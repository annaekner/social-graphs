Any idea what this is?
In the last few days I‚Äôve seen small amounts of yellow liquid dripping on the ground from bottom of my car.. didn‚Äôt know what it was but after looking under the hood, it seemed to be dripping from the coolant reservoir. I thought it may just be leaking coolant, so I kept an eye on it and added some here and there when it was low. Today while I was sitting in the car, I started hearing weird noises so I turned it off and popped open the hood to see this. I took off the coolant cap because there was obvious bubbling in the reservoir, so I wanted to relieve some pressure. After doing so, the liquid started overflowing out of the reservoir. Just to mention, we‚Äôve had this car less than a month and this is the second thing wrong with it. First the alternator and now this. I‚Äôm obviously going to have to take it to a shop but I‚Äôm curious what this could be.

Blown head gasket. Looks like you found the reason the car was for sale. that's what it looks like when engine oil mixes with coolant
Good news& bad news: that'll be the last thing wrong with it
This is bad and probably a blown head gasket, because that‚Äôs the dreaded Oil Milkshake.
Your milkshake brings the mechanic to your yard, and he's like, "this has gone too far, you need a new engine and I've got to charge"
Now THAT is a clear cut case of a failed head gasket. All the DIYers and armchair mechanics around here are rejoicing, as today is their Christmas and New Years all rolled in to one. Today they can finally reply with "head gasket brah" and be right for a change
you've been cheesed by the cheeseman. be wary.
I hope you bought it from sort of used car lot and not Private party..
Is this Hyundai? If yes try replacing cooler asy, sometimes that's the main coz of this coffee.

Edit: I saw its Sorento, try to see if it has cooler asy near oil filter along engine coolant assy, if its v6 (which I suspect 99%) 

Replace that and clean ü´ß water circulation and remove thermostat, will solve problem. Hopefully.

Most people open heads of Hyundai/KIA due to this and main culprit is coolant assy
Why is no one mentioning how dangerous it is to open the  reservoir cap when the engine is hot or to "relieve some pressure"? 


I've literally seen a guy take half the skin off his arm from where the water exploded over him.


It's a pressurised system. Be very fucking careful with it and don't open when it's hot. You're actually lucky that the pressure may have decreased with the blown head gasket.


Look up some videos on why you don't open them hot.
I think it's banana flavor?
head gasket delete
That's the "Milkshake" that brings the boys to the yard.
Coolant mixed with motor oil to make that color combo. Your head gasket is blown.
Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon?
Not good, is what that is.
Don't drive it.  Worst case scenario is you have a blown head gasket.  That can be fixed but it won't be cheap.... However, if you continue to drive it you increase the probability of the head cracking which makes the repair even more expensive.  If you are lucky, you have either oil or transmission fluid that goes into the radiator for cooling and it is possible that a leak in that has caused this... Not likely... but not knowing which car you have here I can't say it is possible.  But if you were lucky then driving it could make a simple radiator repair into a destroyed engine or transmission... You will only make things more expensive by driving it any at all.
**Can we all just take a moment of silence for OP?**
CORN MEAL.....
YOUR HEAD GASKET IS TOAST
Fucked is the word for it
It's not good.
This is why I do not buy from private sellers anymore. I know next to nothing about vehicles to be able to examine one prior to sale and was scammed as a 19 year old college student out of $3k with a lemon of a car years back and had a terrible experience with that.
French Vanilla with two sugars
I don't know what engine you have there but it is either a head gasket or a failed lower intake gasket if yours has coolant passages in the lower intake like a GM 3.4 or something.
Got an Tostitos ? Easy way to figure it out
That's is definitely the worst news you're gonna get this week.
I had a similar issue. Thought it was the hard gasket but it would up being the oil cooler.. internally it had cracked and only oil was contaminating my coolant, I had zero coolant in my oil. Yours might well be a head gasket, but might be worth checking if your car has an oil cooler that also has coolant running through it
Could be a ruptured oil cooler. People always run to head gasket and completely forget how a radiator can fuck your world up too.
If your engine oil dipstick is clear and looks like regular engine oil, count your lucky stars, it‚Äôs your oil cooler gaskets that‚Äôs failed. I had this happen to my car a couple years ago. The oil cooler has a line for both the oil and coolant that run next to each other. The gasket that separates them fails. The coolant lines are under a vacuum and suck oil into the coolant lines making it look like the head gasket has failed. Do not drive it and get it towed to a shop. They will replace the oil cooler, but will have to flush out your coolant system. It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs a lot cheaper than a blown head gasket. Again, IF it‚Äôs the oil cooler that failed.
That‚Äôs deadly stuff for your engine.

It basically dead, coolant/water has mixed up with oil and you have the Forbidden Shake.

Water and oil is kept in separate places in your engine, water is not supposed to go into oil places and reverse, now picture how much of both has mixed inside your engine to make that shake.

‚ÄúEasy‚Äù fix? New engine, plain and simple, cheaper than rebuilding that engine.
Rebuilding that engine is possible? maybe, but it‚Äôs going to be a money pit.

Easier fix, probably scrap it and find other car.
Oil and coolant not good
water+engine oil=caramel cream  
(All I know is from Internet videos)
He got cool in the lube and lube in the cool‚Ä¶ it went from a 4 cylinder to a 2 cylinder
That's Bisquick
Hopefully a bad oil cooler.
New engine time.
Someone sold you a lemon. Not an easy fix.
Death mostly- I am sure the right answer is here
A bad bad day my friend.
Could be a bad trans cooler, mostly likely head gasket.
The devils milkshake
I just had that problem a few months ago. I had to replace the Oil Cooler, the Radiator, and made sure I cleaned all the oil from the inside with a degreaser. I would suggest to check if the oil motor oil didn‚Äôt mix with the coolant first before doing that and make sure the transmission works. But yeah the Oil cooler and the radiator replaced, and degreaser to remove all the oil out but I had to repeat the degreasing process a couple of times. Wish you good luck
Pull the engine oil dipstick, does it look similar to the coolant? is it overfull? Drain the engine oil into a clean pan and tell us what you see. Look at that transmission dipstick too as it has a cooler in the radiator tank as well.
Forbidden honey mustard.
That's the cheese fountain for the pretzel or corn dog.
Check the oil for the same result. If pil has no water in it, Could be a bad oil cooler, getting oil into the coolant. This Is of course a much better scenario and I have seen it multiple times having been confused for a bad head gasket
That motor mount looks loose too, seems skech
1) Half of it is coolant / water, and the other half is oil. Probably engine oil, but possibly transmission oil. 

2) They shouldn't mix. 

3) You CANNOT drive it. Yes, the car might overheat because it has no functional coolant. But it ALSO has no functional oil! This shit isn't lubricant. You would have a MUCH bigger problem after you spin a bearing or weld a piston to the block. 

4) While it looks like a blown headgasket, there's 3-4 oil / coolant interfaces such as oil cooler, oil filter housing gasket, in-radiator automatic transmission cooler etc. A modern car is more likely to fail at these weak points.
Blown head gasket mixing coolant and oil.
Head gasket. Oil pressure is higher than cooling system pressure. This is the result when the 2 systems meet.
Forbidden chocolate milkshake.
Your milkshake brings all the mechanics to your car...
You should pull out the dipstick and if it's anything other than Amber or dark colored oil, you have a problem. 
My guess is you do have a big problem with the head gasket and you don't know how long this has been going on and if there's water in the oil that destroys the oil and having contaminated oil will in fact destroy the engine very quickly. 
The warranty I have my doubts about what it will actually cover. You better read the fine print three times before you go in there. They're absolutely not going to want to cover this. It could be something basic like an oil cooler or something like that but I'm sure this was something somebody covered up to sell it.
Usually, with the blown head gasket, you get chocolate milk, honey mustard is a new one
Could be and crack in the cooler built into the rad. Tow it to a shop and get them to see. $180 diag is better than selling it for nothing xuz you assume head gasket.
Oil mixed with coolant
Blown head gasket
Pardon me but Is that Grey Poupon ?
The forbidden mud. Either the head gasket or the oil cooler.
Anyone tell what make of vehicle this is?
That is engine oil in your coolant
Check the oil level by pulling the dipstick and see what your oil looks like.
Please keep us updated I‚Äôll leave a bad review if you have any issues and I want to hear if it‚Äôs the oil cooler or head gasket.
rip
Water and oil mixed your motors cooked
![gif](giphy|wcSiwjzmtVDbO|downsized)
Forbidden milkshake, get a block test performed, very likely blown head gasket, but small chance could be minor like oil cooler... get a block test to verify if combustion gasses are getting into the cooling system or not. Then diagnose further.
Chile con queso
That KIA/Hyundai is a milk shake machine.
This is the first example that I have seen the coolant reservoir with the mix, I have only ever witnessed it when pulling a dipstick or draining the oil. Learned something new.

I thought the pressure of the hot water was greater than the oil pressure and the viscosity made the water go in through any cracks
Of the head.
Yep. It's what you call "The Forbidden Milk Shake".

It is NEVER a small deal.
Check if the car has an oil cooler. I had an expedition with exact same issue, turns out the oil cooler gave out and allowed oil to mix with coolant. $25 fix. Just something to check out.
Expensive and I'd say more like a cracked head or block. Or a dummy at a quick lube put oil in there instead of its real home.
I just want to point out that the coolant reservoir on most modern cars is under pressure and opening it when the car is hot is dangerous.  Could have gotten nailed with scalding hot coolant.  Old cars from the 80's and older the reservoir wasn't under pressure and it was only dangerous to remove the radiator cap when hot.
Your car made the most expensive Mayonnaise in the world.
Oil cooler or radiator head gasket would be in the oil not the reservoir
That's a problem is what it is..
The head gasket(s) has left the building.
New car time ! Well a new engine always :(
Fucked is what it is
Either a blown head jasket or someone mixed the wrong antifreeze and you caught it early.
The nacho cheese dispenser overheated.
Forbidden milkshake
I'm here just wondering what flavor of stop leak they used before selling it to him.
Oil in the radiator water, head gasket blown
Fucked. That's what it is.
Either a cracked water/oil cooler, a cracked cylinder head or a blown head gasket. 

Don't run it/drive it like that, you will simply completely destroy the engine (if it's not already)
That is one of a few things. 
Headgasket failure, transmission cooler failure, or engine oil cooler failure. I have seen all 3 happen. 
I have seen all three. Check engine oil and transmission fluid condition and levels.
a blown head gasket at best
It's a bad time, oil is mixed with the coolant, probably the head gasket, could be a bad intercooler, diagnosis needed.
Trans oil cooler could be damaged and be mixing trans fluid with coolant from the radiator.
Don't EVER take the cap off of your coolant over flow when it's hot to "relieve pressure".  People like you are the reason the Porta potties at my job site have big "non potable water. Do not drink" signs inside them.
Pull the engine oil dipstick and see if the oil looks whats coming out of the coolant reservoir. If it does then you got a bad head gasket. If the oil looks normal it maybe a oil cooler but im leaning toward a head gasket.
Most likely transmission cooler in the rad
Engine or trans fluid! Most likely cause is oil or trans cooler in radiator
Engine oil and compression in your coolant.  Probably more than a head gasket
This happened to my truck once, and it was the last thing I suspected. The transmission cooler burst inside the radiator and pumped all the tranny fluid into the coolant system lol
I know what‚Äôs wrong widdit.
Means oil is getting into the coolant loop (and vice versa) because of a failed head gasket. If you change the oil you'll get something milky coming out. It's another mix of oil and coolant. In other words shits fucked.
The head gasket gone!
The milkshake of death.
Hopefully not private sale, so you can use the lemon law!! Bring that thing back!
Scrap yard
Latex paint?
Year? Make? Model? (1st rule of this subreddit)anyways looks like a blown head gasket
Milk shake of head gasket death.
Head gasket? Check your oil and see if it's the same. You might have coolant and oil mixing together due to a worn out head gasket.
Possibly a bad oil cooler , is the milk shake also mixed in with the oil or just in the reservoir?
forbidden mustard
My condolences. It's the only time chocolate milk isn't welcome. Oil and coolant are mixing somewhere. Probably head gasket.
Average Hyundai/Kia head gasket expirience
That is called the forbidden milkshake.
Check the oil cap on the engine first, if it has the same yellow mustard it's your head gasket if its black someone accidentally filled the reservoir with engine oil
the other container has ketchup
Your car is effed. Headgasket is blown and coolant and oil are mixing together.
Blown head gasket
This is absolutely a blown head gasket 100%.  Should get it fixed as quick as possible you don't want your water mixing with your oil and vice versa.
Explosive diarrhea! Your head gasket just shat it's pants.
Ooh that is a rare occurrence is some cars where you car will produce the best nacho cheese ever
Nacho ElCamino Grande
i‚Äôm so sorry brother
You need to let it cool completely, top off the coolant overflow reservoir with distilled water to max line (if it's low from boiling)
This could be a bad oil cooler leak or a crack in the head gasket.

You need to get a combustion leak tester kit!

Here's a quality affordable option:

Block Tester BT-500 Head Gasket Combustion Leak Test Kit - Made in USA https://a.co/d/08dtOO7r

Never ever just assume it's something based on one visual symptom.

Then you can check oil cooler for leaks if the test fluid doesn't change from blue to yellow in 10 minutes of the engine running. (Turn off engine if it starts overheating which will happen if the radiator doesn't hold pressure well which can be multiple things. One vehicle has oil cooler leaking and has a bad radiator cap that would not hold pressure and these cooling systems need to hold 18-25psi (depending on vehicle) and for every PSI the engine takes an additional 3¬∞f to boil. For example normally water has a boiling point of around 226¬∞F (108¬∞C) at normal pressure. However, pure water in a cooling system at sea level boils at 212¬∞F, but can reach nearly 250¬∞F if the system is under 15 pounds of pressure. And a system at 20-PSI 233¬∞F and at 248¬∞F if at 25-PSI.

It's definitely possible you have a blown head gasket, I suggest you don't drive the vehicle anywhere and do these tests, if it's a blown head gasket, get quotes from local shops for a head gasket replacement. Hopefully it wasn't driven far while overheated because it could have also warped the head and or valve cover which means new engine or worse cracked them.
About 5k
It‚Äôs can be bad or not too bad in my car the oil cooler went bad and mixed coolant with oil.
blown head gasket. The coolant and oil are mixing, creating this milkshake like substance. The reason it is bursting out of the reservoir is because the exhaust gases from the combustion chamber are getting into the coolant and creating pressure that builds up and is released by the coolant reservoir cap. Be ready to pay $3,000.
Looks like another car to me lol
This is why you always take a vehicle to a trusted mechanic to inspect it. 

Head gasket likely toast. Probably the reason the seller got rid of their vehicle.
Thats not good, thats what that is.
Means time to driver over to the new car dealership and get a new csr
Car goop looks like
Forbidden cheese
Forbidden milkshake, engine innards don‚Äôt like coolant for lubrication
if you can't afford a new motor, or can't find a decent junkyard part.. try a Jasper crate, lots of small shops install them and they are pretty affordable
looks like a oil/coolant milkshake to me
>Any idea what this is?

Forbidden peanut butter.   Head gasket is toast, sorry to say.
It's probably cheaper to get a new car. Most likely, you damaged the engine badly, driving it after noticing the leek just rember to get a inspection before you buy a used car
That looks like someone dumped oil unto the cooling system. No way a head gasket leak that bad still runs well enough to get got enough to push it out like that
Blown head gasket. Do not drive it anymore until the shop gets a look at it
Take an Uber to work bro if you can head gaskets need to be replaced.
That's your oil mix with coolant
gonna be major work. you've got water mixing with your oil. and if the water gets in the bearings it can easily cause damage. most people end up swapping the engine because it's cheaper/easier
They said weird noises so I assume rod bearings
Did you check the oil?
Oh f*..
Mixing two different types of antifreeze
Water oil mix bud
He might have a shot at lemon law?
Blown head gasket. Chocolate milkshake of death.
1. do not open coolant reservoirs 'to let the pressure out' the pressure can cause super heated water to blast your skin - do not recommend

2. that is what happens when oil and water mix - head gasket

3. do not drive it, you could cause more damage if you do, and warranty could be void if you do this.
Yah u are Fkd sorry I mean the head gasket is finished or your engine block !!
The dreaded milkshake! Blown head gasket, very expensive to repair.
Head gasket has left the chat
That is definitely a blown head gasket! I've seen enough of them in my life to know. I took 2 years of automotive in high school and nearly every man on my dad's side was a mechanic at some level and my boyfriend of 15 years has been a master mechanic for nearly 20 years. If you're lucky, this will be one of the cheaper ones to repair, but they are almost always a HUGE pain in the ass so anywhere you take it will likely make you pay up in labor costs. I've personally only ever owned 2 cars that blew a head gasket and it was actually more cost effective to junk the cars and get different ones ü§≠. Hopefully that's not the case for you! I wish you luck and I'm sorry you have to deal with it!

That is a lawsuit. Or a learning experience. Because hoo boy are you about to spend a couple thousand or more.

If it was more foamy and bubbly, I'd say it was over heating/ bad radiator cap not holding pressure, which I was dealing with earlier this year. That looks slick.
Please dont open a coolant reservoir/radiator cap while the cars hot, because the car would be the least of your worries if you get sprayed by it
Forbidden yoohoo from a blown head gasket
That's a blown head gasket. It may be fixable but it's typically a more costly repair
What does the dipstick look like. Is the oil clean or milky. If milky don‚Äôt drive.
So listen we got bad news for ya? You got suckered.
That is called a problem.

She‚Äôs probably gonna need a head gasket, dude. That‚Äôs a signature sign of oil mixing with coolant. If it has an oil cooler there‚Äôs a chance that failed, but I‚Äôd put my money on a head gasket. If you know someone with a head gasket tester, I‚Äôd ask if you could try it out to be sure.
Ahhh, the forbidden milkshake. I see a head gasket in your immediate future.
Head gasket. Rip
Looks like your oil found it's way to the coolant reservoir
Don't take coolant caps off to "relieve pressure." It's a bad idea...

This can also happen if you mix, say green and orange coolant, it turns into a brown muck. A coolant flush would remedy that, if that is the case.

That's a severely blown head gasket or a cracked block or head. Even if it's the head gasket, that head is warped bad. It's done.
Forbidden milkshake always means headgasket unfortunately. Unless you've dumped oil into your coolant.
Yeah, this is toast.

Oil getting into the coolant and making milk shakes blown head gasket or cracked head
Curious what the year, make & model is?
Bro, this sucks. It really does. Head gasket at a mechanic is going to be probably around 2K. 

7 or 8 years ago I bought a used outback. I was pretty poor at the time. Shortly after I got it the exact same thing happened. I'm sure the guy knew it had a blown head gasket and had put stop leak. 

I couldn't afford a mechanic to repair it nor could I afford a different car. 

I bought all the parts online cost me about $900 including machining the heads and I did it myself. 

It's a big job but if you have any mechanical ability you can do it. There's some great YouTube walkthroughs online. 

I didn't have a huge amount of mechanical experience. I had worked at a couple oil change places. 

Just an option if you need it.
One or two things:

Blown head gasket - check oil filler cap for similar milkshake sludge, if not there then not head gasket. Oil and coolant mix in both directions

Oil cooler gasket fail - no sludge under oil cap, just in coolant. Due to pressure differences at the cooler, oil can get into coolant but no much coolant will get into the oil if any
I‚Äôd be shocked if you got a warranty to pay out on this. Good luck!
that my friend is a blown engine :D
Head gasket is blown
It‚Äôs a reservoir. I have no idea what‚Äôs coming out from it.
They have lemon laws in most states to protect you within the first 30 days of a used car purchase.
Who said oil and water don‚Äôt mix?
Oh and the dealership doesn't get a dime from the finance company if you never make your first payment. Don't make your first payment until they satisfy you. After you make that first payment they could give a shit about you.
Definitely blown gasket
Oil cooler seal üëçüèª
Looks like a blown head gasket, of course. But what does the inside of the oil cap and the oil level look like? 

If you're lucky it's something else. But looks like 95% bhg. If so, you might be lucky if the engine hasn't gotten too hot to warp. But in the 4 or 5 times I've had this over the years, only once did I get away with just a new gasket. And that was a thick cork gasket on an old ford escort. These days, this often means a fair bit of work to repair. As in, debatable if you should just get another cheap car or try to repair.

Sorry man. I'm a car man, and this is the moment we all dread. But it happens to all of us. Some days you get fucked.
That is "expensive".
Ah the old mayonnaise. Your head gaskets gone
OP your username is oddly appropriate
Mango milkshake
Absolutely obliterated head gasket is what that is. Oil mixes with the coolant due to the passages not being separated anyone and that‚Äôs the concoction you get ü´† pray the repair bill ain‚Äôt too crazy or hope you can find something cheaper cuz that repair is very involved
99% blown head gasket
hmm.  I guess oil and water do mix
Diarrhoea coolant = Head gasket leak.

Don‚Äôt run the engine since it can cause accelerated wear on the engine and may even cause it to seize up.
It could be a corroded engine or transmission oil to coolant  cooler. Or head gasket. Either way don‚Äôt drive it, tow it to a repair shop.

The lemon law can save him?
So, you probably have your answer to am everything but i noticed no one saying thay. For fuck sake do not unscrew the fucking coolant reservoir ESPECIALLY if it is bubbling.
It's called an emulsion (oil + water) - not normal
I bought a 2010 dodge caravan 14 months ago for $8000. So far I have sunk $8300 into it. New front struts, new ignition switch, new transmission lines, reseal transmission side cover, replace oil pan, replace power steering lines, new spark plugs and coil pack. 
And I bought it certified from a used car dealer. Sucks doesn't it??
Don't take this to a shop unless the people you bought it from are covering it. It's possible that there is no damage if you didn't have the car on a lot/didn't drive after this catastrophic failure, but you'd be better off getting a new engine/car to be certain.
Oil and coolant, busted engine.. yeppyyyy
I'm going to say blown head gasket
New head gasket or new engine bud‚Ä¶ get to do a head gasket on my 351c here at some point this year

That is a bad time, that's what that is. Looks like you got a bad head gasket if a crack allows oil to mix with your coolant. Looks like a Hyundai or Kia, and if so, you might as well get an engine.
Coctail ( oil & water )
Oil entering the coolant system, looks like engine compression as well. Needs a rebuild.
organic peanut butter
RIP
Blown head gasket, cracked hed/block.
Pressurized oil crossing over to the coolant passage(s).
That's the forbidden milk
bad.
That‚Äôs not where you put the mustard Jerry.
Appears to be a blown head gasket But the cooling system would have to be drained and flushed to make sure
I remember the good old days when you could replace the head gasket in your driveway and be off driving the next day.  Now when an engine overheats it cracks and you need to replace the engine.
OP before the mechanic gets the lube out, go on line and buy a head gasket sealant one you can put into the radiator or coolant reservoir and it might solve your issue search for ones with good reviews and etc.
Mmm....choccy milk.

You, my friend, have some expensive repairs ahead of you. That's the coolant reservoir. It's all chunky and thick like that because oil is mixing with your coolant. It probably looks like that inside your engine as well.

Likely a blown or malfunctioning head gasket. Radiator, engine, and coolant and oil lines will need to be taken out, thoroughly drained, cleaned, and inspected for any additional damage that having non-functional oil will cause. Hopefully the head won't need to be resurfaced to fix the seal, because at that point, you might be better off getting a new car.
Rip your engine
That looks like oil inside of your coolant. Do you have a blown head gasket? Is that your coolant overflow container? If so, you should quit driving your car and get it replaced before you cause damage that‚Äôs permanent.
That car literally shat itself
You blew your head
Ah, happy to help, that would be called $5800
Oil + coolant frappe!
Very bad shit =  oil and coolant don't mix "like 2 dix and no chic" :)
What make and model of car is this?
probably a few thousand at least
It‚Äôs a Kia with a blown head gasket
That's a blown head gasket right there. You oil and coolant are mixing together. Load of white smoke out the exhaust as well I'm guessing.
Sorry for your loss.
If it's bubbling out it's 100% head gasket.
Combustion gasses and oil/ water are being forced into the water passages then into the coolant reservoir.
Expensive.

Coolant is leaking into and mixing with your oil, and vice versa.  You probably have a bad head gasket.
You got sold a lemon, sorry bruh
Nice milkshake. That is oil and coolant. Might need to know the make and model of your new drink. But New engine and radiator for you. Stat!
Did you buy it from a dealer or a person? If dealer, you may have a warranty whether they told you about it or not. MA has lemon laws that protect buyers from this very thing for 30/60/90 days based on the car's mileage.
I wouldn‚Äôt put the cap back on
![gif](giphy|prGwyBLmDzeJa)
Looks like honey mustard
I‚Äôd recognize that milkshake anywhere
Could be a failed oil cooler depending on if the vehicle has a coolant/oil cooler.
[removed]
im also concerned with how ignorant they are of cars that they risked literally 3rd degree burns by just opening a boiling water container thats under pressure.
Could just be a bad oil cooler‚Ä¶
If you're buying a used car and have a mechanic inspect it beforehand, will he find these issues? Or can issues sometimes go past the mechanic and you end up with a bad deal?
My old car has a blown head gasket but the weird thing is that that *doesn't* happen. It does throw coolant out though but the oil looks completely normal.
Could also be a radiator with a transmission oil cooler built in. I had an internal seal break in one and it did this. 

If it was hard to put in gear, it could definitely be that.
So for everyone saying this car is done-for...does replacing the head gasket not fix it?  Help us plebs understand.
Had that happen to an old Jeep Wrangler. I sold it to a guy who towed into his FIL‚Äôs shop where tore it down and replaced that gasket. Gtg. Of course, I couldn‚Äôt have afforded to have it replaced. I have no idea how much that would have cost, only that I could have never afforded it then or now.
Im.confused. isn't that the window washer reservoir? I agree that the liquid totally is from a blown head gasket, I was just confused about the location.
I know that engine bay. If its a v6 then the head bolts have stripped out of the block. Will need new engine.
Hyundai?  More like Hyun-dead.
That's not a blown head gasket,  that's a faulty oil cooler.  Oil is in the coolant,  not coolant in the oil.

I don‚Äôt understand. If a car is worth more than $1000, you need to pay $100 to have a mechanic look at it before purchasing. This is a major mistake you will not recover from except for its weight in scrap metal. Sorry, mate. Sometimes the truth hurts.
Yes, this is the end
Can't you just replace the head gasket?
100% blown head gasket.  if you're super lucky, it was a manufacturing defect.  If you're not, you have an engine problem that is ripping itself apart. like a shaft seal
Oh okay, thanks!  The shop is closed until Monday but I have work over the weekend and honestly can‚Äôt afford to miss work. Can it be driven in small amounts? I‚Äôm assuming it shouldn‚Äôt be but I‚Äôm also not at home right now, so I would at least need to get it home. This is so annoying because I‚Äôve had this car exactly 3 weeks and I got it from a used dealership, so I would‚Äôve thought it would be more reliable. I have a warranty on it at least
I wonder if it brought all the boys to the yard?
That's an odd way to store house paint.
Forbidden milkshake, Caramel flavour by the looks.
üé∂the milkshake brings all the cars to the yardüé∂
Looks more like nacho cheese in the video.
On some cars it can be a water oil heat exchanger that corroded and is mixing oil/water. However most times it is a blown head gasket or crack
So if I put this all over some hot dogs that would be bad?
So I go to check the oil in my last car and notice the start of the milkshake. Bottom of the dipstick (eighth of inch) was that color but rest was fine. Mechanic told me not to worry and it‚Äôs fine. A day later I‚Äôm having oil pressure problems. I got rid of the car and the mechanic told me I was dumb to get rid of it and it was a cheap fix. 170k miles. 11 years old. Do I need a new mechanic?
Not to mention every rubber part in the cooling system will either swell or pop and leak in the future. Best solution if the car is worth it get a new engine then sell the car to a dealer, at least the next owner will get a warranty.

This guy Hyundais - check this out OP, especially if it turns out your warranty is useless (and they often are due to exclusions).
Don‚Äôt some Hyundai and Kia v6 have warranty extensions for this?
Scrolled so far to see this. I was stupid enough to do this once and burned my hand real bad.

It‚Äôs a 2012 Kia Sorento SX. Sorry, I didn‚Äôt see in the rules that I was supposed to add that to my post! I‚Äôm going to have it towed to a shop that the warranty company set me up with
Seriously. I cringed so hard when I saw this. üò≤
There's a chance it's a bad oil cooler slim but I've seen a few cars roll into the shop with the forbidden milkshake that just needed an oil cooler, oil change, and thorough cooling system flush. 

Head gaskets with a head rebuild is often cheaper than a replacement engine IME granted the vast majority of head gasket jobs I've done where VWs
The amount coming out of there is how quickly you are losing oil from your engine by the way‚Ä¶ it won‚Äôt last long.
Ooops, I missed that rule! It‚Äôs a 2012 Kia Sorento SX
Seems to be just the reservoir
Agreed more likely a oil cooler then headgasket with that volume of milkshake

It‚Äôs always the head gasket. I‚Äôve hoped for it to be an oil cooler or something similar several times over the years and always been the head gaskets.
Or if you really want to go the disaster route, cracked block
Oh please god no! Enough time has passed, I thought I had forgotten about the BW
Lol your posting privileges should be revoked for that.
Settle down. That's the overflow tank, not the radiator
Listen to my boy buttdust93! I'm not seeing combustion gasses. Probably failed oil cooler. Depending on the make/model. Not time to panic yet. But yeah don't drive it till you sort it out
A decent one can find this issue. Opening the cap on the radiator or using a canister made to see gas pressure bubbles coming back up through the coolant system is one way.
Anyone's capable of checking the fluids for cross contamination. Just checking the dipstick for dirty oil would have shown that problem üôÑ
Yeah, but the fact that he did not know that this was very obviously a head gasket blown tells me that OP did not do that
can you afford a tow and a new engine?
Have it towed to the dealer and walk to work. Its basically do that or drive to work and have to buy a new motor most likely.
I would not drive it, because if this just happened a head gasket is one thing. But, if driven you will also ruin other parts of the motor, including the bottom end. I would tow it to a garage and contact the warranty company.
Do not drive that. 

And good luck with the warranty. 99/100 they're not gonna cover it. You're gonna fight and fight and they're not gonna pay.

You got scammed. 

Lemme guess. Buy here/Pay here? As in, it was specifically a used car place? Not a dealership? And they offered financing and warranties?

Edit: honestly, I feel really bad for you, because these places are predators for people that are just excited to finally have transportation, and they get taken advantage of. 

These people are scum. And you're just the next victim. My advice is, concentrate on cancelling the warranty. It'll save you a few grand. The rest, you're gonna owe. 

Only advice on that, since I know it's a high APR, is make triple payments.
No, you cannot drive this.
No this is really bad. If you drive this all weekend you'll be towing it to the scrap yard on Monday. Warranty doesn't cover intentional destruction. Warranty expects you to tow the car to a shop as soon as you're aware of a problem.
absolutely do not drive
Can you take an Uber to and from work for a couple days? Might be a better idea
DO NOT DRIVE in this condition!!! This is a coolant resivoir where the foam is coming out of. this is not Normal and indicates something is very wrong, oil is getting into the coolant and this is NOT supposed to happen at all. your engine isn‚Äôt broken, just a component(most likely a head gasket). If you drive it any more chances are YOUR ENGINE WILL FAIL CATASTROPHICALLY. 

Get it towed to the garage so as to not do any more damage. 
Good luck!
It should be a 30 day warranty on it or 60 I think in some states. Don‚Äôt let them talk you out of it. Take all the paperwork. Make copies of the paperwork. Good luck!
That's a lot of milkshake.  Almost certain it had a blown head gasket before they sold it to you.  If you want any chance of saving the engine, you need to have it towed.  However, since you bought it used recently who knows how much the previous owner overheated the engine, that engine might already be beyond a new head gasket and need a complete replacement.  If your drive home has any sort of stop and go traffic it will overheat.  Even stopping at a stop light might be too much before the temperature goes up.  If you're are just cruising without stopping much and it overheats then its definitely pretty bad.  You can turn on your heater to try to cool it down a little, but that will only slightly help
Could be your oil cooler, not a big job if it is
PLEASE CONSIDER THIS - you might want to read the terms of your warranty. It may disqualify you if you've continued driving it, or drove it at all past the point you realized something was wrong.

I would be very familiar with the warranty and have your story straight before making the warranty claim. Doesn't matter whether your story is true or false, so long as they make you whole again. I've been there, and it's a shame this is the state of used car sales but they will screw you any way they can, so long as they make a buck.
IM sorry to say this has been an issue for a while and you are now the proud owner of a fuckin lemon and you bought someone elses problem. This is not a small problem friend.
You need to take that back to the dealership and show them that this is what it is doing they did not do an inspection on this vehicle so they should not have been selling it I would be mad as hell and if they refuse to take the car back well you can report them for selling faulty vehicles. Anytime you get a car from a used car dealership you need to take it to have it inspected by a mechanic it‚Äôs not that expensive to have it inspected and it will save you money in the long run.
No don't drive it! You will warp the heads, if they aren't warped already.
If you want to keep the car from breaking completely, it should not be driven at all. It'll need a tow to a garage for some hefty repairs. It'll be 100x worse if you drive it.

As for the dealership, sounds like they sold you a lemon. Call them up and either get your money back or have them replace the car.
I really hope OP sees this comment. I worry that they don‚Äôt seem to know much about cars and will get taken advantage of by somebody who thinks they can rebuild this.
One leaves you with oil in the water, the other with water in the oil; just don't tell them which.
One time worked at a shop, new guy hired, years of experience. Just a simple hitch receiver install, pulls it into his bay, lays down and gets to work. Everyone notices. Manager walks over and inquires what he's up to, just installing the part. Manager: "do you think those two blue posts you parked between are shade trees?" Pissed the guy off real bad, they argued, guy got fired.
You got it. "Armchair" can be put before any profession or skill to describe people making comments on stuff without doing it.  
Armchair detectives from Reddit "solved" the Boston Marathon bombing.
Do not tell them you saw any dripping yellow liquid before today.

Tell them only "it was making a weird sound so I went to see and saw this dripping. I decided to have it towed straight here to the shop".

That's it. Make sure you don't have coolant bottle in the trunk or anything. 

Give them as little as possible they can use to try and deny the warranty.
Don't drive it then as they may void the warranty if you knowingly drive while issues. Find a lift or a rental. Your warranty or insurance may cover rental.
Have those fuckers make this right
Please post as many bad reviews as physically possible. There's no way that that was anything less than maybe negligence. They played whoever they were gonna sell that to. DM me and I'll put a bad review in their Google location ... Hopefully no one else has to go through this but I fear more than you have already been swindled .. sorry about your luck :/
Lord I hope you didn‚Äôt finance it with some lousy subprime bank with scammy warranties.
What happened with the alternator?  Did they fix that?  Is it a 3rd party warranty?  Does it seem like a legit warranty company?
Or in this case, warm nacho cheese
You may be lucky, some sorentos do have an automatic transmission cooling line that goes into the radiator.  So it may not be as bad as a blown head gasket.

If it turns out to be transmission fluid in the coolant, ask them if they flushed the transmission after they repaired it.  If they didn't then have the transmission flushed after you get it back,if coolant remains in your transmission you will be asking for problems down the road.... of course if it is a head gasket then nothing to worry about on the transmission.

I had a similar thing happen way back with an old car and the coolant looked very much like what you have... I've also seen several blown head gaskets and never saw as much oil in the coolant as you have.  I would think a leak in the radiator is the most likely cause.
Same. I thought this was posted in the r/funny subreddit...
Hyundai engine, more than likely it‚Äôs done for. I‚Äôm guessing the 2.4?
That is a good sign .. definitely don‚Äôt drive it until you get it checked.

On my Jeep, it was the timing chain cover. Has water passages to the water pump and leaked coolant into the pan
Usually the other way round for me. I see milk I think head but always check the cooler.
That shit will come out that overflow same temp as
The radiator and if it get
you my friend you just been got. Watch out now üòÇ
No I know for a fact this happens when head gaskets go. 

I had a 99 explorer and you would hear bupbbing from coolant tank apparently the water pump was failing internally and didn't know I told them it needed a lot of work when I sold it they put a water pump on and it blew the head gasket 

So yes they can once the combustion gasses pass through the gasket and Into the coolant tank yes it will become a geyser
Unless the seller changed out fluids immediately beforehand. It's surprising what some shit people will do to screw over a buyer.
Is that why automakers are removing the dipstick from newer engines?
If he has been driving it like that, probably already needs a new engine.
it already needs a motor, get to work and figure something out in the meantime
A long block is a long block, any way you put it. No fucking way I would toss heads at this with that level of lubrication and cooling. Top end, bottom end, all fuckin ends is what this needs.
Only thing to do now is start your own used car dealership and sell the car to somebody else. Its the circle of life
Yeah, dude, my first two jobs were at buy here-Pay here lots working in collections. Do not buy a car from those places. Our mechanics were sketchy as hell, our sales team was sketchy. Everyone was sketchy. Good experience for first time worker, because everything was uphill from there lol
Dumb question but what's the difference between a used car place and a dealership?
Thanks! I ended up not driving it. Just going to have it towed to the shop
On the warranty paperwork, it says it‚Äôs valid for 6 months or 7,500 miles whichever comes first. They did cover the alternator replacement, so hopefully they‚Äôll cover this. Seems like the head gasket (if that‚Äôs the issue like most of the replies are saying it is) should be covered as well.
Thanks, I‚Äôm going to get it towed to a shop that the warranty set me up with. Prior to this though, the car had been driving completely fine and not overheating at all. It‚Äôs just very weird. I‚Äôm trying to get the full service report from the place I bought it from. I don‚Äôt know much about cars but I feel like they should‚Äôve known that this could/would be an issue down the line.
In all my years I have never seen an automotive water to engine oil cooler. I‚Äôm sure they exist but I just have never encountered one.  

Oil to air coolers sure, trans oil to coolant sure. But never engine oil to coolant.
This is excellent advice op. Also get all communication between u, the shops and warranty company in emails. Because everyone involved is going to try to a kid paying for this shit show. Had a similar experience where I bought a car and the oil cooler was fucked from the start and I sent it back to be repaired and it came back even worse. Was a real fight to get my refund from the finance company. Good luck.
[deleted]
It'll be a hell of a cleanup job to convince the dealer that oily coolant wasn't spewing all over the place like in the vid
We had to fight a warranty claim on a ram 2500 cause of this. Guy bought the truck from us, then as he almost finished his 400 mile drive home he developed a heavy miss. 6.4 did its thing and ate a lifter. Told the adjuster he drove it the next day just for a quick errand. They tried kicking the claim saying it was neglect and that he caused it. Fortunately we got it opened back up and I get to drop an LKQ unit in it next week‚Ä¶yay. I hate warranty companies.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying! This warranty BETTER cover it!!
NO.  do not review bomb.  they will see it and know what its about and that can cause them to be difficult with repairs/warranty people. 

wait until you know you are getting your car repaired or getting your money back, and have it repaired/refunded before you review bomb, in case you shoot yourself in the foot.
Me too. Keep us posted if you have any issues and happy to review bomb a place that sells known issues.
Funny thing is this isn‚Äôt the usual killer of Kia engines.
Forbidden milkshake
It always looks to me a lot more like prepared tahini - which it is similar to, being an emulsion of oil and water/coolant.

Will Ferrell and Adam McKay parted ways, production-wise, from what I read few years ago.

Kinda sad. Some of their movies made me laugh that deep down laugh I really needed in tough times.

Sometimes they do it just right the first time. Plus one of the sons unlived himself and it just would be the same without the boys.
A uniquely Chrysler issue lol.  When I was trying to diagnose a coolant issue on my Charger that was apparently a very common problem with those, the Magnum, and the 300‚Äôs too.
Isn't the overflow vented?
I drove a Ford ranger for 2 years on a bad head gasket. Changed it myself and still drive it to this day.
Agree, it‚Äôs toasted.
Why do you think it needs a long block?

Oil in the coolant does not necessarily mean coolant in the oil. The bearings could be fine. Generally oil pressure is higher than cooling system pressure.
A dealership sells new cars, delivered from the factory. Most dealerships also have a used lot attached. The one OP bought from is one of those ones you see with big green prices painted on all the cars.
[deleted]
this problem is way past a headgasket. depending how much you drove with this the engine might be completeley ruined inside.

getting all that sludge out is going to require the engine to be taken apart and cleaned
This is why buying used cars is hell. Much of the time you‚Äôre just buying someone else‚Äôs problems. The dealer who sold it to you may know about the issue, they may not. They don‚Äôt do the kind of detailed inspection you might think they do. They buy them from auction, spray some armor all on the tires, and put them up for sale, hoping they last through the 90 day warranty or whatever you have.
What kind of dealership did you buy it from? If you're taking it to an independent shop I'm going to guess a smaller used lot. In which case, there inspection process on taking it in would be suspect. Probably some kid who has the mechanical skills of a jiffy lube tech if there was even an inspection at all. It pays to take any pre-owned car to a reputable shop you trust to catch this stuff. Even if someone tried to hide this by swapping out the coolant literally right before you took it to get inspected there would have been signs this was going to happen soon.
If you can‚Äôt get it fixed under warranty and the dealer says ‚Äúnot our problem‚Äù contact the local news station. As stupid as it sounds, it can work. If not then move onto a lawyer or just pay for a new engine.
The average car owner is like you and doesn't even know what a catastrophic engine failure caused by extreme negligence looks like.

You should never buy a used car that doesn't have a binder full of maintenance paperwork.

Make sure to read the exclusions.
Do not let them bully you. They will try because used car lots are like that. Wormy, shady, and often immoral. If they do, tell them confidently that you have a family member that's a lawyer. Even if you don't, depending on the cost it'll be worth it to get one if they don't back down.
Like I said in the post I commented linking to sites, I AGREE 100%! DO NOT SHOOT OP'S FOOT OFF. 

I left a bad review and didn't mention about OP. But did point out that people are experiencing issues with this company and buying a car would be regretful. 

If someone buys a car that's brakes give out from this dealership and dies from that, or kills someone else? I want to know I did as much as possible to help avoid that. Without shooting OP's foot off. Lol.

Yeah, 5.2 Liter. Sad thing, I changed out the head gaskets before I found the real problem.
I did a saturn ions head gasket off of YouTube videos. I have a good head on my shoulders for mechanic work but not too much experience. I'd say it was honestly pretty easy. Took my time and tracked every bolt. I drove it for another two years before getting a good job and a new car when it hit 200k miles.
Very few anythings in the history of human manufacturing can take abuse like a ferd fuckin ranger.
So what your saying is they should drive it? /s
Some techs and shops won't take the liability of having to warranty the work. Depending on how expensive the new/used motor the cost difference can be so close between the two jobs why wouldn't you spend the extra 10-20% and get a known good engine rather than taking a chance and there be unseen wear that causes issues.
Shit I just sold my car to a proper dealership for 9k the moment the check engine light went off. It had been stalling, chugging real hard going up hill, rattling in the engine. I'd had issues with it for like 2 years and no one could ever figure out what was wrong with it. I came back in for an oil change on my new car and I heard a customer complaining about their used car with all the same issues as mine did and how the dealership couldn't figure out what was wrong. I'm half convinced they bought my old car.
I know so many people that buy a used car and when it starts having a bunch of problems trade it in. The dealers sell it not knowing that the previous owners performed 2 oil changes in 40k miles
Doesn‚Äôt cover milkshakes???

So I bought a used 2017 f150ecoboost back in 2018, I don‚Äôt drive it much so it only has 85,000km. I noticed a cold rattle on startup and did some research and figured I had the notorious cam phaser problem so I took it to the dealer to get fixed. The bulletin to fix this issue was taken down in January 2023, so I have to pay out of pocket.

I was willing to bite the bullet on it but now they say they fixed another problem for me that had to be fixed(didn‚Äôt tell me what) and I owe another $1300 on top of the original estimate for the job.

Are they allowed to do this? I live in Canada, BC for reference.

Update 1:

So I popped into the dealership after work went to the reception desk and asked to speak to the manager.  The service manager and general manager both had the day off but the sales manager came up to the desk as we were talking and asked to help‚Ä¶so far so good.

I explain my issue and show him the text I received from the service department and he went into shock, literally, he had no words.  He disappeared for about 10 minutes and returned saying he figured it all out and was able to cut the $1300 down to $603. I said no .

He then led me to the parts manager(I think) who was a total dick and he said ‚Äúif we‚Äôre halfway through a job and we see more problems that need to be fixed we fix em without thinking twice, would you rather take the vehicle away half fixed and potentially cause more damage to it?‚Äù To which I replied ‚ÄúI would rather have you contact me before you do extra work on my vehicle that I didn‚Äôt authorize as I‚Äôm the kind of guy who would have gotten a second opinion before I shell out $1300 for im not sure what‚Ä¶‚Äù

No one was able to tell me what the $1300 dollar charge was for‚Ä¶no joke.

I left my truck there and didn‚Äôt pay anything, I have a meeting with the service manager Monday at 8am
Nope not required to pay the part you never agreed to
Who agreed to the additional charges?
Do you still have the original estimate?
Call Corporate and light a fire... it usually always helps... Say you may never buy a Ford again due to this.. Be nice and word yourself well, and it works..
Where i live if you get an estimate the shop can only charge 10% more without getting permission, check for similar laws where you live. Live in MB btw.
Thanks for all the help guys, very informative. 

I‚Äôm gonna fight them on it, I‚Äôll update later
You just got $1300 in free repairs! If they push back it‚Äôs literally illegal to charge you for what you didnt authorize.
Not only did they not tell you what it was and not only did they not wait for you to respond, but they continued without approval??? No that's so bull id absolutely raise hell for
I was a service advisor. You NEED authorization before you proceed with anything. This is exactly why.
I know there are a lot of posts already and I didn't want to piggyback on a half of my opinion on this only to leave something out. These situations happen A LOT. In fact, even doing a simple brake job and turn south really fast and require an additional charge easily doubling the total (looking at you calipers... or hub... or brake lines... or bleeders... see where we are going with this?). That's why the tech/ service writer duo should always approach a repair in stages and inform the customer in phases appropriate to the repair. Any type of internal rattle/ tapping noise should have your:
1) initial diag charge and/or tear down estimate(s)
Then
2) repair cost estimate(s)
Then 
3) do the repair.
At each 'then', there should be a pause as well as a caution communicated to the customer for possible outcomes that could result in further costs as well as what to expect if you as the customer decline further work. Like, if I pull this all apart, I might not be able to put it back together or it wouldn't make sense to put it back together. 
All in all, this situation should not have happened. It was poor communication on the shop's behalf. If you didn't approve the cost of the additional repairs, you should not be the one paying for it. Just keep in mind, if you fight the way out of paying the additional amount, do not plan on bringing your vehicle back to that shop again for a very long time.
Yea they‚Äôd lose that case real fast with that text
Update 2(final update)

So I went to the dealership this morning and they had it all sorted for me when I walked in.

Here‚Äôs what I think happened(they admitted nothing):

When I took my truck in for the original diag I also said I had something going on with my electrical(turn up the volume on my steering wheel and it would switch the song, among other things)they included a ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù that I replace the display console I said no thanks they said it was just a recommendation and not part of the estimate‚Ä¶

On the original estimate there is a $917 charge for ‚ÄúFCIM REPLACEMENT AND REPROGRAMMING‚Äù

On the final service order this is not included, they billed me out at $5,326

Still high as the original estimate for the phasers would have come out to $4,100 after recalculating the taxes without the display console but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than $7k

I paid up and took my truck home.

Thanks again to everyone for all the advice with this problem.

Edit: also I don‚Äôt know how to add the updates to the original post so could you bump this for those that wanted to see.  Thanks again guys
Literally not legal‚Ä¶ ever. Shady as hell practice, there‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt avoid had to emergency order‚Äù that‚Äôs not a thing. I would recommend never going back to this shop and also not paying for what you didn‚Äôt agree to, they can‚Äôt force you and you‚Äôre not obligated to pay
See this happened at my old job we took one of our box trucks into a mechanic and asked to only replace a pump and a few other parts, they ended up going wild and replaced about 10k worth of parts on the truck when it was only supposed to come out to like 2k, my boss called complained and we got 8k worth of parts for free cuz we didn‚Äôt agree to get more fixed. We left with a completely fixed box truck and somebody lost their job that day üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Go through ford customer relations, since they are licensed through ford, but you also can speak with the manager directly, you should only be paying what was originally agreed to. Anything done up and above without your agreement is them paying for it. Stand your ground
I‚Äôm a mechanic near you OP. This is a big no-no!
I work for a Ford dealer. Wtf raise hell
Ask them to show you where you agreed to the work. "Show me where I signed to give my permission to do the extra work."
At least here in Finland you can add some small work (like 50‚Ç¨) to the price estimate without asking the customer. If it's an agreed price, no adding without permission. But jesus 1.3k without asking, that's most likely illegal or at least very bad
Is this Titanium Ford?
Grandma got a 2017 explorer sport, as soon as I heard that rattle I told her to trade that MF in lmao
Pick up ur car pay what u agreed to, raise hell and at worst have lawyer ready. It sounds like Canada has crazy consumer protection I don‚Äôt see how you would ever have to pay
You can post on r/legaladvicecanada

Id take it up with corporate if you are not getting any cooperation at the dealership level. If they didn't obtain your consent to replacing extra parts, that's not your problem. 

They probably broke something and is not fesssing up. Then making it seem like it's a you problem

I also do service work in a different field. I keep the customer updated throughout. If they don't want to pay. I stop work. I don't put parts they don't agree to.
Wow fuck that
Unless you told them ‚Äúyes go ahead and do the extra work‚Äù they cannot change you for it and you can take your truck. If they try to pull ‚ÄúWell it had to be fixed‚Äù just thank them for the free work and be on your mary way.
You didn't authorize it, you have a case
Lots of interesting advise in here. So he‚Äôs how it works, or at least should work. I diagnose a problem, then inform the parts department/service advisor so they can build an estimate and inform the customer. In the case that something else arises, even if we pre-order parts, we have to have prior approval to continue. Even if the parts have been ordered, they should be installed until we have the customers approval. Before we ‚Äúcontact corporate‚Äù, start screaming, or demand that extra parts/labor be free because it wasn‚Äôt on the original estimate, let‚Äôs get on the phone or better yet, visit the dealer. We can show you what else we found, show you the failure, and why it needs to be replaced. There are usually things we can do to at least help out in these situations. We can reduce labor rates within reason, reduce or remove any mark up there may be on parts, or even possibly get some financial assistance from FoMoCo.
Nope. If you didn't authorize the work then they can't do that. It sounds like they may have messed something up by accident and just charged you, can't be certain if that though. Sounds Hella shady. I would just tell them you never authorized the extra work and won't be paying  above the estimate. Record phone calls or do interactions through text/email. This might become CRT territory if they become difficult
Nope it is not as far as im aware and i can't think of place where that is legal. They have any issues giving the keys back for the original agreed upon price call the police non-emergency line
You need to consult someone that knows the law in your state.  Laws vary on this.  Some places require you to be contacted and agree to any changes in the original estimate, others may vary 5% before they have to get authorization... It all depends.

But if this was a recall they don't always expire and normally no longer apply based on the date of original purchase and the miles on the vehicle.  I would check on that as well, some dealerships will try to charge for stuff that is covered and if the customer pays they will still turn it in to the manufacturer and just collect more money for nothing.
What kind of dealer just throws in a $1300 part and doesn't advise the customer till after it's ordered fuckin via text?
Chance that they F'd something up, and are making you pay for it?
Go in, and as you're getting ready to pay, and they pull out your paper and slide the keys on the counter, take the keys and refuse to pay for that BS. Tell them you won't pay a dime over the parts and labor agreed at drop off. I'd also get the service desk manager's name and report them to Ford corporate if they are a licensed dealer.
10% is the standard additional charge allowed without consulting the customer first.  The only way to just order an additional 1300 in parts without first contacting the customer would be if the original estimate was 13k. 

 If they are a professional shop, they should be well aware of what is commonly  needed for a repair of particular symptoms, or they should know there's too many variables which make a full disassembly and inspection required before making an estimate.
No, they cannot perform work with out asking you to do so.
Yes and no. I‚Äôm a red seal mechanic and have worked in a shop all my life. This question was actually on my red seal exam. How much can a repair estimate legally go over without customer authorization. The answer is 10%. So legally they are above the 10% based on the figures you provided. I am in Canada as well
This is why you don't buy a Ford F-150 EcoBoost or a Ford in general
Following this.. It sounds like they broke a camshaft or something similar. That would explain the attempt to burry it, if it was their fault. It's very easy to do if you're not cautious when dissassembling, i've heard. Regardless, no way should this be put on you, seeing as you were never even told *what* broke.. For all we know, it could just be a "because fuck you" charge so they get a bigger check in their pocket...

Good luck, OP
Depending on laws in your state, for example in california you need to contact the customer by phone, email, or text. Then advise about changes to original estimate and get approval,¬† then have to document approval. Like a text, or email phone call. Any work not authorized by customer is going to be the shops loss. I know in california if stuff like this happens you can contact the BAR (Bureau of Automotive Repair) they can step in and set things right. But and this is a big but they have to have a license to be repairing vehicles. Dealers have that license small shops might not.¬†
Definitely not legal if you didn't sign for it or give verbal authorization over the phone which most shops will record for proof. I always make a point to say call me before doing any work that wasn't already approved. I also ask for all old parts taken off of vehicle. I hope everything works out for you.
For 1300 dollars you deserve a full explanation... and a phone call
Nope, they're not. They've done job that you didn't sign off on. That's on them.
If it‚Äôs anything like shade tree mechanics, they‚Äôre hoping you won‚Äôt pay be able to pay for it and they‚Äôll try to keep your vehicle
You have to approve additional work, they just did all this for the original bid. Fight it in court. You have the proof. You might have to call the cops to get your keys.
Yes, based on consumer protection rights. This is what small claims court is for. You have the right to an estimate and based solely on the texts and explanation you provided, you did not give consent for additional work. Without written or verbal consent they can't charge you 10% or more than the estimate you agreed to. Unfortunately you will likely have to pay the shop in full if you want your car back before you go to court. Although, the best option might be to try negotiating with the shop for a more equitable compromise.
They told you 1300 more and you didn‚Äôt respond for 3 days. Then only said ouch. You should‚Äôve said no ***that*** day. A clear no.
I saw a documentary about this in cananda they uo sell u at car shops search it on YouTube
Aside from it being legal or not, it's just unethical. I'm an advisor for a Ford shop in FL and my background has put my morals before the money. Vehicle repairs get expensive and not a lot of people can afford these repairs, I understand the "it's gotta be done" mentality to get the car back on the road but ultimately that's the customers decision, not the tech nor the advisor.
You might as well buy a new car geez
Fuck no it‚Äôs not legal
99% sure they are only allowed to work on agreed things, and not do things without asking you first.

That some costs gets added (a few 100 extra because of extra work is still borderline fine to me, because stuff can happen)

But added costs of newly added or replaced parts without asking you, and then telling you that the car is ready, and you need to pay like 7K for it? Yeah no
No! It is not legal!
If they did all the work already you can legally pick up the car and only pay for what you authorized and the rest is on them for doing it without permission
As a service write they can be liable for unauthorized spending. You could argue it
Man I run a mobile service and I‚Äôm always at the customers location working in front of them and if something additional is wrong or needs replacing I call them out to see what‚Äôs wrong and let them know before I jump and just replace stuff. That‚Äôs absolutely crazy and you should not have to pay for that tbh.
Just commenting to save this for future updates from OP. Interested in how this turns out.
From everything I know in the USA, the guy informed you that they needed $1300 extra, after taking the valve cover off. Which alone is weird imo, if I suspected a car had major issues when the customer brought it in for a Quote I would take the valve cover off. It's like 6 bolts and you can look at the valve train and you don't need to do anything else to remove it. So easy to check, idk what problem other than bend valves you could have had that wasn't visible till the valve cover was removed. 

Anyway, if Canada is the same, you can only be charged for the ORIGINAL QUOTED job. Even if the garage has put on "extra parts" or done more work. You aren't required to pay it, and it's there fault for not getting a Confirmation, not a status text with you saying "Ok, yes I accept+$1300 of parts and labor." Since that didn't occur, you can pay them the original quote and fuck off, and if they complain about the "extra parts" teach them the valuable lesson that until confirmation of an extra +1k of work that in the future they get written confirmation to the "new" quote before doing free work for you. 

Also if you see this can you say exactly what the shop said was wrong with it for a bill of 7k+ especially what would warrant +$1300 AFTER the valve cover was only off. 

Thanks, and don't pay for the work you don't owe!
Must be an agreement at least in Florida that if any repairs will exceed the original agreed upon repair order amount by $10 or more the customer must be notified and give the repairer shop authorization to perform the repairs exceeding the original amount . If there's no signed work order legally they have no legitimate argument to collect that extra money unless you were notified and agreed usually by signing a new repair order
Long story short, yes it‚Äôs illegal. They had to contact you and consult you about the work and cost of the job.
It‚Äôs crazy to me that it‚Äôs just kind of ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù that mechanics will try to rip you off and scam you, and it‚Äôs on the customer to use little tricks to keep them from doing that. Imagine if that was anything else. Like what if every time you go into Walmart you just know that the items are designed to ring up twice or the employees will be trying to pickpocket you the whole time and you just have to jump around and avoid them. It‚Äôs crazy.
Was this in WA?
Wrong post/reply I'm sorry fir your loss,I lost my dad 3 years ago and things haven't been good since. I hope your doing o.k with things. Again, my apologies.
Yes, you can't see everything unless you completely take the engine apart, in this instance it could be a bad cam that wasn't visible until additional parts and or covers were removed.  You can ask for the old parts back before paying the bill to verify that they have been replaced.
Sounds like they broke something during repair and are making you pay to fix their mistake.
Why did you take 48 hours to reply to the msg they originally sent
Almost two decades in the automotive service industry, I can tell you what very like the scenario is , and believe it or not they‚Äôre trying to look out for you. Most likely disassembled everything for the cam phaser repair (timing cover/timing components, Valve covers etc.) and per the repair procedure from ford there is a list of a few parts to inspect and replace if needed, as well as any good technician is going to inspect valvetrain and all other related and exposed parts at that point. Hard to believe but by looking everything over while it‚Äôs apart and replacing those parts will save you money by not having to pay all that labor again to get to those components at a later date. By all means the service advisor absolutely should have explained what parts and discussed it with you but I will say this, any good technician, is replacing those parts no matter what because when that vehicle leaves the shop it‚Äôs got his name on it and if he takes pride in his work he wants it done right and not back in 2-3 months
If you don‚Äôt get warranty don‚Äôt take it to dealer that simple
If they do work they will just put a mechanic lien if you refuse to pay, you then have 10 calander days to pay in full or the property becaimes theirs along with its contents.... Oh and storage is $300 per day.

That's how I ended up with a $3,900 Header install on a SBF..  they broke all the bolts then called to tell me it was gonna be $2,700 more. Gave me the option to pay for the original quote and tow the truck out. I refused. they choose to complete work, then lien on it.
Sounds like they broke something while doing the job and claimed they couldnt "see it needed something else".
Don't pay. The only things you pay for are what you sign on the contract so If you signed and they try and charge more for things not on the original work order you don't have to pay at all
I'd just pay it, I had my 2019 done a few months ago and it needed two new cams new cam gears, timing chain etc was covered
Its legal yes but they should have waited on your okay. Do you really want them to put it back with bad chains? Maybe in a couple months have to do chains for almost same money? Should have it quoted from beginning or at least waited for your okay.
I‚Äôd be trying to take it somewhere else. Mechanics are, for the most part, scammers. They‚Äôll laugh the entire time too
.
.
Yes, there is always potential for more issues to be ‚Äúuncovered‚Äù once they remove the valve cover. You bought a used truck and you didn‚Äôt know what potential issues the previous owner may have dumped on you. Please don‚Äôt blame your mechanic. From the tone of their text, sounds like they‚Äôre trying to take care of you.
Your dad pays for his immature whiny sons car repairs and you in return call him a coward? Pretty sure where the problem is here.
Two ways to look at this....u can be mad they cost u more than expected.... or maybe they really did find some bs that needed done. Legal, prolly not.... but find out what is what before getting mad
No quote no pay I always say. Unless you tell them to fix whatever needs fixing which is hella sketch unless it‚Äôs a trusted shop.
7k dollars rofl. Hope
You got an extra key to go steal
Your car back
Seeing as they chose not to tell you what it was, and when you asked they just said it‚Äôs good to go with a $7000 bill, I‚Äôd say they didn‚Äôt even do anything to or in regard to the extra fix and just put it back together. I‚Äôd tell them if they want you to pay, pull the valve cover off so you can look at the part they replaced. You should be able to tell if it‚Äôs brand new. 

They should‚Äôve called you and discussed not texted. I would‚Äôve also requested pics of the issue, part and part number so you can look up the cost of it as well as the typical labour time for whatever it was. If they say that you confirmed over the phone, pull the phone recording that they have since they all ‚Äú record the phone call for customer service purposes‚Äù. 

This is why I don‚Äôt deal with stealerships.
Looked up the cost. 

Timing chains are $60 usd each at rock auto assuming you have the 3.5L ecoboost. 


The whole timing chain kit, minus the sprockets is $310. 

At those prices, you‚Äôre telling me they charged you another $1000 in labor when they were already in there?

Tell them to get absolutely fucked and call a lawyer. do not pay and do not touch the truck until you speak to legal counsel.
Depends on what you signed when dropping the vehicle off. A lot of places will have you sign something stating they can replace anything within the scope of work without authorisation from the customer.
Not sure about Canada but in the USA you have to sign a paper stating if you want a written verbal or no estimate update if the new price is more then $50 or 5% of the original, this seems like a verbal but at the same time you didn‚Äôt approve or decline so it‚Äôs a little up in the air on if it was legal or not
they call them stealerships for a reason

I had similar happen years ago, but at a way lower price($500 to $1500) and I just accepted it and moved on
That is very illegal they cannot just make you pay for more repairs without calling you and getting a prior authorization for any other additional expenses I would highly recommend you never go back there and I would definitely take that up with their manager.
My mechanic did this to me every time and I have the same truck. At first I didn‚Äôt believe him but okayed it the next few times I asked to see it and he made me look like a jerk off by showing me my whole rear went.
Don't see from the post what they are referencing.
They should get ok before proceeding.
ABSOLUTELY NOT LEGAL TO DO THAT! They need your authorization to do it...also, if they have a work order for the original assessment and quote to u...then thats ALL they can do...no matter what. So if they did anything more, without your OK, IN WRITING...then this is a nice and expensive GIFT to u. Also...NEVER TAKE ANY DEALERSHIP AT THEIR WORD FOR ANY MECHANICAL WORK...always go to a local mechanics shop and get a senond opinion, ALWAYS! 
ALL DEALERSHIPS ARE LYING BASTARDS...NEVER TRUST A WORD THESE SHYSTERS TELL U! Talk to a lawyer ASAP...and if u have paid that already...then sue these assholes for it all back! That work order is a CONTRACT...only whats in the four corners of that page is what they can do...unless modified ON PAPER WITH YOUR SIGNATURE.
that‚Äôs illegal as fuck.
One key thing you've said is that the shop gave you an "estimate". An estimate is essential a guesstimate. It's based on an educated guess on the cost of the job based on the information at hand. Estimates can change if more problems are found. If that shop had given you a quote, then the price would be legally binding. A quote and an estimate are not the same thing in a legal sense. I do agree you should have been informed better on what additional work was needed. I would try and negotiate the price, but it is very possible that the additional work was required to perform the repair correctly. If you told the shop at any point to do what is needed to fix the vehicle, you are liable for the costs. If you specifically told them to only do what was estimated and nothing else, then the shop is liable. Without more information on how everything went prior to the messages we can see, it's hard to say exactly where you stand in this situation.
When you pick it up refuse to pay the added $1300 and tell them you never agreed to the work. If they won‚Äôt then proceed to call the police for vehicle theft
Nope they need your authorization before they can order more parts and install even if it‚Äôs for your best interest
I run a shop in BC and I would never ever do this to a customer.  The job would simply be put on hold until the authorization by the customer was made.
If you didn‚Äôt get a quote and didn‚Äôt sign the quote or another document regarding the go ahead to perform the repair then no. You do not have to pay any labour, parts or shipping etc with the undisclosed repair as you did not approve the go ahead. They will and should eat all of that cost.
If the work wasn‚Äôt authorized then it‚Äôs not legal. If the work was authorized but the cost was significantly higher than quoted, it‚Äôs also not legal.  ‚ÄúSignificantly higher‚Äù is determined by a judge in a court hearing. Basically you‚Äôd have to sue them. And until then, they‚Äôd have possession of your vehicle and may take a lien on it and sell it. Once the case is settled they‚Äôd have to undo anything they did that the judge ruled against. The judge could also order them to do nothing until the case was over if you ask the judge to.
This sounds like is got metro ford written all over it!
The moment you ok a quote unless it finding out that something quoted doesn't need to be done any changes made to the quote need your ok before it can be completed what they did unless you sent them an ok after they notified you about the new issue is not legal they performed and charged you for work you did not give the ok for
I‚Äôd tell them they can eat that money or you‚Äôre taking them to court over this. Unless they get authorization from the customer to do the work they are only supposed to do what the customer wants done unless they want to eat what ever money was sunk into fixing that issue.
Every state that I have worked in allows a shop to exceed an estimate by 10% without additional approval. 

An experienced tech will often write an estimate as "worst case" knowing there may be additional parts needed once they open things up. If they do this, and those parts are needed, they are covered. If not, the customer gets a nice surprise because they came in *under* the estimate.

I've had customers complain that my estimate is "too high" compared to the shop down the street. That's fine. I know it is highly unlikely that I will exceed my estimate. I am also much more concerned about the job being done correctly (the first time) than I am about being the cheapest. I don't make money on comebacks. I make money on satisfied, return customers.
I‚Äôd skip mechanic advice at this point and find a consumer rights lawyer, this is some sketchy shit.
In the states estimates can legally change price a bit cause it‚Äôs an estimate but I think the max 100bucks or a certain percentage . 1300 on a 6k job is a lot.
I‚Äôll put this question to bed rather quickly and easily, at least it pertains where I live. 

Source: My attorney generals website.

You have the right to receive a written or oral estimate for any repair that is expected to cost more than $50, and shops must notify you of this right.  Make sure to request a written estimate.
The shop generally may not charge you a price that‚Äôs more than the estimate, unless it contacts you with a higher estimate and you approve the additional cost.
The repair shop may not charge you for any repairs that are unnecessary or that you did not authorize.
The repair shop must disclose in advance if it charges for dis-assembly, reassembly, partially completed work, or any other work not directly related to repair or service.
If the repair shop works with an outside repair or service supplier, the shop must provide, if you request one, an itemized receipt from the supplier.
The repair shop may not use aftermarket crash parts without first disclosing it in the written estimate.

OP, I suggest you call your states attorney generals office.
Dude, fuck what most of these people are saying. You live in BC. The rules here are, legally, anything over 10% of an estimate, before tax, MUST receive authorization from the customer. Go there, tell them this was your estimate, this is what you'll pay. 

Be prepared to play, so figure out what that 10% difference is, add it to the total, and that is the absolute max you will pay, no questions, before filing with the RCMP for attempted theft and coersion. Where in BC are you, and what shop was it? This is my hood. Feel free to PM me.
1300 for their pockets.
Not legal (tech who works in a dealership, and have also worked independent)
Yea they definitely need your permission before doing anything. My place calls me and explains everything and gives me an estimate before doing any repairs.
They didn't get your approval to do additional work. No this is not legal, or they did free additional repairs. I would absolutely be sticking to the original approved amount and demanding old parts to see what was actually repaired. They are required to return to you all parts removed or repaired upon request. If they say that it was thrown away, no proof, no fix. It can also be considered theft. If they don't do something to appease you, get a lawyer.
Should have contacted you. If you didn't agree got you to sign a waiver stating that the further issue has been explained and if the part of them fails and wrecks the engine, they won't be liable.
It looks like all the work that was done without your consent was free! I‚Äôm not sure of the legality where you are but I have never seen a dealer order and repair something BEFORE telling you the quote. The quote may end up being more than the original of course, but to find it needs another large repair entirely they don‚Äôt just go ahead and do it. I have had a car in the shop getting work and they called me and told me they found something else, how much it would cost to fix, and what the problem and parts needed would be. I told them not to do it and just do the original work we agreed on so they did.
A whole new engine would be cheaper then that
Whenever I‚Äôve used a shop I always tell them to call me before they do the work if it goes over X dollars or they find something extra.  One time a place didn‚Äôt call me and did the work.  We decided to split the difference.  I paid a little extra and they ate some of the cost.
They‚Äôre fucking you. A full phaser and chain replacement at a local shop in the USA is just under $4000
I wouldn't pay it if it wasn't talked about before the work was done. You clearly weren't communicated with before hand. $7000 is creeping up on the cost of a remanufactured engine for that truck I would imagine....I could be wrong though. seems like they're trying to screw you over.
Highly illegal here in the states as they did extra work without approval from you, the customer, and failed to tell you exactly what extra was wrong. All added costs in parts and labor would not be the responsibility of the customer as it was not approved. Also, in the states, that job should only cost $2-$4,000 dollars, and the high side is doing at dealership... you're getting seriously scamed out of money. I just got my phasers, chains, thermostat and water pump all changed on my 2018 f150 3.5 eco for $2,300 with a 1 year warranty since I bought all new oem parts including next gen 3.5 eco phasers.
That's some landrover like prices....does the cab come off the frame as part of the labor or something extraordinary?
Well it appears you just got a fresh rebuild for the original quote of 1300. Tell them this is there fuck up and let them figure it out.
If they didn't get your advance approval then you don't owe them a penny
Either you approve of these parts and labor or you don't own anything. 
If you declined with the valve covers off after hearing more faulty parts you would just pay labor and not parts.
Valve covers labor is like 1 hour each side so you could have said never mind give the truck back and paid like 200 at the end for 1 hour of labor. 
Sounds like they're just replacing it all without your approval.
To me this has to be a full timing job from looking at the price but without approval? Who has 7000 lying around.
No that‚Äôs like getting a quote from a plumber for a leaking line and they fix it and demand money without consultation
You have the advice you need here. Just wanted to confirm the as a shop owner I always get pre-auth before purchasing parts for a customer, unless it's a full build and they've given me an overall budget to work within. 

It's perfectly reasonable to expect they'd find something they couldn't see, but they should have shown you what they found, given you options and costs, (including doing) and the impact of each decision.
Damn this guy got finessed
My moms minicooper quit running and had all symptoms of a failed high pressure fuel pump. I told them ‚Äúhey can you diagnose, but it sounds like the high pressure fuel pump that‚Äôs a recall‚Äù. They ended up doing a FUCKING HEADGASKET, and in doing so they shorted out the thermostat and the radio, and damaged the battery so they replaced all those too and charged her

She‚Äôs super non-confrontational, so me, her, and our former mechanic family friend (now works in a suit in the big city)  meet the service manager. I‚Äôm giving him all kinds of hell, back and forth and he goes ‚Äúhang on hang on, sir who are you?‚Äù And motions to our friend. He goes ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about who I am‚Äù we go back to arguing and our friend, stands up and goes ‚ÄúLook, bottom line you didn‚Äôt have authorization to do any of this work, so we both know you‚Äôre not getting paid for it, that‚Äôs it‚Äù the service manager stuttered and mumbled ‚Äúbut that doesn‚Äôt cover the dead battery‚Äù and my mom said ‚Äúsend me the bill‚Äù which never came. 

Long story short, no authorization, no pay.
Not 100% sure about Canada but in Australia one of the mechanics tried to do the same thing to me except with no message at all. Get there and they tell me they installed a couple other things that didn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù to be done but they thought they would anyway and tried to charge me for it. Long story short I drove out of there only paying when I told them to do and got the rest for free üòÇ safe to say I‚Äôve never been back to them though
Yeah. They left you on read, never telling you what the issue was. You already know they are not legite.
There‚Äôs been an emergency we had to replace your entire vehicle, see how crazy that sounds. Naw man that‚Äôs free parts and labor.
Some shops been screwing  around like this lately, it's not legal but just try fighting it.
I want to know what they found.
Just an FYI a service bulletin is not the same as a recall. It doesn't mean it gets fixed for free at any point. It's just a kind of announcement sent out when the same issue keeps occurring with a car.
I have known my mechanic since I was a child and trust him completely. I also work overnight so pretty often I'll drop the car off early in the morning and then go home to sleep. I once told him "If you find something else and it's less than say $500 go ahead and fix it" and he told me to cover his own ass he would not do that. Even if I sent that statement in a text message every time so that he had proof. As a compromise he will call me three times in a row (so my phone rings even when it's on DND) if he finds something else vs texting me which I would sleep through. Any ethical mechanic would have known they could not do additional work without getting confirmation from you to proceed.
Fart
My shop boss would kill me, basically unless you signed off or have a definitive answer then shop shouldn‚Äôt have gone ahead and done work and or replaced part, it‚Äôs standard to notify customer of an issue and give them price for parts and labor etc. if customer declined to do the fix then it‚Äôs the shops ethical obligation to leave it and inform customer of risks . I wouldn‚Äôt be paying the additional 1300$
Ok my gf recently bought an ecoboost Lincoln MKS 2013 where in bc are you so we can avoid this dealership
The way i read it the guy hasnt actually said hes going to do the work. Hes ordered the parts in anticipation of you agreeing to have it done. If you say no, im sure he will finish the job as quoted but you will still have issues and the original bill to pay. I do this for customers sometimes, as theres no other option. Maybe 1/10 say no, and collect the car with the same problem and a bill
Looks like where the dotted line is where the guy pasting it from his notes is supposed to add what he replaced‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
We always get the okay from our customers, we never just do the work, that's not good business.
Is this a real mechanic or some dude who is a mechanic on the side/out of his garage.  If the former, no Bueno.  If the latter, that's the risk you take.
They should have got approval for that much.
Generally speaking, the shop should not perform any work not authorized by you. Did you sign a work order specifying what was to be done before they started work? If you didn't, they can claim you made a verbal agreement, then it would be up to you to disprove their claim.

As a rule, I always get a work order that specified exactly what I expect the shop to do, and I always add a statement to the effect, "No other work will be performed without prior owner notification and consent."
They can't do that and will have to bite the cost you need a definitive yes to start doing work . Not just do as I please and make people pay. Tell them the original price is what ypur paying and 6 grand for a cam phase delete.  Or just fixing it is over priced done that exact job numerous times . So that shop ripped you right off
Imo it's illegal they tried this bullshit over text and didn't call you so they could explain and get approval
I see where the parts are ordered. Don‚Äôt see anywhere that says it‚Äôs installed. Maybe pick up the phone and call instead of posting here. Only thing I see wrong with the text is the advisor apologizing to you. He didn‚Äôt buy the piece of shit.
it depends, if u told them something like ‚Äúreplace/fix this one part and don‚Äôt worry about anything else‚Äù it‚Äôs on them, but if u just told them something like ‚Äúfix the rattle in my truck during cold startups‚Äù then yes they can do this
1, don‚Äôt buy a shit box 2, learn about your vehicle
This recently happened to a buddy at work, his repair went from 5000 to 12000, hes livid.
where‚Äôs that remind me bot
That service bulletin is also still active, at least in the states. Just did one a few days ago‚Ä¶ if they are doing this to you, you outta also make sure they got the updates phasers
Interesting
Just deny the extra work until you get a 2nd opinion from a different garage imo
I'm not sure about legality, but I work on a companies equipment. I can promise you this there are many jobs you don't know what you will all need to replace till you get in there. Just keep that in mind. I would think they are required to show you what they found and why it needs to be replaced. Sometimes you can't install new parts properly with others if they are worn or broken. I wouldn't think they can go ahead without asking though. What if you can't afford or you were only willing to put x amount into repairs on the vehicle. Just some thoughts!
It happens, unexpected things come up in lines of work like this, doesn't mean he's trying to take advantage of you.

He had to get your permission for the extra cost and work, just because it was something unexpected that nobody caught at first doesn't mean that he shouldn't get paid for the extra work he has to do now, you do have the right to refuse.

It's unfortunate and both parties usually feel bad about it, but it is what it is, he can't look at it and make it unbroken.
RemindMe!
i once paid $139 for blinker fluid bc i didn't even know where to add blinker fluid. my blinkers were brighter for a few weeks, but don't feel it was worth the $139. i'll never do that again.
When a shop or a dealer gives you an estimate they're supposed to stick with that if the repair is approved. A little bit of fluff is acceptable, like up to $50 or so to cover a forgotten gasket or a few broken bolts or shop supplies, but that should be expected and is the point of giving you an estimate for your approval for a repair. An extra $1300 on the other hand, that's a repair that requires approval. Them not telling you what it was makes me think they broke something and passing the cost on to you rather than internalling it like they should have. Whatever the case, you did not approve the repair, so I would take it up with management. Just because it was required to complete the repair you went in for doesn't mean it doesn't also require approval.
Did they ever tell you the issue?
Recently I took my car to a local mechanic, brought parts, and asked them to install the parts. During this, my mechanic sent me many pictures of the process. Even FaceTimed me to show me oil looking in other areas, and told me that seals need to be replaced due to these oil leaks. He even sent me a face time of him showing me himself that the timing belt was loose af. Naturally, I agreed to this new work, cuz the dude gave me proof. I‚Äôve never had a mechanic do this before, but I love it. I think your mechanic should have at least tried to do something like this if they had found‚Äùadditional problems‚Äù
I‚Äôd pay what was agreed. They didn‚Äôt get permission, therefore that work is free.
They probly broke something and made you pay for it.
It's a dealer so probably bullshit
In the states or at least in my state, anything more than a 10% change in pricing needed approved by the customer.
They probably damaged something during the process and trying to convince you to have it replaced in a hurry so you won't question it.
I would get them down to within 10% of the original estimate. Because most states have 10% leeway legally speaking. At least they caught whatever it is. But that‚Äôs shady they didn‚Äôt contact you first
Oof. I have a 2006 5.4 and I started hearing the cam phaser issue. Looked up FordTechmakuloco‚Äôs videos on YouTube. Ordered all the parts he recommended and some extras. Rebuilt the whole top end pretty much and a new oil pump for like $1300 in parts and specialty tools. Took 4 days of work. Truck runs like a dream. Almost up to 250k miles. I‚Äôm not a mechanic but with the wealth of knowledge on the internet I can pretty much fix anything on my vehicles and learn a ton about them in process. If I were to take it to a shop they would have charged me more than what the truck is worth to fix that stuff.
Well you got a discount, just backwards
Bro you live in a communist country and you‚Äôre asking us if anything the govt does is legal? üòÇü§£ whatever they say is legal is legal. Tough cookies
There would be hell to pay if you think I‚Äôm just going to give you money because you demanded it.
If you didn't sign for it. Don't pay.
Have an issue right now with overheating and can't figure it out, several people have said take it to a mechanic. I would if I knew of one that was decent and honest but every time for the last 10 years this is exactly the kind of "service" I have received. Still not sure what I am going to do.
Yeah. They have to ask permission beforehand or you can refuse to pay for it. 
Shops hate that though because they call. You don‚Äôt answer. They text. You don‚Äôt respond. Now they have a car torn down that they can‚Äôt put back together until you answer your damn phone. 
A lot of time/money gets wasted in a shop when the customer is unresponsive.
You didn‚Äôt even authorize that and they never explained the issue. Before I pay a dime I want full disclosure and an itemized bill. I do t know if that is legal, but it‚Äôs shady IMO. I‚Äôd use a different dealer next time. Also, I had to do the timing chain on my 2011 a couple years ago. Cost me about $5K. üòñ
pennys now for dollars later. words i live by when im fixing anything that i depend my life on
The text is sketchy AF  and you never confirmed for him to keep working.
Here in the US, absolutely not. If a shop found new problems and the customer did not/does not give consent for the shop to address/fix the newly found problems, the only things the shop could do are: A) ignore the newly found problems and continue fixing what they originally got consent to fix, or B) if the newly found problems make the car mechanically too dangerous to drive safely on the roads, they can absolutely withhold it from the customer and/or have the PD pick up the car to impound it as a hazard to the road.

If they do make changes or repairs that were not consented to by the customer, the shop can be sued for a *LOT* of money. No idea about Communida -I mean Canada. 

Best of luck though!
I would never go to that shop again
I would go to the shop and clearly state the additional repair was unauthorized by you and it needs to be removed.  If they refuse, pay by credit card and dispute the extra charge thru the credit card company and explain you were forced to pay in order to receive the car back.  I would also research the laws in your area regarding car repairs.
No additional work should EVER be done without the owners written approval. 

If an issue is found during previously approved work an estimate should be prepared, given to, and explained to the owner. 

If the previously approved work cannot proceed without the additional work being done, all work on the vehicle should cease until the owner approves or declines the revised estimate. 

If the owner declines, they can (and should) be charged for the time,  labor and parts invested, including reassembly back to its unrepaired state with the exception of any new parts that have already been installed. 


HOWEVER, your first mistake (as the owner) was buying a used Ego-Boost...
I've never heard of an automaker putting a time limit on a recall repair notice...
When you take the truck in, it is supposed to be diagnosed, quoted, then repaired with your authorization. Some times there are additional parts you may need to replace that cant be seen without teardown. But in this case, valve cover removal is a poor excuse for missing it. Due to the nature of the issue he would of diagnosed, he would need to remove them anyways. So, that's on them, and them adding parts without authorization is a big no no.
The answer to this question is very much dependent on ‚Äúwhere do you live?‚Äù

At least in the US, in most states there is some kind of law on the books stating something to the effect the customer has to be apprised of, and authorize, work in excess of the original estimate.
Based on the information you‚Äôve provided, I‚Äôd recommend getting a lawyer (specializing in contract and Uniform Commercial Code) to look into this for you.
RemindMe! 2 days
They're skimming personal parts off of your work order.
EcoBoOm
It's very common to have happen.  But they have to get.your authorization for the additional work, and that includes telling you what the actual.work and parts are, along with price.
Object to the unauthorized work.  And see what govt agency oversees this.
Not without the consent, so they should either knock off the 1300 or pay it themselves if they already put the parts in by the time you tell them.
Your first problem is taking it to a dealership for repairs.
Pretty sure the work needs to be approved first prior to the actual job being done. I know that‚Äôs how it is in my state.
I had a jiffy lube kinda place do this. The exchanges my diff fluid. Saw my rotors needed replaced or turned. Took it upon themselves to turn them without asking. I argued until they took it off.
I‚Äôm in Alberta and also have a 2017 f150. I did  all the work myself because ford quoted so high. My quote was around 5k. (Phasers chains water pump all the gaskets and seals) 
Sounds like they broke something and are trying to get you to pay for it since the most I paid for a single part was about $150.
In NY state that is an unauthorized repair and you can file a complaint with the DMV and they will investigate.
Yes. As long as he tells you before the work is completed. People don't seem to realize that machines are the sums of their parts. Nothing greater. 

When one part breaks it tends to break others. You can't tell until you dismantle it.

"Not running" isn't much of a diagnosis to work from.
GET RID OF IT I had a 2013 f150 ecoboost and eveytume I turned around it was broke down. Then they tell me it was one thing and a week later it was 5 more things and it went from 1000 to 7000 like your bill did. Get rid of the truck.
Jeez, yeah. I'd be contacting a lawyer to find out if it's legal. Cause, going from 1300$ to 7000$+ yeah. No. Hell no.
Stand your ground OP.
Not telling you what the part was is sus.
What was the outcome? Can't find update part 2

I'm sorry you're going through this. It makes me angry that so many people deal with the phaser problem when Ford could just fix it by adding a few seconds to the ignition time. Seems like an easy enough fix for a recurring issue, but I guess they like getting the money from the repairs.
At my work we don‚Äôt even add an air filter that we would save from used cars to cars that really needed them for FREE without customers thumbs up, they could say you did something to there car and sue us big time
Not in Florida. You need to give an ok here
Screw them. That ain‚Äôt right. Pretty much all the tech here agree. No added work without authorization is right.  In Texas anyway.
In Colorado mechanics have to get the owners informed consent prior to doing any work on the vehicle.
Short answer, no.

Long answer, nooooooooooooooooo.
RemindMe! 14 hours
Not in the states it‚Äôs not
Sounds like I'm not paying a dime till I see the broken parts
Your mechanic texts?? Not to mention it‚Äôs a sketchy green text ??? Also in 15 years as a mechanic we have never once ordered parts without asking the customer first wtf did they charge you 7.7k in repairs unless your driving an exotic car ?? Are these posts real I wanna know at what point are people okay with paying this crazy repair cost? Future reference use https://www.alldata.com/en type your car and the job it will show you the time we are supposed to charge out in labor as well as the complexity of the job also you can ask for all the old replaced parts then you know they acually replaced em you be shocked how many lube techs I watched get fired for not changing the oil or filter and rotating happend of your lucky kinda sounds like you got taken to the bank :(
Also a new crate engine costs about what you paid for your repair and sad part the entire body of the truck lifts off meaning it cuts the job time in half ‚Ä¶. You got bent over and dodge rammed hahaha
As a long standing Master ASE Certified Technjcian I‚Äôll state my honest opinion-
No engine repair is cut and dry. Nearly all repair facilities have it specifically written on their estimates that the written work is a best case scenario because of this. It is often the case something major can be noted immediately with another issue hiding in the background only noticeable when original repair is in progress. 
Yes, some places are shady just like any other industry- and will find unnecessary ‚Äúrepairs‚Äù needed. But at least in my personal experience this is rarely the case. Contrary to popular belief- nearly all mechanics have a pretty high level of integrity, and are very proud of their ability. It‚Äôs a pretty hard kick to the nether regions when we miss something we‚Äôre tasked with repairing. Nonetheless it happens. It‚Äôs not illegal, although seems a little unprofessional sending a text rather than a phone call to inform you of the situation. But then again- this is the world we live in where sending a short text is more ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù. 
My best advice is to ask what the repair was, why it was necessary, and have a better understanding. Ask the person who worked on it who has years of training and experience, rather than the writer who knows how to use a computer and can‚Äôt turn a wrench to save his life, nor saw first hand what the problem was.
You‚Äôll get the correct answer, and believe it or not- 90% of mechanics/technicians will gladly answer any question you have. What was seen, what was tested, what the components do, how we drew our conclusion, etc. etc.  This is what we do all day, every day. If we‚Äôre any good at it- we LOVE to show off our skill set. It‚Äôs those specific moments where we feel god-like and our value and knowledge are on display. 
Illegal? No. Immoral NOT to inform you? Absolutely. 
But in this case they did. Keep in mind auto repair is much different than a cut and dry purchase of an object due to variables. It‚Äôs sucks something fierce paying for it, but it certainly beats the alternative of taking the Nike Express.
You‚Äôre getting ripped off royally, they can‚Äôt do anything without your permission. and why is your total 7k? even before the $1300 5700 seems a little excessive. I‚Äôve never seen a cam phaser repair go over 4k. maybe 5k but that‚Äôs just insane
My husband just watched a YouTube video and he tore my truck down and replaced the solenoids and put it back together and it runs so awesome now
why do i feel like i always hear these stories from canada. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt happen in america because it does. But I remember there being some type of show in canada where they would go into shops and expose the blatant scamming going on.
Only if you authorize it
I've paid too much for tools to be ripped off by a garage.
When I wrenched for a living, we always ALWAYS had to stop what we were doing and get with the customer on the situation and find out what they would like to do, BEFORE going any further. I think our policy was anything over $50 extra, we had to reevaluate the estimates.
Not sure about in the great white north but in the US anything over 10% of original quote has to be given to vehicle owner and approved in writing. Thats US consumer law. If original quote was 5000 anything over 500 would need written approval
Fucking dealerships dude. Such bullshit.

How did the meeting go this morning?
As an auto technician in California, any shop worth their salt would explain a situation that could get them (and you) stuck. I can understand wanting to do their due diligence in repairs, but this seems too vague to be 100% honest. Either that or this writer is just trash at communicating
Depends on your conversation with them, if you had the " just get it fixed" conversation then I can see why they just went for it. Doing it without such conversation, that's a no no. I've sent many a vehicle out disassembled after finding deeper problems, checking with customer and getting declined. Though you are still on the hook  for the labor it took for them to get to that point. As an ex mechanic I had to take my car into a shop to get it repaired at the shop I left when I changed careers. I had replaced a wheel bearing twice and it failed quickly after (even with warranty) it was a press in bearing so uber costs added up going to machine shop to drop off and back and go do it again. I strictly went to the shop for my typical  oil change (cheaper to pay them than do it at my apartment and easier cleaner and less fuss with my community) and told him if it's less than X$ don't call me get it done, that's the kind of person I am tho, also brought them a pack of Gatorade lol
No, they didn't even ask of you wanted the work done. Sue them for the cost of all the repairs, legal costs, and for wasting your time.
I‚Äôm fairly certain the bulletin for the 2017 ecoboost cold start rattle is a reprogramming of the ECM to pump more oil on a cold start up. This won‚Äôt fixed the problem but the added oil will reduce the wear and extend your protection in the event of a failure. Sounds like they just went right for the replacement which really wasn‚Äôt step 1 of the bulletin.
You can turn down further repair and pay for labor already performed. As a ASE Master Tech employed by a dealership I know this kind of thing happens all the time. Techs are not clairvoyant nor do we have x ray vision.
The reason they ordered your parts is to keep your down time to a minimum if you decide to proceed with repair. If they are reputable they can show you exactly what the original estimate covered and what the additional damage that was not expected is.
This was handled poorly
In the country it‚Äôs not legal for work to be completed without your approval.  As a past service writer who also knows how to turn a wrench not just use them computer.  If I had done something like this my ass would have been out as soon as the service manager found out.  And like someone said here, having the customer come in sometimes and have the tech who is working on their vehicle show  them what exactly is going on is the best way to go. A call or a text doesn‚Äôt make a customer feel better about having to fork out extra cash.  If you have to make them bring in the regional manager for a meeting, that will really make them sing.

RemindMe! 8day
I would contact a lawyer perhaps definitely not legal I would never change out a part unless it was authorized first customers have the 100% right too refuse any work too be done ü´°
Is there an update on this?
This feels like every time I go to the hospital.
Wildly unprofessional shop
Any shop worth their weight in shit would call first. "Hey look we got it apart, this was broken, it will cost this much, what do you want to do?"

&#x200B;

As for legality, I don't know. At least not where you are.
Just hold the gas pedal down for a couple seconds while you start it to get the oil pressure up and no rattle
They should have stopped immediately, gotten you another quote and complete description of new issue and not proceeded until you signed the quote. This varies by state on how they should have proceeded tho. Here in MI if I did that in my shop, a customer could let me fix it all and then decided to not pay the extra $1300 bc they didn't get a quote on the extra work .and guess what? They'd win in court and wouldn't have to pay me for that portion of the work. Should be like that everywhere tho. Need authorization to go above and beyond original quote ( give or take a couple hundred or so if you run into complications like we do in the rust belt) .
In my state, repair facility needs explicit authorization for work beyond the original repair order or coming in above at a price above the original estimate.
Most states they need authorization for parts (minus bench stock) or for additional work.
Wrong post,/reply, my apologies
No, they did the work without authorization. Thus it wasn't allowed. You can refuse to pay for that work. It wasn't what you had an issue with.
Eco boost is garbage. Run from that thing ASAP
Why would anyone that has access to the Internet not go and research a mechanic shop and read reviews on it or that has anyone that they trust and can ask for a trustworthy shop they can take your vehicle to?  This seems like a no brainer and if you don't take the time to do this and then you get mad at the fact that you got ripped off then the only person you got to be mad at is yourself for being too lazy to take 2 minutes out of your day to protect your 2nd most important investment(for most people) by ensuring your getting the best service work you could possibly get and avoid a shop that either isn't listed or has bad reviews, which should be a no brainer in this day n age.  It's your own fault for not having looked into the shop that just got one over on you when you have the tools necessary to have avoided this in the first place.  Also, always read the fine print on anything that has any kind of financial impact on anything personal you have.  I believe Judge Judy would agree, use common sense people.
If you didn‚Äôt authorize it you don‚Äôt pay for it plan and simple. If they wanna fight you on it take them to court and you will win
There is a discretionary range but they have to be able to tell you the problem and I think the range is $500 or 10%. Sounds like they should eat the extra cost though in normal circumstances as you weren't consulted before work unless they informed you beforehand of this possibility. Not sure what a new engine costs for this truck cause 7 grand is not a small bill. to their credit, it sounds like they tried to do a proper job and it was probably the tech going to parts and ordering the new parts and didn't let the service office know beforehand
Legally if you didn't sign foe it you don't owe.   That being said, you can be charged for unforseen misc parts needed in most states up to a certain amount. In the states I uace worked in it was $100 but I know it varies.   Any additional parts or repairs needed over what you originally signed for will need approved by a customer.
This is not illegal however it is not good business practice either. You have a civil suit on your hands my man. By the time you threaten to sue they may already agree to reduce price
Yeah if you are quoted for only a head gasket and they change the whole head without consulting you, that‚Äôs on them. Even if it IS in the customers best interest. Unless you tell them to do whatever they need to do
I second this, they have to give you an estimate and they have to get your consent.   No consent means you don't have to pay.
A dealer did that to me last year stating a brake job cost 2400 but originally quoted me 1400 which still felt high.

They tried telling me they forgot to calculate labor in the original estimate.  Not my problem, we agreed on $1400 which is what I paid.
I took a car in once to get evaluated we only wanted them to diagnose the problem they quoted me $75 for the diagnostic. They called and told me my car was ready for pickup and they had done the repair and placed a faulty water pump. I said hold up I only wanted the diagnostic not the work done I never authorized that. I told them to put the old pump back in and give me the car but they had already dumped the old part or so they said. I told them not my problem and picked up the car only paying the diagnostic fee. They gave me the stink eye the whole time I was there.
Really depends on the pre-work paperwork OP signed. They probably unknowingly authorized it.
Yes, this is what I came to say. Everywhere I‚Äôve worked that did service work (shipyards) we had to get authorization to do extra stuff. Unless the contract had the CFR clause (Condition Found Report), which made it so if we verbally documented the findings (in writing) and pictorially documented it as well, if possible, we could take care of the problem and they‚Äôd still pay.  And everywhere I‚Äôve taken my car, they say they‚Äôll let me know if there‚Äôs anything else they find before they do anything extra. I think, legally they don‚Äôt have to pay the extra if they didn‚Äôt sign anything that says they‚Äôll pay for anything else they find.  That‚Äôs how it works here anyway.
If they can't see a broken part until the engine is stripped then yes the customer needs to approve. The only other option would be to rebuild the car at customers expense with the falts not fixed.   

I'm 20 years in this job
And people wanna question the integrity of these mechanics, then the mechanics get mad when people think they are crooks.

Not all shops are bad but why does it feel like the good ones are few and far between?
In Finland the shop can do other work only if the added parts + labour is 10% or less of the original quote.
Even if it isn‚Äôt the law, that‚Äôs good practice. At the shop I work at we usually ask the customer for a ‚Äúwe will call you‚Äù price if it‚Äôs something older we‚Äôre working on and they give us a list of issues, but with newer non warranty items it‚Äôs just good practice to call and ask before we order any part or do any work that‚Äôs more than $200-300. Customers these days like to reverse credit card charges and file complaints if you sneeze on their stuff without permission, this is just downright unprofessional in my opinion.
If they do work they will just put a mechanic lien if you refuse to pay, you then have 10 days to pay in full or the property becaimes theirs along with its contents.... 

That's how I ended up with a $3,000 Header install on a SBF..  they broke all the bolts then called to tell me it was gonna be $2,700 more. Gave me the option to pay for the original quote and tow the truck out. I refused they come to complete work, then lien on it.
Yes in the states, but this is in Canada. I have no idea if Canada has any consumer protection laws or not.
Yup that‚Äôs what happen to me took my car in to see what needed to get fixed and they ended up fixing it for me without telling me. Anyways the Shop ended up paying for all of it
The bill can change by 10% (in nearly all states  part of the UUC) with out customer approval.

That said if we are talking about internal engine components what are you going to do not put the engine back together?
Hello.

I've read your story and update. I'm a dealership mechanic and can tell you right now you did the right thing by standing up to the parts manager's bullshit claim. He doesn't know what he's talking about, as his department (parts department) operates differently from the service department, even if under the same company/dealership. In summary, The parts department's job is to manage and make profit off of parts they sell. The service department manages the services, maintenance and repairs of vehicles coming in, and profitting off of that. The only time our departments intercept is when we (mechanics) request for parts for our car services, and a couple of other smaller things. So I can tell you right now, never go to the parts manager. Ever. For your vehicle service. Even if he is the only manager. Wait until the service manager comes in. Parts manager has nothing to do with the service department unless under specific circumstances.

(Sorry for the lengthy comment)

Now the next thing. If a mechanic finds a deeper issue during their repair on your vehicle, they must immediately stop and report to their next chain of command, who is typically the shop foreman, and sometimes even the service manager.

At this point, we mechanics CANNOT continue working on your vehicle until we get an approval from the customer to go ahead with repairing the new issue. We can't just go on saying "oh we found this issue, we need to order the part right now and bill the customer". That's not how it works. Mechanics don't call the shots. It's the shop foremen and the service managers that call the shots. We are just labourers.

The foreman/service manager MUST inform the customer first of the issue, then order a service writer (front desk person) to write up a quote, present it to the customer, then ask if you approve or disapprove of the repair and its estimated cost.

If you approve, then great! We (mechanics) will be informed to go ahead and order the part, fix it, etc.

If you disapprove, the service manager will tell the foreman, who will then tell us (mechanics) to leave that issue alone and just fix whatever the customer has originally approved. And then you can have your vehicle back, along with a copy of the quote you disapproved. And our service manager will also have a copy of that document with your signature.

You can even request to have them physically show you the issue. They can take you into the shop and the mechanic can show you what he found. Personally I am always more than happy to educate customers and elevate their understanding on car mechanics.

Unfortunately, if that is how that specific dealership works, I am so sorry you are dealing with that. I would advise you to stay away from that type of business. They are the kind of businesses that will use any dirty tricks to grab your money.

Good luck, let me know if you have any questions.
Good for you for standing firm! What a load of shit they can't tell you what the parts are for, lol. Keep us posted!
"We had to fix something else when we got in there,  $1300"
"What even was the problem?"
"No idea, but I can offer you $700 off!"

What a loon
What dealership? Even the original quote seems really high, I'd like to see what all they actually replaced because I can't think of anything they could find after pulling the valve covers that they shouldn't already be replacing as part of that job. 

Not that it helps you now but for reference, I had phasers, solenoids, timing set, both exhaust manifolds and all the turbo plumbing replaced on '12 EB about a year and a half ago and it was a tick over 5k. That was through an independent shop in Langley but using all ford oe parts. The dealership was more obviously, but the manifolds were quoted at $1500 per side so just phasers should be a lot less
pls bring a lawyer with you. even if it‚Äôs a cheapie 100 dollar bill lawyer just bring someone with you who knows the law and can pressure the dealership into dropping the entire charge
RemindMe! 1 day
Remindme! 1 day
Updateme! 1 day
You are right , they can reassemble it with the worn parts too.
Or the service
I did not agree to additional charges, yes I still have the original estimate

Edit: to be clear: no one agreed to the additional charges, it wasn‚Äôt even discussed before hand
I mean if this is a local mechanic, they ARE corporate.
Ford sucks.  I had a problem with my 2008 Escape a few years ago.  The fix should have been covered under warranty, but dealership performed the fix in such a way that they used a loophole to say warranty didn't cover it.  I complained to the corporate office but they didn't even acknowledge me.  Haven't bought a Ford again, and never will.
‚ÄúUsually always‚Äù is hilarious.
Ford won't care, OP bought a used car
Yup. It‚Äôs meant to cover something small that comes up like needing to replace a hose or a belt. $1,300 in repairs definitely needs to be authorized first
Curious to know what they say
Was the rattle cam phasers? Usually the case on those
Please let us know if they reinstall the old parts for the replacement parts that were not authorized.
I would find out if they were actually needed. If you did need them doing then they would have said ‚Äúhey you need these to do the job‚Äù and you would have agreed anyway as your already sunk into the job by that point.
You would have been a prime candidate for AWA - after warranty assistance. Ford offers this through their customer care team. It's for customers recently off warranty (you're under the warranty mileage, over on time by around a year, I assume). This program puts a chunk on Ford Canada, a chunk on the dealership, and (usually around 30%) on the customer. It is also charged at warranty rate, so you pay Ford's pricing on parts (maybe 30% less than retail). 

As the dealership also has to authorize this, they usually save it for their customers that have purchased vehicles there. You are now in a position to incentivise them to take this route. It'd take the whole cost of repairs (including the additional, unauthorized work) down significantly for you.

EDIT - If you want "your buddy who's a service advisor in Alberta" to email you a quote for what we would have charged for the job, just as a point of comparison, you can PM me your VIN and email. VCT phaser repair shouldn't be over 4k.
RemindMe! 24hr
Looks like he doesn't even know what he got, apparently they can't tell him what the $1300 was even for?
I strongly disbelief they replaced what they claim they did
If OP fights out of it, hopefully the shop puts the old parts back on also. It would be interesting to see how badly the parts were needed or how critical they were.
Thanks for following back up!
So sorry to hear that they took you for a ride like that, I wish you the best on any future repairs, but my advice would be to try and find a trustworthy independent shop. I'm biased, as I am part of our family independent shop, but I can confidently say that I DO NOT perform repairs without express authorization, that is wrong on so many levels. Thanks again for updating, and I wish you the best of luck.
Can you clarify what exactly they did for that 4100 bucks. Seems really high but I can‚Äôt tell what services were provided and what you agreed to. Seems like you should have been out the door for way less but it‚Äôs hard to follow.
Usually at most Canadian dealerships there is a spot in your paperwork to indicate what you want done in situations like this. Commonly there is a box that you sign saying that anything over 200 dollars requires contact, or you can sign another box saying anything over the initial amount requires contact. There is a third box that essentially says do whatever it takes but I've never seen someone sign that one.
2017 F150 3.5L ecoboost
Does not matter, cannot order parts and charge them without authorization.
Fuck that. I‚Äôm not going to go begging for discounts on a repair I didn‚Äôt authorize. No authorization no money. I work as a technician at a firs dealer and still see it that way. Never once have I increased a repair estimate without telling the service advisor to contact the customer first. Even if it means the car is inoperable until they respond. Contacting corporate is a lot nicer than I‚Äôd be. I‚Äôd refuse to pay and if you try to force the money out of me I‚Äôd be taking that money and giving it to a lawyer instead and make sure I get all my money and legal fees back and extra. And be damn sure I‚Äôd sue for the time off work emotional stress the gas I spent driving to the court house the whole 9 yards. Make them wish they did the right thing to start with.
You must not have seen where the OP went to the dealer and no one could say what needed replaced or why.  That's a pretty big red flag.
No, up in Canada.  I got it all figured out, I put updates in the comments
All good, I thought that might have been the case and then I found your original reply later lol.  Losing your dad is not an easy thing, I think about him every day.

Sorry for your loss as well.
this 100%
Because people think we have nothing better to do than work around their vehicle sitting in the way taking up space that costs money.
I was afk
I‚Äôm not sure I follow, I‚Äôm 37 years old and my dad has been dead for 6 years‚Ä¶
Where did he say his dad paid for anything? Where did he even say dad?
Did you reply to the wrong post or have you had a recent traumatic brain injury?
Always bro, I go in quiet and calm
Where did you get the idea that he needed timing chains?
No intelligent technician is using timing components for that engine from the cheapest thing rock auto sells guy.  Look up oem parts if you're going to do a comparison like this.
Referencing different Canadian auto laws as they can very from province to province.
So unfortunately I tried to price out the cam phasers through local mechanics but they all recommended I go straight to ford with the job. I was told it has something to do with timing and the ford mechanics have a lot of experience with the cam phaser issue
No, it's a decent size job, but not $7k. I don't know what $7k in Canadian converts to in American dollars, but I know we usually do that job for $4k-$4500 depending on whatever else we find. Some people decide to replace the water pump while we're in there etc.
Also they need to give you a print out of what parts, labor, and shop fees, tax. Can't be doing this.
Book labor on the valve cover R&R on that truck is 5.6 hours.
communism is when canada?
It‚Äôs not a recall. It‚Äôs a service bulletin that tells dealers how to address a known issue under warranty. Since there are no longer any vehicles under warranty that this applies to they pull the bulletin.
Meeting with the service manager tomorrow 8am

Edit: I‚Äôll update after
Sweet, can he do my phasers? üòÇ

|-|-|-|-|
I did my research, it is a reputable shop.  They made a mistake on the estimate. They‚Äôre only human and they made it right(updates in the comments)
They already did, I put updates in the comments if you‚Äôre curious üëÄ
They would argue that text message was informing the customer, and they didn't say to stop work. Still a bit crappy. I always ask WHEN DROPPING THE CAR OFF for them to retain removed parts so I can inspect them. They have no idea if I know anything about cars but probably wouldn't chance completely ripping me off. On pickup I ask them to show me the problem on the part, then you get to learn something. I will also get them to explain why they are doing the extra work before authorising it, usually people making up extra work are remarkably bad at explaining an imaginary defect.

I have a garage I trust now, but my wife got ripped off by a dealer changing the front discs and pads to fix a problem with the handbrake which on that vehicle operates on the rear wheels. She authorised the work not knowing any better, I made them explain how the braking system worked when we went to collect the vehicle, made them squirm a bit. They still doubled down claiming the front brakes needed changing, even quoting the mm thickness of pads, which actually just proved they were 40% worn, that second attempt at lying to us set the price they eventually got paid.
OP did not post a quote for us to look at and headgaskets don't cost 6 grand to fix. But let's go with that example.

I used to run a Subaru specialty repair shop. If someone came in for head gaskets I would give them the price to replace those on a quote or invoice sheet. 
At the bottom of that page before the signature but not on the work to be completed line would be a statement that read something like this.

"There's a chance that other internal components are damaged that are unable to be seen at this time a common example is valves. If this components are found to be broken the additional cost could be somewhere between $500 and $1,000 true place said components. As this prevents the engine from being reassembled. Customer agrees to pay the cost for these parts and that the shop only needs to notify that for the repairs are needed up to that cost."

This commonly added another $700s  to a $1000 dollar job
Nope. The rules are officially: you must quote prior to completing the job. Any cost beyond 10%of the original quote has to be confirmed by the customer. In this situation you would get some communication and either approve or deny the repair. If you deny the  repair, there is a good chance you‚Äôll pay for the work up to that point and have to tow the vehicle to another place with a bunch of parts in the trunk. Maybe another garage will tell you what you want to hear. Not a great situation. Reality is you likely needed this expensive part to be replaced and they just failed to get approval. That‚Äôs the problem. 

You can fight this but contacting the licensing body which governs the garage. Alberta this is AMVIC, they are a consumer protection organization. This fight will likely leave your vehicle in limbo as I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt let the key go without payment first. Your argument will require word from another licensed garage which disagrees with first garage. Make sure you take any old parts with you.
A few years ago, I was visiting my parents in a small village about 100 miles from where I lived at the time. The day after I arrived, we took my car to drive somewhere, and on the last mile, I noticed some weird noises from the rear left wheel. I figured I shouldn't drive that old piece of junk all the way home with a fucky wheel, so my dad and I drove to his local mechanic (two villages over because yay villages) and we dropped it off. Said something to the effect of "please have a look at the source of the noise and call me" and he said he'd call us the next day.

He did call the next day, to tell us that the repairs were complete and that would be 800‚Ç¨. I'm like, what? What repairs? I asked you to find what's wrong not fix it with an outrageous price?? At least that's what I said to my dad, who had taken the phone call. I said I did not want to do an 800‚Ç¨ repair on 20 year old basic beater Audio that only cost me 1000‚Ç¨ to buy three years ago, I could buy a whole new Audi for that much. 

Alas, my dad said he'd rather just pay for it than argue with the mechanic, and said he'd just avoid that mechanic in the future. And I just figured... well it's not *my* money anymore, and I'm not about to save my stubborn dad 800‚Ç¨ just because he's too big of a coward to confront the mechanic about his shady business practices.

Turns out the dealer quoted for two work hours and a genuine brand new Audi OEM brake caliper. On a 20 year old car. Without consulting me. And given the speed he performed the repair at, I can only assume that he had the part in stock for the last ten years and was glad to be rid of it.

And he also fucked up the wheel speed sensor because my stability control got fucky a month after the repair. But that Audi did not need that to begin with so I didn't bother.

And he also fucked up the rim on my dad's car, repaired it when it really should have been replaced, causing it to tear apart and rip the tire to shreds while I was the lucky one to drive that car at 100 mph. You know that iconic WWI/WWII braaaaaap noise of propeller airplanes from the movies? Yeah that's what my tire sounded like driving on a sudden flat at high fast. Shredded it real good, glad I could come to a stop before running out of rubber. Barely.

Pretty sure that guy just liked to cause problems to make customers come back, and since he was the only mechanic in a ten village radius... must have worked out for him.
In most of Canada you can legally go over the original estimate by 10% without approval if there's a legitimate need. Anything else and they have to pound sand.¬†
Wow...what all did they do?  Even 1400 sounds high.  Dealer tho...
Wow üòÆ $1,400.00 in parts to change brakes. What vehicle is this?
1400 for brakes? The fuck? They redo the entire braking system in the process?


Are they carbon ceramic brakes? A ferrari? A semi?




1400 for brakes on your everyday commuter car (think mass produced vehicles like civics, camrys, crvs, f150s and the like) is an absolute ripoff. Only way i could even envision this would be calipers, pads, drums/rotors, and labor and still added "fuck you" time.

Thanks very much for the effort on this comment, I‚Äôll update with how it all turns out
I second this as a 20-year veteran tech with foreman experience. This is very common and in a shop of good repute the tech buttons everything back up nice or leaves things in a state it can easily be buttoned up from and the vehicle gets put into the lot under wait status. The tech then grabs the next vehicle for diag or the next one with available parts and keeps it moving. Flat rate is a double edged sword.... 
If the shop gave you this short shot text then they are shady and shady practices usually have a hard time training their guys to practice shadiness in a way that totally circumvents laws and standards put forth by governing bodies. With that said don't let the pressure off them, they fucked up. They have to come correct or face the repurcussions in the form of eating this whole job, getting sued, or whatever you  choose to pursue.
my shop has a great system, once a tech finds a new issue we report it and our parts department finds the part as fast as they can before notifying the customer. (a lot of the stuff we work on gets back ordered for months)
That's one of the most thoughtful and insightful posts I've seen in a while. I think someone also needs to send this story to Steve Lehto, he would love this. This is right in his wheelhouse.
As a dealership parts person - Ford, at that - seconding all of this. This is all spot on, from procedural info to department overlap or lack thereof.
This is (potentially) actually very bad advice. Once you even mention a lawyer, let alone bring one with you, a large percentage of places will no longer speak with you. They‚Äôll tell you that all further communication will have to go through their attorneys. Just fyi.

If they even replaced anything
Technically yes. 

But customer approves 5 k for phaser r & r. With 40k on the clock . 

They get in there and see a worn timing chain.  Shell out 1300 for a timing kit now or put a new phaser with old timing chain /guides / tensioners. If you do the latter 

Customer comes back complaining why you didn‚Äôt change/see that it needed to be replaced. 

This is hypothetical to this situation obviously but you get the point. 

Customer in general are a double edge sword. They don‚Äôt want to pay for diagnosis but will complain when they pay someone who just throws parts at it and it doesn‚Äôt fix it.
Yes meant the part and labor together, should‚Äôve clarified
Then say " thank you for the work, but I never agreed or asked to have that fixed." The General Manager will twist your arm. Be firm and let them know you will call corporate if they don't remove those additional charges.
You will want to also look into state/local authorities and requirements for where you are.

For example: In California, all repair shops including dealerships are regulated by the Bureau of Automotive Repair or the BAR. One of those requirements is providing a written estimate for initial job, and then also getting consent for specific work performed such as, a written signature on a second estimate with costs, or writen/oral authorization which then has to be documented on the estimate for that specific job. Oral authorization would usually be proven through phone calls being recorded. Written would be via text message/email. 

So in California, no consent? Thanks for the free work.....And if they still want to play hard? The BAR will not be very fun for them and could even result in the Revocation of their license to operate as an automotive repair facility....A dealership near me is currently on Probation for selling a engine wire harness, not replacing the wire harness and just performing a wire repair....aka fraud.
Hey, was anything signed? 

I‚Äôve had a place try to put a ‚Äúsafety clause‚Äú where they could repair something that they ‚Äúdeemed unsafe‚Äù and tried charge us an extra $400. 

It sucks because my wife dropped off our car and I went picked up the car/pay. But they didn‚Äôt even know what the ‚Äúfixed‚Äù for the additional cost. A part of me felt that the mechanic thought he could try to pull a fast one on my wife. Never went back after that slimy shit
If my shop sells coffee I cannot just charge an extra kale shot for 24.99 because I think the customer is low on iron... Feels like this should be disputed and the other commenters here have great suggestions.
Ford broke some shit while working on my wife‚Äôs car (like fluid tanks) as they removed and added them back in. They then proceeded to bill her for the replacements and called and said ‚Äúhey sorry, you‚Äôre going to have to pay or we‚Äôll stick the broken ones back in instead, the cars old so they needed replaced anyhow‚Äù

We did NOT pay for anything but the work approved in the original quote
It‚Äôs through a licenced ford dealership
>I had a problem with my 2008 Escape a few years ago.  The fix should have been covered under warranty,

What's your definition of "a few years"?
10% is 10%. It‚Äôs the same where I live. On the listed repair the total was over $7000. That means the original was $5700. That means $570 over estimate with no authorization is legal. 

Of course I‚Äôd absolutely always call for approval and on $1300 I‚Äôd wait for approval as long as possible, but I‚Äôd probably take the gamble on moving forward if it meant not doing so was going to tie up the bay, vehicle or tech for more than a day or 2. 

I‚Äôd be interested in seeing what needed to be replaced. If the repair was timing related and the phasers were coming off, finding worn cam lobes wouldn‚Äôt be out of the question. There‚Äôs no way to predict that when estimating and cams could easily run several hundred each. 

The problem with questions like this is that we‚Äôre getting half the story with no actual mechanic involved in the explanation and for some reason the ‚Äúmechanics‚Äù commenting jump at the chance to shit on the shop, especially if it was a dealership. It‚Äôs very frustrating how ready people in our industry are to tear down others in our industry and then wonder why we‚Äôre undervalued and often under paid compared to other skilled blue collar jobs.
Yes it was
That‚Äôs true.. they may have done nothing haha
I get where you are coming from, however I doubt they would even attempt to put the old parts in. My best guess is that most of the $1,300 is labor or a few select expensive parts mixed in. Due to this, the shop would actually lose out even more by trying to put the old parts back in. Most likely, they will put in a "discount", which is really adjusting the labor down closer to cost, and see if the customer will bite.(Semi) worst case, they let him go with no additional charge past the original repair estimate (approved) cost and call it a day. Then hopefully some training for the advisor and tech. Actually worst case would be fights for a lean or court. I doubt it would go that far as the shop would lose super hard in all 50 states. Again, I am really sorry the shop put you in this position OP, and it truly is their fault this thread exists. Hopefully everything turns out alright for you. (Edited for stupid autocorrect fails)
You are correct, I priced the job out at $3,200 with a mechanic I know but he actually suggested I take it to ford as they warranty their work and he doesn‚Äôt do cam phasers very often
To answer your question though:

‚ÄúReplaced engine oil pressure switch and re wired oil pressure switch connector (pig tail) do to low engine oil warning light on. Replaced left valve cover do to engine oil leak. Replaced timming chains, VCT solenoids, VTC units, timing chain tensioners & gides do to engine noise.‚Äù

That‚Äôs a direct quote from the service order, spelling mistakes and all.
 No the dealer that added an Extra $1300. Are rhey called Titanium Ford?
The shop is free to order any parts they want. But they cannot install them or charge the customer for them until the customer agrees. If the customer does not agree, the shop can return the parts.
I was out of town and had no reception, I still have life and a family even though my truck is broken, and when they tell me that they‚Äôve done the job 1000 times and it‚Äôll be ready on Friday, perfect‚Ä¶..I‚Äôll see you Friday.
He's responding to the wrong person/post. Some kid (SavvySillybug) posted his own mechanic experience, this is a reply to that.
Wrong post.....so ya......brain injury is quite possible.sorry forum
More importantly, why does he think a shop is going to order the parts from Rock Auto? It's surprising that people are still ignorant enough to think that because something costs x amount of dollars on the internet that it should cost the same amount from a local store. Especially when there's a good chance they aren't even comparing the same brand of parts.
Damn, it's not that complicated of a job. We do them all the time. There's realistically no job that only dealerships have the ability to do, besides warranty and recalls and that's just cause outside shops won't get paid for that.
That's about the same the dollar is shyte...
That sucks.
Thankyou good luck!
I think he replaced those. Also he did so much shit on that truck. It wasn‚Äôt even funny man and I swear to God my truck run so smooth right now.
And if I‚Äôm getting the words wrong, I know solenoid phasers or mentioned he says now he needs to replace the spark plugs. He‚Äôs really really getting into it.
Yeah I had a mechanic look at a headlight I had switched out because it went out again the following day even though it appeared to be seated all the way.  I told him I was just having issues with my driver side headlight.  After an hour or so, the mechanic came back and gave me a burned out bulb telling me the whole fixture was loose and the entire assembly would need replaced which would run me just shy of a $1000.  He at least asked me if I wanted him to order the part(s) and pay now to which I replied, "no, I'll need to wait on that." 

Went home, pulled out the bulb which as it turns out wasn't seated all the way after it was plugged in.  The bulb, however, was the one I put in two days prior.  I know because I bought a new brand and type of halogen.  I had a feeling this was going to be the case because the bulb the mechanic gave me at the shop was not the same bulb I had just bought and used.  After I seated it properly, I've had no issues with my headlight.

TL;DR - Don't always believe the mechanic just because they show you removed/broken parts.  It doesn't mean they are the removed/broken parts from YOUR vehicle.  Also, if you do anything on your own to your car, check your damn work to save you a trip to the auto shop and potentially get scammed out of a grand, or more, of your hard earned monies.
>to retain removed parts so I can inspect them

Unless you mark those parts beforehand you still won't know whether that's actually your old part or one from the bin.
>They would argue that text message was informing the customer, and they didn't say to stop work.

That does not constitute informing the customer. 

Any shop worth a damn (and their license) has it in the T+C on their estimate that no work will be done without the customer's approval. 

It is not the customer's responsibility to tell them to stop work if the shop finds previously undiagnosed problems.
Honestly the easiest way to sell something is to show the customer the problem anyway. I always ask if they would like to see the issue or encourage them to see it even if they dropped it off. I have no interest in selling people things they don‚Äôt need. Loyal customers all spend the most money over a lifetime anyway so no reason to rip people off
They might argue that, but it would be a tough sell to say them asking ‚Äúwhat is the problem‚Äù to which the dealer didn‚Äôt reply with an explanation of the issue and decided on their own accord to just go ahead with it.

As the customer id just respond to the text now and say I don‚Äôt agree with the additional work especially with no explanation of what that entailed.

The dealership would lose this hard and they know it, it would likely be resolved by management far before this became a legal problem.

I‚Äôd agree to pay the original price and nothing more for unapproved work, and this text message is all the proof needed as there is no approval anywhere in here, nor an explanation of the problem which was asked prior to the work being performed.

I‚Äôd ask that a manager investigate this as I only agree to pay for approved work, and that they need to make this right. If they pushed back I‚Äôd let them know I was going to be consulting an attorney. Seems like a slam dunk.
Informing the customer, and getting an OK for +$1300 worth of work is two, HUGE different things. This is clearly a "status update text" where he tried to slip over an extra grand in. It most definitely was NOT a text asking OP if they authorize the extra work being done. 

Which any shop that isn't trying to scam their customers or upcharge would stop work immediately regardless if they were in the middle of the quoted work to let the OP know that they found another issue not on the quote, what EXACTLY the issue is, not just "work not visible until we removed 6-8 bolts only". Also they would need to get an Ok from OP, and a smart shop would have OP sign an updated quote and or, at least a text you could truly argue what you said they would argue. 

I'm sure they just count on people uneducated in car issues to hopefully just want the "issues solved" so will just pay the bill and then be a car driver for another 5-6 years without any major work needing to be done. Imo if it's not super super clearly above board, the shop is trying to rob you.
But the quote is for specific work done. The 10% applies to the original quoted work. Unless they were quoted '$x to make car work properly' that's a little different than '$x to replace part z and labor'.
If other work needs done, it needs to be re-quoted with the required work or at least approved by the customer.
Didn't read past the first sentence because it's just wrong. In my state customer has the right to a written estimate, and by law the shop can't exceed that written estimate by more than 10% without approval. It is not required unless requested. Opposite end of the spectrum a customer can say do whatever it needs I don't care what it costs and legally the shop can do just that.
Bingo.  Same thing in Ontario.
Would you be able to recoup the entire 1300 or just up to 10% of what the original quote was?
I‚Äôve been threw this twice both times ended up with free repairs the one time they just did it obviously no brainer but the second time they tried to call me I was at work called my spouse they said yes title was in my name I used second key to pick up my car then proceed to inform my lawyer few court dates later they brought in my other key and I had zero bill
It‚Äôs an issue of them doing work unapproved and with no explanation of the problem.

They don‚Äôt owe for work they did not approve. The dealership is in the wrong.

The part might be needed, but that‚Äôs irrelevant.. maybe the OP doesn‚Äôt have the extra cash.

At that point id just find out what they did, get a quote from a mechanic that‚Äôs not affiliated with the dealership which will definitely be lower and tell the dealership no problem I got a guy that‚Äôs gonna do it for x.

Now they are in a scenario where they have a vehicle that the customer wants to have serviced elsewhere and they chose to do out of the kindness of their hearts. I wouldn‚Äôt pay and based on this exchange the dealer wouldn‚Äôt win. But the fight may suck, but that‚Äôs how they learn not to do shit like this because someone with a spine needs to push back.
Nope they didn't get a quote for the second repair so they don't have to pay.   There is a reason dealerships record their phone calls.
As soon as I read 100mph I couldn't believe anything else I had just read.
Immature whiny little boy calls his dad a coward for paying his repair bill

Brakes, rotors, brake fluid flush, diag on the electronic power steering that they wanted another $1100 to fix even though they couldn't source the replacement part from Mazda anymore.  I haven't been back since and found a shop two blocks away where the owner is a rotary head.
pads, discs, and two remanned calipers would hit that easily on a lot of vehicles.
2011 Mazda RX-8.  Genuine OEM brakes and rotors were around $950.  The brake fluid is shared with the clutch and brakes so extra steps are needed to also bleed the clutch but $500 in labor did feel high.
Just a little 2011 RX-8.  Sure it's a 'sports car' but I felt like I was given an exotic tax from the Mazda dealership.  The local independant shop I found also scoffed at the $1400 and we talked rotaries for a bit so I'll go there in the future.
You're blaming the wrong party. Someone at the garage told the mechanic to go ahead with the repair knowing they didn't have authorization.  The shop screwed this mechanic over.
No problem at all, glad to help.

If they end up fixing your vehicle without your authorization on paper, you get to walk home with your truck back and a free bill. They are the ones at fault for not having order in the shop.

They also legally cannot hold your truck in the shop and force you to pay if you didnt authorize the repair. They HAVE to take that financial loss as their fault. If they hold your truck in the shop, call the cops, take them to court if it gets to that point. 

Maybe hit the record button on your phone before the meeting starts in case they say some shady crap. 

I'll check up in a few days for the update if you decide to let us know.

‚Äê------------
Edit: it seems like people are misunderstanding one of my conversations here. I apologise for this and will elaborate on it. However, this may not reflect other dealership practices or privately owned businesses. I can only speak for the practice in my area, and a few other areas in the countries. This is regarding holding any vehicle in a shop for unauthorized repairs.

When a repair is not approved AND the shop goes ahead and fixes it anyway. That is NOT the fault of the customer (you). That is the fault of the dealership/business, and the dealership/business MUST take that financial loss. They legally cannot force the customer to pay for a repair they did not authorize. And they cannot hold the vehicle from the customer for rightfully not paying for an unauthorized repair. That is called being held for ransom.

Most service managers and businesses are understanding and will take the loss. This situation happens weekly/monthly and we take financial losses all the time. This is something most people are unaware of.

Here are 2 things that realistically happen when an unauthorized repair is done: 

1) The dealership will let the customer walk away and we take the financial loss. (This is normal)

2) The service manager will order the mechanic to remove that new part out of the vehicle and put the old part back in and we take the financial loss. And the customer still gets their vehicle back.

Imagine taking your vehicle in for maintenance which cost you $200-$500 and then they try to charge you another $3000 for something you didnt agree to. Even I don't have that much disposable money, I would be pretty angry. I could take my car to another shop to fix that same issue for only $800 instead of $3000.

In any case, I am on your side, the customer, in this scenario. If this happens to any of you, I am letting you know you can fight for your rights. If you did not approve the repair, you are not obligated to pay. If they hold your vehicle because you didn't pay for a repair you did not agree to, they are holding you for ransom. Take it to court. Call the police. They are also mediators for situations like this. But I can tell you right now that realistically most businesses would rather avoid going to court, will give you back the vehicle, and take the financial loss, and maybe yell at the person (or fire, depending on the financial loss) who made the mistake of allowing unauthorized work.

Again, I only speak for my area and some other locations.

Let me know if you have any questions. If you are a mechanic, service manager or foreman in this conversation, I am always open to how other business practices work as well.
Don't give those fuckers one penny more than agreed at drop-off, good for you.
We actually have a service writer at my Ford dealership that will tell us that repairs are approved WITHOUT CALLING THE CUSTOMER, then tell us halfway through the repair "oh yeah they declined it, sorry." Sounds like you have one of those guys. Trust me, we hate them too.
I‚Äôd recommend getting a video/voice recording if you can of your meeting with the service manager. If you have to go above their head it may be helpful to have the recording on the chance that what they told you was total BS. It may not do anything but it also doesn‚Äôt hurt anything by having it, if they‚Äôre giving you false information they certainly aren‚Äôt going to admit to doing so when upper mgmt asks but they can‚Äôt deny the sound of their own voice. Hope you get this sorted soon, I can‚Äôt really speak to the legality of it because I‚Äôm in the US and don‚Äôt know Canadian laws but I feel like this type of behavior is unacceptable anywhere you go. I went in for an alignment and the shop called saying they wanted to replace my subframe, i ended up needing more than just an alignment but i absolutely am not replacing the subframe on a 2009 vehicle because it doesn‚Äôt look shiny and new ü§£ good on you for standing up to these jerks, it‚Äôs sad that not just 1 but 3 different people cant tell you what this mysterious repair was
fine then don‚Äôt bring one to the meeting, if it doesn‚Äôt get resolved completely in his favor then he brings the lawyer.
You skipped the part where they contacted the customer, thoroughly explained the situation, waited for the customer's decision, then acted in accordance with the customer's wishes as far as what to do with *the customer's vehicle*.
I understand what you are getting at but at the end of the day you properly explain the situation, document everything,and let the customer make the decision. As long as everything is documented properly when the customer comes back for the issue they chose not to have fixed your ass is covered.
You mean California, Canada? Never heard of it...
Apparently it's somewhere in Ontario...
Nah all verbal after the estimate, just standard key drop off
There is a tire shop chain in the states that, if they deem your tires unsafe; will replace them with the cheapest acceptable replacement if you refuse to buy new tires. They just write it off as cost of doing business since it looks real bad to tell a customer their tires are too dangerous to drive on, and then let them leave that way if they can‚Äôt afford it.
They have to get your approval for this amount. They are allowed to go over the original estimate by a certain percentage or fixed amount depending on the state but this amount would be way beyond that. You aren't responsible for the amount over what is allowed by your state.
It's different. I managed a GM dealer service department we were privately owned. Customers go to Corporate to get assistance, which is then passed through us as a dealer. Im just trying to help. Why are people judgmental with opinions now? When you continually critique people helping,  then we quit helping... people need to wake up and be mindful.
Fuck dealerships. In my experience they are lying predatory snakes. Obviously not all, but I‚Äôve had many bad experiences and times I‚Äôve been blatantly lied to.
I had a problem with them at my local.  Head office won‚Äôt do anything.  They‚Äôll tell you it‚Äôs up to the owner of the franchise.  I‚Äôm in Ontario.
I dunno. Point is, car was still under the certified pre owned warranty program.
>The problem with questions like this is that we‚Äôre getting half the story with no actual mechanic involved in the explanation and for some reason the ‚Äúmechanics‚Äù commenting jump at the chance to shit on the shop, especially if it was a dealership. It‚Äôs very frustrating how ready people in our industry are to tear down others in our industry and then wonder why we‚Äôre undervalued and often under paid compared to other skilled blue collar jobs.

Sadly, it works both ways in this industry. The dealer will always try to throw an indie shop under the bus. I was talking to another shop last week that is having problems with a recent reman GM transmission. Their local dealer wants the shop to send the vehicle to them for the warranty work. The shop knows the dealer is going to blame them for something. I know I have had that same feeling before and try to keep everything in house because of it.

Edit: you are also right about only knowing half the situation. It could be possible that the job couldn't be completed without the extra parts. If the timing chain tensioner fell apart, the engine can't be reassembled without it. I know that doesn't make up the price difference, it's just an easy example. If the end of a camshaft or camshafts were damaged and the new phasers couldn't be bolted on, it would be the same scenario and closer to explaining the price difference. The shop should have still waited for authorization, but they also know if the customer declined the extra parts and the job went to shit that they would be blamed for it.
Mechanics underpaid? Come to California
I'd like to know what the fuck they did to need $1300 in parts while doing phasers.
Ahhh thanks for the clarity
Wow, I get downvoted so much for bullshit. Thanks for taking my side bud. Yeah though, my pops still wrenches on the side and has so many people ask if they can bring their own parts in. He will sit down on the couch and bitch for hours about the horrible quality he has people try to have him put on, let alone try to have him warranty "well you put it on you should warranty your work" yeah it was a job that took several hours but you purchased something that cost nothing and had a lifetime warranty. Sorry bud.
Just found out about it when changing my oil and was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that rattling sound‚Äù. Now I know. Wish I didn‚Äôt.
what a piece of shit
I have taken to writing the date I change consumable parts onto the part itself. Doesn't work for things the garage changes, but at least I know if air filters are getting changed... Although these days I just do them myself.
Very good tip as well. The thing I find weird here, personally if I was going to quote a job, I would take the time to peak at the valves BEFORE quoting the job. I think it is scary for those that aren't familiar with cars, though anyone with experience knows it's max 8 bolts, and you can view the valves, camshaft, springs etc. So I think work "only visible after the valve cover was pulled" is a very odd +$1300 personally.
In what world does a headlight cost $1k?
I kinda assume a base level of honesty. The point of asking to see any parts before even starting work is so that they know some level of scrutiny is going to be applied to their work so they are less likely to try something on, instead picking on a more ignorant customer.
We have more regulations in Canada btw.
Wait, so you ripped off a local business? That‚Äôs fucked.
You maybe speaking about a different market. If you are correct then the parts the customer needs for the repair will be removed, at best. It won‚Äôt be free either way.
I'm German. I was going 160 km/h. As you do on your way to work. XD

I‚Äôm sorry but I read your comments and this is wrong.as the story goes the customer approved work but not the updated estimate with the cost of additional parts. At this point the vehicle is disassembled.  I assume I‚Äôm speaking to a journeyman flat rate guy, you know that the customer would have to pay to reassemble the vehicle with a known issue and no warranty on work done or all parts dumped into the back and customer pays up to this point and a tow bill to get it off the property or pay what was recommended. The shop needs to get paid up to this point. Also, a side note: this vehicle is disassembled on a hoist and the garage has a stop work situation until approval right? Couldn‚Äôt the customer at least make an attempt to get back to the business before  the next day  or couple days later? A dealer tech, around here, doesn‚Äôt get paid unless work is completed. Shitty deal right? Should the tech go home and clock out?pack up the vehicle and push it outside and then tow it back in when the customer gets back to the garage eventually, for free?You guys might be surprised that it‚Äôs the tech working on the vehicle getting jerked around by this as well. If the shop isn‚Äôt paid, neither is the tech. This only applies to flat rate dealers naturally. 

Also, OP didn‚Äôt receive a phone call before a text came in? No written estimate of the updated parts after a concern was raised? OP went into the garage, still zero explanation what the extra cost was? The parts manager could even name the part in question? Also, the service manager was out‚Ä¶what about the tech or service advisor or parts person to explain what happening? Nobody could say anything about this extra cost? Sounds unlikely. OP should post a written estimate of the updated work or tow it outra there and update on what another garage says and how that worked out.
If OP wants to take their vehicle back without paying, they will have to go to the courts and get a bond in the amount of the bill. The courts will hold the money until the dispute is settled. At least, that's how it works here. I'm not in Canada, so it might be different. If OP is just disputing the additional amount, they will probably have to pay that plus the 10% increase allowed to the bill. Then they might have to get a bond for the rest of the total, which at that point would probably only be a few hundred dollars.
They didn't explain the situation. Nothing is explained if you're not going to say WHAT the extra cost is. Can't just charge more and not effectively explain why.
Maybe I‚Äôm blind or there‚Äôs more images you‚Äôve seen that I can‚Äôt, but where does it show the customer giving permission for additional work?

I‚Äôm not backing this shop because I don‚Äôt know the situation. But it isn‚Äôt out of this world. Or a impossible situation. 

1300 could be a camshaft. Or hpfp. 

Or the shop bent valves and are charging customer for machine shop fees
In all honesty, the worst that's going to happen is that the shop will have to eat that extra $1,300. They acted in best interest of the customer, even if said customer has his head up his ass and can't see that. I understand being frustrated that they didn't contact you to notify you of additional work needed, but if I'm running a shop, I don't want that car coming back for something that I noticed while working on it but neglected to fix.
>You will want to also look into state/local authorities and requirements for where you are.
 
Literally the first line.
Ok, yeah don‚Äôt pay for what was not initially agreed upon. Also look up your state laws regarding the ‚ÄúAutomobile Repairs Facilities Act‚Äù. Good luck
It's not verbal though -- you have a text of them saying extra $1300 and your response was what is the $1300 and in no way seemed to agree to it... their next communication was telling you it's done and a huge final cost.

Given it's a $7000 job they can eat that $1300, and the "met you halfway" sales guy can eat something else.

Just to be clear tho, you likely can't go back to this dealer for service if you push this, they'll either refuse or they extract it from you later... if the $1300 was legit and you'd have agreed to it then I'd likely take the "half way" offer if it seems fair.
That is admittedly pretty cool, do you know what chain?
I‚Äôm honestly very grateful for your advice, thank you
I‚Äôm sorry but where exactly did I critique you? I just stated that if it is a local mechanic there isn‚Äôt much you can do as far as ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù. Since it isn‚Äôt they don‚Äôt have to worry. Not sure what you‚Äôre on about.
Are you a mechanic in California or are you basing that on a high labor price in a high cost of living area?
Often time phaser issues are not cause by just the phasers...

The cam journals in the heads don't use bearings. Wear to these journals causes oil flow/pressure to the phasers to drop, which causes them to malfunction and fail. If the journals are worn, replacement of the affected head(s) and cam(s) is warranted. 

Although "cold rattle on startup" is more indicative of a chain tensioner issue than a phaser issue. But, a bypassing tensioner can cause oil flow issues to the head, and the above damages...
Most people in this sub want something for nothing. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre in a free advice sub. They run off most of the people that can answer their questions because the actual answer is different than the answer they want. The only reason it‚Äôs amusing is cause the people in this sub won‚Äôt take their vehicle to a real shop so we don‚Äôt have to deal with them and their not understanding that shops don‚Äôt buy parts off rock auto or care how much the part costs on the internet.
I do that on ALL parts I replace.

I do 90% of my own maintenance and repairs.

Air and oil filters are easy BC you do them all the time. But I also do it on fuel filters, coils/coil packs, spark plug wires, sensors, etc. 

Even "hard" parts like a control arm, CV shaft, shock, strut, etc the date and mileage gets written on it in paint marker.
Canada?  Which one of the 52 states is that in?
I didn‚Äôt realize Germans drove beater Audis. How could it pass TUV inspection?
No shit
Turns out the internet can't hurt anyone so all the web is a safe space
>Trying to get free stuff because of a mistake like that is shitty.

They tried to rip him off and he told them no.  

I don't have a problem with it. This shop should eat their screw-up.  Maybe they'll learn not to screw people over in the future. 

If someone paints your house without asking then tries to charge you money for it, you're saying you should pay up?    

They weren't authorized to repair the car. They did it anyway.  To me that's a free gift.
I asked them how much the water pump was and they said it was $150 and they would waive labor but I had already been to autozone because I thought it was the water pump, and it was a $50 part. I wasn't going to pay their part markup for a repair I didn't want.
That's what he is saying, he's saying Dr Downvote magnet is assuming the customer is just automatically agreeing telepathically to whatever the mechanic decides to do carte blanche. 

This is why I stopped watching Rainmann Ray videos, he's always complaining about customers and saying that he "fired a customer." Customer service is part of the job, being personable and actually communicating in a language that a customer can understand is part of the job. The mechanic is not always the best person to do this, but if he can, all the better. To explain the necessity of doing extra work with sound reasoning and getting the customer on board is going to be a challenge sometimes, especially since most people don't know a fuel pump from a knock sensor, but burning your customers like that dealership did is just bad for the service industry.
Who are you replying to?
They were speaking hypothetically.
It does not matter what the mechanical issue was. They did something to the vehicle that added $1300 to the bill without giving the customer the opportunity of making an informed decision. If the shop needs to go more than 10% over the estimated repair cost then a discussion needs to be had.

Stuff like this is why I am so glad I work on my own vehicles.

>I don't want that car coming back or something that I noticed while working on it but neglected

-to inform the customer and seek approval for the extra work is what you should have written next.
No, best interest for the customer is to contact them, explain the situation and the extra cost and ask them to go ahead. Ordering and charging with no communication isn't good form at all.
I believe I am ‚Äúsaid customer.‚Äù

If I was informed of the additional cost and decided to square up what I owe, tow my truck home, and park it until I had the money to fix it that‚Äôs my prerogative as it‚Äôs MY property.

I understand your logic about trying to do right by the customer in the long run but the biggest thing to consider is the customers finances, you should never spend money that doesn‚Äôt belong to you.
If it were my shop, if the customer couldn‚Äôt be reached to agree to the additional work, put it back together and charge the labor for the original repair. If they want the additional repair, they can be charged for the additional labor to tear it back apart. Or the customer could take it somewhere else. ‚ÄúActing in the best interest of the customer‚Äù is an absolute garbage of an excuse to perform unnecessary work on someone‚Äôs vehicle. It isn‚Äôt your property, and you have no right to perform any repair that wasn‚Äôt explained prior to starting. I‚Äôd lodge a complaint with the states attorney generals office and have their license to operate a business in the state pulled if they fought that repair bill. The shop should and in my state, would eat that cost, as all work must be agreed to, and signed on a work order, prior to work being completed. That way, if the customer refused payment, a ‚Äúmechanics lean‚Äù can be placed against the title for non-payment. Doing work without the permission or direction of the customer is shady business practices and makes reputable shops look bad.
Trash ass take. Customer has his head up his ass because the shop added on 1300 in charges without asking?! In what world does that sound right
They didn‚Äôt look out for anyone‚Äôs best interest besides their own. 

Why does everything you wrote after the first sentence contain lies and implications that op was informed about this and declined the work? 

Scammer.
As someone who works in a shop, we also don't want your vehicle stuck on our hoist when there is other work to be done that needs that hoist. I agree that the customer should be informed, but sometimes you will completely void warranty on new parts if you don't change out other worn/damaged parts. The customer also needs to respond in a timely manner to the shop. Looks like the customer took 2 days to reply in this case. Is the shop supposed to lose hourly rate on that hoist due to a customer not replying? We don't exactly want to keep your exposed engine outside while we wait on a reply. It's a tough situation but sometimes things can not be seen until you are in there doing the work.
You don't actually know what they repaired so how could you know they acted in the best interest. 

The first step of any extra charge thats not a couple dollars should be informing the customer... 

Legally that amount seems to be 10% where this customer is located.
Like in the United States of Canada?
Discount Tire Co. I worked there years ago, not sure f they still do it.

The latter, I was more so taking a jab at how expensive hourly labor rates are.

brooo, trump isn't going to have sex with you, just give it up.
Truth. Rainman Ray realized that introducing drama and conflict was good for engagement, so he started creating it. I stopped learning, and started to feel like an apprentice mechanic listening to the been-doin-this-shit-50-years mechanic complain about everything. These days, he's the kind of guy who'd complain if you hung him with a new rope. Sad, because he started out as an honest mechanic with good tips and closeups of repairs I might one day have to do. I want to see you wrench, Ray, and tell dad jokes. Not bitch about everything.

You skipped the part where they contacted the customer, thoroughly explained the situation, waited for the customer's decision, then acted in accordance with the customer's wishes as far as what to do with the customer's vehicle.
Thank you for this comment,

I‚Äôm a fairly reasonable guy, If it was over the estimate by a few hundred bucks and no one called me I wouldn‚Äôt have said a word but $1300‚Ä¶no.
By law, in my state, it‚Äôs required. If a shop exceeds 10% of the estimate given, the customer has to sign off on it prior to the work being performed. Or the customer doesn‚Äôt have to pay for it. 
Source: My states attorney generals website and online state law code book.
Bro, that guy don't know what he's talking about.

I'm not a mechanic but a dealership advisor and former lube and tire bitch and my entire job is to call you and say "hey, while we are in here we noticed x, want us to get that done to?" They absolutely dropped the ball and I wouldn't be paying an additional 1300$ for their mistake.

They legally need your approval for the work and if you didn't text them affirmative or sign off on it then they did not have it.
I‚Äôm sorry, but if my shop didn‚Äôt CALL me, and ask for my permission to proceed, I‚Äôd sue them. I just recently had a similar situation happen. They were supposed to go and replace the oil pressure  switch, but that ended up not being the problem. The oil pump needed replaced. Do you think the shop just did it without asking!? No. They called me, told me what was going on, gave me a NEW estimate for the additional work, and asked for my permission to continue work, which of course I agreed to. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt the oil pump either, and the motor was trashed. So it got traded in and got a new car. Moral of the story is, I was ASKED before additional work was performed.
It's called an example, like when they say "For example"
 
Multiple places that aren't in Canada have been used in this thread to give examples about their local experience. Are you being intentionally obtuse?
Okay? Calling corporate doesn‚Äôt matter if it was a local mechanic. If it was Bob‚Äôs auto repair corporate would be Bob‚Äôs auto repair. That‚Äôs all I was saying. I didn‚Äôt know it was a dealership. Calm the fuck down.
I wish high labor rates translated into high pay for the actual mechanics. Main reason I stopped wrenching professionally
Well, he does fuck his rubes constantly‚Ä¶
Mild confusion. I believe AdmirableLeopard wasn‚Äôt talking about this scenario. They were responding to Chiggachamp whose read of the scenario is wrong, because they left out the part where the mechanic should notify the customer and get approval.
Yeah dude, check the laws of your state. You definitely shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for the extra work unless you got a new estimate with the detailed cost explained. The shop I go to makes you sign the work order to show you were notified.
That's a completely different scenario. You're talking about the difference between an external oil pressure switch and an internal oil pump...massive difference in repair cost. I'm not saying the shop didn't fail at communicating better, but the repair was very likely needed at the end of the day. If the customer declined at that point, they would still be out the original 5k and still have issues. The most appropriate thing to do would be to fix the additional components while you are already in there. Doing it later on would end up costing the customer even more, and not doing it at all would likely void the warranty on the first 5k of work. But hey, customer is always right. Let's make sure the tech doesn't get paid for doing the work properly the first time!
I noticed a lot of examples given are from the US and therefore completely irrelevant to OP, who clearly stated he they are from Canada.

If you can convince me in why this example would be relevant in any way, please do and I'll apologize.

Posted shop labor rate at my old dealership was $96/hr with techs making at MOST 25% of that rate. Shop rate went up $15, with NO adjustment to tech pay. The principal decided he wanted to build a new store, and bumped the rate because service is the absolute lifeblood of any dealership. Lost a lot of good help - A techs with YEARS of certifications and schooling, which they replaced with B and C techs fresh out of vocational high school.  And then a vacation to Paris to really rub everyone's noses in it.
Sarcasm.  So hard to tell in written format.
But that isn‚Äôt YOUR decision to make. It‚Äôs not your car, it‚Äôs not your property, it‚Äôs not your money. Whether the repair was necessary or even required makes absolutely no difference. It MUST be communicated to the customer, who would then make the decision. I would personally sue any shop for VANDALISM if they made any modification/repair to my vehicle without permission. If it requires additional repair, it‚Äôs not your ‚Äúright‚Äù to perform that work on my property without my permission. Assuming it was a required repair, that doesn‚Äôt mean YOUR shop is required to do the work. I could, and would be within my right, to have that vehicle towed somewhere else to have that work completed or for a second opinion. The OP would be absolutely crazy if they paid that bill, I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt. And like I said, id sue them for vandalism if they fought the bill as they had no right to touch my vehicle other than what was already agreed to.
A lot of business practices are the same or similar across the globe. Just looking at this thread, there were two users, one who is from Finland and one giving prices in euros(possible it could be Finland as well) who described a similar practice in their countries. Also, a lot of governments have consumer protection laws that are the same or similar. It makes markets work better together. OP is from Canada which is the US 's friendly northern neighbor with the world's longest border and the US is Canada's largest trading partner(this means lots of trade and more reason to have similar standards and practices). OP is using a Ford dealership mechanic. Ford is headquartered in the US. Their practices in Canada are going to be very similar to their practices in the US. Certainly not completely irrelevant
That‚Äôs literally what I said. I said ‚Äúif it‚Äôs a local mechanic then the they ARE corporate.‚Äù So calling corporate at bobs auto repair would do absolutely nothing, because they don‚Äôt need to abide by anyone‚Äôs rules but their own. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre not understanding? No one got snappy with you. I was LITERALLY saying if they aren‚Äôt a corporate franchised dealer then there is no corporate to call. I was unaware they went to a Ford dealer because nowhere in the description did they say that. 

Again, calm the fuck down. Not sure why you‚Äôre getting so bent out of a shape about a general comment dude. Take your own advice and go back to my original comment with zero knowledge that they went to a Ford dealer.
You know what, you have the right to try and sue. That's totally your choice. If their shop gave them an "ESTIMATE", they can legally charge more for the repair if additional parts are required. Generally, 10-20% is considered within reason. Yes, $1300 is a bit more than 20%...but if the repairs were absolutely necessary, it will likely hold up in court. That puts the OP out even more money in legal fees. Again, an estimate is different from a quote. This is also an estimate that was made for internal repairs, not something that could be visibly seen until the work was started. If they put their signature on an estimate, I doubt they have much legal ground. Their question was whether or not it was legal, and it likely was. Regardless of anyone's personal opinions, estimates can change once work has begun and that is completely legal within reason.
It just sounds like you misread (or didn't read) the part where OP asked if this is allowed in Canada and you're doubling down right now.  
Or it's just plain r/USdefaultism.
wtf is this guy on lmao
Maaaaan shut the fuck up.

(If you get this, it‚Äôs been a loooong time Sav‚Ä¶)
They are not corporate, but its ok...there are no Corporate Ford repair shops..  But I can see where we are confusing.. The whole "franchising" and "licensing" of the Ford Corp name and logo, I got ya.. We are wasting brain cells here though lol.. And we are not helping anyone.. But its been fun, nice to meet you..
Tommybuilt T7
Sharing this here since the negative posts seemingly get taken down in Facebook groups. This is not a troll post. I am simply sharing the facts. The pistol does work with Fiocchi Defense Dynamics, but not the Hornady even though Tom himself said that‚Äôs what he uses to test fire the guns. I‚Äôve heard some people have been through hundreds of rds without an issue and I‚Äôm happy for them. I on the other hand did not have the same experience. This is the short version of my experience with this gun so far. 
$3k to beta test is rough ü§£
Five Guys money for a pre-packaged gas station hamburger.
The downvote copes are insane. 3k is crazy for these results
Isn‚Äôt Tommy Built known for QC issues with their previous clones?
Everyone sackrides tb so much, but I've seen nothing but issues with his g36 clones through friends that own them. I wouldn't touch one of his firearms with a 10 foot pole.
Definitely rough as fuck for a gun as expensive as this. 

Psa quality without the psa price
Damn so many people were excited. I hope you enjoy it still
Man I hope PSA doesn‚Äôt use this as a benchmark for their 5.7
Make sure the admin of the FB group doesn‚Äôt see this, he might shit his pants
Everyone‚Äôs been jerking off to these hard‚Ä¶ I would absolutely not buy one and I‚Äôve said that since the beginning lol. 

They must ship with a vile of copium
The keltec at home
Genuine question. If stuff was falling off at the gun store, why not send it back?
What a shame I am sorry man
Lol you pissed off that boot licker sirris sirris on the facebook group got is that guy shoved so far up tommy ass hole you think he speaks for tom half the time he made a post about you on the facebook group calling you a piece of shit and what not and then deleted it like a bitch
Couple things:

1. What a piece of shit.
2. Thanks for the honest review.
3. These are good for the space imo. Shows other companies and HK how much people actually want an MP7.

Honestly, I think this gun is getting so hyped because people can't bare to call their $4k purchase "bad". But to point number 3, I do think these are a good thing. I'd love a reliable MP7 clone, and these only push others toward that.
For that price to be a tester is rough
I myself signed up to purchase the gun. However, after 30 yrs of collecting, shooting competitively etc.. I've learned not to just jump on the bandwagon. Too many guns come out and their 1st iteration has way too many bugs. It's the same thing with 1st gen cars, let the masses chime in with their findings, problems etc. I've been bitten by a few in earlier years, but not now. When the hype, because at the end of it, it is hype...common sense, patience and wisdom will hopefully let you not make further mistakes, least not as many. 

Will perhaps buy one at a later date, new of course because people let go of these types of things when they're just fed up with the issues, and then you unsuspectingly purchase a gun with problems. Perhaps, a 2nd gen, with hopefully improvements made. Have fun everyone and keep on shooting.
I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious these are having problems at this point.
This was my buddy‚Äôs experience as well. His is going back to Tom
Unfortunately, to anyone actually paying attention, this felt kinda inevitable.

It's the first batch of a US made MP7 clone from a small shop that has consistently had numerous issues with the first runs of other designs. If I bought this, it would be with the understanding that it would almost certainly need some work at some point, maybe even upgrades as the design was refined.

That's why I held off personally. I believe Tommy will get the kinks with these ironed out...eventually, but until then, I'm, happy to let others work through that stage without me lol.

The people on both sides of this are wild though. Rabid TP7 owners and prospectives downvoting and denying reports of issues, and PSA copers that would never buy one of these, proper HK or otherwise, sperging all over the place about a handgun in a shell, yet again. Fun stuff /s
Guess I ain‚Äôt getting that
I‚Äôm so glad to be a PS90 fanboy right now lol. Just need to SBR it lol
[removed]
Jeeeez‚Ä¶ WTF!?
I made a post in a really popular fb group about how these are a failure and I was crucified for it and even got the run through from Tom himself. The post is still up though and I‚Äôve added this too it.
Well well well
u/TommyBuilt
Glad I waited and didn‚Äôt buy it drop night
Careful, the fem, I mean fanbois will be coming after you! Sirris and omega are gonna be calling you out for having a limp wrist and just a TB hater. Tommy, you would be better off telling those shills to stop blocking on your behalf! LOL and my fav, "you are doing it wrong" but no manual to tell you how to do it right! WTF
oof
I love seeing hypebeasts getting their shit that they paid a retarded price for and watching it not work lmaooo 

He got yall, AGAIN.
I know a few people with the 36ks and none of them run more than 4-5 rounds. Have been saying for a long time these guns aren‚Äôt worth the hassle.
There is a sucker born every minute
Man that's beyond disappointing. I was on the t7 side of things when we saw it at SHOT next to the PSA whatever-it's-called because it looked much closer. 

I'm not a huge mp7 guy but since you can't realistically get a real one I'm all for clones for the folks that want them, but this just blows.

Such a shame.
[deleted]
I feel the anguish you have comrade. Even though I don‚Äôt have a cock in the fight I know what a broken man sounds like.
Damn that fucking sucks
I mean... Tommy built is doing insane stuff that NOBODY else is doing. And how many of there are there out there?
I have a TommyBuilt TG36 which I have set up to be like a G36E with the HK AR-15 mag well. So far my rifle has been very reliable and I am happy it is considering what I paid for it. 

It is unfortunate that you're having all these issues. Luckily, from what I have heard, but not needed, is that Tom Bostic's customer service is pretty good and I would hope he would fix this for you if you sent it back.
[deleted]
TBT does such a great job bringing MP5s back to life. At least on mine anyway. Sad to see that quality didn‚Äôt extend onto the T7s
I wonder if he lubed it or if it's being broken in dry. If that's lubed I'd be sending it back for work.
Call me cynical, but I really don‚Äôt get the point in buying $4k semi auto PCCs. At that point why not just save some extra coin for a reising or a MAC that actually goes full auto?
Tommy built just raping yall pockets ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. The hustle is real
Ooff, would not buy one of these
Took a page out of sigs book
And just like that TB‚Äôs gun reputation is killed off. All for the excitement of releasing these too early. I hope it was worth it ‚Ä¶
I knew that anime girl couldn‚Äôt be the only one
Yes after the t36/tg36 debacle, I will not buy anything from TB. In my honest opinion to pay 700$ for a t36 receiver and then getting the notification I had to send it back and spend the extra $$$ for the th36, I was done. It‚Äôs plastic, it doesn‚Äôt cost that much to manufacture a plastic receiver. A responsible owner/manufacture would have sent off to the tech branch and had an approval before selling. They‚Äôre cheaper clones of course, but The guy shoulda have done his due diligence. He F‚ÄôD up he shoulda owned it
[removed]
From what ive seen this is just what you can expect from tommy built guns
That is the type of gun that you buy so you can say you own one.  Your really not supposed to use it.
You know the worst thing about this gun? It‚Äôs ugly as sin.
Had a TBT UMP45 and it was absolute trash. Wouldn‚Äôt cycle more than 5 rounds. TBT kept throwing different parts at it to try to get it run and it just made worse. Ruined a grail gun for me.
My buddy bought a T36 and it was a jam o matic. Not seen many good results for TB guns as of late.
Seeing all these issues sure makes me glad I didn‚Äôt order from the first batch. I'm sure Tommy will make it right, but this should be the standard for a 3.5k gun.
I always thought they weren't work $3k and now I REALLY think they aren't work $3k
It‚Äôs a quasi reverse engineered novelty.  What else did you expect?
I was downvoted to oblivion for telling people that Tommy Built guns are absolute DOG SHIT. Stop giving this clown your money.
Part of me still wants their XM8 tho
Shit dude.. I know the pain. I hope he gets you right.
Oof!  Keltec cp33 mo betta
What happened? I remember hearing about how nice their shit was for years and suddenly in the last year or two it's gone to shit.
Have you contacted Tommy Built?

The ‚Äúput it back, we have a MP7 at home‚Äù
Saw the video you made, its a shame I was really hoping it would be good
I almost snagged one but I was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype. Looks like I may have made the right choice in waiting.
I understand why everyone wants an MP7, I do. But if you step back and think about it, logical. IMO I'd rather have an MP5K and call it a day. Reliable and ammo is available all over.
Waste of money
Looks like a hack operation
Joseph seed breaking down weapons now
Meanwhile, my LC Charger SBR MP7 for poors runs like a champ
Come on guys mom said it‚Äôs my turn!!!
Ha Ha!
Such a niche novelty gun that we‚Äôd never see in the U.S. without Tommy, sure some issues should‚Äôve been sorted out. But who tf buys the first batch ever with expectations of perfection? Idiots, that‚Äôs who.
Makes you feel slightly  better when Kel-Tec does this to you with a $700 firearm :(
Lol yup!
Due to Itar and other extra costs they are even 10k here in Switzerland. Honestly if i really want one i will save up the extra 10k and get a H&K Mp7 but i probably never will because i'm not a hk guy
Sounds like a sig product lmao
Yeah,  it he volunteered.
Closer to 4k after tax and what not.
I don‚Äôt have any personal use with any of their shit, but I think the general consensus is theyre to be treated as toys and not tools because their build quality isn‚Äôt nearly as rugged as genuine HK‚Äôs. They‚Äôre more so to scratch that itch.
Yes, but at least he‚Äôs pretty good about fixing any issues. I had a problem with a new tg36 and he had a new part in the mail a couple hours later. I don‚Äôt think there was ever an argument that his products are anything above range toy quality though.
Ive had like 4 or 5 tommybuilt guns over the years. Me and 99% of tommybuilt owners do not shoot their guns enough to see their problems. You‚Äôre expecting people who buy 5 thousand dollar guns to actually RUN THEM lol.
I saw someone on FB point out a flaw in one of the polymer frames from a production pic and jokingly ask if they could get a discount on the ‚Äúblem‚Äù, and Tom replied with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt expect perfection‚Äù.

That‚Äôs what turned me off on one of these.  I get that it‚Äôs a small shop and they‚Äôre bringing something brand new and highly coveted to market, but I do expect damn near perfection for an almost $4k firearm in a 160 unit production run.  I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to spend that much to play the flaw lottery.
I‚Äôm waiting for the PSA 5.7 knockoff.
PSA guns are better than this
Hey now my PSA Sabre has been nothing but reliable.
I've yet to have a psa product in that bad of shape.
This is a 4.6 tho
He already did, I already got banned and posted his comments in this thread below.
What is the group fb called?
Most people who buy these are probably going to put these in their safe, or on a gun wall, and take them out every now and then for pictures. It‚Äôs like the ‚Äúrich man‚Äôs‚Äùversion of a red anodized AR.
Yeah I really don‚Äôt get the appeal here.
I honestly don't get it.  I see all the posts of these, and people are just foaming at the mouth with how "awesome" they are.  


All I see is a too small (I'm a domesticated bigfoot) pistol that shoots a stupidly expensive round (aren't the "cheap" ones nearly a buck a round?)...and you pay a premium for it. 

Would I buy an MP7 if I could get a real one, despite the expensive ammo?  Possibly.  But then you'd be getting HK quality...not whatever this is.
My Farrow FT-7 Cp-33 seems to function way better.  Come on PSA.
So at the store the first issues I had seemed to be small and relatively easy to fix under the assumption that the gun would shoot just fine. Obviously then getting home to find out it only works with half the ammo I purchased in preparation for getting the gun was a kick in the nuts.

I have spoken to Tom and he said to send it back and he would take a look at it, he was apologetic about the whole thing as well. My reluctance is, if this gun made it out of his hands and into mine with these issues and didn't even make it through 5 rounds of the supposed ammo he uses to test them, why would I send it back? He clearly didnt notice the problems it had, or maybe he did and chose to send it out anyway. Which would lead me to believe that I would be wasting my time sending it in especially when he has another drop coming soon, and probably several others coming back to him along with mine. 

This may be irrational to think this way but from the get go this entire process has been unorganized and TB has been terrible about communicating website issues, late orders, and updates. I still haven't received the two grips I ordered in May that were in stock at the time I ordered them. Today I got an email that they had finally shipped but only after several emails back and forth between Tom and I to figure out where my orders went.
Even broke if he wasn‚Äôt happy with it he could turn around and sell it on GunBroker for a tidy profit. 

And yes I know, in the business of dealing firearms, blah blah and stuff. Point is, even broken it‚Äôs worth more than retail right now.
Oh no he deleted the post?? Haha thats a shame honestly I was looking forward to the comments on it and what feedback he would get. I wont be deleting any of my posts... I guess that makes him the bitch then lol.
Very well said! And I 100% agree, I'm willing to take the backlash from the company and or their loyal fans by being honest about the issues I have, if it means that the industry as a whole is able to progress. Whether that be TB or HK or PTR I am indifferent. But these were a flop in my opinion and there is a lot that can be learned from it. I have no problem being honest about something regardless of the price. The more I pay the more pissed I am if it does work lol. But I understand that people may be embarrassed to tell the truth about something they spent an entire months rent and then some on.
The problem with this gun, is there will be probably be no second generation, Tommy has said he only has parts to build a limited number, and does not expect more.
Lmaoooo
He is actually the one that‚Äôs a little bitch
That number is probably more like 5000 and they probably don‚Äôt get on social media. No one wants to touch this gun now. Not that you should have to do this but I wonder if running it suppressed would help with the FTF issues.
There is a lot of coping by people, especially in the HKPro forums, about Tom's stuff. They say some heinous stuff like "you should feel lucky to even have a T7!"
Could you paste the link to that in here I would like to check it out. That reason exactly is why I posted this here.
What fb group?
Dude, no matter what it is there‚Äôs not really any reason to enjoy seeing people get their hard earned money taken from them.
Had an early kit and receiver (eventually upgraded due to the ATF) ran without issues(1000 rds)  but sold it when I needed some moving money. Problem is probably who was making the us parts more than Tommy‚Ä¶ ‚Äúgsg9‚Äù which also makes the us 416 uppers‚Ä¶ some of their stuff runs and some needs some tweaking sadly.
My 36k is excellent, even with the receiver swap it‚Äôs still excellent.
Plastic HK guns and roller guns are two different animals. The tooling, parts, blueprints, etc are all out there floating around. So many countries have access to them and improve them. Nobody is making g36 or mp7 clones, and Hk is not outsourcing their tooling for them.
I agree. It‚Äôs really unfortunate. I own 3 TB products that I‚Äôm generally happy with and had plans to pick up a T7. But with the way complaints are being handled on social media‚Ä¶.I have lost faith. 

And if ‚ÄúSirrus Sirrus‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work for Tom, then Tom should come out and flatly say that his comments are not a reflection of the company‚Äôs stance.  Because calling people idiots and morons (and banning them!) because their $3500 gun doesn‚Äôt function as expected‚Ä¶..is a TERRIBLE look for the company.
I don‚Äôt think you truly understand what happened with that T36 debacle. He got full approval from the ATF for the T36. Some other importer tried claiming that they were easily converted to full auto like the SL8s out there. So the ATF rescinded their approval for the T36 and forced him to do a recall even though they couldn‚Äôt replicate any machine gun ability with the receiver unless they did a lot of alteration. Tom could have very well just said, oh well and let end users just have their guns destroyed or face charges. Instead, he offered up the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù in better material with the added reinforcements that the ATF approved (again). That upcharge was for better materials and the labor to swap all of your existing parts over. It‚Äôs a one man shop, he alone took on over $100k fighting it in court. Everyone that had a tax stamp on their T36 didn‚Äôt pay a dime for the upgrade. So he at least helped in that sense. Another issue people seem to forget is that all of the TG36 and TMP moldings and parts were from Todd Bailey, Tom simply got them working as best he could out of the parts they sold him. This whole T7 thing., everyone assumes he‚Äôs a large manufacturer with the HK blueprints and already had the tools to do this. He started from scratch to bring us something we otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have. He created the mold and everything and does all of the work to build these things. So in essence, he redesigned a machine pistol to be semi auto only and had to do it from scratch on every single part. It‚Äôs a generation 1 firearm, of course there will be flaws. One thing about Tom and his service though, is that he will always do whatever he can to make it right.
He told me your experience was ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in the group I was referring too. I send you a dm.
Tell that to the guys that gobbled up all the mags and parts lmao
A gun that can cycle for ~4K usd
TB's guns have always had questionable quality.
I have, yes. He was apologetic and offered to take the gun back. I made a very long youtube video about the entire process and why I am waiting to send it back to him. All I am doing here is sharing the issues I had with the firearm out of the box. I believe if I sent it in Tom would probably do his best to fix them. But I don't think it would be a quick process. Instead I am going to run the gun on the ammo it does like and try to see if I can resolve the issue on my own as I am sure Tom already has a few on his plate. If I cannot figure it out then I will gladly send it in. By no means am I shitting on Tom personally or his business. I am simply sharing the facts.
Most of us wanting the T7 probably already have a MP5
I never once claimed to expect perfection. But buying a brand new car, you would expect it to at least get you from point A to B. Or, in this case, make it through a full magazine of the ammo it was tested on without a malfunction or maybe just a couple. I have a very high tolerance for minor things. Had this gun shot fine, I would have likely never made the post. But in combination with very obvious issues before even making it out of the gun store. I felt the need to share my experience in hopes that others would be able to use the information. And determine whether or not they want to be a part of this R&D process that some of us are seemingly now roped into.
I remember I had Kel-Tec nightmares for years. Waking up in the middle of the night with a broken gun in my dreams.
Is there a place where you can shoot machine gun in Switzerland? Are you allowed to do any sort of tactical training? Cheers
It didn't shoot by itself
$4.5K plus tax (and stamps because you have to put the iconic stock on it) for the guys who picked it up with the suppressor.
You still pay tax? Find a free state friend.
Yeah, I heard that if you used an SL8 or a USC to have TommyBuilt covert to a G36/UMP, respectively, they are more reliable than his versions.
I have almost 10k into my Hk Mr762 and I actually run that. 6k in my Mr556 and I beat the shit out of that one.
Only 160 at that price and this crap quality? Man that‚Äôs embarrassing. At that production amount they better be near flawless.
Yeah wrong, Tommy.

If I‚Äôm paying north of 2k, I expect motherfucking perfection.

:Edit: holy shit, I made this comment thinking his first prod batch was like 500. 1-fucking-60 units, and he couldn‚Äôt take the time to thoroughly QC every single one with a magnifying glass?

I‚Äôd rather tell someone their wait time just increased or refund over sending out poor work.

P.s. if OP is reading this: no excuses for TG making those ammo statements, but I think the issue is carrier weight. That being said is either bouncing around or just lacking energy to strip and chamber a new round.

I think it‚Äôs Demo Ranch, but some dude had to mod his full auto for similar reasons (ftc, fte). You might be in the same boat.
Hashtag me too
If you're okay tightening a couple of screws, I'd bet >99% of them are. They had some issues YEARS ago, and every issue since seems like confirmation bias to me. 

Sure, they're not as good or smooth as other brands, but they're not "bad" by any means.
I‚Äôve yet to even SEE bad PSA quality anymore. I just assume people who chuck that into random conversation kept up with and shot their firearms at some point in their life, and now no longer do.
Potato, tomato
So, you agree that 4.6 is worse?

Too many stories of guys in country with select fire mp7s coming out to say the 4.6 is garbage
These people need to find a different niche to base their entire personalities on
Like one of the biggest appeals to the HK MP7 is that it‚Äôs a super refined, well built and engineered sub machine gun built with high quality parts.

This is like paying 3-4k something that just kind of looks like one and is 99% less reliable. Like I couldn‚Äôt imagine paying that much for a gun and needing a paper clip to hold it together on the first day
video games and movies
I‚Äôve shit a real Mp7 a number of times, it‚Äôs a slick gun I can see why people in the real world like them, FA is very controllable. In a pure semi auto role, especially given the price of ammo and mags I just don‚Äôt see it. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to get one in his next drop before they sell out within 30 seconds you‚Äôre in for $5400 if you get the stock, grip, Silencer (a must in my opinion) and the two tax stamps needed. If you want to buy some 40 round mags they are currently $200 assuming they are in stock. So buying an extra three mags and you‚Äôre at $6,000 to get a setup ideal for actually using the gun a lot. This isn‚Äôt factoring in an optic, light and laser. 

Then you‚Äôre around 90 cents a round for range ammo, which is around what I pay for my 77g OTM 5.56 ammo.
Well and you never know if he pulls a dead-air and leaves you in the dark without your gun for months.
Had great communication and turn around time on a SL-8 with TB. Making an assumption about his customer service/repairs without actually utilizing them is fairly unreasonable.
I get it, but that's also how companies think they can get away with shit like this.
Yup that dude is the ultimate cock sucker like i have never seen someone so attached to another dudes cock than him its fucking ridiculous
False. He said that he only has a set number of parts to build about 500 for now, but does intend to ramp it up once things get flowing. The only thing he is somewhat stuck to a specific amount of, are the stocks and magazines because they are sourced from Germany.
Banning folks with legitimate complaints is a very bad look. In the long run, this makes TB and his shill, Sirris, look guilty AF.
I shot it with and without a can as well as with the factory MD and same issues unfortunately.
Dude they ride his dick so hard there it‚Äôs insufferable
When you willingly let a company fuck you despite their history just to say you have the latest and greatest (debatable), that is a choice you make and the outcome is on you. This dude has the money. He‚Äôll be aight. He‚Äôll get his views and probably recoup the money he lost by buying another one of Tommy Built‚Äôs bullshit science projects.

You play stupid games you win stupid prizes. You play pussy, you get fucked.  It‚Äôs the way of life.
Well I'm banned from the group now so he controls the narrative of what gets said. That to me sounds more like fake news than the comments I was leaving. And ok i'll check it out. Thank you for letting me know!
It‚Äôs only worth what people are willing to pay.  4K for an untested, quasi clone?  Ok for some.  Anyone who purchased this plastic disaster should have known it was a novelty for LARPing.
I wouldn‚Äôt spend more money on very expensive ammo trying to get my very expensive gun to work that should have ran out of the box
I respect that. I do find it weird though that you‚Äòre not just sending it in. Tommy is the most qualified to fix it and it would only be fair to all parties involved to have the issue resolved as fast as possible. One way or another I hope you‚Äòll get a working product at the end‚úåÔ∏è
buy an SD then üòÜ
You signed up for the R&D when you purchased the FIRST batch in existence. There was no R&D other than the prototype. That was obvious. It‚Äôs good information but instead of coming off snobbish and upset in these videos like a kid, layout the issues in an email to the company so they can 1. Fix yours and any others like them and 2. Ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen again. All your antagonistic video did was throw shade on a small company trying to give us the HK‚Äôs we‚Äôve never had in the states and that‚Äôs bs. Could easily ruin the company and any future builds.
I‚Äôm glad they finally got them sorted out. I have a flawless RDB, RFB Gen 2, KS7, P50 and 2 CP33‚Äôs. The first CP33 I had to send back since it was one of the first ones but they upgraded it and I‚Äôve had zero issues since.
If you own them you can get a permit for the day to shoot them. Normal tactical training is not illegal in any case. In most cases you are safety restricted
Actually there are reports of these discharging when you manipulate the backplate with the hammer locked lol
My state is free in terms of gun stuff but ass for tax lol
https://www.ttb.gov/firearms/rrd-faet-background

I have bad news for you
I started, with a Tommy made, then sold it for a sl8 conversion.  Didn‚Äôt shoot the Tommy made enough to tell about reliability, but just the action alone is waaaayy smoother on the conversion vs the Tommy built. 

I‚Äôm just waiting for this mp7 fad to die off so he can start working on conversions again, sitting on a usc and ump parts kit.
i had probably 10-12k in my G28 and i shot 15 rounds through it before i sold it
Yeah, I assumed they would really be going over every single one to make sure they are flawless. With production that low and a price that high it‚Äôs wild not to.
Which screws should be tightened?
They have some issues for sure. Mainly dagger and jackl products. And even those are minor.The pa15s and pa10s are solid af. My pa15 is rock solid.
You‚Äôre absolutely right. If HK themselves released a semi-auto MP7 for the US market I‚Äôd be first in line to hand them my $$. Not this though.
These things are like the kit cars that look like a Lamborghini Diablo but are actually a Pontiac Fiero under the flashy exterior.
At that point might as well buy an airsoft replica.
I don't personally think that he is the type to do it intentionally, I do however think he needs help and will likely be back logged quite a bit. I would rather wait and let him get back on track and find a solution to the issues rather than subject myself to more of the R&D process I am regrettably already a part of. If he reached out to me and said you are the only one with this issue I need your gun back to fix the problem for everyone I would do it. But I don't believe I am the only one and he probably already has guns back to him with the same issue. So for the time being I will put up with the issues until I see them resolved and run the gun on the ammo it does like while fixing the other issues myself. And maybe I can do my own R&D and find a solution that I can communicate to others and help fix it.
There is much more to the story than what I wrote in this comment. From zero communication on tracking or status updates on my orders to then losing them, then finding them, then explaining that I made it difficult by placing too many orders because I ordered two grips at the respective times they came in stock and thats why its taken nearly 6 weeks to ship out products I purchased that were in stock at the time of purchase. Feel free to watch my full YT video if you're looking for further explanation, but I believe my thought process to be fairly reasonable based on the experience I have had thus far. I am happy that you had a good experience with your products but we can agree to disagree that I did not receive the same experience with mine.
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right, it just is the nature of scarcity. He has a rare and desirable object in any condition. 

Side note, I‚Äôve been busy as shit since 2020 and haven‚Äôt shot anything since then. But I have purchased a lot of guns. Any one of them could have problems and I wouldn‚Äôt know yet. So we may be seeing just the tip of the iceberg with the T7s if there are people like me out there that haven‚Äôt even shot them yet.
That's just FB groups lol, they're cancerous.
I had never really been a part of that forum until recently and suddenly realized how much of an echo chamber it is.
I understand that, this being the finished product that made it to my hands though doesn't make me super confident in his standards for whether or not a gun is good to go out the door if that makes sense. I replicated Toms exact testing process with the same malfunction twice in the first 9 rounds first time at the 6th and second on the 9th rd. I did this in its factory configuration to be fair. With a SF RC2 it FTF every single round out of the box. All the other cosmetic and mechanical issues aside just getting it to shoot has been a task. So for me I would rather try some remedies myself and in the process I may learn the gun more. Tom may be the most qualified but to me he has seemingly cared the least based on the QC that I experienced out of the box.

Been there. Done that. üòÇ
Copying from TB's website description exactly:

"The long-awaited T7 pistol, a testament to precision and quality, is almost here! These are meticulously crafted, injection-molded glass-filled polymer receivers proudly manufactured in the USA."

Please tell me where it says I am signing up for a R&D program while paying the same proce as future customers whom will get to enjoy the fruits of your labors fixing all of these issues, oh and they will pay the same price as you..

I fail to see what part of my video was snobbish or childish. I spoke clearly and frankly and told the truth. I also spoke to Tom prior to posting any of these videos. I don't believe my post will be the nail in the coffin for TB. If anything, it would be Tom's decision to send firearms like mine out of the door and into the customers' hands in the condition I shared mine to be in. I clearly stated in the post I am simply sharing facts about my experience. I could go online and act like a child and purely talk shit as many of his fans and associates have done thus far. Instead, I chose to present the problems with my product clearly and plainly.
I LOVE Keltec ... But real fans know not to buy any "new model" for the first 6 months, at least... When the people that paid TWICE retail are beta testing them..
A one day pass?
I moved to a state with no income tax, sales tax, or gun restrictions (including having constitutional carry). It's made life a lot better. I save about 22k a year in taxes.
That‚Äôs like having a super model girlfriend and not fucking her.
I oversimplified, but it's not like "always tighten the handguard screws."

Most of the complaints regarding PSA guns are just usually fixable with really simple tools at home. It's stuff that shouldn't make it out of the factory and would've been caught by QA.

I've seen loose handguard, loose gas block, over-torqued barrel nuts, unstaked (or poorly staked) gas keys and cattle nuts, etc. It's just a bunch of little things that might make your gun fail that are easy to fix at home. Rarely do they send anything out with a real fatal flaw. Again: not okay, but not the flaming garbage they're portrayed as.
Like I ‚Äúrespect the drip‚Äù of independent builders with a go getter attitude. But when you‚Äôre charging almost 4 grand for a gun that has about a 98% malfunction rate that was said to be tested before shipped, you lose all of the credibility in the world to me. 

TBH. I‚Äôve said from the start they look cheap, so sucks to see the people that bought them are finding out where their money really went.

Like look at all the super well built affordable MP5 clones out there. It‚Äôs definitely possible but this ain‚Äôt it.
True. 

All social media is cancer.
Man, that sucks. Say about HK what you want but them having factory lemons is basically unheard of.
First time buying something new? Anyone who has bought anything even remotely new knows you let the first iteration roll out before you go grab the new one to prevent being apart of the recall group. That‚Äôs goes for iPhones, Androids, Guns, Cars literally anything man. You got excited, gambled, experienced problems and threw a tantrum in the first video. Your body language and blank stares at the camera show discontent. We can clearly see that, whether your words reflected the same energy is irrelevant. Have a good night.
basicly yes
The IRS has been sending mail to your old address
Damn. Texas?
Sometimes i just want the company that an escort gives me
Except most of the MP5 clones (MKE and POF built ones) are made by former HK contract suppliers so they had access to real HK tools and drawings.¬†

They weren‚Äôt reverse engineered from a parts kit by a guy in Florida.¬†
Well, somebody has to be the one to purchase the first run of all those products and put the information out there. So that the manufacturer can make the necessary improvements and future customers can choose to spend their money wisely. If that makes me the idiot for being the one to test the products and inform others so people like yourself can enjoy them in later iterations, then consider me just that. Goodnight to you as well. ü§ôüèª
Nope, NH. The cost of buying a house wasn't bad either compared to my home state.
Texas has sales tax
Furthermore- they're great now, but back when I built my MP5 from a German parts kit, the clones were out of spec garbage. (Research Special Weapons MP5 clones.) It took a while for them to come around.
Options were few for a while there. Don't know if I'd have put as much blood and swear into building my own of a hood clone was available at a reasonable price.
That is very correct, which is what makes them far more appealing. Quality made and cost effective.
Small nitpick, but NH doesn't allow hunting with a suppressor. Anymore, I hunt exclusively with a suppressor.
I'm in Maine..... Might be time for a move lol
Not correct. NH has allowed hunting with a suppressor since 2016. https://www.northeastshooters.com/xen/threads/hunting-with-suppressors-in-nh-is-legal-as-of-6-10-2016.311309/
Fair, I didn't know that cause I've only ever used shot guns and never nutted up for a 12gauge suppressor. Fair criticism, thank you.
I love parking my camper at OOB for a week but wouldn't be moving up there any time soon. Just seems expensive for the services you get. Got to bring my own trash to the dump tho lol
Suppressed 458 socom SBR for deer is incredible inside 200 yards.
I thought a suppressed 12 gauge would be too long, but a buddy claims he barely notices except when hunting from a crowded blind.
I, too, have yet to make that addition. I looked at the Salvo, and when I got to the steel shot restrictions with chokes, I kind of gave up.
Dude is wrong. NH has allowed hunting with suppressors since 2016. https://www.northeastshooters.com/xen/threads/hunting-with-suppressors-in-nh-is-legal-as-of-6-10-2016.311309/
OCL is savage
Otter Creek Labs just dropped their not surefire surefire hub mount
Straight from the product description of the ShoreFyre:

> This mount has been in the works for over a year with a lot of testing, it can easily handle any abuse you throw at it and are 100% QC checked for alignment. That means we take every single mount, put it in a suppressor we know to be true, put it on a muzzle device that we know to be true and check it with an alignment rod on a barrel we know to be true. Every ‚Äì single ‚Äì mount. I say this because we have seen a surprising variance in the CR2 muzzle device tolerances and there‚Äôs obviously variance with suppressors. If you put this thing on your gun and it doesn‚Äôt rod check good, don‚Äôt email us about it. We‚Äôve already checked it. It‚Äôs your muzzle device, barrel or suppressor so email those people.

>I have to also say I hate this mounting system. In my opinion and based on what we have seen over the last year of testing, it‚Äôs just not very good. I think buying this mount is a poor decision. Not because the HUB mounts are bad but because the mounting system and muzzle devices they‚Äôre designed around is bad. You can only polish a turd so much. I think it would be a better use of your time and money to invest in a different mounting system. But as I‚Äôve said before it‚Äôs my job to make what people want and that doesn‚Äôt necessarily always line up with what I like or what I think is best. It‚Äôs long, it‚Äôs heavy, it‚Äôs expensive, it‚Äôll carbon lock but hey at least you can use the same muzzle device that the military uses for when you‚Äôre knee deep in the shit in your boogerloo fantasies or whatever. So here you go, you‚Äôre welcome.

Andrew is throwing some mad shade at SureFire.
Hell, I wish they‚Äôd come out with a ‚Äúchemo‚Äù mount so I can quit waiting on DA to actually start getting products to distributors.
Glad I went with the rearden as my way of mounting my polo k.
This should make everyone consider buying ocl products and more of them
I guess I'll have to buy a Polonium 30 tomorrow to make sure they have enough money to help them out with their legal fees.
I would love to know the amount of business OCL has received for Andrew being just a regular dude. Fantastic products aside -it's hard to not just give him business for being likable, lmao.
For someone who doesn't have a surefire suppressor but a surefire Socom 4 prong muzzle, will this adapt non surefire suppressors on the 4 prong
For context

https://ottercreeklabs.com/product/shorefyre-1-375x24/
Andrew is my favorite internet dude and I will own an OCL can one day (polo K).
Andrew is one of the coolest dudes to shoehorn his way into this incestuous, cutthroat industry, to the chagrin of the gatekeepers.
u/ottergang_ky I don‚Äôt think we told you but something is fucky with the SF mount. B&T told us they designed it and when SF stole it B&T said something and thats why B&T is allowed to use the mount now without recourse
I didn‚Äôt realize so many hate the SF mounting system. Haven‚Äôt had any problems with mine. Interesting
u/ottergang_ky I love your explicitly stated return policy.  Might borrow a few bits from it.  We essentially have the same policy...if you're a jerk we enforce all our terms, but if you're nice we'll bend over backwards to make everything perfect.
Wow, they said your product was *exemplary!* What an honor!
Reddit 1 year ago: ‚Äúomg we love surefire and highly recommended their cans!‚Äù

*surefire comes out with a $1700 can*

Now Reddit: ‚ÄúOMG WE HATE SUREFIRE THEYRE THE WORST ALL THEY DO IS CATER TO THE GOVERNMENT‚Äù

This site cracks me up with this crusading hivemind. For some big bad 2A militia men you cats sure get your asses chapped over something new every day
ü¶ç
Cant wait for my 1st OCL can, and 2nd, and 3rd, erc. Etc.
OCL so gd based it's dumb. They've won my business (again)
I‚Äôve been saying forever the Surefire mount sucks ass. No clue why people like it. Carbon locks like crazy. Gas leaks out the back of it covering your hand and making it louder. Ratcheting mechanism will wear out eventually. Heavy. Expensive. No clue why people like it so much. Even the muzzle devices need improvement. The FH pings every shit. LAC and silencerco figured out how to fix this forever ago. Why is Surefire hesitant to fix it changing the prong lengths slightly. So dumb. I‚Äôll take rearden, ASR, YHM, etc over a Surefire mount any day.
So, do I get a Polo K now instead of an RC2 mini?
Someone‚Äôs going through these comments downvoting everything. SF getting salty laying in bed
u/ottergang_ky Im newish to suppressor stuff and still debating on what mounting system im going with. I previously was reading the SF was pretty good? can you shoot me a quick explanation of why you think its trash and what you would recommend for a mounting system?
Cheaper and likely better quality than that bullshit BSD just dropped too lmfao, I love OCL
90% of my mounts are surefire mounts, so fuck yeah this opens things up quite nicely, instead of having to send in my warden to get it made into a hub adapter.
I'm liking the cut of this guy's jib.  Surely going to need a few more cans over the next year or two and will definitely be trying the wares of OCL.

You know what I'd really like to see them post? An in depth, no holds barred review and guide to all the mounting systems. Every time I look around, the field seems more crowded and confusing.
Wait so this is a hub mount? Meant for SF MDs? I love my Surefire cans but I can stand the mounting system. This seems counter productive lol
I wanna buy an OCL suppressor just for the hell of it now
This is the type of product description that helps me validate my decision to own 1 of each of OCL's supressor line
Hes not wrong. The mounts suck.

Cloners gonna clone
Surefire gettin' bodied up in here. Glad I never got hooked on their ecosystem.
I'm buying one just because of the C&D photo he posted, lmao.
I‚Äôve been on the fence which can I wanted to buy.  This just made my decision overwhelmingly easy
I just saw that on their website. Fucking hilarious üòÇ
Been looking at the Polonium K, besides direct thread, what mounting solution is recommended?
My local shop has a Polo 30 in their display case. I've already got two cans in jail with them, but this makes me want the Polonium 30 that much more
Take my money Andrew üëë
I suddenly need an OCL hub mount.
Polo K is clone now. Don't @ me
Single greatest item description ever
Damnit, you had me at vinyl siding, ginger with rosacea, wind swept beard and C&D .  And you make awesome products?!? 

OCL4L
u/ottergang_ky, can you troll Griffin next? That would tip me over into another can purchase prolly :D
That's awesome.  lol
Upvote this into oblivion
I have 2 OCL cans, they are for the culture, great products from some red blooded Americans.
Obviously you're not infringing on their patent.. they patented a device that doesn't work for its intended, or at least stated, purpose.. yours does
Noice !!
Legend! ü§üüèΩ
Surefire did the same thing to me years ago over a   switch patent but they also sent out letters to all the dealers at the same time  being a small business at the time I shut my door. Good luck brother.
Savage, I need more OCL cans
*The need for OCL cans intensifies*
This made me laugh, especially the explanation in the comments
Idk but the product description makes me WANT to buy this just cause they said all that and posted C&D.
I need a shorefyre compatible muzzle device for my galil Sar threads.

I don‚Äôt understand how this mounts. Does it have a latch like the rc2? Or is a like a keymo style mount that can mount to a 3 prong? Can it mount to a 3 prong?
I guess if I decided to get an OCL. I don't need a new mounting device.
I‚Äôm just waiting for that mk11 suppressor lol
Love that guy.
Andrew, that looks like a wanted poster or jail booking photo. ü§£üëç
Lol, that's pretty funny I had to send a Surefire mount back because I was getting a P&W done and they said it was out of alignment
Oh man!  Brice is really going to lose his shit now ü§£ü§£
Literally buying one of their cans just because of this
That‚Äôs goddamn hilarious
Andrews honest opinions on his own products he has spent time and money on are a breath of fresh air in an industry full of snake oil salesmen.  Going to keep buying OCL stuff for this reason.
boogerloo fantasies üòÇ
He‚Äôs 100% right. The SureFire mounting system is garbage. The company tells you to unlock it and shoot it off if it becomes carbon locked. What kind of bullshit is that? You know who has an awesome system? KAC. You can leave a suppressor on for three years, put 3k rounds through it, and QDC cans come right off, because it uses ball bearings when ratcheting on/off. SureFire suppressors shouldn‚Äôt be on the pedestal you‚Äôve put them on.
Mega based. Surefire always seemed overrated to me. Solid products, but certainly not god-tier
I can't put into words for much I love this
This makes me want to drive down to my LGS right now and order another OCL can just because it‚Äôs so hilarious
Beautiful, spot on!!
SF makes new styles of turd polish, just a different sheen.
That's an absolutely amazing name for it to lol
I cut the muzzle device/ mount adapter weight in half on my rifles and cans when I switched from keymo to Rearden. The future is now.
<3
Hopefully that‚Äôs sorted out lol

If you read the paper that C&D is from about 6 months ago. Our lawyer has already talked to theirs. The C&D lists ‚Äúa suppressor that attaches to the surefire mounting system‚Äù and this is not a suppressor üóø
A lot and it was unexpected honestly. Like I always thought people wanted like elite operator high speed tactical guys and then I‚Äôm just over here drinking beer at work. Really didn‚Äôt see things going the way they have
Thank God he isn't like KB over at Q.
Nothing like watching some Kentucky rednecks earnestly getting rich from producing truly quality products. They can continue to have my money.
Mine, 100%.  The product is great and he participates in this forum, is 100% why I bought a K and P30, and will buy the .22.  It‚Äôs baffling why other manufacturers aren‚Äôt here talking to people.  THIS IS their market.

When a friend, family, coworker asks, I say OCL products.  When they say why I say ‚Äúthe suppressors are great, inexpensive, and I can talk to the owner if I want to.  He‚Äôs in our Reddit group.‚Äù
Yes
The OP pic is one of the product pictures, haha
>You can only polish a turd so much.

>The entire mount is made from 17-4 with H900 heat treat and the spring is made from Inconel

Fuck me, that's one hell of a polished turd
[deleted]
You can own one today (you just have to wait for gubby permission to have it). They sell em everywhere now.
Carpe diem man. Seize the carp or whatever
I really appreciate his honesty on other products too, tbh
Same.
Oooh interesting. I know B&T uses it but I‚Äôd love to know more
Hux boys laughing and sipping bourbon. ü§£
I mean one of its ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù is being able to shoot the can off when it gets stuck. That‚Äôs not a good thing to brag on.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had to actually enforce it thankfully
The one thing the gun community hates more than anything isn't priced right. Like if something is too expensive for no reason they hate it. They really hate it when something doesn't cost enough. As if their mad at the audacity of something being reasonably priced and viable.
Surefire was the best thing on the market until it was suddenly out of the reach of their pocket books, now its a trash company and always has been!
Well a year ago their can wasnt $1700. Try some critical thinking ffs.
Yeah! Leave my dead air cans alone.
You‚Äôre goddamned right
Well the mini2 sucks dick so i hope you make that choice
Itll be more the size of an RC2 at that point. I have a ecco sf hub and it brings the polo pretty much identical to it
Hell yes
Rearden Atlas
Rearden
Buying anything by BSD is gambling your safety. The guy's a fucking clown.
I think the intended market are people with uppers that have surefire muzzle devices pinned and welded. I would personally get the pin and weld removed via gunsmith over staying with the sure fire mount, but that is just me.
Si
It‚Äôs improved with coatings to resist carbon lock, but yes, SF‚Äôs mounting system is garbage.
You should have wanted to do that long before this!
I'm glad a meme made your choice on weapon parts.
Go with Rearden. Light, short, good seal, and if you get unlucky enough to have issues, they've got good CS. It's pretty damn cheap too.

I have a preference for single port muzzle brakes from them, but they have a bunch of options.
Same. I want 30 for my ak but then ima need new parts for tuning and mounting. Or maybe I can use it as an excuse to get a cheap 308 bolt gun
DOOO ITTTTT
Ratchet style like Keymo but for surefire socom muzzle devices.
I am objectively very funny. Thank you
I said the same thing a while ago and people came with their pitch forks. 

If I have to shoot your suppressor off the mounting system is poo poo
Even Keymo when properly installed/tightened is better than surefires garbage system. Having to shoot off a 1200+ dollar can that‚Äôs carbon locked is a stupid ass solution. I love SF stuff but come on
Or your me and your locking collar on your brand new can won‚Äôt unlock when mounted to a brand new 3 prong. Every time I want to take it off I have to beat it off with a mallet
My surefire cans sit on the shelf. Mediocre, outdated, proprietary, and now I‚Äôll add litigious to my criticisms.
Yup, the Emperor has no clothes.
I just can't fathom paying those sorts of prices for what is a good suppressor when you can get good suppressors from a number of different manufacturers for a fraction of the price.
Mine sit around, outclassed by more modern cans.
My one OCL can (Lithium 9) has been fantastic and I am definitely going to pick up some more cans in the not too distant future. OCL will be one of my top choices.
Dead Air called it that on purpose because they considered the Saker mounts to be a cancer.

Yes, you can use the name and yes, sign me up for one, or maybe two... 

You'll probably get it developed, tested and on the market before I get any of my 'in stock' notifications come in.
I'm not saying you're wrong but I'm a little bit committed to keymo, including pin and welds. I don't see anything I dislike about Rearden (and I always recommend people have a look at them when considering mounts)  but I'm personally not going to go through that level of trouble and expense to lose two ounces of weight.
I love my rearden, it was one of the only places I could get an 8.6 mount... then, I decided to get a couple more ü§£. My next can will probably have a rearden on it as well. Thanks for supporting the community when few others did (with the 8.6 specifically).
Hey I've converted all my rifles to Rearden muzzle devices and I've put your Atlas mount on all my cans.  I like it.  BUT I do have trouble getting cans off after shooting them (moving from one host to another) and I usually have to let them sit for a few minutes and cool down before being able to get them off by hand.  Is that normal or is there anything I can do to make it easier to move them from one host to another?
So uh, IANAL but that sounds a whole lot like "these dinguses patented the whole RC2 instead of making the mounting system its own patent."

Dude, they're not done, they'll just send an amended letter. Watch.
Real deal operators don't act like they are. You'd never know unless you get to know them. Guys that were in Mogadishu, Afghanistan in 01 and Iraq in 03 and were kicking doors and jumping out of planes for 20 years really don't look or act at all like most people would think.
Honestly the "One of us! One of us!" type of shit you have going on is refreshing. We all just want shit that won't break or break the bank (mostly). Then you got your ass over here recommending competitor's shit over your own in certain use cases. Which probably (definitely) gets you more business than lying to keep a sale. If only bigger companies in other industries also got that memo. Keep it up my dude. We all love a gay commie sometimes.
The problem with that is anyone that ever served knows those guys are a sham. Real operators don‚Äôt get out and work retail or machinery, they go into high threat private security, executive protection, or become training instructors. Very few manage to get lucky and make it big in the marketing space. I‚Äôd rather my kit be made by someone with 20 years of machining experience. Kicking in doors and shooting people doesn‚Äôt translate into machining experience.
This is the way.
:O I must buy
That is amazing. I'm a fan now.
You sir, are an idiot sir

E. He said, ‚ÄúI may be an idiot, but isn‚Äôt this just keymo?‚Äù Or something stupid
I mean, it‚Äôs literally Called a shore-fire.
Wait. Did I fuck up? I have really bad Internet right now going through traveling. So this is isn‚Äôt the mount to connect Surefire MDs to OCL suppressors?
Looks just like it
> Otter Creek Labs

As a non suppressor owner (Restricted State life), I'm so confused at what this product is.
More a money issue right now. Soon though!
Just put another can in jail this week, I think around day 150 on this one it will happen.
Thats pretty much it B&T got a C&D and clapped back.
Man I watched a hux can carbon lock in 50 rounds and BAD. There isnt a damn can in this world that checks off all the boxes.
It‚Äôs much better than having to use a pipe wrench to crank off a carbon locked can. 
 
Do surefire‚Äôs get carbon lock easier than some cans? Sure. Especially with warcomps. 

But if you put 200-300 rounds through a gun suppressed in one sitting I‚Äôve experienced carbon lock with multiple QD mounts. The nice thing is you can unlock the surefire mount when it‚Äôs carbon locked, and launch it off, whereas with other brands, like Keymo for example, I had to use tools to remove the carbon locked can since the body couldn‚Äôt rotate.
I don‚Äôt understand. It seems like a good thing to be able to do. What exactly is bad about that?
That must be nice -- we end up having to with about 1 in 1000 customers.  There's just a certain percentage of the general population that can't be made to be happy it seems.

The our customers are wonderful, a huge cut above normal ecommerce customers scamming sellers on amazon.  I imagine the suppressor gang is an even better subset of the average gun part buyer crowd.  The Boise Black Rifle guys were singing your praise big time when we dropped by for an event a while back, so you guys are doing something right!  


I should really get one of your rimfire cans into our inventory.
About a decade ago TFB did an April fools post about a new civilian-legal MP7 from H&K.

The telltale sign that it was fake? MSRP was too low.
Lmfao like surefire is losing sleep over these clowns
It‚Äôs like the people trying to act like people just groupthink DA as if they haven‚Äôt done a complete 180.

Because nothing ever changes.
No no you don‚Äôt understand you have to think the same thing about something no matter new information comes to light? 

Were you an OJ Simpson fan when he played for Bills? Sorry now you support a murderer.  Think Jared from Subway was cool for losing all that weight? You‚Äôre basically a pedo now, tough shit.  Wanted to be just like Bruce Jenner when you grew up? Welp, it‚Äôs morphin time.
Their RC2 has stayed the same price. If that‚Äôs what you want, buy that one. Nice ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù though. Excellent critical thinking on your end lmao
I always really enjoyed mine
Do you have a mini 2? Bc I really like mine.
I just did the math and it would weigh the same as an RC2 as well‚Ä¶

I think he may have a good point here üòÇ
This is what everyone recommends, and is probably what I‚Äôll go with, I just already have 2 uppers with SF3Ps that are my go tos. Mainly wondering why the dislike for the SF mounting system, other than it kind of limiting you to SF cans, why is it a bad design? Does it perform badly? I was under the impression it was a pretty solid lock up with very little / consistent POI shift.

Methhead*
SFs mounting system is actually not garbage üòÄ
I‚Äôm not familiar with Rearden but know they are a manufacturing company, so when you say ‚Äúgo with Rearden‚Äù, what mounting system specifically of theirs are you referring to? Is Rearden also the name of their muzzle device?
I plan on buying some OCL cans literally because of you.  You interact with the 2A community like an enthusiast because you *are* an enthusiast.  Which also means your products are (likely) built with passion.
I was pretty sure you were going to take my suppressor virginity, now I‚Äôm certain.
I‚Äôm just glad someone with more suppressor credibility said it. I always thought the Surefire mounting system was subpar at best and really made me not care for their suppressors.
Enough of the kumbaya funny guy, where‚Äôs the TI 22 already?!? THE PEOPLE DEMAND IT NOW!
When I had insta I was following you way before the ocl days right up until the early days of it. You are objectively hilarious. 
I'm glad Its spread to reddit so I can still get some laughs
You hate surefire muzzle devices that much lol
I love the smooth brains that do in fact shoot them off at SF‚Äôs ‚Äúguidance‚Äù and then come here to complain about their now dented SF cans. SF makes an awesome flashlight. That‚Äôs about it. Their muzzle devices are also garbage pot metal that get marred way too easily.
Every system is better than SF‚Äôs system.
You ain‚Äôt wrong. It‚Äôs ridiculous. But why the keymo shade? It‚Äôs an excellent and boringly reliable system, ignoring weight of course.
I wholly agree, dude. The PewScience performance numbers don‚Äôt lie, but there are other cans that perform similarly or better and cost less. That and the weight penalty. My first can was a Sandman-S and ~21oz of crap at the end of my muzzle got old over time. Surefire‚Äôs system isn‚Äôt too far off in weight.
I love my polonium k. I‚Äôm thinking polo 30 is next. If it wasn‚Äôt Christmas time I‚Äôd probly have ordered it already
The weight reduction was ~5oz, and it shortened the assembly (can on) by about an inch. It‚Äôs a noticeable change in the feel of a rifle shedding that weight since it‚Äôs out at the end of your muzzle.  As you acquire more cans, and they started to become dedicated to one gun, start switching out, it‚Äôll be a real quality of life improvement.
No problem! Appreciate you putting food on our tables ü§£
I truly appreciate the support. What you‚Äôre seeing is totally normal and expected.

If you are wanting to move it while hot, you can use wrenches. You just really need to make sure you put it on the next host securely and check it.
Basically yes. 

It means fuck all at the end of the day. If you have enough money you can sue a ham sandwich for looking at you wrong and surefire definitely fits into that description. 

But in the opinions of the multiple lawyers, patent lawyers and industry lawyers and professionals we‚Äôve talked to over the last year we are in the right. That was like step 1 before even starting the project.
They‚Äôve had 6 months ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I was able to do some intel support work with some of the guys from Team 3 in Iraq. They're LT looked like a straight up fucking nerd (think Gunny Highway's LT in Heartbreak Ridge), yet here he was leading a SF team. One of their chiefs was definitely a little more rough around the edges, but still had the "dad sipping on beer while grilling and not a care in the world" demeanor. Now, 18 year old boot PVT, oh yeah, he's most definitely a elite operator high speed tactical guy!
It'll work on any can that accepts hub mounts.
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.
B&T came up with the surefire mount originally?
Cool story bro
It‚Äôs a bug disguised as a feature.
Oh shit i was just looking at your [complete blaster uppers](https://borebuddy.com/product/complete-blaster-uppers/) and I have a question, If I have a cmmg conversion kit would I be able to pull the chamber adapter off and just run it or would I need a different adapter? Thanks.
[Your internals fuck!] (https://i.imgur.com/cC8w66l.mp4) This one never fails to make people smile/laugh and is easily my most shot gun!
Its all about the memes and gotchas
And people have stated that they plan to just get another rc2 rather than the rc3. People are expressing their disappointment in the massive price hike.
I could enjoy it if they cut off the qd mount and dropped that inch and 6ish ounces off of it for a direct thread. Then it would be a size profile that justifies its performance but in stock config its blown out by too many other cans
I do and it is the only can I regret buying
Same as the Rotex X from B&T same weight as an RC2 just a 1/2‚Äù longer
It only seals properly on their flash hiders.

It's stupid heavy, prone to carbon locking, and it's stupid expensive with no real upsides when compared to the current market options, like the Atlas.
I think reading this comment thread will give you all the cons for SF
Oh nice his exploits have reached Reddit lmfao
Great argument crayon eater
Rearden Atlas
They only make the Atlas, they've just got a shit load of options as far as adapting it to can interfaces aside from typical ASR threads. 

The atlas is just a Plan B system, but better quality than what Q makes. 

They've got a bunch of muzzle device options as well, you'd have to try pretty hard to not be able to find something compatible with whatever you're looking to suppress.

Edit: well technically they also do direct thread stuff, but that's not usually what people are looking for when comparing different mount companies.
Hell yea, I mean that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm just me. I love guns and suppressors and always have. I was a consumer and still active in the NFA and 2A world pre otter creek. So it‚Äôs just like nothings changed. The only difference is OCL exists now which is cool. Turned a hobby into a business and I‚Äôm incredibly blessed. Get to go to work every day and do what I‚Äôve loved doing forever anyway.
Hmm. ‚ÄúMade with passion‚Äù

Always wondered what the white stuff was
Went with a Polo K for my first can because of this exact reason. Andrew is super active and fucking hilarious
I remember when Zastava used to be involved as well. It's what swayed me into buying an M92.
My thoughts exactly.
They start shipping next week
> garbage pot metal

Uh what? They are all machined from heat-treated stainless steel bar stock. There's plenty to criticize them for but this isn't one of those things.
Objectively, while their flashlights were revolutionary, they are now outdated, and there are multiple companies making a better product, for less money utilizing their system.
I'm pretty fond of the system yhm has on their turbo lineup personally
I'd take that any day over a surefire
I have no complaints with my Keymo setup (sandman K). I just know the adapters sometimes can get finicky with use. Mines been rock solid though.
Thank you both ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm glad you like them, those are the only comments I really love to hear. That‚Äôs my goal
I've got I think 8 rifles with Rearden brakes on them (plus will be getting another one for an 8.6 as soon as the gumsmif is done with it), a F1 can with an Atlas, and 2 Diligent cans in jail that I've already bought them for too ü§£ y'all's products are great and customer service is too, y'all did 2 bare stainless Atlas's for me and a buddy to better match Ti cans, hope y'all's business continues to grow!
Well thank god. Frankly I didn‚Äôt expect to have to cash in on my offer to kill on your behalf QUITE so soon. 

Still down for the cult tho.
I don‚Äôt have a lot of money, but I‚Äôm getting pretty goddamn tired of ham sandwiches looking at me wrong.
Thanks. 1.375√ó24 HUB as it says in the product description? I‚Äôm finally getting it!! Makes sense.
Yes back in the 90‚Äôs but a different scale
Good point guess I made it up
Doesn‚Äôt every kind of mount get carbon lock? Or are there mounts that don‚Äôt cause carbon lock?
You'd need to replace the chamber adapter with one of our barrel collars.  Pretty simple, so you can save some cash ordering without a bolt.
This is great to hear -- we love seeing our parts make these rifles run like sewing machines!
Yeah, people are also throwing a hissy fit over the fact that they‚Äôre selling an $1800 can. It‚Äôs pathetic.
And most of those people buying RC2's probably still view flowthrough as a meme and can't imagine spending money on something they think as such.

If this was a year ago I would probably be saying the same thing that I would rather buy an RC2 instead of wasting my money on "flowthrough." Having shot a Flow556k for some time I now have a hard time convincing myself to buy traditional cans, so the RC2 is out of the question. I'm just waiting for the Mini3 to hit the market.
Do you by chance use a warcomp as the mount?
Good list thank you. 

My main question is why the atlas mounts don‚Äôt back off as they are essentially just threaded on correct? Also I just have heard on this thread before that the SF mounts were solid and had little poi shifts compared to others
I was looking it over and mainly it seems the cons are 

-expensive 
-carbon locking 

As a newb does that offset the Pros that it has?
Who‚Äôs BSD?
Hngggggg
Ok so the Atlas is the name of the design of the piece that you attach to a HUB suppressor and then screw the other end onto a Rearden muzzle device. Am I understanding correctly? Or is Atlas the name of the system the muzzle devices use too? Sorry just not getting it
I‚Äôve bought two of your cans this year simply because of your presence on here and amazing products. Thank you!
I remember the quail days‚Ä¶
Hey I've never heard of you before this post but now I want you to know I love you
And you are doing gods work at that. Making the guys at surefire with more years of experience look bad
Can I jerryrig an OCM5 to this mount cause all of my ARs have surefire muzzle devices except 1.
Based
Fuckin a, God bless u
I‚Äôm about to put a Polonium in jail and can‚Äôt wait! OCL is the way!
What is your personal preferred QD mounting system?
Literally as you just replied I stumbled onto https://www.reddit.com/r/NFA/s/cOwiC07Mci and saw your answer haha. 
Can‚Äôt wait for my 30 day approval. ü§´
I‚Äôd have agreed with you if the new Turbo series wasn‚Äôt a thing
Wasn‚Äôt that with the sandman s overrun cans? I have seen problems with people over tightening the mount but otherwise bulletproof. 

In surefire‚Äôs defense though, at least they‚Äôre not as bad cherry bombs lol
Thank you! Appreciate the support!
The otter compound is going to be lit
Fucking ham sandwiches, who do they think they are?!
[deleted]
nope SF3P
They are threaded on but they have the tapered shoulder that gives way more friction than a standard thread with nothing
It's a matter of putting it on tight to begin with. But yes, that's definitely a risk. 

SF is definitely repeatable, but it's not unique in that regard.  Keymo and QDC are both known for that as well, but they're likewise on the heavier/expensive side (qdc is KAC only still)

They'll at least come off without having to launch the can down range. 

But they're more aspects to repeatability than the mount alone, three SF system just kind of dumbstruck it down and makes it easier than twisting a can onto threads to the same torque every time. 

It's got its uses, and if you're already heavily invested in the ecosystem, by all means keep using it. If you're in a position where you can move away from it and aren't trying to get into cloning guns that use it, then I'd say look into other options, there's a bunch that might offer what you prefer/need.

Just because a bunch of us like the Plan B system and particularly clones of it (atlas), doesn't mean you have to use it. A fast attach system I've been interested in is the one for A2 flash hiders for example. Not sure what the effect on poi with it is
I guess that depends.

When looking at 5.56 suppressors, I think it's important to look at how the entire system is going to perform, and performance includes how it will meet your specific needs.

For my GPR, I wanted something relatively lightweight that would be used mostly suppressed.  I live out west and do a lot of off-trail hiking in the mountains.

When I was deciding on my build, I knew I could save some weight going shorter than 16" without much compromise on terminal performance, and it would be more balanced with the can.  So, I figured my choices were 13.7 -14.5"

When you start looking at mounting options, most QD systems are heavy compared to Rearden.  For example, a 13.7" barrel with a NOX and keymo adapter is heavier than a 14.5 with R2 and the Atlas.  QD isn't important to me, so why give up velocity for QD.

If you want the QD, your realistic choices are keymo, SF, YHM, or Griffin.  Now you need to find out what muzzle devices are available for those technologies and if the compatible suppressors meet your needs.

For me, the Polonium has RC2 performance, but there are more mounting options that result in an overall lighter system at a lower price.  The only compromise I made was needing to go 14.5 instead of 13.9, but that was an easy compromise.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a marine, I drag my rifle behind a humvee so I know more than you. Hoo rah!‚Äù
The Atlas is what goes on the can.

Technically the whole system is 'Plan B', the same as Q, since it's the same thing. 

But the Atlas you need specifically will vary on the can you have. The regular Atlas (as in just straight called atlas), is for standard 1.375 or 1.4375 threads (typcial 'Bravo' and 'D-cell' specs respectively).

They also make versions like the Alpha that's for rugged 9 and 45 cans with 1.125-28 threads. Their site is pretty straightforward on finding what you need, assuming you know what you are trying to use it with.

All of their muzzle devices will work with their Atlas adapters, just make sure you pick one that works for what you need as far as thread and caliber sizing.
I was thinking about that a lot last night. Idk why but it was just on my mind. It‚Äôs been such a wild ride
I thought that damn face looked familiar hahha I love quell
No you can‚Äôt. They won‚Äôt work together because the OCM isn‚Äôt HUB it‚Äôs ops only
What MD do you recommend across a variety of hosts for your system with a DA Wolfman?  357 lever, 9 pcc, 300blk ar
Awww, but last time you made us wear pants. ü•¥
Yeah but that is even more expensive than SF
That‚Äôs a hell of a good answer, thanks for the thought out response
One more question on the rearden atlas, as far as I know it essentially threads on the MD and presses up against the taper, how does that not back off like a direct thread? Just the pressure against the taper?
That‚Äôs really mean bro. My purple M16A4 didn‚Äôt appreciate that comment.
Got it, clear. Thank you!
Why the name change? Just to differentiate business ventures?
Alcohol and fusion 360 go brrrrr
Lathe go worshhrrrrr.
It‚Äôs mostly personal preference. I like our non timed devices like the r2s cause I‚Äôm lazy nowadays. 

Brakes are my favorite for can longevity, though.
Glad that was helpful!
So I have a rearden setup and my experience so far has been this. Grab can at home with a bare hand tighten down can on MD firmly. Go to range and shoot the gun, as it warms up it taper locks to the muzzle device. I used a welding glove and a supressor wrench and it was firmly on there after about 15 shots. When I go to clean the gun a quick pop with the wrench and it's off. So far my experience has also been limited zero shift at 100 yards now this may be due to it being a socom profile dd barrel but zero shifts about 1/2 inch at 50 yards vertically.
My experience is similar. I've never had the Atlas loosen.  If I tighten the can as hard as possible by hand, I need a wrench to remove it.

The taper has a lot of surface area contact, and the threads apply a normal force forcing the tapers together.  It's very secure

I have a decent amount of zero shift with and without the suppressor, but return to zero has been perfect.
We wanted to separate the history of quell from OCL and not give the government any excuses to mess with us if it could be avoided. We sold the company to a gentleman in Texas, used that money to start OCL and now here we are
Is there anything that easily compares/explains the differences in the different brakes?
Do you rocksett your hub adapter to the can?
I still have a robot D
Love it. Keep up the good work
Aaaah so that's why quail have near as much variety as it used to
Wait so y‚Äôall dropping a mounting system that‚Äôs compatible with SF socom muzzle devices?? I‚Äôm out the loop
It‚Äôs primarily personal preference in aesthetics.

Bore size needs to be larger than your projectile, your projectile. For example .280 bore will now allow 300 blk through.

Thread pitch has to match your barrels threads, so that‚Äôs an easy one.

Finish is again personal preference. 

If you aren‚Äôt running an AK you don‚Äôt have to worry about face mount. Tapered shoulders on barrels require the use of a taper adapter or a tapered md.
Yes
Talks of unions at work
Can someone whois in a union weigh in on this? These were put on tables in the break room at work and I'm curious what the positives and negatives are on joining a union.
Statisticaly union employees make i belive it was 20% more over their lifetime
They are putting these propaganda flyers out at your job because they don't want you to join. **Union employees generally get better pay/benefits as well as protections** which translates to higher expense for the employer.
I dunno what typical union dues are, but mine are only 21 bucks a month,¬† I can tell you for fuckin sure that's less than what I was paying for health insurance at a fortune 500 company.¬†
Let‚Äôs see. In a union you get better pay, better benefits, better accommodations if you‚Äôre on the road, other bonuses such as higher LOA, paid travel, etc. the cost is the dues, whatever they may be.
Jesus Christ, the graphic design on this thing... That alone would make me unionize out of spite.
Protip: if your company tells you something is bad for you, it's probably just bad for them.
My dues are 78 a month.
Been in a union shop for 14 years. Worth the dues.

Ive got good almost great pay, great benefits and a pension.
My dues are less than $50 a month. In exchange, I make $50 an hour(on the check), medical benefits, BADASS vision and dental coverage (for the whole family btw), pension/annuity, ‚Äúvacation‚Äù checks every 3 months (mailbox money! equaling an extra paycheck or more, typically, unless you didn‚Äôt put in hours. Think, a small tax refund check in the mail every few months instead of once a year, but this one is guaranteed because you‚Äôll never ‚Äòowe‚Äô), extra training that equals real college credits (if you‚Äôre into that, or want to go on to be a cwi once you‚Äôre older or want to move on)‚Ä¶ 

I worked rat for years, and never made more than $16 an hour. My first union paycheck at $22 an hour blew me away.

100% either someone in your company is pushing an anti union agenda, or a local union has targeted your employer because y‚Äôall are big enough to be a threat in the market. Someone in the office of your company is leaving that anti union bs and hoping you buy into it so that they pocket more money instead of paying you what you deserve.

Sign the card.
Anyone who has a beef with unions needs to work the same type of job in a union shop and then non union‚Ä¶ and then tell me which one is better. The answer will be union 99.99% of the time. The only type of people who dislike unions are people who make more money for cheap labor. Unions exist so we don‚Äôt get paid 12 bucks an hour, because I promise without the unions, we‚Äôd get paid shit.
Shitty unions suck. Good unions are great.¬†
I've never seen anybody that joined a union and made less money or got less benefits. 

there's a reason why management doesn't want you to join.
Your employer is putting out propaganda to stop you from joining a union. That should be all the info you need
I‚Äôve only worked in 2 union places and wished I worked in more. The fact that they are making an effort to dissuade you from joining a union should be the reason to join.
In my 61 years I've never heard of anyone regretting joining a union.
I get paid $38/hr with full benefits and a retirement pension, while my cohorts get paid $18-$20/hr with no benefits whatsoever. All because of my union. Don‚Äôt let the anti union types scare you.
Live Better, Work Union! Corporate profits are at an all time high. Unions, while not perfect, seek to put more of those profits in your pocket. They are also responsible for ensuring YOUR safety, overall working conditions, and benefits. I‚Äôm in a union shop although not welding specifically.
Union employee here.

Good benefits, respectable pay, solid and secure retirement and pension, constant guarenteed work, and promise that you won't be worked like a dog for OT.

Cons are, they might work you like a dog anyways, and your union isn't strong if you aren't a contractor union, contractor unions can go from one place to another, and if a company wants to be a shithead, they won't work with that company. But you'd be with the same company forever, and would never have any real power to tell them to fuck off aside from striking, but the moment your out of a job, your out of that job UNLESS you have the backing of a stronger union like Ironworkers, Pipefitters, Teamsters, ect. who do sponsor people trying to unionize.

Hell the Ironworkers backed up people trying to unionize in a fast food warehouse near me.

That being said, i'd honestly rather be IN a union, than out of a union.
Not to mention union dues are tax deductible‚Ä¶
If you negotiate your own salary, you're negotiating against someone who does that for a living. Just like you're a much better welder than he is, he's probably a much better negotiator than you are. The union allows you to have a professional negotiator represent you.

I'm gonna be honest, I'm a total labor union guy. I work in a different industry and mostly just lurk here because I do weld a bit and I like seeing what you guys can do. I worked the same job for ten years before we organized. When our contract took effect, I got a 40% raise without anything about my job changing, except I got PTO as well. After the pandemic, I found a new union job where I literally make double what I did before we organized.

I have a home and two children because I joined a union.




Roses are red

Violets are blue

Organize your workplace

So the boss can't screw you
I have worked in both places. The last time I worked in a non-unionised place, when i started, I earned more per hour than base pay because my job was "more technical." Then, the minimum wage went up, but mine did not. This happened twice a year every year until I left. Eventually, I was working minimum wage with everyone else, but I was still doimg the "more technical" job.

There are some significant things to consider: 

Would my employer lie to me about unions? 

Does my employer care for my best interests? 

Does my employer volunteer to give me a living wage every year? 

Will my employer help me if something happens? You know, life happens (sickness, family, children, accidents)? 


Alternatively:


Do you have to pay for a Union? Yes

Do they cost me money? Yes

Is it a lot? No


The increase in your wage, pension, and benefits will offset any costs for unionization. 


Look at the productivity of Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. A strong unionized workforce does not destabilize a country. The distribution of wealth and productivity both increase.
The fact that an employer needs to put out these flyers is telling. They are spending money/resources telling you what to do in an effort that they don‚Äôt have to pay you better. Companies will actively spend money just so employees don‚Äôt get more money. It‚Äôs hilarious and dumb. 

Joining a union is the best option for the working class, we get better pay, benefits, pension, better protection against discrimination and wrongful dismissal and so much more. Unions are for the working class, and unions even help those who are non union because it raises the standard of compensation. 

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll regret it at all. Union members on average make 15-30% more than non union. Not sure what country you‚Äôre in but I can cite a source for both the U.S. and Canada if anyone is interested. 

Union is the wayüí™üèª
This propaganda is all the more reason to unionize
Anybody telling you that union dues are expensive doesn't know what they're talking about.
If your boss doesn't want a union, you should probably form a union.

Hell, if you have a boss you should form a union.
I don‚Äôt know shit about unions, but if your employer is going to these lengths to sway you away from doing something you‚Äôre allowed to do, it‚Äôs probably not because they have your best interests in mind.
Your boss really doesn't want you to join a union. What does that tell you?
I would unionize simply out of spite if my employer put up flyers like this one.
Corporate greed wants you to believe that being unionized is a bad idea. Take it from someone that was NOT in the union to now being apart of the UAW and having REAL representation, is a great feeling! I know that my dues are going towards not only giving us more fun stuff outside of work but also going towards paying our officials for making sure we the workers are not abused and taken advantage of. I feel truly blessed to finally be in a REAL union and have people looking out for my best interest.
I'll never work non union again in my life. Ironworkers Local 397, Tampa FL.
Union for life.

Your bosses boss doesnt want you to unionize. Take the hint.

I pay alot in union dues, i also get 30-40% of it back on my taxes....... i also have guaranteed benefits for my whole family, travel insurance etc.

Life insurance, death assessments (everyone in the union gives my family money when i die).

A healthy pension, and a good rate of pay.

I can tell you, i work on sites with non union fellas (i dont mind, everyones gotta work), and theyre blown away when they ask what i make versus them. We do almost the same job, just 900ft away.

They think were the enemy for some reason (propaganda). When we could care less they are there. Everyones gotta work, id have a beer with any of them.
Businesses exist to earn profits. 

Businesses also hate unions. 

Ask yourself why.

Edit: FWIW, and this info is almost 25 years old, dude I knew joined IBEW out of high school.  Bought his first house in his early 20s.
And a union is only as good as the members that participate. Join the union and fight for better wages and benefits. Go to the meetings and take it seriously. The union is gives you power over your bosses. While you are working Saturday the owner of the company is on his boat that he bought through your labor. You deserve some of those benefits and spoils. 

UNITED WE BARGAIN DIVIDED WE BEG!!
You lucky duck. I've never heard so much as a whisper about unionizing and it makes me sad
Your employer is using scare tactics to prevent you guys from unionizing because then they‚Äôll have to pay you fairly. They would rather pay you as little as possible. The only people who are against unions are brainwashed corporate simps.
If unions were bad your employer wouldn't sway you from joining one
If you‚Äôre getting a flyer like this you especially need a union
The union at my work has currently negotiated a raise of ¬£6k for staff at my level so far (20%) in the last 3 years, and there are talks in the pipeline for another 7% raise this year. The increase should already have happened, so when it finally goes live around October we will get a nice tasty back payment lump sum.
RemindMe! One Year
The IW represents shop welders and my dues are $35 a month. I‚Äôm a first year so my base pay (contractors pay for our benefits) is 60% of journeyman wages which are $36.83 hr, and we just renegotiated the contract so we‚Äôre getting $10 over the next 5 years. 

Our benefits are: 80/20 health insurance + vision + dental ($8.50hr), HSA ($0.60 hr), pension ($10 hr), annuity ($6.70 hr), vacation ($2.50 hr) <‚Äî contractor pays all that 

Total package is $66.29 and pay + are also paid at 1.5X or 2X 

Just fyi
I would unionize simply out of spite if my employer put up flyers like this one.
I am a pipe welder in Ohio. My union package is 72$. 47$ an hour and the remainder is dispersed between an annuity 2 pensions (local and national) and a vacation fund. Previously I was making 25$ in a factory with a measly 2$ an hour in benefits. On a bad day I would weld out and physically move 1 ton of product before lunch all while developing no marketable skills. I now work at the highest level of welding which is engaging and rewarding. The pace is safe and the tools to do the job keep you from destroying your body. and I learned the finer points of commercial hvac which is insanely lucrative as side work. The fact that companies work so hard to keep you from unionizing is all the proof you need that it is the best thing for you. I pay less than half of one paycheck per year in union dues. Respect yourself. Go outside your comfort zone. Apply to your local union. And live a life you never dreamed possible.
If you want to ‚Äúget the facts before you decide‚Äù you should get in touch with your local union. Flyers like these are anti-union propaganda put out by employers to discourage organizing.
Technically some of this is illegal. An employer can restate facts about unions, and can give their own opinion, but they can't really tell you what you should do or make any sort of threats vague or otherwise. But I imagine if this crap is what their flyers look like they probably are doing weirder shit behind closed doors. Ultimately a union is an organization made up of employees, and it's a democracy, that's it. The employees will decide what they want, that's it. Employers will always try and paint it as some outside force but it's not really, it's a representative democratic organization.
If the company doesn‚Äôt think you need a union, you need a union.
Not all unions are great but a union is better than none at all.
Looks like some language that would be worth checking with a local union leader. NLRB charges are a real thing and only certain things can be said by both sides.
Yes, a private wage organization trying to keep costs down‚Ä¶
I have a union job right now and top pay in 2028 tops out at 43/hr and we will see what the next contract brings after 2028
Brother up.
Join the union. That document is very very biased. Unions get you better wages and benefits and help protect you from bullshit.

Join the union.

Join the union.
Hey man , im a union sheet metal workIer and i love it.  The great training and the companies that care about us.   These companies work in partnership with the unions and they are not scared by them.
They seem worried they might have to pay you more.
This is because your boss is scared, that‚Äôs how you know its a good idea.
They write like they think you‚Äôre a child. Are you?
Unions are as good as the people who run them
Just remember it's cheaper for them to print this up then it is to pay you union wages.
Unions exist to protect workers and their income, benefits, safety, job security, vacation time and ability to collectively bargain.  

Whoever wrote this "fact sheet" is a cherrypicking scaremonger who doesn't want you to have those things.
Lol, the exploiters getting nervous
My union dues are percentage based but I paid $45 in dues out of a $3,000 gross paycheck. Not too bad.
Union worker here: don‚Äôt hesitate unions are not scary. 
 
Just remember they are only as good as your members, your leadership and your contract.
It's all bullshit because they're terrified of unions.

Don't take advice from your opponent; they wouldn't fight with and nail to keep you from joining a union if it wasn't a threat to their authority.

They'd gladly spend more money on union-busting than they would fostering the kind of environment that would make a union less likely. 

Fuck them; unionize.
Propaganda and disinformation campaigns are acts carried out by tyrants who fear losing control.

United, we stand. Go union.
That's a common union busting strategy. They don't want you to band together because you'll get more money out of them that way.
I'm in a union and it's the best thing to ever happen to our work place. Making 20% more and the schedule improved. They even gave other departments a raise to avoid them unionizing lol. Some unions are bad, most are good but the employer will always fight them with propaganda ha ha. I loved my union so much I ran for and was elected to the board. Now I get to help the new hires not get taken advantage of by management. 

That said, I even like our managers, it's just their bosses who are the greedy pricks ha ha

Edit: my union dues for the first 5 years we're paid for by the raise I got my first year of a contract.
ALWAYS. UNIONIZE.

Collectively you can work to preserve your rights. Alone, you get pitted against each other and exploited. Co-op wins, not competitive.
We are USW at the steel plant I work at. Because of the union we have the best benefits I've ever heard of (my deductible for health insurance is $500). We get paid mid 30s (that's low for my area) for maintenance work and welding but with our production bonuses (again, union fought for benefits) I made nearly $100k last year and I worked no overtime for half the year. I just worked my 8 hour shift and went home. The benefits make up for the lower wage and factoring in the healthcare it's as if I make $50+. These things alone are %100 worth being in the union for and ~$30 a month in dues for these benefits and having a collective of people that have your back is worth the price. 

Word of warning though. It takes hard work and passionate people to keep a union healthy and thriving. Going to meetings, communicating with your brothers and sisters, and having each other's backs is essential. My union has lost that over the years and it is very hard to get that drive going again. 

I don't think I will ever go non-union again. Best decision I've made in my life so far was too go for a union job.

These cards hold some truth to them but they seem like scare tactics to make people back away from forming a union.
I have a union job and I‚Äôve never had such amazing benefits. I‚Äôm never leaving.
As someone who went from a union position to a non union supervisory position at my workplace.

As non union I get worse health insurance. Less vacation accrual. No personal days. Less 401k match. And my pay was not raised the last 4 years when union employees were, leading to my current situation where a new hire makes more per hour than me. 

If your workplace is so strongly against something, it's because it's in their best interest, not yours.
Look at UPS vs FedEx.
Even if I weren't pro-union I think I'd sign that card just to stick it to the ass-hat who made that flyer.
Yea I'm a union member and it has benefited me tremendously. I've never had an employer offer me any kind of benefits until now. I got 3 teeth removed and 5 crowns for $20. I can smile again... For $20... Let that sink in.
I am British, and even i can tell that poorly written toilet paper is pure propaganda to stop you joining the union.
I would put this down as another grand old lie from the republican party.
Not only are they trying to give tax cuts to the rich, but they are also trying to stop you bettering your career from joining the union.
That's fear mongering propaganda.  I'm a Union Boilermaker and I believe that everyone doing what I do should be because I've met people who were non union that do what I do and have been fucked by companies because of an injury or because of using cheaper labor through legal loopholes. You just don't  join for yourself, you join for the men and women you stand next too. It also gives you a chance to argue and issue you have without your job being help over you like a bargaining chip. Remember for most large companies the only reason they even offer help to any of there employees in need is because of the fear of unionization. The non union people who say they have great work lives is because of what the unions have done. Just go back and look at historical working conditions that happened that caused the unions to form in the first place. But you have to remember to also try to keep your union under control through your vote to keep it from getting to greedy. Ask the union rep. What's been going on in your profession and why it's even becoming an issue(from their side). You might find out some shit you weren't aware of.
I frequently take the word of my company at face value, they only want what's best for me after all! This is just good advertising for the union imo.
You still make more even after paying your dues lol
Having reviewed numerous tax returns across various types of entities, it's clear that companies can offer more time off and better benefits. The gap between employee wages and the income of executives, partners, and S-Corp shareholders is enormous. Stand up for your fair share by joining a union!
Don't believe the propaganda, union up!!!!
Positives: benefits, pension, raises, paid holidays, paid sick leave, paid vacation, paid boots, paid meal per diems. 

Cons: dues, CAN hinder ability for professional development, gets paid the same as the guy who can‚Äôt weld for shit. 

I‚Äôve been in and out of unions. I‚Äôll be staying within the union. Sincerely, 11 year member that just got a 9.5% market adjustment.
I was an auto mechanic for 30 years, mostly in car dealerships, and they were absolutely horrible.  All non-union.  I would up at an air force base (civilian contractor at the motor pool) and it was my first union shop.  It was an amazing difference.  Good pay, guaranteed raises, better benefits, more vacation/sick days, etc.   And when management wanted to do crooked a Shit, we filed grievances and we won them (most times). The key is to have strong leadership and people who aren't afraid to step up and push back to enforce your cba.  Feel free to DM me with any specific questions.   I am now a full time union rep, btw
Also....fuck the company you work for. Unionize!!!! ‚úäüèª
 
If your boss is trying that hard to stop you from unionizing it means that a union will Mike your life 100% better as an employee
If your employer is so against it, there is a good reason. You will benefit. Going union was the best thing I ever did for myself and my family.
Union dues are fuckin cheap ü§£ü§£ü§£. 

"If you sign this paper you'll have to pay .25 per hour in dues, if you don't sign this paper you'll continue making $15 less per hour!" "Don't sign!"
Ignore it, there's a reason your boss doesn't want you to unionize.

I'll put it to you this way: If the vote passes and you guys unionize you'll have to work with management to come up with a contract and then all have to sign that shit. You should ask yourself "Who in their right mind would go through the incredibly risky ordeal of unionizing only to get a contract where employees would be making LESS money than before?" The answer is no one because that's ridiculous. I've looked at a lot of unions, the fees are NOT expensive. It's just your run of the mill anti union bullshit.

I think unions ought to be more popular, however a union is not automatically better for you than not. Often it is, but it's a case by case basis. Of course, a good union will help the people who pay dues more than they could do on their own, but just don't automatically assume union = improvement because there are wasteful and corrupt unions out there. Do your research, know your union leaders, and make an informed decision. And know your employer, be wary, because I've seen companies totally clean house over stuff I didn't think they would, including serious union talk. 

I know this might seem like the most fencesitting post ever, but often the right decision is more about shades of gray.
I‚Äô gladly pay $81 a month for job security, top wages in my area, pension at $80 x year per month when I retire $80 x 20 years= $1600 per month on top of social security.

That‚Äôs just some of the benefits for what I pay
My union dues are 2 1/2 hours of pay a month. For that, i get industry leading pay (obligatory, i‚Äôm not a professional welder, but the point stands) free healthcare, a pension‚Ä¶ 100% worth it
Union worker here. Unions are,totally worth it. Don‚Äôt listen to your bosses, they don‚Äôt have your interests at heart.
Well if it does go though, congrats on the raise
Ignore anti-union propaganda and be wary of anybody pushing anti-union rhetoric, because they‚Äôre not on your side.
[Common union busting lies.](https://ibewyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2022-The-Dirty-Dozen-booklet-1.pdf)

My favorite part about being union other than the better pay and benefits, is the added dignity it gives you. When you have an agreed upon contract between both management and labor, you can more easily stand up for yourself when they try to go against that agreement, and they can‚Äôt just switch things up on you and change the rules, schedule, compensation, etc on a whim.
yea bro don‚Äôt join in the foreman said he‚Äôll stop the annual pizza parties if you do üò∞
Unionization? YES!

Anytime I was in a unionized shop/factory, I had better pay and benefits in the long term and also most if not all safety concerns I brought forward were addressed quickly.
They don‚Äôt want union because they can‚Äôt oppress you anymore. Being in a union is like having your own team of lawyers defending your rights as a worker. They also can‚Äôt fire you for nothing anymore. Also dues are like $50 a month wtf üòÇüòÇüòÇ
There‚Äôs power in a union. Even a bad one.
‚ÄúUnion dues are expensive‚Äù 
My window dues are $32 a month and then 2% of my gross income. Now, when you add it up it may seem like a decent chunk of change, but what they fail to tell you is that unionized employees for the most part make a lot more than non-union. So you will pay some money back to the union but you‚Äôre probably going to get a $15-$20 raise AND better benefits by going union.  

‚ÄúViolating union rules are costly‚Äù - yeah there are rules when you‚Äôre part of an organization that does a hell of a lot of good for you and you decide to not follow them. 

‚ÄúCannot guarantee any change‚Äù - Unions have working conditions and other rights in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that cannot be taken away. More than likely, these working conditions are better than the ones you have now and going union will guarantee you get those.
Statistically, ‚Äúfuck off.‚Äù

Fight as hard as you can to be unionised. Your employer will always view you when all comes down to the wire as a commodity.

Respond-in-kind.
Wow sounds like your employer is looking out for you and not just concerned about their bottom line! 
They definitely won‚Äôt let you go as soon as it‚Äôs financially beneficial for them, they love you and will cry at your funeral!
Most of the digs @ Unions on there are things the employer is def already doing to the employees so the  scare tactic is kinda funny considering....Do You get invited to sit in on mtgs & have Your voice heard presently w/out a Union?  

Yes joining a Union is a commitment & not all are great- but You cannot expect mgnt or HR to have Your back if things go wrong w/ You or the co.

Also- look it up, in areas that have more Union density than not- other working class workers have a better standard of living- the whole: "Rising boat lifts all tides".
Classic union busting tactics. They‚Äôre so lame. Democracy in the workplace reduces employers‚Äô abilities to exploit their workers. Plain and simple. Not all locals are created equal, but they‚Äôre all better than the prospect of negotiating individually.
Union organizer here. This poster is nothing but lies. This poster is an illegal unfair labor practice violation and it should be reported immediately. You can report this to the NLRB if you're not working with a union organizer. If you're working with a union organizer, be sure to send this to them so they can report this. 

Here's the truth about union cards:
- Signing a union card only means that you support unionizing your workplace and you want that union to represent you
- You pay nothing when you sign a union card
- Signing a union card does not enroll you in the union
- Signing a union card is confidential (the union is able to guarantee this anonymity by using a third party mediator to validate the signatures)
- Signing a union card adds a layer of protection; if the company were to illegally retaliate against you, the union would be able to file charges on your behalf

Union cards are only used to show your support for forming a union. To think of it another way, signing a union card means you want to see what you can get from the union.
The only reason a company does this is because they know they've been treating workers unfairly and they know it will cost them when they are forced to change their ways. Think about it...
If they go through the trouble of pointing out possible issues; it‚Äôs because it will benefit you more than them. Sign the fuck out of it.
If you can join a union do it, best decision I‚Äôve ever made and some amazing experiences being able to travel the country while making money doing it
Man, just join. I once worked at a Walmart distribution center for like a month...several hours of the orientation was all about how unions were out to get your money and tell you what you can and cannot do. They also gave us us instruction on how to file for foodstamps. I wish I were making this up...
There is no negative to joining a union. Dues included I still make more now don't let them lie to you. And my pension is way better than a 401k. I have gripes but I think we all will have them. It's still way better than before when I was non-union.
Pay $100/month to double your pay and have a team backing you up when shit gets real.

What's left to consider?
TOGETHER WE BARGAIN, DIVIDED WE BEG!

Everything on there is the company not wanting you to have the ability to sit at the table as equals with them. It REALLY bothers management that a union gives them that opportunity through the power of collective bargaining.

Unions are the last thing we got! Get involved and get organized!
Your employer is a joke for putting that out there
They wouldn‚Äôt be yelling and pulling their hair out with this intense letter if they thought it wouldn‚Äôt result in them paying you more
Your boss really wants his new yacht. Why would you deny him his new yacht?
He needs somehwere to stash his mistress and wine collection.
I want to join a union so bad
You sign a contract when you buy a car, or phone. I rather pay the Union Dues than pay an attorney.
This seems a unfair labor practice.  section 8(a)(1)  national labor relations act.
Yea üíØ a unfair labor practice   the employer to not allowed to "convey a message the selecting a union would be futile"
Twice I‚Äôve worked for companies with unions and both times the unions intervened on employees behalf‚Äôs to our benefit. Once was identifying an errors in overtime pay that took place over the course of year, leading to a fairly significant check being issued to us by the company. The second time they negotiated for better contracts for us since our job descriptions were slightly changing at a college I worked for.
I‚Äôll put it this way, if the company was paying fair rates and benefits, there would be no reason to unionize. Instead they see the writing on the wall, and want to scare anyone on the fence to backdown. Don‚Äôt. If the threat of a union is so frightening to their bottom line, then someone is afraid of losing their yacht/vacation home in order to make the laborers not have to struggle to feed their families. If you weren‚Äôt decided before, seeing this anti union scare tactic is a sure sign that you need to unionize.
\[signs up even harder\]
It's 2024 and laborers are still wondering if they should band together for better conditions, pay, and benefits. The propaganda runs deep. Join the union, no one is going to fight for you except yourselves.
Sounds like an employer really doesn‚Äôt want to pay its employees. Unionizing is going to give better pay and more protections. The union will help negotiate terms and ensure the employer follows them. This generally means employees won‚Äôt get fired for no reason. It‚Äôs almost always better be unionized.
There is strength in numbers. Don‚Äôt be selfish and just think of yourself
Most u ion busting is illegal and most employers are not clever or subtle enough to stay on the legal side of that sort of action. Get this photo to someone at the ACLU or a union organizer. Most organizers aren‚Äôt too up on the subtleties either, but they all have a pipeline to lawyers who absolutely are.
UA has provided me with so many benefits and hourly wages I will never think about leaving. Gonna retire at 55
Join that union. Itll be hell for them to fire you cause you did it. 

My last job.. the boss. Mr. Asshole, threatened to fire everyone because we joked about forming a union. I dont think he was thinking with his head brain on that one...
Another thing to think about once how obvious it is that being in a union is better for all workers is how disrespectful, coercive and downright shitty it is for your employer to try this tactic. 

One of your bosses has sat down in a meeting and actively come up with a plan to prevent the workers he depends on for _his_ own livelihood from having the pay, rights and safety standards they deserve. It‚Äôs absolutely fucking disgusting and I would treat them with the same level of contempt and hatred that they have shown me. Then to add insult to injury, they‚Äôve gone about the process of trying to influence you in the most childish, insulting manner possible. Fliers with literal bullshit propaganda, printed using gotcha style font/editing that actual schoolchildren could do a better job with. You should be apoplectic with rage at how this has been handled.

As an addendum, I‚Äôd immediately sign up to said union and spend as much time as possible arguing the above points and getting my coworkers to sign up too. Fuck these greedy, arrogant, self-serving cockwombles.
I worked non union for years.  Mistreated and underpaid.   I joined the ironworkers union and have never looked back.
You would be wise to sign soonest. Retired now, and have worked both union and non. Was a time when you could work without, but it seemed to change under Reagan. Companies NEVER have your interests at heart, and if they did, they wouldn't care if you unionized.
You should be in a union. Your bosses don‚Äôt want you to join one. That should tell you that it‚Äôs a good idea
They did the same shit at the company I worked with. They pushed as much as they could legally to stop the union. I signed and left the company soon after. Going union is the best thing I've ever done. UA all the way
Don‚Äôt u know unions are super bad?

That‚Äôs why every cop in the USA has a union, has a union and can get away with literal outright murder

We need to take some union from the police and give it to ourselves, so it evens out and we all get respected and no one is aloud to murder anyone else
In my area UA dues local+regional are around $3k a year, total package is around $70 per hour, $46 per hour on the paycheck. I believe $2 per hour is worth $4000 per year on a 40 hour work week. So if you're bringing home $70+ per hour with no benefits and no union you don't need us. Unless you get laid off or the company goes out of business and you want to pick up with a new contractor next week with the same pay and benefits you had. Unions are awesome it's a no brainer
i actually love being in a union. it kinda sucks bc say your a good worker and working w someone who absolutely has no work ethic and you make the same rate.. but it does have its pros. your job is pretty much safe with the union unless you do something pretty bad then you can be fired but union reps will fight for you and basically be your lawyer. union dues can be hefty but it comes w the territory. they take 2.8% of my pay every check. but also if your in a good union contract raises are always nice knowing you have a future raise where if your not in a union there is no guarantee of a raise from your company. i‚Äôm sure i can think of more but yeah i do enjoy being in the union.
Assuming this is for the UA:

Positives: better hourly rate, pension, health benefits, labour protections, free training and classes, consistent hours, proection from abusive management.

Cons: none really. Sometimes the Hall is too friendly with the mechanical contractors and suck at negotiating. But youre still better off than non union.
Uh, take the pension money and go with it. Anyone who tells you differently isn't in your benefit. 

Go to the meetings. Anyone who says union is no good, hasn't been to a meeting, and said that. 

Stand up at the meetings, have your voice heard, and you'll love it... get involved, be a steward, the more involved you are the more money you make.
My favorite is point 4 on that list, they make promises and employers don't try and make pretend promises that you will get a raise....
Would be great to do union if they actually idk.. took apprentices? I‚Äôve applied to multiple unions (each application costing money) and have been told that they‚Äôll give me a call and to not contact them. Still haven‚Äôt heard back years later
Refusal to sign these cards **and** **and** to oppose unionization. 

Well maybe if it were unionized they‚Äôd run a check for grammar.
Union pay is higher than non-union pay in every category that exists.
funny how it mentions state laws protecting your right to refuse signing the union card, but doesn't mention that state laws *rarely*, if ever, give you a *fraction* of the worker protections a union will.
the bots are out in full force on this one.

just waiting for the quinnjammin19 bot to reply to this
The *United* States is a union. The original colonies formed a union to protect themselves against the owner, Britain. They understood the importance of collective bargaining for better control over their own resources and protecting the rights of citizens. Instead of each individual colony having their own separate relationship with the owner, Britain. That leads to favoritism, shady dealings and civil war. Unionizing at your shop is just a tiny version of that grander experiment. It works, but like the United States, it‚Äôs not perfect and needs constant upkeep. Unions are a good thing and should be brought back!
I'm not a welder but I'm a nurse in California where our unions have the buracrats by the balls.  We enjoy the best working conditions and pay I've ever heard of.  Even the non union hospitals have to shape up if they want to keep staff.
UNION ALL THE WAY!
Unions are so fucking good
All the Union authorization card does is prove to the NLRB that the Union has the required support to file a representation petition, nothing more

I can only tell you that line is yellow is a lie.  I‚Äôve seen union folks keep their jobs for the same thing non union guys got fired quicker than you could snap your fingers.
Do it
‚úä
Shred that
If management are so desperate to stop you joining a union, that's a pretty good reason to join a union.
How to make a $5000 dollar job into a $25,000 dollar job
Having to pay dues is such a BS "argument". I don't even know what my union dues were, don't care. I also like the thing about following rules, LOL. Are they telling me non union shops have no rules?
I worked for Chart in Tulsa, they are trash companies.

I have seen them do mass layoffs while working overtime, just insane stuff.
and and
"Nobody gets preferential treatment for being in a union"


Lmao, I see tons of union only bids, never seen a non-union only bid
There is a big shift when you are no longer of ‚Äúat will‚Äù work status.
What bs, still not joining IBEW though.

I gotta laugh at that loser who didn‚Äôt have the balls to mention meü§£ 

Did you notice that he never once gave any factual information? Just made claims that I was a bot and a lazy worker? When I asked him to prove how I‚Äôm a lazy worker he just ignored it, when I asked him for proof how unions make ‚Äúlazy‚Äù workers he deflected. When I asked for proof of how non union is better he never had an answer. 

If someone thinks unions are bad because they don‚Äôt let everyone in they are completely uneducated. At the end of the day, this is a career that you need to meet requirements for, just like any other career. 

The beauty of OP‚Äôs situation tho is that they are unionizing their workplace, which means they are bringing a union into their workplace and everyone who signs the cards is a union member. So, situations like this actually allow all workers at that workplace to be union members. 

And the best part of all of this is, that little weasel blocked me after I called him out numerous times of not being able to prove a single shred of evidence to back up his claimsü§£ 

I did make fun of the little apprentice too, but he had it coming, people like that need to be put in their place when they have no idea what they are talking about
These are just scare tactics to get you to hesitate. Are all unions created equally? No. Are all employers looking to make money and pay you as little as they can for the work that you do? Absolutely.
If you aren‚Äôt in supervision and you are in the trades union is the way. I spent the first 15 years of my career in the union and the wages were always much higher and better benefits, training, legal support etc.
This is a pretty standard anti-union flyer from companies.  They always bring up dues and the ability to complain personally to your supervisor if there's issues.
Any union member will tell you the dues are no big deal, especially when you make a union wage.  They are also a tax deduction, in Canada anyway.
We all know what happens when employees bring up issues with management.  Management is generally favored, and the employee is fired for some obscure reason.  Employees don't want you to know your rights and have a union behind you to help enforce them.  This makes them accountable, and they hate it!
I‚Äôm going to say that not all unions are made the same. My stepdad is/was a lifelong Teamster and is very pro-union. 

My wife was in a union for 20-something years before leaving her old employer and all that Union did was protect the crappiest of workers and when her and one of her coworkers in their department was in a big jam, their union steward left them high and dry. Wouldn‚Äôt take a meeting with them to discuss what was going on, ignored messages and phone calls. Literally didn‚Äôt give a damn. Because they were hard workers and made other members of the union look bad because of it. 

She‚Äôs been out of that job for 2 years and last week they took her to collections for 2 years of unpaid union dues for a union she hasn‚Äôt been a part of for two years. 

So while you‚Äôll hear a lot of people here talking about how great a union is, there is a dark side to them.
The pros of unions are basically everything on paper. However, one major downside I've seen since becoming part of a Union are the fees. They're usually over $100 per check paid bi-weekly. This doesn't include the rest of the taxes and medical expenses that come out. So far, the union negotiated a $4.99 raise since I've been working at my current company. So that's huge. But other than that, they have done nothing else for me.
Where do I go to critique the (and and) mistake in the last box.
"You don't want to have an organization fighting for you, you're better at that by yourself!"
Ufcw2 is a god damned joke
Unions can be great, but they aren‚Äôt ALWAYS great all the time, my Dad and his coworkers got hung out to dry by thier union after years of paying dues. Remember, a unions job is to make money for the people that run the union. Do what you feel is in your best interest- but don‚Äôt trust that the union has your best interest in mind.
Not all unions are the same and not all are good, but the unions in more critical sectors tend to be the best. I recently started in boilermakers local 92, and my dues are 60 a month, they ensure my safety and well being, ive got a great pension, im represented well if ive got a serious problem with someone higher up (obviously not like a ‚Äúthis person called me dumb and now im angry‚Äù problem but more of a ‚Äúthis supervisor-foreman-whatever is very obviously creating an unsafe environment and i need back up to help keep my coworkers from getting seriously injured‚Äù way). The benefits beyond that are great, we make a fuck ton of money, and all the guys i work for and with are generally more willing to work harder and more properly knowing someones got their back. 

However IATSE local 83 as far as i understand blows, since its very in the pocket of production and theres generally little representation for workers, especially those like medics.
GeT tHe FaCtS!    everything will be better for you!
And and
Been a union journeyman lineman for 37 years, wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way
I‚Äôve been in a union for the last 21 years and I have a million dollars in my pension already, lifetime medical too. Everyone should have this, it‚Äôs our right as workers who give the majority of our lifetimes to a job. So many people will never get to retire and will work until they die. Go union and give yourself a chance at life after working.
Oh no! Not a return to the days of living wages and worker protection from employer abuse and harassment! How are we supposed to be told we need to get the job done even if it means we have to skip our breaks for the 70th shift in a row?
Political action leagues, union dues, meetings, educational programs, conferences and safety training programs. Plenty of fun activities. Industry standards are not just all. Aside from that, be careful with your health, welding ailments aren‚Äôt always discussed during your career, other than drink milk for galvanized poisoning and minimize your silica exposure when sanding. I‚Äôve seen and worked with an old welder. Take care of yourself
The fact they don't want you to do it should tell you it's better for you than them.
I'll never work union again. Too many pieces of shit get protection they don't deserve. This isn't a universal problem, and doesn't mean I'm entirely anti-union.
Why do so many companies put out anti union fliers and presentations. "Nooooooo please don't unionize I BEG YOU"
Unions are you and your coworkers, not an external force
Unionization is the practice of collective bargaining, AKA, a bunch of voices are louder than one. I can't think of a situation where being in a union is a bad thing but I hesitate to say there aren't any. Dues and fees are fundamentally decided by the collective group so it's much less likely that they'd be exploitative, as the people who make the choice pay the same fee.

I would almost immediately jump on it and laugh in the face of whoever made these fearmongering fliers, but I urge you to do your own research and make sure you know what you're getting into. They're at least right about that.
It's fair representation, you will almost certainly receive better and more regular raises, benefits, and retirement options. Your boss/company doesn't want you to unionize because it means they will be negotiating with an animal that has not been defanged. Company made a ton of money this year but for some reason you didn't get a raise? Not with a union. Company wants to rework your insurance to save money and force you to accept higher out of pocket costs and more restrictive networks? Not with a union. The list of benefits goes on and on.¬†
Join the union
Hey I work at the same place handing out those papers! Vote for the union brother, strength in numbers!
How do I get ahold of this union card? I work at the same place and want to know if I have to actively seek out the union and get a card or if there will be a big vote on it
Do it up.

The only real threat is that the shop closes its doors in the event it goes union.

I'm a part of the IBB, local 146. which is arguably the most corrupt union in North America, and it's still worth it to be a union welder making $55 plus benefits plus pension.

Unions aren't all rainbows and sunshine though.  They are still just run by people who are fallible and can cave to the pressures of the contractors  who pay them off when negotiating, but that's just the world we live in.
Cut is out and sign it.
written by someone who stands to lose their shirt (or at least their beach house) if their shop unionizes and fights to get paid what they are worth
Depending on the size of the shop/company they may go out of business.  The place I worked at before my union welding job at a railroad would have went out of business.  

I like unions for establishing what your job is and the requirements, no sweetheart deals with certain employees and rules against being taken advantage of or being punished.  95% of our union's leaders time is arguing to keep 5% of the members that probably should be let go.
Not all unions are created equal
Unions are cool. However the only issue I have as a welder. Just because you have your journeyman and are no longer an apprentice I find it doesn‚Äôt matter how hard I work and try to make things real nice the guy beside me can dog fuck and still get paid the same. Oh the other thing is some unions also file grievances against you if you‚Äôre not staying within your trade. That‚Äôs pretty shitty as well.
Depends... im in Britain working for a big government division (taxpayer funded) and unions are clearly a bloody nightmare!! 

Threats of stikes secured 1.5 hours less in our working week (woohoo) 

Boss put a questionnaire out to see what days suited individuals as the whole maintenance team can't be unavailable all at once. 

What did we do??? Joined together with x4 other maintenance workshops & 200 guys all put the same days as 1st, 2nd & 3rd choices. (Early finish on Friday) 

Why??? Just to hammer home how much power unions have. 

I'm mot saying they're all the same, but there's a very good reason UK doesn't have a lot of love for unions. Myown father had to go work in germany during the 1980s because the miners unions had brought the country to a standstill
If you get performance based raises or make more than coworkers doing the same job because you're better at it, a union might implement pay scales where everyone makes the same rate. So you could end up making less money. Sometimes unions protect the average and below average performers at the expense of the best performers. If you happen to know you're making a good bit more than your coworkers I would not join
When inwas young I told them to do one. Then an older mentor talked me into joining. Glad he did. You cant predict the future. The union have gotten me much more than I've paid in dues.
This is true unions workers have a lot less risk of doing work than normal hardworking people
Oh and unions are destroying America‚Ä¶
So it‚Äôs kind of like getting the vaccine? Totally and completely optional? Oh wait..
I work for a company that has a Union, but I am NOT in it. 

     They "expect" everybody to enroll in the Union during orientation. They asked me 2 days into the job, which of course makes me suspicious so I asked the question "what if I don't join"? They told me, "They cannot MAKE you join the Union. The Union will still represent you, because it's a right to work state and that's when many people decide to join the Union. After they see what the union will do for them." Guess the question is, when that happens, and you need  someone to represent you. Will they send their best? ü§ûMaybe. Either way I'm still not in the Union nor do I want to be, at this point.
Probably more than that if you factor in benefits and pensions.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm in a union, I make close to 30$ more an hour than non union in my area. Health insurance was 800 a month now I pay 380 for family with a hsa. Have matched 401k and one with the union. 3 weeks vacation and 2 weeks sick. 

For me it was a no brainer to take the money and benefits.
I'm not a a welder but im a plumber who just went union..my paycheck more then doubled and the benefits alone are worth more then my pay before
Lemme bump that up. I make roughly 20-60% more than my non union counter parts locally depending on certifications and experience I make 250% more than the National average.
"They're just making money off you!"

"I make $52/hr to flag traffic."
I see this comment a lot. Let‚Äôs keep in mind statistics account for both sides of the story. I‚Äôm not in a union and I make more great wages, with great benefits and work with great people. I‚Äôm very happy with my work situation, I have a very good life. 

Would like people to know union is not the ONLY way to go. This is only my story and I do not intend to persuade anyone to NOT join a union.
How much of that 20% is union dues?
it's not only about wages
This is really all that ever needs to be said in the discussion about unions. 

If unions weren't good for the employees, why would so many companies try so very hard to push them away?
The amazing thing is the non union shops charge about the same to the customers.
>which translates to higher expense for the employer.

Which seems to also translate to the CEO won't get as many millions in end of the year bonuses, boo hoo.
I went from 20$ an hour with about 40$ a week taken out of my check for insurance when I was a scab to 35$ an hour with fully paid benefits when I joined up with the millwrights. On top of that I do the same job. The union also makes me basically impossible to fire. If you are in the US it is your only hope of having a pension.
Collective bargaining means everybody wins, and I mean everybody. They hold you to a higher standard, yes, but they also make the market more competitive and cannot take what they give you away. Open shops do not abide by those same rules
Me in union, union good, me happy.
Even non-union employees in unionized sectors see an upward pull on their pay and benefits to stay remotely competitive with the union positions.

If unions didn't work, billionaires wouldn't be so scared of them.
14% increase in pay, plus pension, plus benefits. And all you have to pay is 1-2%. It's a no brainer.

And the fact that the company is posting these should tell the employees everything they need to know. Everyone knows the company isn't on your side.

Also, just so everyone is clear, when you join a union they usually choose your company's employees to join them at negotiations so that your voice is heard. I have sat in on such negotiations with my company.

You can always form your own union, but the benefits of joining a large union are: better economic security in case of strike, negotiators who are familiar with negotiating contracts, and that they know ALL of the things that should be in your contract that you might overlook otherwise.
UA Pipefitter here. Yes, the United association of welders,fitters,plumbers,and hvac is the best place to be for a welder. We get paid more, and we get a benefits package that is amazing. Plus if you want to travel, the road money is insane. Refinery shutdowns can pay 100$ an hour, plus your benefits, plus 70-100$ daily per diem. Now put that into a 6-12‚Äôs , or 7-10s work week and do the math. Road dogs make 150k regularly, it all depends on you, and how much you want to work. Our local has an amazing jurisdiction, I have never been on the bench for more than a week, maybe two once or twice. In 5 years I would say I spent a total of maybe 6 weeks on the bench waiting for work. We get free prescriptions, free urgent care, individual deductible is 250$, after that we pay 20%. Family deductible is 1500$, then you qualify for 20%, with max out of pocket being less than 4k. Our local has 1$ an hour annuity included. So when you retire you not only get 2 pensions, but a check for 150k or more.
All I'm seeing here is their employer is scared and pissed that they are unionizing. Good for OP, I hope they get the union in there.
#OUR PAY COMRADES
Management is sweating rn
Yep. As I read this, it came as if it was the owners themselves.
This exactly. Find an actual organizer if you want to join. If you sign this they make up bs to fire you.
Yep. Guaranteed, if they're putting out low effort propaganda like this their only goal is to keep you out of the union, NOT put your interests first. And if they're more interested in preventing a union than showing you why you don't need one... Then you need one.
It's not propaganda, it's facts
The problem in my job, however is, that no matter how much they claim they'll help they show no sincere signs of elaborating on how they will accomplish all of the great things they want to do to improve things for us- just like they did in the other hospitals. We have yet to be incorporated and am looking forward to opting out of becoming a paying member. The union in our hospital has not handled the negotiations gracefully and have become a sort of nuisance, causing delays in a solid organization which promised somewhat a better pay and working conditions (staffing). They're losing my trust for sure, not that they had any to start with.
> Union employees generally get better pay/benefits as well as protections which translates to higher expense for the employer.

[edited to add] Apparently the concept that that higher wages paid to union employees doesn't magically appear but has to come out of the owner's pockets is controversial. People here apparently think companies also run on magic and that increasing expenses never has consequences.[/edit]

The only tradeoff of this is...

A unionized company is more likely to fail.

Because it's driven to fail, by higher costs, of the union wages.

Also, because of the massively lower efficiency of union policies.

As long as the company has huge excess profits, a union takes money out of the owner's pockets and gives it to the workers. But when times are tough, there's no extra to take, and the company goes under. In general it will go under because of years of being unable to run as lean and competitive as it could have, as innovative as it could have, and because the lowered profits meant the company wasn't worth investing more money in.

But here's the great thing...

If a union kills a company, who cares? At worst, you're back in the same shoes you would've been before you unionized... looking for a job in a non-union competitor shop.

Unions are universally a nightmare for the company owners, and a dream come true for the employees.

Your company does not need your charity, and wouldn't give you any of its charity or loyalty in return. Slip the knife between its ribs and twist the blade if it suits your purposes, and do so with a clear conscience.
Union pipefitter here. Mine are $37/month and working dues of ~6%. So right now i pay $3.80/hr worked. But I pay nothing else I‚Äôm a foreman so I make 10% more than a journeyman and that puts me at $64/hr. It‚Äôs well worth the dues
I work night shift, do you think I'd get a better differential than what I've currently got?
And talking about how signing a union card is a legally binding contract that we would have to sign, like we didn't sign a legally binding contract when joining the company in the first place.
Why should they update a perfectly good anti-union screed that was perfected in 1996?
Chart is a decent sized company too. I would think they could do better
Indeed. Agreed.
That doesn't sound like much. Can you just be let go for whatever reason?
I did some quick math and I pay about $3580 per year in union dues, but I made $105k last year and my employer pays for all of my benefits.  We have amazing insurance and don't have to spend a dime on it, we also get an HSA that my employer pays into.  All of that together means my healthcare is basically free.  I got an injury this year that would have set me back more than $30k but my union actually paid ME disability while I was out of work.  I don't give two shits about the dues I pay.  They're worth every penny.
My dues are $30 a month.
I don't even know how much my dues are‚Ä¶ That's how much it doesn't matter. I pay $99 a quarter, and there is a specific amount that comes off my check based on how many hours I work. There is a cap for that.
I work at this company as well, no one has told me how we sign the card, is it something that we‚Äôll all vote on or do we have to actively seek out the union and get a card from them to sign?
I worked the same type of job in a union and non union show. Non union is 100X better. Unions are great if you‚Äôre not good at your job but they really knee cap you if you are.
This is extremely correct
So glad to see the pendulum finally swing this way.  It's great that people are getting that fed up.  People are tired of being pushed around.  Join.  That.  Fucking.  Union.
I'm an electrician and am constantly in awe of what the ironworkers get in their contracts.  If they have to climb 100' of stairs to start work they get an extra half hour of pay.  Plus, if it starts to rain they get to go inside and just hang out.  I would never want to do their work, but their contract is SOLID.
I don‚Äôt think they are for fed anymore. TCJA took that away but I believe it expires eventually.
‚ÄúWere ‚Äú
I‚Äôm union btw and trump signed that away
They are not. But if you're at the point where you're debating about a minor tax deduction, you need the union. They'll improve wages and you won't need that deduction.
"Look at the productivity of Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. A strong unionized workforce does not destabilize a country. The distribution of wealth and productivity both increase."

This is unamerwican
To be fair, it doesn't look like they spent much producing that flyer.....
I'm living in Georgia, probably the heart of anti union country over here. I'd love to get some extra resources on unions for sure.
That I should definitely join a union lol. I mainly looking for talking points so I can negate the negative thought processes a lot of my coworkers have against unionizing.
I'll be signing up for the local Carpenters Union next week! wish me luck! üôèüôè
Local 17 here!
Employers have literally killed people to stop them from unionizing.  That tells you everything you need to know.
Wouldn't the local union just provide you the pro-union propaganda?
Thats exactly what I thought, they put 2 to a table and are hanging them on the walls. I'm wanting to get some facts so I can confidently talk to coworkers. I'm doubting its going to happen though because apparently most people here have had bad run ins with unions
Which part would be illegal?
Brother. I pay 2.5 hrs per month. That's like 120ish. Ny weekly pay is like $4300. If you can't afford the union dues, you need the union. The dues aren't even noticeable after the pay.
I wish I had paid vacation.
I don‚Äôt agree that it can hinder ability for professional development‚Ä¶ a union you‚Äôre a member of wants to see you succeed, I‚Äôve gotten nothing but support from my local when I sign up for courses and take initiative to 1: better educate myself and 2: make myself more versatile and attractive to contractors. They paid for my rope access training, they were excited and supported me and answered any questions I had when I got my first gig as foreman on a shutdown when I was 25/turning 26. 

Hindering growth is a lie
>gets paid the same as the guy who can‚Äôt weld for shit. 

That shouldn't matter. It's like if I said we shouldn't have invented the car because young folks should have to walk to work like I did.
My supervisor had said we would lose a bunch of benefits if we unionized and I said " what like the pizza parties and kona ice the comes around once a year?" Lol.
I'm non union and we have plenty of useless eaters as well. Our employer is always sure to make sure the journeyman rate is close to the union. It's almost impossible for them to higher a pipefitter or pipe welder because most go union. 

The only benefit we get I guess is we are always working and the work enivornment is not bad at all.
Sheet metal trade in Michigan doesn't make you pay a thing. Pass some tests, drug screen and you're a pre apprentice if you show hussle and drive.

Hope you get a spot somewhere. Don't give up!
lol.
I'm pretty sure hes not a bot. Looking through his posts. Kinda braggy but whatever.Not everyone can join a union when theres a wait list of people. Exclusivity is what drives wages up for all professions. Its not easy joining a labour union and usually they are very selective and you have to pay to apply. 

People don't know what survivorship bias is apparently.

Management gonna manage
I keep seeing this about supervision. But I‚Äôm my local members are covered all the way up to general foreman. The only people out of the collective agreement are superintendents and above
Union dues are nothing my guy. I paid $5.5k in dues (tax refundable) and I made $122k in only 9 months of work last year‚Ä¶ dues are fuck all
I've honestly got no idea, they said that there are going to be talks about it but only thing I've heard about it is a meeting they had when I wasn't there about how bad the union is for us. I think we definitely should form a union, I think it would benefit everyone who works there. I'm just not so certain of the people we work with, I don't think most people there want to join a union.
Please explain how it‚Äôs shitty that other trade unions file grievances? It‚Äôs shitty that you‚Äôre stealing their work to begin with. Don‚Äôt be a rat, work your trade, the trade that you get paid to do. Instead of stealing work. 

Also, the shitty workers are first laid off.
You like to steal work from other trades? You sound like a shit worker.
That's a terrible reason not to join- Unionization isn't just about the 1 worker, it's about those coming up behind that 1 & Their cadre.  

We used to have many strong Unions & industries...Ppl fell for the okeydoke w/ what mgnt said & over the decades worker power has severally dwindled, allowing vultures like the amazons of the world to run roughshod over workers.
So you think that union members CAN‚ÄôT be paid over scale? 

Did you drink the kool aid that hard? 

Paying union members over scale is a common and accepted practice, if people are worth it. A company will pay. A collective agreement is only the bare minimum
Wait, if that‚Äôs true then how come I worked 7-14s for 3 weeks straight at the end of a shutdown?
Unions are definitely not destroying anythingü§£
And this ‚òùüèª

Is the definition of a freeloader 

Don‚Äôt be like this guy
Absolutely. The 20 is just in wages
And fucking annuity if you‚Äôre lucky
And do way less work lol.
If you have to try to defend non union against factual statements then you‚Äôre fighting a losing battle. 

Unions are better than non union 90% of the time or more‚Ä¶ unions are the reason why you actually make a great wage. Unions are the reason why we don‚Äôt make $6/hr and work 7 days per week 52 weeks per year.

https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm
bUt wHaT aBoUt uNiOn dUeS - everyone who‚Äôs drank the kool aid that the rich corporations have fed the sheep
because we are a family here! nad a union is just outsiders telling you not to work "with us"üò¢üò¢
Exactly!! My job offers a ESOP program because they don‚Äôt want a union. They even had the employees at the time vote on it
Tell that to our teachers who are in unions, get paid shit, literally assaulted by students, union ain't doing shit for them.
Actually there is another discussion to have on unions and that's how the model works in big cities but bankrupts small town businesses. I don't have an option to join a union unless I move closer to Toronto. Working up north the margins and companies are smaller and they can't afford to go union. I'd love to have the option but it just doesn't work. So when people say everyone should join a union they are really just speaking to trademen in cities.
P I've brought this up many of times. 


If the union was shit and did shifty work  how come they have work and pay their guys twice as much. 


Waiting on the call atm.   Fuck these owners using their daddies company they got handed as their credit card.
Read up: [https://ibewyes.org/dirty-dozen/](https://ibewyes.org/dirty-dozen/)

It explains the tactics your employer is using on that paper.
Its why walmart, amazon, and every other huge megacorp does everything they can even paying fines for illegal union busting.¬†


Its cheaper overall to pay 5million every 5 years for illegal practices than to pay 10s/100s of millions in higher wages over every year.
Sounds communist.
Keep spouting this horseshit while I make $47/hr with 175 per diem working for companies that have been around 70+ years with no worries anywhere on the horizon of going under. üòÇ
Lmao, you drank the kool aid so hard little boyü§£ü§£
It is extremely possible but you have to put the work in. A union is only as strong as the members. If you expect a union to do everything for you, you will not get much. If you and your coworkers do the work to build a strong union you can get massive gains!!
Yes, I believe you would. I know not every local or union has the same contract but our nightshift premium is 20%
Night shift in my local depends on the job. If there's no day shift, then night gets time and a half. If there is a day shift,  then it's either time and a half or a few bucks more than scale. All depends.
In all union outfits I‚Äôve heard of night shift gets a premium over day shift. I personally think the premium is too low for how much night shift sucks but it‚Äôs still something.
Committeeman here, just negotiated our egregious $.60 differential to $1.00 this last contract. Everything is on the table during negos.
Probably not. In my union if it‚Äôs a shift job I believe it‚Äôs only 10%.
Of course. Why wouldn't you? Why do you think it matters which shift you would work? Do you think unions only work for people who are day walkers? There's a vampire Union I bet
And GO TO YER FEKKIN LOCAL MEETINGS DAMMIT!!!

Edit: seriously, go to your local meetings. Get to know your treasurer and trustees, opportunities abound in a good local. Even for very high paying side gigs.
Night shift for Union where I'm at is a 15% pay bump
The funny thing is that signing that card is not a legally binding contract.  Signing that registration card says you *want* -- not that you *shall*.  That registration card says nothing about having read or agreed to the Labor Agreement and Constitution.
The places I work do have layoffs, but you keep your medical coverage and the union gets me my next job. My dues are 73 a month but I make double hourly what I did at the non union shop I started at. And the union has/does fight bullshit layoffs.

Another nice thing I like is we vote on our contracts. Feels a lot better than those performance review meetings for 2% with your manager being all preachy about how much he's done for you. Like you didn't show up and work the whole time.
Think of a union like a lawyer. They go to bat for you. If you're laid off, they find you another gig.¬†
No. The only thing that the union can't help you on is attendance, failed drug test is also a thing but there's way around that. Management has to show that they've gone through all the proper chanels to fire but anytime the try to write you up for anything the union is there to represent you. So say for whatever reason management  has tried to give you your first warning 7 different times but the union has gotten you out of all 7 that means management has given you 0 first warning. Now management isn't looking to fire people all the time but if you do get jammed up over something stupid then the union will fight for you.
Mine are $34
There are so many reasons to join a union, and zero reasons that you shouldn't. Unions aren't some magical entity that will keep you employed forever, but you will be far better off having been a part of one than not.
Almost $1k/yr
Yeah dues are definitely worth it. Companies make them out to be some big expense but it's not at all and all the benefits that come with it are great
Tbh I don‚Äôt know because I didn‚Äôt organize in, I was sponsored in, or hired by a contractor that was already a union contractor.

r/unions might be the best place to find the answers to all your questions, lots of good info in that sub!
Yeah, i've been on both sides of contractor and non contractor unions.

Non contractor unions are typically very weak, and are basically filled with company plants trying to pretend they're "pro worker".

Contractor unions are stronger cause like I said, don't like the company? Tell them to fuck off and go to the hundreds of others that are looking for workers.

It's very important to be aware of what type of union your joining, because not all unions are good, and not all unions are corrupt.
Say it louder for the trumper union members who keep voting against their own best interests.
I was able to deduct mine this last filing‚Ä¶
Yeah the South fought a war so they wouldn‚Äôt have to improve working conditions, and they still don‚Äôt want to.
I‚Äôm going to leave pamphlets around chart explaining the positives of unions, just gotta figure out how to do it discreetly
Hell yes brother! Best of luck!
They can provide actual facts about how much dues are, what benefits they offer, pay scales, training they provide, etc. of course they‚Äôre going to be biased, but this flyer the company put out only has vague assertions meant to sound scary, and no facts about what a union would provide. Leading with the assertion that dues and assessments are a serious financial burden says a lot about how honest this document is. Dues vary depending on the local, but they‚Äôre never a crazy amount like they‚Äôre pretending, ours are $32/month right now, that‚Äôs less than what I make an hour.
absolutely they would. 

they would try to convince you that you will be paid more and get better benefits and a pension. they act like its all going to be some happy Kumbaya time. 

no one ever mentions that the pension is a ponzi scheme and its going to collapse when all the boomers retire. 

as a personal issue, basically every union worker ive ever met is an lazy entitled douchebag. the smug attitude of knowing you can get by doing fuck all day in and day out, and never get fired is repulsive to me. that attitude makes me want to vomit.
Unions aren‚Äôt perfect, and every local is going to be different, at the end of the day it‚Äôs an organization made up of people, if it‚Äôs run by shitty people it won‚Äôt turn out good, but it‚Äôs also a democratic organization, every member has a voice in electing representatives and voting on how things are managed within the local. I spent my first few years working non union, then joined the UA in 2015 and haven‚Äôt looked back, literally the only downside is paying dues, but ours are less than the equivalent of 1 hour‚Äôs pay per month, and an additional $10 when a member (current or retired) dies that goes to their families. That‚Äôs well worth the better pay, better unemployment protections, better benefits, and better job security I‚Äôve experienced since joining.
It‚Äôs pretty nice. I get 4 weeks annually paid time off.
Congrats, you have an opinion.
Huh? I‚Äôm not going to try to make the correlation there but I‚Äôll re write what I was trying to say. You should be paid based off of your work performance and quality of work you perform.
Every union in southern Ontario makes you pay $20-$50 so they know you‚Äôre ‚Äúserious‚Äù. However it depends on who you‚Äôre in communication with on how much you gotta pay.
> I'm pretty sure hes not a bot.

\*shhhh\* its bait. 

> Not everyone can join a union when theres a waitlist of people

this is one of the negative things about unions that ive heard from a lot of people. what a barrier to entry.
Hey there! Just your typical bot replying! Just doing bot activities like finishing season 3 of House MD on Netflix with my fianc√©e and now going to play beer league two pitch! Definitely bot-like activities right?

You can say whatever you want about me. But I‚Äôve never lied, and I do talk with factual information. I do however think it‚Äôs cute that u/8yp00o19pB14Ic didn‚Äôt have the balls to mention me. 

You‚Äôre right, not everyone can get into a union via union halls. After all it is just like applying to any other employer right? You can‚Äôt just let everyone work at your workplace. The people who meet the requirements get an apprenticeship. That‚Äôs the fair way of doing it. 

But it is very much possible to unionize your workplace. In Canada it‚Äôs in our charter of rights and freedoms, which means that it actually is our right to be a member of a union. 
 
Beep-Boop-Beep

*powers down*
I think welding is cool and was considering a career change at one point.  Ended up finding a niche in hospice and palliative care but I still think welding is cool.
This is correct. To clarify, when you take a salary you almost always have to leave the union and as an experienced foreman most companies will pay union equivalent wages and benefits. In my case they matched union pay, ordered me a new truck and provided me with discounted stock options, better insurance and a 100% match to my 401 and IRA. My operators and laborers are making a couple dollars less than union at the high end and 5-6 dollars for the new guys coming in.
Hmm, wow. I didn't realize they were tax deductible.
This guy is the prime example of why unions are less than ideal sometimes.
You disagree that unions institute flat pay rates? If OP is really good at their job and their pay reflects it I'm just saying they might get a big pay cut in a union. Just something to be aware of before you sign
I clearly said "might" so no I don't think that
‚òùÔ∏èand this is what my coworker who's a union rep said. The vice president was grumbling about me asking the obvious question (what if we don't join?) it's simply an option you don't have to jump on bored right away, ask around first don't let them ambush you in orientation. 

Only people who get mad at this, are mad they didnt do their research. That's like being a sore loser because you didn't bother taking the shortcut, even though everybody in the race knows about it and uses it.
Lifelong union Steamfitter here. 

Everything yall said is true. I‚Äôd also like to add easier and MUCH cheaper access to continuing education and generally easier access to job opportunities.
This is the most true statement
yes.   that equals less broken bodies
You say that like it's a bad thing lol
I‚Äôm simply talking about statistics and you just want to argue.. I‚Äôm happy for you man. The exception proves the rule. Look that up my man. I‚Äôm lucky to have a great life as a non unioner, and believe it or not.. I‚Äôm still happy for you brother.
Hey I pay a huge amount for union dues. A years worth is still less than the cost of what my health insurance for 4 months would be, but I pay a lot. Oh did I forget to mention that my pension, 401k and SS are predicted to be $9k a month without working another day. I‚Äôm 54 and that doesn‚Äôt include my plumbers and laborers pensions
Legal dues. You pay a team to have your back, where before you had nothing. Well worth the money in my book.
This made me lol
the ammount you save on medical alone is worth it. also oeace of mind. also yearly pay increases.¬†
My union dues are 3 work hours a month. 

Interestingly, I've never been paid double time for working weekends before I was union. 

Absolutely worth it.
I will say as an engineer that interfaces with hardware/repair shops, union shops are a pain in the ass for all the regulations and paper work they gotta follow/file. Maybe it‚Äôs just my industry but engineers commonly talk about the union vs non union difference.

Of course all that is secondary to advocation against a large conglomerate, so I support unions despite them inconveniencing me.
In my previous life I worked in the film industry. I worked with union and non union crews.

The union shoots were SO much smoother and professional than the non union shoots. The final products were also much better.
"If the punishment is a fine, it's only illegal for poor people" is evergreen.
> Keep spouting this horseshit

Well, keep spouting your hatred of facts I guess. You seem to have low reading comprehension.

I'm glad you're in a union. Unions are great for employees.

I'm glad the company you work for has stayed in business for a long time. I didn't say "all unionized companies fail", I said unionizing makes them more likely to fail because they have higher costs, less innovation, and less investment. This is just straight facts, companies do not run magic. If a higher portion of their profits go to employees (why else would you unionize?), this affects the health and competitive survivability of the company.

If basic common logic fails you on that, you could look at the literature, this is well studied. There are many failed or struggling companies that would have survived if they were allowed to innovate and if the wages of their employees were competitive rather than collectively bargained.

Also, if you'd read what I actually wrote, I encouraged him to unionize regardless and squeeze every dollar he can from his employer because his employer is surely happily doing the same to him every day... and at worst he ends up having to work for another non-union shop, which isn't his problem.
What kool aid?

The money to pay the (higher) union wages has to come from somewhere. The lower innovation that results from job protection results in a competitive disadvantage. The company being less attractive to an investor due to their lower profits, limits their ability to grow or recover.

Read what I actually wrote. I told the guy to unionize and take every dollar he can get. The company's profit or survivability isn't his problem, it's theirs, and they're busy screwing him any time they can, so he owes them no favors.
20% of base pay??
Yea right now we have a day and night shift with a $2 differential, but I think it should be more.
That would still be more than my current differential lol. But honestly higher base pay would be better.
Not mine because it's a shop not construction.
So, you‚Äôre saying unions protect the employees I don‚Äôt want to work with, got it.
Tinners are winners
They don't care‚Ä¶ They won't listen.
Please explain how I‚Äôm lazy, I would love to hear what you have to say.

And it‚Äôs true, union members do make 15-30% more than non union. If you‚Äôd like I can cite a source that backs up my claims. 

Pensions are not a scheme at all, and the fact that you think you know everything, especially about unions makes me laugh‚Ä¶ 

Any worker who worked for me that didn‚Äôt do any good work got laid off right away. I kept the good workers the longest. Any worker who isn‚Äôt a good worker gets laid off first and doesn‚Äôt get called to jobs as often because contractors don‚Äôt want them. So they make less money. 

If you think you have everything figured out then why are you still an apprentice? Just can‚Äôt suck that dick good enough yet? Your boss must love youü§£
How do the boss's boots taste, bud?
I‚Äôm in Southern Ontario. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, which unions have you visited?

I‚Äôm not in a union either.
So you think that unions should let everyone join? There should be no requirements? They should not choose apprentices based on how they do, how they are as a person and how they fit as a union member?

I‚Äôm genuinely curious why you think I‚Äôm a bot? Did we have an argument previously? I see you‚Äôre an apprentice. Clearly you know everything
I agree. But easier said than done I seen our electrical contractor employees try to unionize with IBEW. Both times he shut down his business for a long period of time and all the employees went to the IBEW. Now he's got the CLAC and I took a look at their agreement book for $38 for a journeyman. That's criminally low. The real money is in residential contracting $95-$100 hour.

 Our journeymen pipe fitters/ structural weldersmake $45.52 CAD plus boots, coveralls ,%8 rrsps matching. Not as good as the union but it's decent with constant work.

I'm not even a journeyman/apprentice I'm just telling it as I see it in my company.
exactly what a bot would say if u asked a bot if it was a bot or not
interesting. fair enough.
When you permanently work for one company yes. That is correct. But when you work a job as foreman, or general foreman you are still a union member. I worked my first job as foreman at an oil refinery, once the job was done I took my lay off and hit the list like every other member
Me? Please explain‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs amazing how you think stealing work is a good thing‚Ä¶ you think it‚Äôs okay to do one trades‚Äô job for only one trades‚Äô pay?
Good, which means your whole comment doesn‚Äôt mean much‚Ä¶ being paid over scale is most definitely a thing‚Ä¶ why is it always the people who are severely uneducated talking shit about unions?
Asking questions is a good thing. 

But people like you hate freeloaders. You hate people on welfare. You hate people getting anything from the government. 

But yet when it comes to you, you think it‚Äôs okay to reap the benefits of a union without contributing? Typical. You‚Äôre a hypocritical loser bro

Edit: I‚Äôm happily a union member, I truly don‚Äôt mind paying dues. Because I get paid better than non union, I get to use the union hall whenever I want to burn rod. I‚Äôve burned probably tens of thousands of dollars worth of rod and materials for free‚Ä¶
Found the HR rep
Lol never said it was a good or bad thing, just stating a fact.
I wouldn't say it's a bad thing, but it is comical. Sometimes shit needs to get done, and guys who are unionized so they don't have to work end up getting in the way of that.

But for the most part, I'd rather do the bare minimum for the corporations and share holders making a buck off our broken bodies.
Your statistics are factually incorrect‚Ä¶ how come the skilled trades have a bad reputation for low pay, bad working conditions and dangerous? Non union is the reason. 

I actually provided a real link from a government source. And you think your made up statistics are more accurate?ü§£

It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre happy, but you are factually wrong‚Ä¶ the statistics heavily lean more union. In the source I provided it states that union members made $32% more than non union in the year 2023‚Ä¶ 

I take it you think your wage means every single non union worker makes the same as you? Which means you think your stats are correct? Yikes‚Ä¶
My last outage was 14 days, I think my working dues were like $550? 

Which sounds like a lot until you realize your take home starts with a 7 lol
Joining a UA steamfitters local as a service tech was the one of the best decisions I made in my early 20s. The opportunity's and training I received are second to none. I love teaching at our training center, I'm pumped to go to instructor training in ann-arbor in a few months, and have met some of my best friends through the hall. It's provided me with the ability to financially support a family of 4 while my wife is a stay at home mom. I've been trying to get some of my plumber buddy's to join our sister local and the one who did was blown away over how much better it is. The bigger nonunion shops around here really harp on having to pay dues and saying that you have less ability to grow but it's all straight bullshit. I still got another 20 to 30 years in me before retirement but as I've set myself up right now I'm probably looking at 15 to 20K a month from my ss( if it's still around) 401k and pension because I'm aggressive about saving plus my other investments.
Daaamn you carry 3 cards? I thought that was frowned upon? I've heard of guys in both pipefitters and ironworkers but they gotta be sneaky about it lol
Yup I believe it, my pension calculator is saying $8k-$10k/month when I retire. Plus all my other investmentsü§òüèª
Damn, thats a killer retirement
Some genius convinced people in my union (before I was a part) to go to 401k if you are new and pensions were grandfathered in. In pension stay pension new to the union 401k......the selling point I'm told was that you can take your 401k with you. Where I'm at only idiots leave. So new people that are going to be lifers have a 401k.....ü§¨
I was only in for 11 years before I was injured on the job and had to medically retired.  Sadly All I have to show for it is a full pension, with full medical benefits that pays me only 100k a year for the rest of my life.  Those guys in other states get awesome salaries of up to $15hr and won't have to worry about a pension or being forced to keep using paid for by the state(company) medical benefits.... I was only making $35/hr in comparison with my forced union labor.  It's a real shit show I tell ya.
Wow! I am in motion picture and television and we just  got a tentative agreement for the next 3 years. At current levels, when I retire after 30 plus years, I am looking at maybe 3500 a month plus health which is a huge consideration. But damn. You get pension and 401k?! 
Can I get a do over?
Fuck that must be nice
100% I agreeü§ôüèª
Ever look at the yearly book for Teamsters? Most of the legal fees were connected to guys with Italian names. ü§£
It‚Äôs probably more of a hassle because there‚Äôs more steps to make sure everything is being done correctly
almost as if the less red tape and office fuckery a shop has, the more flexible a shop can be. who would have guessed?
It‚Äôs the difference between an organization and a group of fucking guys (and fucking gals) showing up at the same time. You gotta answer to your coworkers and not just the bosses.
I just simply do not believe that affording Union work kills companies. There are plenty of companies that avoid paying for Union work because it's expensive so they pay for cheaper, less skilled, non Union work and overtime pay for it with prematurely failing equipment. Once these companies let us in the door, see how much more reliable our work is, and over time how much they save not redoing work when done correctly the first time, they keep bringing us back. 

Then there is the idea that if a company is at risk of going under paying for skilled labor they need, the company would likely go under anyways unless they're gouging their workers at which point they deserve to stop being a business. 

I also don't work for any one company, I get contracted for a multitude of companies to work and they choose to pay for Union work because you really do get what you pay for. I've seen some unbelievable shit non Union workers have done that never flies with us.
So you feel bad for the poor poor CEO??üò≠üò≠üò≠

Omg dude, just stop licking the boots so hard‚Ä¶ 

Please explain how unions put companies out of business‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs numerous unionized companies here that have all been around for 70+ years‚Ä¶ your facts aren‚Äôt facts at allü§£
Yes, I worked a shutdown as foreman on nightshift and my hourly rate went from $58/hr to $69/hr just because I was on nights. Plus all OT was double time on top of premium
Yeah my nightshift is 25% and 30% for back shift, I've worked both union and non union jobs and I make way more with the unionized jobs. Unless you're running your own business doing contracting work I see no downsides going with a union. Union dues are a total of about $16 a week for me. Payed holidays off, payed vacation, if you fuck up you have a group of people that has your back. I mean there's downsides to a union but the good outweigh the bad imo
In my union, we get double pay the whole shift if we work at nights. And double pay all weekend, no matter if you didn‚Äôt make 40hrs that week
33% in my local
10% of a higher base is even more. The retirement and health insurance are the real benefits though. I get paid $14 an hour into my 401k plus a pension.
No. Unions help protect workers from getting punished or retaliated against for bullshit things. It could be anything from not doing something unsafe or against the rules, to making a simple mistake, to the supervisor is a dick and just wants to get rid of someone they don't like, among many other things.

They help make sure that the business has their ducks in a row and they can't pass off crap on employees who were just doing what they were supposed to.
When I was in a union shop that‚Äôs exactly what the union did.
Not always. It really depends on the union. Where I‚Äôm at, there are no ‚Äúwrite ups‚Äù, you just get fired lol
shitty co workers exist regardless¬†
Only is management can't prove they're a bad employee.
I'm a tinner but not really, I mostly do pipefitting work.
> If you think you have everything figured out then why are you still an apprentice? Just can‚Äôt suck that dick good enough yet? Your boss must love youü§£

why do u keep bringing up sucking dick? typical lmao.
im really sure that they have subreddits if u want to explore your fetishes, but honestly quit the projection.
128, 46, 401, Iluna, sprinkler fitters, 721 ironworkers and sheet metal¬†
>So you think that unions should let everyone join? There should be no requirements?They should not choose apprentices based on how they do, how they are as a person and how they fit as a union member?

no one seems to ever bring that aspect of unionization up, all they do is shill 'higher wages and pension".

>I see your an apprentice. Clearly you know everything.

ahahahahaha i love it. the sheer desperation of it.

classy.

i see your a journeyman, clearly you think you know everything.

id love to see how you would hold out in a normal, \*competitive\* work environment.

except i suspect that this quinnjamin19 is actually just a sock puppet account run by a social media manager employed by a union to astroturf support for unionization. its not hard. throw up a few random pics on a few random subreddits then spam some of the trade subs with pro-union propaganda.
Lmao, that right there just shows how fucked up a rich company owner is‚Ä¶ he would rather shut his company down for long periods of time just so he doesn‚Äôt have to pay his workers a proper wage‚Ä¶ 

CLAC isn‚Äôt a union, and the fact that they pay $38/hr is fucked. 

Your journeyman Pipefitters make $8.78/hr less than journeyman Boilermakers and about $11/hr less than a journeyman UA pipefitter. With worse benefits and pension‚Ä¶ 

The thing is I don‚Äôt have to work all year to make $100k+ I worked 8 weeks in the spring, I made $52k in those 8 weeks‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm enjoying some time off‚Ä¶ 

u/8yp00opB14lc still doesn‚Äôt have a pair of balls I see, come on little guy. It‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm not gonna bite‚Ä¶ hardüòò
Nah bro I just love hearing you call people pieces of shit you don‚Äôt know. Guy asked for an opinion but you‚Äôre welcome to feel however you want lol.
OP asked for positives and negatives, I gave him a negative I've seen in person. U mad about it for some reason
So you assume I get benefits without paying for it. I don't, you assume a lot actually.. way to make an ass of yourelself just because you have a different situation and decide to pay for something I don't need. So you're a midwit and happy about it. Good on you.
Man.. you really like to argue don‚Äôt you? Can‚Äôt even have a conversation with people these days. Hope your weekend gets better than it started brother. I‚Äôll pray for you.
Nope. Was a laborer for 7 years, 90% vested, plumber for 14 years 100% vested, Pipefitter for 14 years 100% vested. Plumbers and Pipefitters are both UA.
I plan to work another 10 years so it should go up a few more thousand.
We have both... Regular pension plus $13/hr employer contributions into the 401k.
My plumbers union was 100% 401k because the financial ‚Äúexperts‚Äù said they would all be millionaires. Then the market crashed and a lot of members lost most of their money. They were able to get the union to give them a small pension too.
Yeah, we got another dollar to the 401k last year so we make $14 an hour in our 401k. I‚Äôve been averaging more than 2000 hours a year for awhile now. I hadn‚Äôt looked at my portfolio for over 2 years. It was a great surprise to see how much I made in the past 2 years.
No it‚Äôs a job function thing lol. If I wanna look at something it‚Äôs ‚Äúgotta get the guy that does that he‚Äôs off doing this other thing‚Äù then something else, ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs not my job, let me get the supervisor to then get you the other team that does that and handles this thing right in front of both of us, you can‚Äôt touch it without this paperwork‚Äù

Some of it is dumb inefficiencies that might be removable for sure but all in all the red tape is baked into unions.

Edit: To give you a tangible example of what I mean, the other day I had to physically drive down to the shop to move one box of hardware from one cell to a cell in another building myself because union rules dictated that it had to go through SHIPPING. 

TO GET TO THE CELL 500 FEET AWAY
> I just simply do not believe that affording Union work kills companies.

Well, it does.

> There are plenty of companies that avoid paying for Union work because it's expensive

Yes, sure, there are all kinds of degrees of quality, and anyone wanting to get work done for cheap is going to get cheap work.

But that's not what we're talking about.

In an apples to apples comparison, union work costs more for the same quality.

If this wasn't true, unions wouldn't exist. Why would you form a union only to get paid less than before?

Union work is often better, and also often much worse because union shops tend towards being utterly brainless and job protections based on seniority means the shitty workers don't get fired.

Everyone should try to form a union and get into a union. It's a no brainer. There are zero downsides to it from the perspective of an employee. Except, maybe, that the company is more likely to fail because of it.
> So you feel bad for the poor poor CEO?

Huh?

Can you stop trying to pick a fight and imagining what someone you want to pick a fight with might say, and actually fuckin' read what I wrote?

At any point did I say anything sympathizing with the company's owners? No. I said (repeatedly) that a company has no loyalty to its employees, so show them no loyalty in return. Unionize, and take every cent you can get from them. And if the company fails, which unions play a significant role in, who cares, because you're no worse off than you are today anyways.

> Please explain how unions put companies out of business‚Ä¶

I don't genuinely believe you're so stupid that I would have to explain that to you.

What makes a company fail? When they run out of money. So what makes companies that are unionized fail more often than companies that are not? A company that is unionized has higher costs.

Of course it has higher costs, that's why the union is there, it increases employee wages.

Unions also stagnate innovation and cripple further investment.

> there‚Äôs numerous unionized companies here that have all been around for 70+ years

Again, I don't believe you're so stupid that your logic could be this bad.

"There are some unionized companies that have survived a long time, therefore there is no impact on a company's financial health by unions" is a nonsensical argument.

It's like saying "Seatbelts don't save lives. My uncle hasn't worn a seatbelt in 50 years and he hasn't died in a car crash." 

I did not say "All companies that unionize soon fail".

I said that it is MORE LIKELY to fail. It is harder for it to stay in business. Of the factors that drive a company out of business, there are 3 additional ones with more weight behind them after a company unionizes.

...

For what it's worth I have a degree in economics, it's not like I'm pulling this out of my ass or these are my personal theories. This is basic reasoning 101. It's not debateable, it's very, very basic and universally agreed on, and the data supports it.

You're so eager for a fight, or you lack basic literacy, that you think my point is "Don't unionize, it takes money away from the owners."

Learn to read.
I dunno man. I've been working for 15 years and in all that time, I've only gotten maybe three or four writeups from employers, and never over bullshit. Usually, because I was egregiously late, did a no call no show, or willfully disregarded company policy. If there's someone who keeps slipping out of their writeups for shit like that because of their union rep, I don't care how good their benefits are, I'm probably quitting because I don't want to work with them. 

It sounds a lot like trying to protect shitty employees. 

Another thing I've seen is that employers who are too hard on their employees just go out of business. 

Also, as a small business owner, if I had an employee who wouldnt get with the program, and their union rep kept interfering with me documenting it, I'd probably just close the business out of spite and leave everyone jobless, and move to a friendlier state. Employment is a two way street, and it seems like unions try to make it seem like all the burden to make a healthy work environment is on the employer. I can't do that if I can't get rid of problematic employees.
Whatever works!
Why haven‚Äôt you given any evidence to any of your claims? Typical non union wannabeü§£

Please, humour me. Please explain how I‚Äôm lazy, and explain how unions are bad? What‚Äôs your personal experience with being a member of a union? Mr. Apprentice doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking aboutüò≠üò≠üò≠
Do you have anything smart to say? You‚Äôve made 0 valid points and only made claims about me being a union ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù

Are you going to have any sort of valid argument at all kid? You seem to be angry at unions. Did you not get accepted? Not good enough? Couldn‚Äôt hack it in the big leagues? I‚Äôm far from the best, but I do have some skills, I spent 3 months in a nuclear power plant tig mirror welding stainless. Was every weld perfect? Fuck no, but I got better as the job went on and got more comfortable with a mirror. And I do weld hanging on ropes, all this stuff is clearly super easy for you the apprentice right?üòâ

I don‚Äôt think I know everything, in fact there‚Äôs still SO much in my trade that I don‚Äôt know. And I take jobs with people who I will learn from. You sound extremely uneducated, and ignorant. Did your boss tell you that unions are bad? The fact that you think any pro union person is a ‚Äúbot‚Äù is telling‚Ä¶ because we all make more money than you‚Ä¶
Please explain how stealing work from other trades is a good thing?
You actually sound extremely uneducated and quite frankly unintelligent.

You act like unions calling grievances for you not staying within your trade is a bad thing. But did you ever think about the fact that there‚Äôs jurisdictional agreements between union trades? 

For example, I‚Äôm a Boilermaker. Boilermaker work stops at the first flange off of a pressure vessel. The pressure vessel is my work, and the first flange is my work. But anything after that is pipefitter work.

If I‚Äôm caught lifting in a 20‚Äô section of pipe, fitting it in place at a welded connection 20‚Äô away from that first flange the pipefitters have every right to file a grievance. That‚Äôs their right because of our jurisdictional agreements. 

Are you just not aware of the jurisdictional agreements? Do you think having jurisdictions is wrong and you should be able to do any job your boss tells you to do? You‚Äôre a welder, but your boss wants you to take apart a scaffold, are you going to do it because your big daddy boss says so? Or are you going to tell him to call the carpenters to remove the scaffold? 

I‚Äôm genuinely curious why you think it‚Äôs shitty that unions can file grievances if you‚Äôre not staying within your trade? The whole point is 1: that you aren‚Äôt doing 2 trades‚Äô work but only getting paid 1 trades‚Äô wages and 2: you‚Äôre not stealing work from other trades 

Please explain your reasoning sir
How exactly did you see it in person? Did you read the collective agreement specifically stating that one member cannot be paid more than another one? 

I‚Äôm not mad about anything, but people like you love talking out your ass with no proof. Everything you people say is ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs boss told Susan, who told Danny who told his kid then told me‚Äù

Did you read specific verbiage in the collective agreement? Or did you hear about it?
You do receive the benefits of a union without being a member‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre called freeloaders. Thats why you‚Äôre most likely treated differently at work‚Ä¶ 

Keep drinking the kool aid little man. The rich just have you right by their boots don‚Äôt theyü§°
Me? I just like when people have the proper information‚Ä¶ people like you just love to talk about how 1 shop is better than all unions in general‚Ä¶ 

You are factually incorrect‚Ä¶ sorry little guy‚Ä¶

You don‚Äôt need to pray for me, I‚Äôm already driving the bus straight to hell when I dieü§£

What makes you think my weekend isn‚Äôt great? I live a great life, and make more money than non union while not even working a full yearüòÇ
You Prior Marine?
I wish! That sounds like a pretty good deal!
Yes, so again. Making sure things are done the correct way. Doing someone else‚Äôs job isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm paid to do. I‚Äôm a Boilermaker, not a Pipefitter. So I‚Äôm not going to do Pipefitter work.
This is a frustrating reaction to management taking advantage. If it really was just a bit here and there to help out- the rules wouldn't exist.  But it is amazingly common for people to be pushed into doing two jobs for the wage of one. "Do more with less". Another trick is to push people into doing skilled trade labor for general labor wages. In your case there probably wasn't hazmat, or ppe required,  or specialized knowledge needed- but it's really easy to get in over your head because you just didn't know what was going on like an expert would
Poor engineer, had to get his hands dirty.
lol i never said unions where bad but ok. 

i seem to have gotten under your skin lmao.
lmao. classy. 

keep trying that lol. u just sound like a douchebag, proving my point.
I had coworkers making $20+ hr in a manufacturing plant, they wanted a union with a caveat that they kept their pay and new hires were stepped down to $12/14 (support/operator). If you got hired post union, there was no way to ever make more than the $14 unless you got promoted to salary or something and left the union. The legacy employees still got their wage from before. Idk why you're so adamantly insisting I'm lying. This was in like 2017. You need to chill bro
My point is, you have no idea what my ‚Äústatistics‚Äù and ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are. You never bothered to ask, or even meet me halfway to see if I had any valid points. You come off as a real jerk, and I would probably hate to work with you or near you. I‚Äôm trying to have a respectful conversation because I make damn good money and work with damn good people. I‚Äôm trying to explain that I‚Äôm the rare exception, and you‚Äôre just trying to tell me I‚Äôm wrong. But hey, it‚Äôs all good man. You‚Äôre doing the best you can, I‚Äôm sure. And you clearly care about the subject. I only ask that you tone it down a notch and maybe realize your way is not the only way. Peace.
Yeah
It's an amazing deal, we're very fortunate and have been well-represented for a long time. Scale's nothing to sneeze at either.
> Doing someone else‚Äôs job isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm paid to do.

And union members can't take work away from their brothers or sisters.
Please explain to me how having someone pick up one box, label it, move it to shipping presumably shelving it and then having someone else do the reverse and drop it off somewhere that is closer to the origin than the shipping cell is the ‚Äúcorrect way.‚Äù

I understand the sentiment of ‚Äúgetting paid to do your job‚Äù however you are still getting paid and the fact that this inefficiency doesn‚Äôt have to exist but is put in place by the union is exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. Again, wanna reiterate I am venting my frustration but I still support unions lol.
What about union staff that won't open up a folding chair for a scheduled meeting to sit in because that's  the job of some other person?  I experienced that ridiculousness at two companies repeatedly.
I just want to say, I've had plenty of frustrating interactions with engineers working as both a welder and CWI, so i totally understand your snark; but, since this conversation is about how unions operate, and we live in a world where unions NEED to have more power if we want to build a middle class again, and since this world is FULL of anti-union sentiment, I would advise being respectful to people when you're representing a union in casual conversation. 

It's the little things that build up, you know? Plus, it's easy to just be friendly, if nothing else.
Far from it, I‚Äôm just having fun right now‚Ä¶ but keep spewing nonsense because your boss told you union members are bad and lazy! Keep cryingüò≠
Actually, your lack of anything factual or smart to say is proving my point‚Ä¶ bootlickers gonna lick boots bro, keep it up little apprenticeüòò
So you didn‚Äôt read anything in the collective agreement? You just heard it from people? Thank you‚Ä¶ 

People like you like to spread misinformation‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm pointing out
So you talk ‚Äústatistics‚Äù without any evidence of these ‚Äústatistics‚Äù‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ you seem real fuckin smart there bud, nothing to back up anything you claim‚Ä¶ typical non union worker‚Ä¶ you never had any statistics‚Ä¶ just one anecdotal shop that you work atü§£

I‚Äôm only a jerk to people who think they know what they are talking about. So you. Honestly, I got great feedback from my workers after a shutdown. My first foreman gig at 25/26 and made $52k in only 8 weeksü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è started making six figures at 23. 

Statistically and factually speaking union is the best way. Just because there‚Äôs 1 non union shop that pays well doesn‚Äôt mean shit. Sorry little guy, nice try thoüòò
We need your people for the next contract!
I know it can be a pain but employers will always try to get people to cover more and more responsibilities, for the same pay, if they can get away with it. My girlfriend is experiencing this right now, she should have a higher position and better pay for all that she does beyond the scope of her job description but it ain't gonna happen. I see people discussing this on reddit all the time and they feel taken advantage of. It's no wonder I see them repeatedly say the best way to get a raise is to get a new job.
It‚Äôs the correct way because you‚Äôre not doing someone else‚Äôs job‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶ 

It‚Äôs not inefficiency, it‚Äôs the fact that the company probably didn‚Äôt hire enough people to do that job‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not a union‚Äôs fault
>I understand the sentiment of ‚Äúgetting paid to do your job‚Äù however you are still getting paid


You still don't seem to understand it, but it's pretty simple, let me break it down for you.  


I'm getting paid to do "x" 

That was the agreement. 


Now you want me to do "x" and "y"  while only being paid for "x"?

A line has to be drawn somewhere. Where would you draw that line?
So people skilled in a trade should be handling shipping for a company because the company lacks the coverage?

Now the tradesman isn't doing his trained job.

Now the project gets behind.
Every union meeting that I‚Äôve been to the chairs were already set up. Either the BA and staff set up the chairs or they had someone do it, either way, I‚Äôm not sure you can have a union meeting with no chairs‚Ä¶ 

You had this happen at two companies or two unions? There is a difference you know, and most people aren‚Äôt educated enough to understand the difference
ive never spoken to my boss about unions lol.
> Actually, your lack of anything factual or smart to say is proving my point‚Ä¶ bootlickers gonna lick boots bro, keep it up little apprenticeüòò

> your lack of anything factual or smart to say is proving my point‚Ä¶ 

lol the irony. pot calling the kettle black.
Haha I got hired as a new hire, making the low pay scales like everyone else hired after the union creation. Then I got promoted to supervisor. You're never going to believe anything negative could happen from a union so I'm out. I answered OP's question and u are clearly unemployed to be this passionate on a reddit post bro
Definitions matter, precision of language is important, especially when dealing with unions. Inefficiency is practically the name of the union game, nice and slow. It's better for the workers for sure, but that in no measure means it is efficient, or correct.

You're legally bound to wait, and paid extra to put up with it. Some of us like that a whole lot more than others.
> A line has to be drawn somewhere. Where would you draw that line?

Whenever you read companies are understaffed this is why. They have no power to change things. So you have 10 people at a place then they need to increase profits and they slowly let people leave and don't replace them. Now you have 7 people but the same amount or more work needs to get done, but you make the same amount or less because they cut your benefits.
Next time you take a shit and there's no TP, walk out with your greasy cheeks held high and go find the guy who's job it is with a proud union smile! 

jk, just a funny example of how it can be bad too.
So where are you getting your proof about union members? Clearly you must have some sort of evidence that you can cite to support your claims? Right?
Where‚Äôs the irony in my comments? 

I‚Äôve always provided factual information and I do have sources to back up my claims‚Ä¶ if you want some you can have them‚Ä¶

But you, are just a wannabe, coping because you didn‚Äôt have what it takes to be a member? Idk, you seem to have a hard on for me and you didn‚Äôt have the guts to even mention meüòÇ
Actually that‚Äôs not true, there‚Äôs definitely unions that aren‚Äôt as good as mine. Some need overhaul from the top down. My international union actually just got rid of the president. We are all human and susceptible to corruption. 

But the thing is 98% of people like you have never actually read a collective agreement in your life. I have read ours, and there‚Äôs 0 verbiage that states that a member cannot be paid over scale. A collective agreement is purely bare minimum of what members should receive in compensation, restrooms, lunchrooms, PPE etc. a company has every right to pay members above scale if they desire. 

I don‚Äôt have to work all year to make more than non union, I made $52k in only 8 weeks of workü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A few more things off my bench
GTAW 5086 aluminum 
Really nice job, looks good and steady
You do some nice work. I have the ability to pump out work that nice, but my shop grinds everything, and doesn‚Äôt pay well enough for me to be patient. Slang that wire baby.
Glad someone enjoys it.  I hate welding aluminum, I hate tge prep work, the noise, the smell, how it get to hot to brace.  I'm a steel/stainless guy forever.
Beautiful work, post here more often
how much did you get done per day? I've found it hard to dial in my quality/time used ratio
Out of curiosity what‚Äôs your balance and frequency for something like this?
this guy welds üí•
I never get past the 3rd picture with these posts, i always nut and lose interest.

I do bookmark the post for future visits though
Nah this is just [caulk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XXZ4D8AcUY) with silver spray paint. /s
I hate you. I say it sarcastically and it‚Äôs all love but i hate you. Lol
Really beautiful, nice Job.
What‚Äôs your tolerance‚Äôs?
What is this used for? Curious since I have to use 6061 which is marine quality for building docks.
Stellar work.
I'd be wanting to call the boat owner to see if he wanted it ground off.  I wouldn't....again that's art bro.
Very nice
JEEBUS, these are perfect!
Art üëå
Man your welds are wicked. Keep posting these please. Awesome every time
Very nice work. Canadian too eh, cheers bud.
Nicely done. Do you guys use PAPR?
Well, that doesn‚Äôt suck!!!

Bad ass!
That's some gorgeous TIG welding from my amateur perspective.
Awesome work, there is a guy named John Marcella that builds custom intake manifolds, your welds are like his‚Ä¶..flawless, I just stare at your pics in awe!!
Did you use 3/32" or 1/8" filler? And what brand machine?
beautiful work.
‚ÄúLooks worth about 12 an hour the best I can do, gobless‚Äù ‚Ä¶ looks amazing hopefully you‚Äôre getting paid for your talent!!!
Beautiful beads I must say
Beeds schmeeds. That man can wrap a fuckin corner! 
So nice.
I was getting the hang of tig, never this good, then fucked up my dominant eye. 
I can still stick stuff together fine but have to farm it out if I want it looking this good. 
Fine, fine work man.
Damn ai is getting too good
Goddammit. Didn't even want to upvote it's so disgustingly good.
fuck yeah that‚Äôs beautiful.
Incredible work, some of the cleanest ac work I‚Äôve ever seen
Fucking excellent job.
 Bruh just stop! You make me regret every weld I laid down in my life!
What kind of prep work do you do to the aluminum before welding?
What is this? Incredible TIG welding my friend. 2 more mods left of welding school.
I wish I could have robot arms like that. Good stuff.
Do me a solid? Don't post any more pictures? I don't think I can handle my boss showing me these and telling me that I need to do better, lol üòÇ ya gonna make me lose my job with this immaculate shit
Beautiful!!
Hell yeah how long have you been welding?
Damn bro that is just art
Weld Jesus
I mean if that the best you can do
Great job
I‚Äôm wet now thanks.
Sexy
Not your first day I take it? That is a display of skill right there.
Homeboy thirsty with these posts... save some pussy for the rest of us my guy... in all serious tho you have great aluminum tig welds... I always found it difficult but only tried it a few times.. I found stainless to be alot easier. For my experience, I've mostly MIG welded and I'm very good at that but it's easy imo... TIG is an art form. Good on ya, bro. I hope you are getting paid well.
I don‚Äôt know shit about fuck but that‚Äôs beautiful work
Jesus dude this isnt a porn page, get those beautiful welds outta here üëå
Artistry
Depends how good the forming is. I can get stuff done pretty quickly if everything fits up well. TIG is not a speedy process, but you can become efficient with experience. Don‚Äôt sweat it.
75% cleaning and 125 hz üçª
I was gunna go with 

"This guy TIGs"

but, ok.
Usually +\- 1 mm. Angular tolerance is usually a degree
It‚Äôs part of a console for a Zodiac boat. We‚Äôre a marine company, so pretty much all 5000 and 6000 series aluminum

Thanks bro üçª üá®üá¶
No. Just a half mask respirator. I‚Äôm also fabricating, so the small mask doesn‚Äôt really get in the way of my helmet or face shield

Thanks broüçª
3/32 5356 filler and a Miller Dynasty 350

Just a wipe with lacquer thinner works fine. Debur the sharp edges
30 years
üçªI‚Äôve been TIG welding for 30 years so I‚Äôve had a lot of practice üòÇ
Nice man, clean work.
.040"?! Why does almost every print I get demand .010"?!

edit: Beautiful work. Love working with Aluminum.
Very cool and great work!
Oh wow. Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm 3 years in and doing all I can to get better. This is very inspiring
Yea... I've been welding for almost 20 years at one company and recently left... it turned into a different place that I liked being at. We just didn't have much TIG work for me to get really good at it.. looking back, I wish I would have spent free time doing that and practicing instead of other things...
üçª
üçªI don‚Äôt mind sharing tips to help anyone out
Hey man in your years did you get any certs that are worth while or some that you never get use out of?
All position qualifications, but rarely overhead. My shop requires certification for too many things, but that‚Äôs what our customers want, so it is what it is.
You‚Äôll never believe this
These pictures were taken today 2/10/24 over Lake Willoughby during the thunderstorm that rolled right towards us. TWICE in about a 10 minute span, I took a picture of the lake, perfectly timed with the lightning bolt. These pictures are unedited. If you zoom in on the second picture, the bolt of lighting looks like it‚Äôs striking the ice fisherman‚Äôs head. I am still in shock this happened. Going to buy a lottery ticket.
You should enter that in the National Geographic photo contest.
Awesome awesome shots!
Awesome! You should submit that to some photo contest or something
That fisherman is probably scraping his drawers after that experience.
Incredible!!  

(sidebar: it has been waaaaaaay too warm this winter to be ice fishing IMO‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a total weenie that way)
Thanks everyone! So happy to share this with you! I love Vermont so much. Definitely going to submit this to NatGeo in the morning.
That is a once in a lifetime shot!
this photo is completely insane
I was there as well! We had just gotten in the car after skiing at Willoughby State Park when it really started happening. As we drove up 5A we said ‚Äúget off the ice, my dudes, there‚Äôs lightning going off...‚Äù
Yeah February thunderstorms surprised everyone! Awesome, awesome shot! I second the nat geo suggestion.
Would you look at that
If I were that fisherman I would want that picture displayed on my wall. What a conversation piece when you have guests.
I‚Äôm more shocked people are ice fishing Willo
Really amazing shots! Get that framed. Did you check on that fisherman just in case?!? Lol
Wow! Thought this was black and white. Lol.
That's so cool! Thanks for sharing them.
You are right I dont believe there was a thunderstorm today in Vermont.
I've seen thundersnow once in my life and it was incredible and lightning in general in the winter twice.

Amazing job with the pictures.
Yowza!
We felt both of those cracks over the house. I thought a transformer blew. Awesome shots!
That second photograph is spectacular! The first is very good too.
Awesome.  Award-winning quality!
actually insane dude, this is a world class shot
These are amazing!!! Let us know how it goes with NatGeo!
All luck used up for a lifetime :(
One of my .ost favorite places in the world with the coolest photos ever....nice
Incredible photographs.
Great images !
What a shot! amazing.
Woah
Amazing
Nice!
Wow!!!
WOW
Amazing!
This looks like frozen Kattegut from Vikings
The second one almost looks more like it's shooting skyward out of the fisherman's head. Pretty cool.
Wow! Nice photos, right time, right place
Is that the God damn rain in the second picture as well? How much did it pour for this February thunderstorm?
That‚Äôs wild
I can hear Zeppelins Immigrant Song cueing just looking at these pics.
Amazing timing, what a cool photo!
Wow!!!
The question is did you catch any fish and if so what?
Cannot upvote this enough!!!
photog here.

Holy shit! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
I feel like that second picture is perfect for r/fuckyouinparticular
These are UNREAL shots!!!!
Incredible
Stunning photos. I knew where this was taken as soon as I saw it.
Wow incredible shot! Happy for you!
They‚Äôre incredible.
Bravo, good cath, quite the storm
Hubbity hoobity this got me jazzed
My mother and I love lighting in thunderstorms, this is so cool, ill have to show her.
What awesome pictures! I have been trying so hard to get a picture of lightning lol these turned out so good i am so impressed
That's metal af
Great photo ! Timing was perfect.
Very cool.
Full on thunderstorms and a tornado in Wisconsin this past week.
Amazing
"Fuck that spot in particular"
Amazing shot! This is awesome!
Fabulous.
‚ö°Ô∏è!
Great shots wow!!
I looked but it doesn‚Äôt seem like they are accepting photos :( the best info I could find is tagging them on instagram, which I did. I did submit these to a few local photo contests so we‚Äôll see!
Honestly they should.
Thank you! I still can‚Äôt believe it happened‚Ä¶twice!
Funny thing is he probably had no idea. He was looking away and the bolt was soooo far away from him on the other side of the Lake.
Ice was solid in northern VT in most places (not Champlain proper though some bays) but this warm spell made it more sketchy. I bet the ice there on Willoughby was over 8 inches thick. It you would be surprised how long it takes ice to melt even in the 40s though. 

Regardless, drill test holes and don‚Äôt go on a body of water you are not familiar with!
Was out on Eligo today.  Ice was about 10‚Äù thick.
And they got it twice
You totally passed us! We dashed back to the car just as the wind starting getting crazy. Felt like the Caddy Shack thunderstorm on a golf course scene  haha
I was thinking while posting this ‚ÄúI hope that man is on this Reddit thread‚Äù haha
I'm not. Every year you hear about people falling through ice somewhere. People just don't think or don't care.
I didn‚Äôt but I also would have definitely noticed if he got struck lol
Thank you! I was absolutely shocked to see a thunderstorm in Vermont in February. The thunder was echoing off the mountains and I‚Äôve never heard anything like it.
Just an update. It doesn‚Äôt look like NatGeo accepts any photos but I did make an instagram post and tag them in it like it tells me to do on their website so we‚Äôll see if they even see it. However, I did submit it to a few Vermont Photo contests, fingers crossed!
Thank you! Will do!
Hope that‚Äôs not the case! Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised though
I wasn‚Äôt ice fishing unfortunately. Haven‚Äôt seen the lake before and have always wanted to visit. I didn‚Äôt notice if anyone else was catching fish. I think we were all preoccupied by the storm coming right as us haha
Thank you! My first thought after taking them was this Reddit thread!
I will have to post it there!
Thank you! Got a big goose egg on the lottery so it looks like this is what a lifetime of luck amounts to haha
Good luck! These are sick photos!
Thanks for posting.  These shot are surreal. At first I thought it was some Simon Stalenhag images, especially the first one with the two people and that red circle. Like other posters have suggested, these would be unbeatable in any photo contest.  Right place, Right time.
Lightning never strikes twi‚Ä¶ eh nevermind.
Username checks out üòú
Last year was bad. Usually old timers who don‚Äôt realize the ice is not always solid at the times it used to be. It was 55 when I was fishing yesterday.
That's awesome! You should maybe try submitting to Seven Days as well! Or tag them if they have an Instagram.
I don't blame you for watching that storm! Hey, at least you were out on the lake as it looked beautiful.
Take my upvote haha
Yeah it was so warm. I definitely would not feel safe ice fishing in that weather. Some spots it seemed like there wasn‚Äôt even ice. Could have been water pooled on the ice though
Just found their website, I‚Äôll look into it. Thanks!
It was breathtaking! I wish I could have captured the thunder rumbling and echoing around the lake. It was the most wild thunder I have ever heard.
Bad time living in vermont 
I know this is going to get downvoted and people are going to be mad, but I have had an extraordinarily bad time living in Vermont.

I live in Bennington and work in Sunderland. From the start, people (particularly in the northern areas) were cold and standoffish with me. Now, I lived in the Czech Republic, so cold strangers is nothing new to me, but people in VT seemed downright judgmental. When I hold the door for people a the Stewart‚Äôs in Arlington, they don‚Äôt say thank you. When I get a drink at Ramunto‚Äôs in Bennington, people stare at me like I‚Äôm some murderer. I‚Äôve made a couple friends, but generally people are rude and make me feel unwelcomed. It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôve never seen a new face before. When people in Manchester hear that I live in Bennington, they treat me like I‚Äôm som kind of criminal.

I‚Äôve experienced a lot of theft as well. Again, I‚Äôve lived in places like Detroit and Milwaukee and never had anything. In Bennington, some random person crashed into my car my car while it was parked and totaled it. When I got a new car, someone smashed the window, stole my stereo, and left cigarettes ashes everywhere. I know this can happen anywhere, but nothing as extreme has happened to me before. It‚Äôs extremely isolating. 

For the past year, I‚Äôve been vaguely sick all the time. I‚Äôve felt dizzy and like I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly, and my bloodwork was all messed up. Come to find out that there was a hole
in my apartment roof and the ceiling was covered in black mold. I had to go stay at a motel for a couple weeks and some asshole broke into my car and stole all my clothes. 

To add to all that, you can‚Äôt get anything without driving at least 30 minutes to an hour. Want Wendy‚Äôs? Drive to Troy. Live in Arlington and want a reasonably priced grocery store? Go to Bennington. 

Just a gripe, but people take their local town politics WAY TOO seriously. The people in Manchester spent a full two hours debating about the color of open signs outside of businesses. Like, who the fuck cares?

I moved to VT for work and I fucking regret it. My health is compromised, I‚Äôm down a full car, much of my belongings have been stolen, and I‚Äôm just sad. If you‚Äôre in your 20s/30s and you‚Äôre thinking of moving to VT by yourself for work or something, just don‚Äôt. Take a vacation and go skiing if you wish, but don‚Äôt commit to moving here. I understand that all this shit could happen anywhere, but the fact that it‚Äôs only ever happened me in VT says something.
I wouldn't recommend most of Vermont for a 20 something unless you love a rural lifestyle or your life focuses around outdoor activities. Yeah, Bennington is kind of dumpy depending on where you live (guessing you're in some old ass cut up house/apartment building downtown). Might be worth trying to find a better rental and neighborhood. Vermont is a great place for raising a family, but can be very tough for 20s 30s folks trying to start their career and set roots.
I'm sorry for the crummy time you've had. Sounds like it's been very difficult. Try to stay strong.
Listen to this guy. Don't move to VT!
I moved close to you three years ago.  Haven't made any friends either. Acquaintances i see at thw bar and am friendly with, sure.  But nobody to go see a movie my wife doesn't want to see with.  Want to hit a movie in Bennington some time?
I‚Äôm sorry you had a tough time here.  One man‚Äôs paradise is another‚Äôs nightmare.  I hope you find your place, it‚Äôs a great opportunity to set yourself up for the next phase!  Good luck to you!
As a born and raised Vermonter, I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough go of it.  Vermont isn't for everyone, and as a lot of others have stated it's what you make of it. Have you tried joining any of your local committees or clubs?  Are you an active member of your community? Those are good places to start. If you're expecting people to welcome you with open arms just because you're a new face, don't hold your breath. 

If your job allows, maybe look further north. Franklin County and the NEK have some of the kindest, salt of the earth people I've ever met and I've lived in many other states. Like anything else though, you get out of it what you put into it.  Make an effort to get to know your community and maybe you'll see that it's not as bad as you think. 

I don't mean this to be rude, but why would you move to a very rural state then complain about the lack of convenience?  That's what most of us love about Vermont! There are plenty of other places to live in the USA where everything is easily accessible, it doesn't have to be that way here as well.

Hoping it turns around for you and you're able to find some positives in your life.
"I live in Bennington".....well that is your problem right there
Personally, I'd like that people take small town politics seriously.  They'll likely let less corruption slide.

Sorry you got your belongings stolen, I've been there too and that shit sucks.
[deleted]
Yeah Bennington sucks.
Sorry you‚Äôre having a bad experience but I moved to Vermont 3 years ago and I have been loving it. I‚Äôm in the Chittenden county, I live 15 mins away from Wendy‚Äôs , KFC, Walmart, target, McDonald‚Äôs, etc . I‚Äôm a person of color and the people here are extremely friendly. Doors are being held open for me when I‚Äôm no where close to the building. It just depends on the area you are in tbh. If you want to see for yourself, spend the day or two in the Burlington/south Burlington/williston area and see if it‚Äôs a good fit for you
I moved to VT and left after two years. Just wasn‚Äôt for me and my partner.. no shame
All of New England is very stand off-ish and that is coming from a Vermonter.
Dude, I hear you.  None of this sounds shocking, and I have experienced some of these things myself.  Unfortunately, when this comes up, even in a polite way, many seem to get defensive or explain why it's wrong, and don't even want to listen or try to understand that experience. 

 I do feel that in Vermont, people are willing to help a stranger in need--someone will usually stop if you're on the side of the road type of thing.  But I agree that overall, people don't come across as outwardly friendly and aren't inviting.  I've found a lot of judgemental too. There is this reputation that everyone in Vermont is so friendly, and that hasn't been my experience overall. It is often very hard for people moving into the state to meet people or find more than acquaintances.    Though I'm sure many here will disagree.
Native here. I think it's harder for translants. I always wonder why people come. lol I am moving further up north but I also have an insanely good job and I am okay with this way of life. I visit big cities and enjoy coming home to the quiet after.
>I know this is going to get downvoted and people are going to be mad, but

No one hates this state more than the commentors on r/vermont youll be in good company lol.
Having lived in Bennington for ~18 months, I have to say i have experienced none of the things you have. I'm sorry you are having a crappy time here. I know Bennington has problem areas, just like everywhere else. It sounds like you are in one of those areas? that sucks, and I can't really provide any solid advice.

As for "you can‚Äôt get anything without driving at least 30 minutes to an hour. Want Wendy‚Äôs? Drive to Troy." that doesn't seem like a very valid complaint. That should have been pretty obvious before you moved here. Want Wendy's? Just get Burger King instead... If you want every single fast food choice of your preference on your doorstep, you won't find that here. 

It would have been better to restrict your post to your real, valid concerns. going off on a tangent to the tired, generic complaints of "Vermont isn't like the place I came from, it should change" isn't going to win over many sympathetic ears.
My understanding is that mold can really do a number on your mind and health, I‚Äôm really sorry this is going on for you. I feel like sometimes waiting on good friends to come into one‚Äôs life can be agony, but once they arrive, it feels worth the wait. Don‚Äôt give up‚Äîwelcome here.
People are strange when you‚Äôre a stranger
So there‚Äôs this Vermont farmer out in his dooryard working on his tractor. A guy with a Connecticut license plate stops by and asks him a question. He says, ‚Äú Ihappened to notice some milkweed growing down by your pond. Would it be ok if I go get some milk? ‚ÄúThe farmer , perplexed, says to himself, ‚ÄúThis should be amusing ‚Äú. About an hour later the flatlander returns with 2 bottles full of milk. He thanks the farmer and leaves. The farmer scratches his head in bewilderment, but soon forgets about it. 
The next weekend, the farmer is out cutting wood when again the same car pulls in.
The man from Connecticut says, ‚ÄúI noticed when I was getting milk last weekend that there was some honeysuckle growing and I wondered if I could go get some honey?‚Äù The farmer, remembering his amazement from the previous visit, said, ‚ÄúSure, why not?‚Äù About an hour later, the man from Connecticut returned with 2 jars of honey, thanked the farmer, and left. The farmer was quite baffled by this 2nd incident. 
Being busy though, he quickly forgot about it. 
The next weekend, the farmer was just coming onto his porch when once again the same fellow pulled in again. This time he asked the farmer,
Hey ah, I noticed, down near the woods there‚Äôs some pussy willow‚Äôs growing and‚Ä¶ The farmer said, Hold on, I‚Äôm putting my boots on and coming with you!
Yeah, rural living takes a specific personality type. Thats why most people live in population clusters like metros. Humans are social animals and generally crave other humans. People who prefer rural environments prefer less people and have less exposure to other types of people, personalities or cultures. So they invariable get a little narrow minded, a little overly focussed on the local/self. Its just the general lack of variable life experience overall, I think
In my early 20‚Äôs and live in Bennington! I moved here over a year ago from Oregon and have been pretty lonely as well. Feel free to PM me, I‚Äôd love another friend :)
Some people are not meant to live here dunno why my dude but I've never had any of that happen in my life and I love it here. hope you find your spot.
I just moved here in August and while the people I work with are great and I've met some nice people out and about I have noticed how rude and unwelcoming some people can be. I try not to let it bother me but it can feel isolating, especially if you don't have people around to hang out with.
I moved up six years ago and have experienced the opposite but then again, I come from arguably the most rude state in the country (one reason of many for the move) so anything is a step up from that. I think there is a healthy skepticism here of outsiders until locals know your intentions because there are people who come here and want to change things to where they came from. I always am floored by that. If I wanted convenience stores, big box stores, night life and strip malls I would have stayed in Jersey. I left because I could not stand any of that even as a kid. Give me nature and slow living and mom and pop stores and farmstands and town meetings and land for miles. That‚Äôs Vermont to me. Less people is a bonus.
As a 26 almost 27 year old that was born here, lived here my whole life, and has only visited VA Beach, Hampton(NH), Maine, NY, NC & PA. I can confidently say I hate it here. I cannot wait to get out. There is absolutely nothing here, the drugs, stealing and just straight chaos where I live(Swanton) and around where I live, like Saint Albans, I‚Äôm over it. I went to school and was friends with people I now see on the streets strung out, robbing and breaking into peoples car/homes. And don‚Äôt even get me started on Burlington, I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable driving through that city anymore, let alone walking on church street, stabbings, shootings. I got harassed by a dude sitting on the sidewalk with a crack pipe in his hand because I told him I didn‚Äôt smoke when he asked if I had a cigarette he could have. Like you said, this stuff happens everywhere, but all the bad doesn‚Äôt out weigh the good in this state to me. I don‚Äôt ski, I hate snow and the cold and I won‚Äôt leave my house without carrying anymore. 
But I‚Äôm so sorry all that bad stuff has happened to you! Hopefully you get some good luck soon!
I‚Äôve been here 23-24 years. and I‚Äôm not a big fan of Vermont.

(always a flatlander if your grandparents weren‚Äôt born here.)
I agree with some of what you said but there‚Äôs also some stuff I like about Vermont. The isolation and peace is great but it comes at a price. 

It‚Äôs a nice place for this chapter in our lives but we realized about a year in that we don‚Äôt see ourselves here long term. 

The biggest problems are around availability of services and health care. I have to wait 10 months for a basic eye exam or a year for a dental cleaning. I was floored the first time I learned that. But that‚Äôs on us, we didn‚Äôt research carefully. 

Also, there is truly no social life for most towns. Things close at 5-9pm and that‚Äôs basically it. Our social life is the bar and the gym which is fine but also incredibly limiting. Finding younger people our age is a challenge.

Being around our family is important but we‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs just not enough to keep us here. Good luck, OP.
I'm right outside the arlington stewarts and got a thank you for holding the door.
Pretty much sums up all of New England actually, they all have rough spots and youre in one. Takes some getting used to for some things, I would imagine. I'm born and raised and it's about assimilating or at least don't let it get to you. 


Bennington is one of the higher crime rates per 1,000 people and ranks a "6" with "100" being the safest for scale. 

At least it's not Montpelier. A lot of homeless.
I'm sorry you've had such bad luck. It's not the norm, in my experience. 

Other than the Czech Republic, you don't mention where you hail from. Where did you move to VT from? 

For me, I moved here 40 years ago for two things: to be left the fuck alone, and *to be left the motherfuckingshit alone*. (And all the beauty and nature, etc etc) And in that, I have been pretty darn happy.

But being young and living here I can see being pretty lonely. But there are plenty of bars and open mic nights and whatnot in Bennington, and I'm sure ManchVegas has similar. Have you checked them out?
Thanks everyone for your comments! For those of you who said ‚Äújust leave,‚Äù I‚Äôve decided that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. My mum is very sick, and I‚Äôm leaving to go take care of her. 

Vermont is not the worst place in the world. I‚Äôve met a number of cool people and my job has enriched me professionally, but it‚Äôs all been too much for me. I‚Äôm out. I‚Äôm happy that you‚Äôve all found a place that you love, but this just ain‚Äôt it for me!
It‚Äôs super expensive to live here for what it has to offer. Used to be a good state to live in, until politics completely took over here and ran it into the ground. If you‚Äôre looking to move somewhere (especially if you‚Äôre younger and looking to start a family) don‚Äôt move here.
It sound like you and Vermont are compatible. I honestly hope you find a good place to settle that you are more comfortable in.

Reading between the lines, I get the impression you are also dealing with the lower income side of things. Living in VT with a low income is particularly difficult right now with the prices of housing, food, transportation, etc.
I'm a bit confused by some of this. You say you live in southern VT but that you experience the most issues in "northern areas" - what does that mean? 

Also it's pretty easy to do a little research and realize that, if fast food is your thing, living in rural vermont is likely to not be for you. Same goes with having to drive 30min to everything - 5 minutes on google maps could tell you this. Local politics too serious? These people actually really care about this place that they call home - it's ok that you don't care for it and don't call it home, but don't hold it against people who are passionate about it. Be happy that there aren't more serious issues to deal with than open sign colors. I don't have a response for all the thefts and whatnot - but it does seem you have been disproportionately impacted by theft which raises some questions. Sucks that your apartment was moldy but that happens everywhere in the world, and it sounds like your landlord took care of it which can sometimes be easier said than done. 

Finally, very, and I mean VERY, few people are moving to Bennington/Sunderland for work. They just aren't. So the infrastructure isn't really built for young newcomers to the working scene. 

I get it, it sucks, you're unhappy, but I think you're blaming the fact that you and Vermont aren't compatible on Vermont. Believe it or not there are plenty of people happily living here and working on improving many things - and the entire state doesn't really owe you anything in terms of changing for you. Again I can appreciate your position, but your angst is misguided and your energy would be better spent finding a way to get to a different place that works better for you.
Start Mountain Biking. Vermont has really good trails and it‚Äôs something fun to do.
I am from Long Island a have a camp just over the boarder from Bennington in NY.  I often go to Bennington for drinks and food. I have found the locals welcoming.  I have even frequented some of the places you‚Äôve mentioned.  If a flat lander can be accepted a guy from Maine surely can.  Kill them with kindness
Damn OP,  this really hit home hard for me. I moved to Vermont several years ago in my early 20s to work in restaurants in Woodstock.

/rant

I was pretty shocked to be treated like a colonizing foreigner while simultaneously reading in the news about labor shortages and how the economy is basically begging for people like me. There wasn't a single restaurant or store that wasn't understaffed or hiring.

I COMPLETELY understand locals being pissed about out of staters buying up property for their second home. Hell, it pissed me off too. 

Mind you, I am in the Woodstock/Quechee area of all places. It was mind boggling that people my age were so smug and standoffish to outsiders. Meanwhile, their parents probably moved there in the 90s so they can golf and open some bullshit antique shop with their Goldman Sachs pensions. But since these crunchy Karens and gatekeeping Gregs were born in the shadows of an exclusive country club and had an 802 phone number they get to be "real Vermonters." Silver spoon ass fake hippies.. smh. 

Anyway, shout out to the working class Vermonters and other foreigners in the trenches. Y'all were real ones. Make sure to smile when you bring them their $24 locally sourced cheeseburger during the dinner rush.

/end rant
This is a rural state, it's normal to drive 20 minutes to a grocery store if you live in a backwoods little town like Arlington.¬†


There no shame in not fitting in, so you should try somewhere else.¬†There is shame in whining and then doing nothing to remedy yourself.


But let me cry big salty tears that your favorite brand of fast-food is far away. One of the things that like about VT is that bland chain-franchises don't quite have a stranglehold on lower-end dining.
Sorry to hear this. I know most people will upvote this because Vermonters want Vermont to not change. So take your upvotes. 

But just fyi your experience sounds pretty odd. Don‚Äôt want to downplay it but to anyone who wants to move to Vermont should do lots of research first. And I mean actually visit the place you want to live for extended period of time. Because Vermont is rural you need to check your specific area and know what you are getting into. Living 2 towns over could be completely different. I am sorry you didn‚Äôt know about 30 minute drive for anything but you should know that before you move. We enjoy that and want it to stay that way. Sorry about the bad stuff that happened but some of the stuff you complain about is why we live here. 

Much love to you and hope things change. Living in southern Vermont is also much different than other places. It all depends on pocket and situation but I hope things get better for you.
Vermont is full of people who aren‚Äôt from Vermont. They probably aren‚Äôt even from New England.
I'm so sorry that all those horrible things happened to you! I hope things get better for you. I was lucky to move away from Bennington, but now I'm so far from stores, as you said. 

What kind of clothes do you need? DM me your size - I can deliver some to you or something!
I‚Äôm sorry for your experience. It is tough in VT. A lot of wannabes pretending that love and acceptance are paramount to any other values‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but only if you think exactly like they do. There are good people here, though. I hope you find em.
You deserve better! That‚Äôs not your place, those are just not your people, and there are better opportunities in kinder places. It may work for some, but not everywhere is suited for everyone. I‚Äôm so sorry, that sounds like a really shitty year. Onwards and upward my friend, keep moving along ‚ú®
I have friends in VT and most of their local culture is centered around keeping community small and hating on anyone that‚Äôs not from VT. NY, CT, and MA bring up all the money for skiing and hiking and the Vermonters act like they don‚Äôt need the tourists or the tax revenue from outside home ownership, but they desperately do. All while having an aura of being somehow better than you for absolutely no reason at all. It‚Äôs very strange.
Me too, man.

I have had my car stolen, iPhone, professional camera and so so so much more stolen from my car. I also grew up in a mold infested house and it largely impacted my health. Your story is not unique unfortunately. And the awful judgement if you say you grew up in Barre, Rutland, Hardwick, Bennington, Milton or the Old North End or any trailer park really. They automatically think you are trash. Even though there are good neighborhoods in each of those towns, it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Some people just don't like it here and there's nothing wrong with that. I find it very easy to make friends here, but enough people struggle that it's clear not everyone has that experience.


The housing does suck, no arguments there, that's my own biggest complaint with the state. The quality of this state's housing stock is absolutely abysmal.



Sorry you haven't enjoyed yourself, hope you eventually find happiness either here or elsewhere.
Sorry your time in our fair state hasn't been the greatest. Vermont is not for everyone. I was going to be sarcastic and say something witty because sarcasm is our love language here in Vermont, but you have already received your daily dose of that. If I were you, I would actively be looking for somewhere more suited to your lifestyle. Maybe not in New England.
I moved here from Ohio. Definitely feel the "cold and standoffish" thing you feel but I always assumed it was because I was used to mid-western politeness.
VT is a strange state.

First state to abolish slavery and the last to ratify the 19th amendment.   It went into eugenics for awhile and wanted to be independent.   

It has an issue with drug use and crime.  It's only increased and gotten worse since the pandemic.  There is no answer to this so far.  

On the national level, Vt is usually seen as having covered bridges everywhere, the leaves are in perpetual state of changing leaves, there's a covered bridge around every corner, Bernie Sanders is from there, and there's Champ on the discovery channel people know about.  Knowledge seems to end there.  Weirdly enough I have found VTers more friendly on vacation out of state than actually in state.  I guess because of how small the state is and running into others.  

VT was once a republican stronghold and over time due to the Eisenhower administration managed to put in the highway system making Chittenden County  have far more left moving in.  Ironically, the democratic party platform has the same beliefs as the 1956 party platform, giving credence to intellectual claims that the democratic party is actually more of a republican party platform of the 1950s and the Republican Party is far, far right.  

VT seems to have its democratic stronghold which has led to more gentrification and overall numerous people moving out of state from the cities.  It has areas largely impoverished and decaying.  The quality or spirit has declined.   One county caters more to the rich and not to those that have lived here for generations and doesn't do much to help them. The very principles aren't applied to their own state, like making a living wage to be in VT, affordable housing program to an instate and first time buyer.  

 Most can't afford to live here and they move out of state.  Most of the state's character has largely turned more into a state of renting out giant 1800s homes into 5 to 6 apartments with slum lords and people that don't live there.  Overtime, towns themselves, similar to other states in NE, are rich and mostly empty, but that changed once the owner realized that it wasn't that bad to live in the third mansion remotely for some time as opposed to a few days a year.  The prices went up and zero has been done to address it.  That goes with rent and also housing.  

Outside of Chittenden County, we get more into rural areas, where such an such person stayed on a plot of land that was likely stolen by Native Americans and has led lived there for several generations.  They are largely foreclosed in thinking, belief system, and unaware of an outside world think populist MAGA.  Like other states, in the US, one isn't really accepted if they have to move around a lot.  Most don't have much of an open mind.  It isn't necessarily all, but is most, dependent on demographics and location.  

VT might be a microcosm of everything wrong with the US and its issues happen elsewhere.  I'm largely convinced its not fixable at this point.  A lot needs to change.
If you want fast food at a moments notice, move back to the city. It sounds like you moved here with no knowledge of the area and are experiencing buyers' remorse. Vermont is a very particular state with very particular people. Your complaints are in the same vain of moving to Arizona and complaining it's hot and there's too much sand
You're not crazy and you're not alone. I felt the same way before making the decision to leave. Vermont can be exceedingly cruel and asks too much of it's working class. I get the feeling that the only people who think it's paradise have never really lived anywhere else. It sounds like it might be time for you to either substantially change your circumstances here, or to plan to thrive somewhere else. The community here is not interested in change and as the state ages and young professionals and families feel less and less welcome, I am not optimistic that things will get better. And ignore the negative voices on this thread. Less than a year ago I saw this online community mocking a woman who was snowed in with young children and just looking for someone she could pay to help plow her out. The same people who think they are ruggedly independent will desperately expect someone else to solve their problems for them the moment the shoe is on the other foot. They also seem to think driving out young professionals will somehow help their housing crisis rather than just a result in a resource poor community where it is impossible to get any help for anything other than exorbitant prices, just further pricing out those who can barely afford to be here.

Good fortune to you and if you choose to leave, know that you didn't fail. Vermont failed you.
I could say a lot to commiserate with you here as I'm not originally from here but have been here long enough to at least find some kind of personal balance and I'm not far from you so some of what you said I've experienced. I'll refrain from writing a novel though. But yeah, I get what you're saying.

It's even weirder when you've traveled a fair bit and things like people from Manchester treating people from Bennington like that just seems so... Small world.

You've definitely had some bad experiences above and beyond what I've seen: health, crime, etc. Like you said that can happen anywhere. But it's compounded on other actual local issues.
Try a different perspective. Maybe reflective.
Come to NH
‚ÄúFrom Away‚Äù
I‚Äôm from Indiana and Arizona.  Moved up here in 06.   There are ups and downs.  As a guy of color I‚Äôve experienced more positive connections.  The winters here suck tho lol. I do miss Arizona everyday.   I have met good friends here in vt
I live in rural N.H. not far from vt.    It‚Äôs basically the same here.
We moved to close to Brattleboro and moved away. I 100% agree with your comment about people being judgey. Come to Mass, you‚Äôll be much happier. 

You need a tribe in VT and we couldn‚Äôt find one.
Yo try New Hampshire. It‚Äôs awesome here. Look at Laconia/Lakes Region.
Would you consider moving to Williamstown in Mass? It‚Äôs just a little farther south of Bennington. I always thought it had a better vibe
Come to Philly, you‚Äôll be happier.
Toughen up or move to a city.
I mean, its all full of yanks.
I live and work in Bennington. Is it great? No, but then it's hardly a cesspool either. Like most places, it is what you make it to be. Do you live in a Peter Cross apartment by chance? :p



I was born and raised in London, a city with 10x the population of the whole state of VT, and have had no problems at all settling in...even as a queer person with a weird accent. People have been nothing but kind.

  
Anyway, anecdotal evidence is anecdotal, I guess.
I lived there ten years as a teen and was miserable. Nothing to do. Nowhere to go and no way to get there. Sorry you are having a bad time.
Let me just ask you this- have you ever met a Vermonter outside of Vermont? Rarely. They are in a rural area for a reason. You have to earn their trust and respect.
this might be the one rare occasion where you‚Äôd be happier if you were closer to rutland
Hey just wanted to say I hear you and that sucks. I had a really similar experience moving to Maine for a bit a few years ago (minus the car thing.) everyone around me was retired and the few young people I met had just lived such different lives that we could only connect on a superficial level and felt pressure to get along because there were so few of us. I worked really terrible jobs and suffered a ton of health issues, went through horrible living situations and eventually just left. I say this because like Vermont people love Maine for the beauty and peace and it has plenty of that, but sometimes a place isn‚Äôt a good fit and you just have shit luck. My advice is take a deep breath, do some research, find a goal and make a move somewhere. It changed my life and I hope yours improves soon. Sorry you‚Äôre going through this but is gets better.
I live in Vermont and it‚Äôs beautiful but all the problems are swept under the rug and as far as peoples behavior I‚Äôve noticed that no one says excuse me or thank you . I hope you have just had some bad luck and I hope things get better for you I honestly love vt I‚Äôve traveled and have felt the same as you everywhere else even here
Glad to see you‚Äôre not being downvoted. :) I‚Äôve met a few nice ppl in Montpelier‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs HARD‚ÄîI‚Äôve met the nicest folks at the Marshfield general store. Hands down. Lol. I have no idea why this is! I stopped in once to ask where to get a hair cut for my husband and two older men came out from the back to give me the most detailed directions, ever. The young blonde who is the cashier? The sweetest. They bother with the smallest courtesy. There seems to be a really good mix of older and younger kind ppl there. And my husband works in Cabot where everyone he works with are very kind. A lot are much younger. 
From what I gather? They don‚Äôt live in Cabot but around there. I think VT is very different town to town. I‚Äôm still new here as well. But I‚Äôd recommend the area I‚Äôm in. Parkapoolza is every Thursday with music. There‚Äôs lots of music and art stuff going on downtown. Not some huge show type thing but looks like decent bars with outside seating and looking out into streets. Maybe try this area next for a night out?
I'm currently living in Barre, not by choice (rough situation and had friends offer a place to stay), and after working for nearly a year at a "decent" paying job, there's no way I'm affording my own place.

I travel south into the Albany NY area on a regular basis and am pretty well acquainted with towns along the route through family and friends. Family and friends is key. Trying to exist here as someone starting out is nearly impossible without a ton of money or assistance, and if the  assistance doesn't come from within the state, then it has to come from bringing folks with you. 

So you either don't need the help, which implies you're of a different socio-economic class than most of the blue-collar farmer hunter types, or you need the help and end up bringing in outsiders and end up "changing" Vermont. Difficult to feel welcome, but I spent more than 50% of my life in NY so not feeling welcome doesn't bother me right now.

Bennington is a great place to just pass right on through. The welcome center on rt 7 has great bathrooms.
I should have added NH and ME are very very similar: you can be in one town with a great overall friendly and open vibe. Drive twenty minutes south and get your wallet stolen, in a fight, attacked. Etc etc. it sounds crazy but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve been all over. And I got robbed more In Portland Maine than in Oakland CA. I dealt with more bold faced racism in big ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù posturing cities. 
Our expectations and experiences can differ wildly to say the least.
Well friend as soon as I saw in the first paragraph that you live in Bennington I can surmise that I don‚Äôt need the res of the post to believe you
I've never been to Vermont, but we moved to the North Shore in Minnesota a few years ago and love it. To be honest we're a couple of wallflowers and a wee bit socially awkward. I grew up in a really bad part of Kansas City but have never felt so at ease as I do here. The crime is low, people people seem pretty happy and seem to.come back after moving elsewhere.¬†


Either way I hope you can find something that can turn things around.¬†
I don't know, you kind of complain like a Vermonter...
 Us New Englanders are not soft and warm we‚Äôre hard on the outside and way colder than our winters. It‚Äôs just how we are, the no saying thank you is pretty on par for up north sadly. The theft is something new since the lawlessness started in 2020 sadly.
Hi! I also recently moved to Bennington and totally get it. I found one thing that helped was frequenting one local spot a lot (even just to hang out) helps as people stare at you less and the waitstaff get to know you (I did Sunny Side and the Local). There‚Äôs a few walks around that happen through Bennington museum which may be good for getting to know people.
Vermont sucks
I worked in Bennington for over seven years and never once felt welcomed or accepted by the community. They have  really insular us vs. them mentality that I can‚Äôt get behind.
I moved to Vermont back in 2018, and moved out 6 months later.

The people around Bellows Falls are just nasty.  And I hate to say it, but when there is only one or two minority families in an area, that‚Äôs a huge red flag.

On a side note, there were more Black Lives Matter posters in Vermont than in Boston üòÇ
20 something looking to move to Vermont? If you want any semblance of urban amenities move to Burlington or close by. If you like outdoor recreation (biking, hiking, skiing), move to the Waterbury area. There's a little bit of a younger vibe in the Upper Valley, though it skews towards health care professionals and those connected to Dartmouth. Pretty much EVERYWHERE else is going to be a struggle; rural, expensive, boring, poverty stricken, drug problems, older demographics, second home owners, insular; take your pick or combination.
Vermont is horrible
I love to look at Vermont, it looks good on paper. I have isolated myself because people are rude and inconsiderate and I don't like people. But I think that is just what society is now. Everything just seems unreal.
This post just sent my husband and I into a serious conversation about what we‚Äôre doing here.  Have lots of acreage and he works outside everyday.  He loves it and so does every tourist who walks along our road.  When we bought the place 11 years ago, people were not friendly AT ALL.  A neighbor used to yell at my husband for coming up here and buying the land and raising their taxes. Apparently they don‚Äôt understand that my increased property taxes are paying for their shack. We live here full time and the only friends we‚Äôve made moved here from out of state.  The 5 most famous words are ‚ÄúI‚Äôm originally from New Jersey‚Äù.  I miss so many things from my ‚Äòother life‚Äô.  Everything I have is from Amazon.  I‚Äôm not looking for fast food. 

This place will go in trust for my 3 children to figure out.  In the meantime, I‚Äôll keep searching for my niche.  I‚Äôm really open to new ideas but currently I have a sour taste in my mouth from where I landed.
That's because that's not really vermonters thise down there are more like mass holes. Come up to the real vermont.
I love Vermont and absolutely hate Bennington with a passion. It‚Äôs a shit hole and I used to live in Manchester, NH, Bridgeport, CT, and Woonsocket, RI‚Ä¶so I know shit holes.
....It's Vermont!
People in Vermont are 100% ruder than people in New Hampshire or Maine. I have no idea why
You have to be a townie to live there
Nobody cares what Manchester thinks and Bennington is kind of a shit hole. 

Sorry it didn't work out for you

I wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the US but people suck everywhere. Xenophobia is real up here and people can smell bullshit a mile away.
Assuming OP works for Orvis?
Im sorry all that happened to you, but I understand what you are feeling. I came to VT from NYC when I was 15 yrs old let me tell you CULTURE SHOCK!!!  I have gone back and fourth on weekends because there was nothing to do, I couldn‚Äôt make friends because one of the mothers told her kids to stay away from me because I came from the city and I was bad news!!

I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out and when I finally did and moved back to NYC it was the happiest day of my life. 

I never ever called myself a Vermonter, I was at that time and will be forever a New Yorker!!
Moved to Bennington a little over a year ago and have had the polar opposite experience here.  Everyone I've met have been super friendly to me.  Sorry you're having this bad of a time.
I was born and raised in Chicago and never had been broken into and robbed until I moved to Vermont..
I moved to a small town near St Johnsbury back in 03.  Found the locals extremely unfriendly and the flat lander resentment was clear.  (I came from Long Island, NY).  Sold cars and that was fun and made a lot of friends.  Met my second wife there and went back to NY after three years.  (With her) Got easy after a while but the first few months were lonely.  VT is a beautiful spot but it suffers the same low level drug fueled crime and shittiness as every other place in the US.  Loneliness can strike anywhere.  Reach out to old friends to get you through.
...move to Burlington
If chains like Wendy‚Äôs and Walmart are important to you, maybe you are more cut out for someplace like Detroit. On the other hand, if going to local businesses with tastefully-designed signs and talking with your friends about local updates is your vibe, that‚Äôs southwestern Vermont.

Rudeness is a Bennington thing‚Äîit‚Äôs an increasingly poor town that gets left behind more and more every year. If I lived there, I‚Äôd probably be bitter too. I don‚Äôt know anyone who would recommend that someone move there.
I was born in Bennington and lived in Arlington and Wilmington. Vermont is a very insular, xenophobic place. They even side-eye people who leave and comeback. There‚Äôs also the issue of so many dying little towns that can‚Äôt admit they‚Äôre in a death spiral. Arlington being one.
I lived there over 7 years.  He is describing the situation in Vermont fairly honestly.  It is also extremely expensive.  Housing can be hard to find outside of Burlington or Waterbury.
From north shore Boston, lived in Denver metro/Colorado most of my 20‚Äôs, then back to MA for a few and at 30 I took a position in southern VT and moved. Living in Bratt and working in Chester, engage in recreation all over southern and central VT.

I disagree. Sorry to hear you‚Äôve struggled however. Hope it turns around.
I don‚Äôt blame you, my family moved out 2 years ago and haven‚Äôt looked back since, state sucks ass
Dude I'm from VT and I love my friends and family but I barely even want to be here. The moldy apartments I can afford suck. The food is so expensive. There's drugs everywhere. The flooding seem be getting worse. IDK dude. I wish I could leave. Unless you're insanely wealthy you can't live here
Yea I left for Boston and Denver in my 20s, can‚Äôt wait to move back soon in my mid 30s! Sounds like you need a busier place with newer apartments, Colorado is cool
Vermont is not for everyone, even living in or near chittenden county.  In my experience, folks living in the southern part of the state don't hold true to what a "Vermont Lifestyle" is.   Please don't blame Vermont for other folks having a bad attitude, i can assure you that is not normal.  I would suggest that if you feel this uncomfortable here, seeking an alternative place to live/work would be the best idea.   

As a side note, i notice you didn't mention anything about your ethnic group, which unfortunately does have a lot to do with how certain people treat you.  You mentioned the Czech Republic, so i'm going to assume you have an accent, and don't really look like the folks around here.   Don't take that heart, there is still quite a bit of xenophobia around here, much to my dismay.  Chin up, and find your place, i know you can.  Good luck!
I loved Vermont but it didn‚Äôt love me back (lived in Burlington)
You get an upvote from me. I grew up here and it used to be so much better here‚Ä¶  less crime. It is a beautiful state as far as rolling hillsides and old wooden bridges go. I used to think people here were actually nice too (I‚Äôd always get a wave or two from people walking by on the road.) But I too have noticed a decline in curtesy. People who are here now are not nice. I also had to deal with mold illness from the house I was living in, so I can relate to that, as well. I connect the decline of Vermont to the local Politics. We let anyone and everyone into this state now. A friend of mine who grew up in the hood and moved here to escape it, said it is looking just like the hood. Graffiti everywhere, escalating crimes, etc. Our Socialist Politicians also say ‚ÄúTax the rich!‚Äù‚Ä¶ but instead they tax the common man, and farmers, etc. People are getting sick of it. This state has declined and I agree, until it changes this state is going to sink alongside those who supposedly ‚Äúlead it‚Äù.
Relatable. Came here for work and not flourishing also in my mid/late 20s.
VT is very politically polarized. You have the native liberal conservatives (doesn‚Äôt fit in modern politics), and the super progressive trust fund flatlanders that have moved in. It sounds like you are a good kid, holding doors open and such, might even fit in with the former.some of us have been here since the 1500‚Äôs and dont like change. Others just got here and want to make it like where they came from. It can be hostile, and rightfully so. Pick your sides and choose your battles wisely.
I was born and raised in Vermont (WRJ area), but moved to NH 5 years ago and would highly recommend NH over Vermont for several reasons.  

1st - NH prosecutes criminals and seems to have much less break ins and theft because of it.  NH also seems to be able to retain experienced police officers that care about the towns they serve and the people in them - many towns in Vermont have reduced police numbers and prosecutors seem to have a catch and release policy for criminals.

2nd - No state income tax in NH is like having a ~6% pay bump over Vermont.

3rd - More medium to large size towns with grocery and box stores make it more convenient than most of Vermont.

4th - Better infrastructure (less road washouts/closures) and more reliable snow clearing and road treatment in the winter.

It makes me sad the way Vermont has gone downhill over the last 5-10 years and I will always have love for the state.  Most of my (very large) family still lives in Vermont and I visit often...
I live in New Hampshire. I met a man from an old Vermont family (Colonial settlers)  who lives in the North East Kingdom area of Vermont. He hates Vermont now too because of all the outsiders who moved in, many from New York, and changed the culture of the State.
"If you‚Äôre in your 20s/30s and you‚Äôre thinking of moving to VT by yourself for work or something, just don‚Äôt."

We found common ground. Please do what you can to spread the word as wide as possible. Do Not Come Here.
Vermont has bad areas like any other state.  Please don‚Äôt generalize the state because of one particular experience that sounds like being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Vermont is the most beautiful state I have ever lived, that being said the price for that are long winters, solitude, and hard work, did I mention solitude.  These are also what you have to embrace to enjoy life here.  You can be happy or unhappy anywhere, it‚Äôs not always about the place, manifest destiny.  Truly hope things get better.
Hey thanks for holding the door.  Fell better now.  Btw I am a Mainer and we hate people.  VT peeps are the best.
Wow. Thank you. üôè THIS ^^ has been our exact experience living in the Brattleboro area now for well over 10 years. Don‚Äôt even ask me why we are still here‚Ä¶ Only to say that when you have children it‚Äôs much harder to move out of state ‚Ä¶I find that the locals take themselves way too seriously ‚Äî and take it upon themselves to educate newcomers on how to parent, own a dog, own a home, etc., regardless of how seasoned you might be. 
I never thought that I could miss Connecticut! But I do. And Vermonters say CT natives are **unfriendly**!?! Hah.
Probably should pin this to the top of the subreddit.
I moved to Vermont 3 years ago. I don‚Äôt like it. During those three years I haven‚Äôt really made any friends. I did learn how to ski and fly fish, so I guess there‚Äôs that. 

My wife and kids don‚Äôt want to leave which is sad as I now need to return to the office so I‚Äôm dragging them back at the end of the school year.
Sounds like you‚Äôre just having a string of bad luck, and instead of considering things to be grateful for, you‚Äôre putting bad energy out. Consider this, you do have a landlord who fixed things. You do have a good job so you can deal with issues. People are probably picking up on your energy that you do hate it here so they avoid you at all costs. I think if you leave you‚Äôll find your problems were not geographical at all. And just some advice, which is good advice no matter where you live. Don‚Äôt leave things in your car. Because it must really suck to be the person who needs clothes so bad they need to commit a felony
Shit. This sounds like the peak of shitty experiences.  I‚Äôm not saying this for any reason except to empathize with you.  Sorry this hasn‚Äôt worked out.
I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you!! I agree there‚Äôs way too many judgy people here, and being a type of different makes people treat you like shit. I hope you receive help somehow and the friends you have keep you supported. Keep your head up you got this (my apartment also has mold in it so I feel you)
Bennington has a very high crime rate. 

Passing through there years ago I got a vibe suggesting it was an even more isolating place to live than where I lived at the time. I didn‚Äôt last  long living up there. Never even met my neighbors
I moved to the NEK and it‚Äôs been great. Perhaps explore other areas of the state? I‚Äôve been here 5 months and the most consistent feedback I hear from locals is stay away from south/south central Vermont üòÖ
You don't get all of that in the greater Burlington area.  The cost of living is higher, but I think you would have a much better experience.
Grew up in Bennington, and yeah, this tracks lol
Many of the towns in Chittenden County are great places. I lived and raised a family in Richmond, and now I have a daughter who loves Hinesburg. Great schools there. 

Although,  it is stupid expensive to live there, rents are high, real estate is basically out of reach for 1st time buyers. Avg home is $380k, and that gets you just above a trailer for a home, maybe 2 bdrm, 1 bath.
I lived in somewhat sketchy parts of New York City for over 20 years and was never once a victim of crime. Vermont is statistically about the safest place you can live, so to hear someone had their car broken into not once but twice is...odd to put it mildly. Not saying it didn't happen, just that it's a freak occurance that's not representative of the state. I'm sorry to hear you've had a bad time hear and hope things improve. It's far from perfect but as someone who has lived in many parts of the nation (including the deep South) I'd take Vermont's quirks any day of the week.
I‚Äôm from NH. Traveled to VT over years and nearly every time I am left shaking my head wondering WTF????! It is strangest place. Weird. Creepy. Try to avoid going there at nearly any cost. I have driven to Boston to go to THE Somerville Home Depot rather than cross the Connecticut river and wander into VT.
I live down the road from Bennington. Your description is right on. I live between Bennington and Pittsfield, so for Home Depot and some other stuff we switch off which one we go to. Bennington is uncomfortable. Shirley Jackson wrote The Lottery and some of her other work while living there, and I don‚Äôt think much has changed.
If youre ever down in the upper valley ill take ya out for some drinks. Show ya some friendly faces around to help offset the negativity
Sorry that your having a bad experience and hope it does get better truly, only issue I find with ur post is ur line about caring about local politics. Those are in fact the politics you should care about THE MOST; ur example sure is what ever its just a sign color after all.
I feel you on the Ramunto‚Äôs comment lol. I stayed in Bennington for a weekend this March, and when I walked in to pick up the pizza I ordered, the entire bar, full of people, turned around and stared at me as I walked to the counter. It was like they could smell I wasn‚Äôt from there.
I‚Äôm so sorry. Grew up in vt and this makes me sad.
Sorry for your troubles man.  Get out of Bennington for one.  Never felt there was much going on there.   But also, this is a low population state‚Ä¶makes social options for newcomers minimal.  But most important thing I wanted to ask‚Ä¶is Ramuntos in Bennington going down hill?  I feel like it used to be really good‚Ä¶..noticed the crust started getting overly thin recently‚Ä¶.cheese/crust ratio is way off, and slice is getting floppy/soggy.  Wasn‚Äôt always like that.
This place is crazy I am down in southern Vermont and we had a foreign exchange student at my school some years back. I was nice to him like I am to everyone I meet. Am he asked me where I was born. When I told him here in Vermont he thought I was joking. 

Seems people in the school and area weren‚Äôt the nicest to him and he didn‚Äôt think someone as nice as me could be born here. 

I‚Äôm sorry so much has been happening to you. I wish people could be nicer. I know if I saw you I would feel special just getting to see someone so nice out in the real world. Please don‚Äôt let the mean people drag you down to their level and know I would be happy to help how ever I could. With a home made batch of cookies to brighten your day or some fruits from my garden to help you smile.
Sorry you are going through this , Vermont has the most Curmudgeon people in New England,  post your job experience with your story and you will probably get a few offers outside of Vermont
I left Vermont about 15 years ago. Best decision of my life. It‚Äôs a beautiful place but it was not the right place for me. I still have family there so I visit occasionally. My life has improved in so many ways since I left.

Perhaps you need a change of scenery too.
I moved to Vermont for a job (Poultney) about a year ago and really like it.  Thankfully it was super easy for me to meet a lot of new people
Who were into the same outdoors stuff as me.  Im in my mid 30s tho when I was 25 I stil lived in NYC.
Need more posts like this in the sub to deter transplants
People in Vermont hate outsiders. That‚Äôs why I left moved over to Utah better skiing anyways.
I lived there for around 5 years, and I agree.  Getting involved with the local community is hard.  You almost have to get started in a town that is mostly people who didn't grow up there.  I lived in both Plainfield and Cabot, and the people were pretty nice.  The standoffish thing is definitely just a New England attitude, people are weird up there.  There's also very high taxes that don't pay for the right things.  It's not the worst place to live, but it's far from this idealic fairy tale land that so many people think it is.  I moved back to York County, Pennsylvania, in late 2023, and I absolutely love it here! ü§ò
Vermont is a joke. State has turned into California
Sorry about your experience. I lived nearby in Granville NY about 20 minutes to Dorset VT I loved it there
Thats so interesting. I have spent a lot of time in the Czech Republic and found people there to be incredibly kind, and friendly and willing to go out of their way for you.


Vermonters I find pretty neutral I guess but New Englanders in general can be a bit funky with non locals though that is what Vermont seems to be filled with.
Oddly I am sitting in my den in shaftsbury.  I must say this is the closest Ive gotten to any feedback on vermont.  I grew up In western mass and moved to nyc in 1994. Got the hell Out of dodge just over a year ago.  Nyc lost its luster for me big time.  Full disclosure I have a house here and managed to reconnect with a few highs school friends and actually met my wife in becket mass.  I worked in the financial industry for over twenty years and it was a shitshow of ego, backstabbing and judgment.  I figured i could make it work but outside of bucolic scenery vermont has mostly three classes; lifelong vermont folks who are plugged into many legacy jobs, contractors etc.  of labor work who make good money, the aristocrat class who are every bit an asshole and any nyc entitled wealthy person, and the severely poor.  Finding work is very difficult as there isnt much industry ‚Äúby design‚Äù as far as i am concerned.  I am 53 working retail making not enough money to
Survive.  I have had to resort working  seven days a week in order to
Make do.   I feel
Your pain and i am sorry.  If vermont were a living organism, the asshole
Would be bennington.  Total shit show.  Text me Back if you want to Chat.
Vermont gives the US a bad name. Literally anywhere else in New England will seem like paradise compared to that dump. Bennington is a shining star of the incest capital of the world.
Wow I actually heard bad things about bennington, or someone just said a negative comment about the place, but I didn't know much about the area at the time, so I didn't know whether to believe it or not. I will say this, in regards to culture, welcome to new england. Some people, especially from rural areas may not have the posh manners we might have or they weren't ever taught them. They actually might have some that city folks DON'T HAVE. People in New England, especially Vermont, are miserable! BUT the catch is, i.e., my neighbor and I may act like this, but if I needed something, they would help! And likewise. I've noticed that people have less etiquette these days, less people saying thank you for small things like holding the door. And welcome to the New England, and the US where people care more about the color of a sign that anything else. People in manchester may have nothing else to care about than that. Want good food I suggest you make your own. I work with guys who refuse to buy meat or chicken from the store! The fastest food I know and like to eat is deer, not any grocery store food. (And i havent hunted yet). Wendy's is garbage! Another point about new england, is that Vermonters, Mainers. Hampshirites, CT people, Rhode Islanders, all act like A holes. Maybe some more or less.And people in northern communities think it's just a flatlander ting.  And there's def a lot of towns, or town bars, where they haven't seen a new face before lol. Back to manners, being looked at might be better than totally being ignored. People are curious/nosy in meeeew england.
People here are miserable and the schools are horrible!
I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you. It sounds like something is telling you to leave that place/area. Sometimes it just isn‚Äôt a good fit or timing and that‚Äôs ok, now you know and can move on.
The liberals have destroyed Vermont & New Hampshire is getting just as bad, move south, that‚Äôs what we did, people are much friendlier
You should come to Texas  !
I get it! I've lived here 30 years and have no friends that actually stayed in Vermont. I will say the younger generation are much more pleasant to deal with.
That was me. I left 4 months ago and I‚Äôm a lot happier. 

I‚Äôm not sorry to say that Vermont is trashy. Too expensive. Taxes won‚Äôt stop going up. Social programs out the yingyang keeping poor people living off your money. Schools are terrible. Parents don‚Äôt raise their kids with any class. Dump piss and shit into lake Champlain for fun, it seems. Grey weather. Hardly any snow anymore.
Yea bro, I was born and raised here and left for the same reason. It's a bad mix of isolationist backwoods hillbilly yokels, wealthy liberals, and impoverished drug addicts. It's cold, isolated, and out of touch on every level. And it's expensive. Vermlnt is an absolute joke and a lie, Rutland in particular. Never again.
Glad you posted. It's a visually stunning place but roaming around Brattleboro in past years the street scene is creepy---that said, pre internet, growing up in New England, most towns had little to do---kids and adults--people drank too much, now it's drugging too much. I agree with another poster below--for those that love hiking, green living, finding artists and some kind locals--they're out there--it's a great place. But between Brattleboro to Burlington, it's a real life style choice. That said I've met many people that flee Tristate New York, Hawaii, California, Miami for a batch of reasons that don't sound that different.
Looks like we got a flat-lander over here.

Just kidding. All of that sounds so terrible. I‚Äôm from NH and have always gotten some weird vibes from certain parts of VT.
I have family right on the mass/NH/VT border.  I notice the judgy mentality people have.   It‚Äôs a beautiful area,  but kind of strange. 
I think things feel more normal more on the Mass side.
Also in central CT and agree.
I wouldn't give up on VT as a whole just yet. Every corner of the state has its own particular vibe. It can be hard at first to meet and get to know people but once you find community it's gold. VT does certainly hold true to a lot of the things folks say about it but in a less exaggerated way. We do generally really love to be outside in any season/weather in any sort of way. You have to get outside to make it through the winters (if not the cold in our warming climate, then the darkness) but honestly it's so beautiful in all the other seasons that you simply spend a lot of time out of doors. We have our challenges like anywhere else and some that are all our own. It is a small state, and this has both benefits and drawbacks. 

As far as observing townspeople spending two hours arguing over the look of business signs, there are indeed folks who seem to have an awful lot of free time to dedicate to such causes, but at the same time it is crucial to care because if you don't, then who will? People debate the little things because they also dialogue and collaborate over the big things. That is how the work of living gets done in a place like this. 

But I'm from the northeast to begin with (Northern NY) and VT truly feels like home, so I am a bit biased.
Then move?
Time to head over to NH. Nothing but friendly folks over there last time I visited.
It‚Äôs only good if you‚Äôre a 50 year old hipster liberal. Or you live off grid
Vermont is no longer the Vermont I grew up with.  Yeah locals have always been cheeky but the elitist public ordinance allegiance which professes inclusion while simultaneously ostracizing locals with less volatile opinions is the unfortunate reality of VT.  Not sure how it became the woke capital of the US, VT used to be a place where everyone‚Äôs love of farming, forests and community were more important than being ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù.  

The whole situation sucks, VT is just the canary in the coal mine of rural gentrification.
"I live in Bennington". Ok read enough haha. Of course youre having a bad time
I lived in Claremont, NH (stones throw away from Vermont) and it was very much like this. Tons of crime, TONS of drugs, nothing was close, the people were awful and just sooo racist. I‚Äôve been in northern Rhode Island for almost 10 years now and I don‚Äôt see myself leaving.
Montana is the nicest place I've ever been..... Minnesota as well
I‚Äôve read most of the comments and I could go either way on this.  Vt is tough.  I‚Äôve met the best people in my life skiing in VT.  As someone who lived in vt 50% of the time for 11 years and now full time for 3 years, I don‚Äôt know many people outside of VT though we meet people wherever we go to festivals etc.  Even growing up and living in CT we never spent enough time in CT so all the people I know in CT I met in VT.  lol.  In VT we have a core group of transplants in our resort community who are like family. Some are locals, many are weekenders, and some are people my husband has met working and going to school in VT.  I have cousins who are natives. We spend time on the cape in the summer.  The thing is that in Connecticut and Massachusetts no one cares where you are from when they meet you.  You don‚Äôt have to defend why you are there.  But in everyday life meeting new people in VT who are locals or natives there is always an undercurrent of ‚Äúwhy are you here?‚Äù.  It‚Äôs gotten significantly worse Every year for the past 10-15 years. Ever since Covid it‚Äôs really bad.  It‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs such a beautiful place and I love it when I am at a big house party or pot luck or when I‚Äôm at the mountain and I run into any one of the hundreds of friends I have there. That‚Äôs when I feel like it‚Äôs my place and there is nowhere I would rather be.  But it‚Äôs draining the rest of the time.  Even well meaning nice people who are in the community make me feel defensive about belonging sometimes.  It‚Äôs sometimes subtle and other times it‚Äôs not.  My car had CT plates for a long time even though I lived in VT because we were back and forth and had a house in CT.  It was like wearing a flatlander tatoo on my forehead. I was going to the hair dresser who I go to every 12 weeks and the woman leaving ahead of me made a nasty comment to my hairdresser when she was leaving.  In particular I feel it in the grange getting community dinners, at the Nearby grocery store and general store.  But living in an area where 70-80% of the houses are second homes creates a feeling of being invaded by tourists too.  So I always feel like I need to drop a hint I‚Äôm local.  Like when I pay with my debit card I‚Äôm wanting to fumble with my license so they see it says VT.  It‚Äôs just mentally draining to feel you have to defend your right to exist all the time.  Mostly people are nice but‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt really want anyone new to be here even though in my head I‚Äôm not new.  In CT or MA no one would act like that.
Sorry to hear that. It sucks to hear people moving here for actual Vermont jobs are not doing well.¬†


That said, Vermont fucking sucks now. Used to be OK, pre-covid, but it's been loved to death and all the things that made Vermont cool are gone.
Heading to northern VT on Sunday, looking forward to getting a burger in jeffersonville
I mean.... Bennington blows, like, bad.  Erm, but yeah, VT sucks!  Don't come here!
So sorry to hear this. What do you do down there that caused you to move to Vermont ? Sounds like you really like areas with more things happening and hopefully you find a place that works for your needs . VT is highly indigenous and multi generational along with being rural.
I think you will find that most rural places in the US aren‚Äôt terribly welcoming for outsiders. 

And having all of your stuff in your car is an invitation for thieves. 

Most of your complaints seem to be related to normal things that happen when you live somewhere rural in the US, not specific to VT.
Sir, this is not a Wendy's.
Bennington is Trump country, so of course everyone was an asshole. It isn't representative of the entire state, though.
So stop whining ,‚Ä¶ and MOVE OUT
I moved to Bennington two years ago. I‚Äôm extremely tattooed, yet no one looks at me weird or bothers me. The town isn‚Äôt bad at all. Vermont is boring as hell but there is plenty to do within driving distance. Ramunto‚Äôs Bennington is a shitty local drinking spot for college students, if you felt judged there idk where on earth you would feel comfortable. Tbh you sound like a cry babyüòÇ
Guy talks about a small portion of the state as if it‚Äôs the whole state. Why don‚Äôt you just say Bennington sucks ?
Interesting that the comments with the most traction didn't even remotely address any of his concerns.
Massachusetts people especially will want to avoid living in Vermont. We drive too slow and know how to merge. Totally annoying!
Haha! You should try Brattleboro....
It's hard enough trying to afford living here. Everything else is just bonus. I've lived here less than a year and already want out lol
VT sucks if you are poor and it is a Utopia if you are rich enough to enjoy buying expensive food, wine, and activities like skiing or sailing. ALTERNATIVELY, if you are poor but genuinely live for the backpacker/dirtbag mountain lifestyle, you will be OK. You run into problems if you move to Vermont with less than $100,000 annual income expecting a normal suburban American lifestyle. That's not really a thing here. It's rich stuff for the rich OR dirtbag hiker/farmer stuff for either poor or rich who understand and actually like that stuff, OR hell for anyone else. (Was a poor backcountry caretaker with Green Mtn Club along the Long Trail and loved every minute of it. 10/10 recommend, if you know how to backpack.)
Yeah, I live in Vt, I hate it too, looking to move to Austin possibly. There‚Äôs so little joy here. There‚Äôs so many financial problems and poverty that‚Äôs severely spiked in the last few years. The housing costs are unreal for apartments. Food costs are through the roof. Taxes are some of the highest in the country. There‚Äôs lots of open jobs because people can‚Äôt afford to live here. As soon as you said health decline I knew it was mild before you said it. You gotta move somewhere hot and dry to let your body heal.
Bro, that‚Äôs New England, sorry
Lived there for 28 and constantly called a flatlander even though I had more mountains where I grew up than Vermont has. Moved out in 2016 to NC and never looked back
Ageee with everything you said. We moved to NH, 6 miles from Brattleboro. The people have been very unfriendly. We have made no meaningful relationships, and our kids have had a hard time, too.
As a 20 something I lived alone in VT for a while. I thought I could live the whole Thoreau-ian existence out in the woods in a house I rented. 6 months in, I was lonely and miserable. Definitely not for everybody. People were friendly and helpful enough, but like a lot of New England, the default mode is do your thing. Very little social life (I didn‚Äôt like going to bars) and mud season sucked.
I just spent time in Bennington for my job. There is a huge drug problem in Bennington. Its also ‚Äúin the sticks‚Äù, so you have to drive a distance for just about everything. Alot of the hotels are full of homeless people. Im not sure what you do for a living but maybe try Burlington? Or NH?
Vermont does sorta suck. There's more talk about it being wonderful and people being nice then in reality.
I moved here from NY. Raised my son here. Have tons of friends and love it! Yes things are far apart but surrounded by beautiful scenery and good people!
I loved Vermont... Until I didnt. It was an awful experience eventually. I have never experienced the racism that I did in VT.
My experience has been similar: people in VT are aloof, cold, blatantly rude. I grew up in NH, with roots in CT/NY, and it's the same weirdness in NH.  I got the hell out of NH as soon as I could, but with 3 family members in VT, I've spent a lot of time there over the last 20 years. It's fucking weird, and I would NEVER live in either place. It's really pretty, I'll give it that.
This is like the umpteenth time I've seen someone bitching about Bennington area, and a lot of the properties I've seen, even for sale there, have been shit holes.

Should we start making warning signs in the "New to Vermont" reddit that says "don't move to Bennington"?
Bennington is not VT. It is somewhere between Kentucky and West Virginia. I prefer to think of that part of VT as West Benningtucky.
Yeah, dating up here sucks for everyone. Small selection and there's a lot of generational misogyny and sexual/physical abuse that isn't talked about enough.
What do you think the best New England state would be for those in their thirties putting down roots?
Almost 40 and trying to continue my career and regrow roots in the biggest city in Vermont and it's been near impossible.
It had been a couple years since we'd been to Bennington, maybe 5 (?). It's really on hard times these days. Sad because it was a funky, fun place with a nice vibe to it.
Had to scroll too far for this. Sounds like you've had a rough go, OP. I hope things improve for you and that you find community if you decide to stick around.

I agree that it seems hard to start from scratch in a lot of VT towns. There's more opportunity in the bigger areas but COL goes up to match.
Vermont sucks, tell your friends!
Came here to confirm Vermonters are wanna be hippies who actually try to gate keep stuff you can actually find all over the country when they think they are the only ones to have it.
too late, the masses have settled.
where's darryl?
No worries. Most people can‚Äôt afford Vermont.
Yeah, he forgot to mention that we have snakes everywhere here! It‚Äôs awful, definitely don‚Äôt move here!¬†
I mean you‚Äôre joking bc the influx of people but it‚Äôs really not that great. The landscape is pretty I‚Äôll give it that, but I found the towns to be less charming than most in New Hampshire or upstate NY. Was truly surprised by the amount of graffiti and homelessness in Burlington. Montpelier was nice and of course Stowe and Lake Champlain are cool, but not much else. Incredibly mid. I‚Äôd give it an honest 6/10. Seems the more French someone was, the bigger of an asshole they tended to be, but it could be a smaller sample.
I second this. Stay where you are üòÜ
PS - the way I personally made friendly acquaintances and got "in" with the locals, was to go to triva night every Monday at a local bar/restaurant.  I feel like I'm at least tolerated by the locals because of it.  They definitely place me above the tourists and part-timers anyway.  Why don't you try something like that?  Doesn't have to be a bar if that's not your thing, but try involving yourself in the community in some way.  And don't show up with animosity towards locals in your heart.  They can sense it.
That's cause everyone is cousins and you're not related. If you had kids in school you would see how many kids are cousins.
I was kind of desperate for work and an opportunity popped up in VT. I was born in Maine so I thought I understood what ‚Äúrural‚Äù meant, but then when I got to VT I was hit with culture shock. 

I am very involved! My job requires me to be in the community a fair amount, and I do enjoy many of the people I‚Äôve met
lol, nah, Vermonters are pretentious and cold.
Rutland entered the chat‚Ä¶
Why does it seem that all Vermont cities and large towns suck?
This is the correct answer!
[deleted]
I think you have no idea about what happens right under your nose. Have you ever heard the saying give them something small to quibble over so they don‚Äôt see the something big that is really happening?
Well, a number of years ago the Barton (NEK) town council featured fistfights. Idiot old men. FIGHTING with each other. I am not making this up.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
100% definitely
We aren't standoffish, we just aren't fake nice.
As a Mainer I concur that we tend to be pretty cautious of people "from away" moving in for better or worse it seems to be a New England thing.
Bennington also had a Wendy's in the early 2000's...and nobody went there.
Having been born, raised and lived here for 48 years I agree with OP 100%.  Bennington hates businesses unless you're friends with the good ole boys.
Faces look ugly, when you're alone...
When you're straaaaaaange
Haha. But wait, dooryard???
This post wins most compassionate award ü•á¬†
Get out! Seriously. Get out now. You still have time.
Lots of judgemental hicks in towns like these. If you aren't a white truck driving hill person it's shite living in these areas given my experience.
It's funny because someone crashed into my car and totaled it back in 2014, but insurance was a mess, my advisor was a piece of shit, and the car didn't get totaled, just fixed twice.

Shoutout for JAS auto as well, the shittiest body shop in the state, go out of business as soon as possible.
I moved here in late March. My husband got a great job opportunity. People have been very kind to us but I did have two new friends tell me that they're letting everyone know we're good people and putting a good word out for us. So it IS cliquey and hard to penetrate through. I've had other transplants tell me it is much easier when you involve yourself in community events and clubs.
See a healthy attitude its not for everyone but everyone should try things out and see what works for them best of luck to you :)
I‚Äôve lived all over the place. I was born in Maine originally, but was living in Rochester, NY before I moved to VT.

I‚Äôm leaving VT at the end of the month
You made the right choice. Hopefully your mom gets better. It's not you, this place sucks.
This. Seriously. I would say there's more going on than just politics (covid gentrification is a big driver of costs) but moving here now unless you are rich is just insane.
I actually work a professional job and make decent money
You are right, and this will be the death of Vermont.¬†


"what if an entire state was only affordable on a remote salary?"¬†
VT about to find out.
I moved here in my early 20s because I am trans and this was a close by state that has a lot of better protections for trans people. My experience has been the exact opposite of OP ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I find people here to be exceptionally kind and way more helpful than where I used to live. Like even employees at any given chain I find are just actually helpful and really kind. This was not my experience growing up in CNY haha which was much more rural and Republican. I heavily prefer being in a heavily blue area. I might not be here permanently but it's definitely not a bad place to be
‚ÄúBe happy‚Ä¶‚Äù is what you suggest to someone having a rough time, huh? Thank god I‚Äôve met nth generation Vermonters who are much more validating than you, Jesus Christ‚Ä¶
I moved to Vermont for work. I can‚Äôt just up and leave. My health insurance is tied to my job, all my doctors are here, and my livelihood comes from having a job. I‚Äôm sick now because of the mold, so moving elsewhere is risky.

Im sure there are plenty of people doing well living in VT, and I‚Äôve met people who love it here, but I‚Äôm not one of them. I moved here for a job out of desperation and unfortunately now I feel stuck
Lots of truth here.
I hate the corporate takeover of VT right now. If it's not maplefields, Irving or dollar general, then it's something worst
What we need to do is utilize tax money to put an unprofitable Wendy's in every town.
New Jersey is not in New England, no.
Omg thank you so much that so nice
Once you make friends with your neighbors you'll experience a kindness you havn't known before.  Don't come here expecting what you know, because that is why most folks fail.
On the other hand "Midwest politeness" is kinda off putting to people from the NE it can be a bit of a culture shock for peopleto talk to you lol. and is REALLY off putting to my partner that is from western Europe lol.
Lived in Vt. for 13 years, moved away for\~10 years then returned and lived here for another 17 years. Finally realized that VT. isn't for me and moved for good. Unless you are 40th generation and your pet dog has ancestry registered for 30 generations within the State, you'll always be considered an outsider and a suspected violent criminal with degenerate tendencies.
The cause of the change is AirBandB.¬† ¬†
I agree entirely!
My family has deep roots in the Bennington area, spanning several generations. Our last name appears on local road signs, and it‚Äôs so common here that it fills four pages in the phone book. Many of my neighbors are distant relatives who share my last name. It‚Äôs a tight-knit community‚Äîalmost like a little family commune. If someone needs help, I‚Äôm there in a heartbeat, and they do the same for me. We never exchange money or keep score; it‚Äôs just understood that we look out for each other.

I find it amusing when outsiders describe us as having a 'hippie' vibe. Maybe that‚Äôs more of a Burlington thing! Here, many of us own farms, make maple syrup, hunt, fish, and yes, we enjoy our fair share of locally crafted brews. It‚Äôs a simple life, close to nature, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything.
I‚Äôm from Maine I get it
LOL
I‚Äôm from Maine I know!
Which is worse Manchester or Bennington
nope
I did the same thing! I used to go to NYC every weekend and stay with my ex!
Vermont left an impression on you though, didn't it <3
South Burlington is the safest city in America, and Burlington is not far behind, a new ranking says.

Personal finance company WalletHub just released its list of safest cities in America, and South Burlington took the top spot, while Burlington came in at No. 4.
I wouldn‚Äôt say those things are ‚Äúimportant to me.‚Äù I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just more representative of the overall stuff. I wanted to buy Doc Martens one time and between the only two shoe stores I couldn‚Äôt find a pair. 

I know it sounds silly, but the lack of options is simply distressing to me. I‚Äôve never really lived in a place where you couldn‚Äôt get to something quickly. 

I‚Äôll say, I do love that the hospital is right near the center of town. Those folks are some of the best people I‚Äôve ever met
I love Wilmington, but I also had roots here since childhood. I have never felt excluded here as a ‚Äúflatlander‚Äù, and I am a working class teacher, not rich by any means. I guess it all depends on your perspective. Its a damn sure more welcoming and kind place than anyplace in Jersey, and most of the unkindness I witness here is from visiting Jersey people. Imagine that. üòÇ
Feel you there, born and raise and can‚Äôt wait to move out
Thank you!! Like I said, this could happen anywhere. I just have a bad taste in my mouth because a number of bad things happened in a row. 

There are things that I genuinely love about being here, but they‚Äôre out weighed by the things that suck
I‚Äôm also a Mainer. I prefer the Maine attitudes to the VT ones
I just moved to Vermont but Mainers stole my heart. The KINDEST people I've ever come across.
Based on the way you talk about them in your other comments, they‚Äôd be far better off if you left and just let them go on with their lives without you.
I think it‚Äôs ok to put bad energy out there when you‚Äôre going through a decidedly bad time. My job requires to be on like 24/7, I‚Äôm burnt out, living in a motel, and much of my belongings are gone. To add to that, I‚Äôm sick from toxic mold exposure. On a more personal level, my mother is dying of lung cancer, and I‚Äôve just broken up with my fianc√©. Maybe I‚Äôm not in the position to think of things I‚Äôm grateful of. You don‚Äôt know me. I‚Äôm typically a positive person with a lot of energy, but I feel like I‚Äôve been beaten to a pulp by all this crap
RIGHT it‚Äôs like a western movie when the stranger walks into the bar
Well that‚Äôs just like, your opinion <pronoun>
*Provincial* is the correct word.
My health insurance and income are now tied to this state. Not so easy to just leave
Guy talks about a small part of Bennington as if it's the whole town. why not just say my life sucks?
Truth...and i was born here left and came back...sometimes I am like what a fuck show...literally. Lund center baby!!
Yea kinda makes me wonder if people say raising a family is good there, mean it's good for the parents lifestyle.
Having grown up and spend much of my 20's in rural vt I used to laugh when friends showed me what it was like to use dating apps..


I was like these are all the women we know.. just call one..


I worked with a bartender who had a great joke about how small the pool of single women is in small town VT.. "It's not your girlfriend it's just your turn"


Sad level of truth in that statement
Maine if you prefer rural, and it's not even close. You need to buy property though, if you're going to rent, just stay wherever you are. But it obviously depends on your hobbies/employment.
Man this is going to be unpopular but you can have a lovely experience in central Connecticut. Nice suburban neighborhoods with friendly families long connected bike trails and really high wages. To me it is the place to raise a family.
Western mass 30 min from Northampton or Amherst.
Connecticut. It‚Äôs North, but not too North! It‚Äôs close to both Boston and New York. The weather isn‚Äôt as severe as a Maine or Vermont or New Hampshire. It‚Äôs close enough to visit Massachusetts and Rhode Island for the beaches. And near Cape Cod for vacations.
Southern NH for sure
Massachusetts by far. Providence, Rhode Island can be good too. There are a lot of colleges and universities there which keeps the inner city young.
Probably rural Maine or New Hampshire.
Connecticut, near New York, or Massachusetts, near Boston. But each person has their own definition of what they want out of a location in their 30s.
Connecticut if you can afford it. Litchfield county
I‚Äôm from RI and miss it so much
Western CT. Loads of hiking, fishing, outdoor activities and safe
MA has literally the best HDI in the country and one of the tops in the world. It‚Äôs absolutely no contest: MA if you can afford it.
Massachusetts
Not New England. New England is dying because it's mostly designed for rich boomers.
The biggest city in Vermont doesn't even qualify as a city by most international definitions.


There are a few golden tickets here. OnLogic, Beta, I've heard good things about PCC, and there are some great options for certain healthcare fields (nurses get kinda dunked on tho).


Honestly though, if you want decent wages you almost always need to work remotely. My girlfriend worked for the state for awhile, she has a master's degree and several years experience in her field and was in a managerial role. I earned more than her working an entry level warehousing job. It's wild how depressed wages are.
The absolute worst. Wouldn't recommend.
I have this as a sticker on my water bottle lol
YESSSS THANK YOU. 

my favorite story is when I had my car running in the winter, about to run into the food shelf. I was there for like 3 minutes testing my blood sugar and giving myself insulin on my pump before going inside, clearly taking care of my type 1 diabetes. This woman knocks on my window and tells me about the town ordinance to not idle cars. I‚Äôve been living here forever. I know about the ordinance. I didn‚Äôt think it would be an issue with anyone. I was just trying to keep warm so my blood flowed to my damn fingers. That was the second time it‚Äôs happened. 

A woman also once chewed my husband out for leaving our dog in the car, even though IT WAS ON AND I WAS IN THERE WITH HIM. She looked at me right in the eyes too. I was wondering what she wanted but she left to go yell at my husband before I could ask. 

These are the one on one interactions that stick out, but I have a few major issues with other similar behavior.
Yes nailed it.
*Do you all have ciabatta bread in New York?*
This is a perfect descriptor.
Sounds like the gatekeepers on  r/Adirondacks. i went hiking there recently told my story and all the redditors in my thread were basically telling me never to come back lol
Not true. We just hate pur towns getting crowded and crime following. Grew up in VT and still live here. Sorry but after covid we got a lot of ppl escaping their towns and now burlington is full of crime and drugs- happy I dont live there either. It's not all out of staters , but a lot are.
 Nothing to do with gatekeeping. We just like our space and keeping to ourselves. We don't want city and billboards and such. We have a "yogis" in a town over. It's a ugly shop with a computer style sign advertising beer and vape and such. Take the ugly back to Mass please. And no I am not a hippie. But hate more ppl in my state. We want the room and no overcrowding. Not what I now see on my commute to work. Tons of cars. Double what it was before covid.
Found the dude from Connecticut everybody!
What in the actual fuck are you yammering on about? 

I think we found the guy with his eyes closed everyone.....
Except Heady Topper.
Gotta love the tourist who post on here saying "I come to VT a few times a year and love it. Am I considered a Vermonter?"  ü§£ü§£ü§£
That‚Äôs kind of everywhere, Vermont isn‚Äôt special. We‚Äôre all ‚Äúfull‚Äù
You nailed dude. Perfect assessment. Please tell everyone the same!!! üëç
Out of curiosity, how many of the locals were born in Vermont?  

There also seems to be a big difference in native Vermonters depending on generation.  Boomers and older still tend to have that I can fix anything, do it myself, do what's right attitude.
The fact that you had to use the word ‚Äútolerated‚Äù really illustrates the problem, don‚Äôt you think?
I grew up in the shadow of Smugglers Notch vt and unless you went to high school with us or have been a fixture for 5-10 years you are most likely just the out of state "flatlander" who most likely won't stick around..¬†


Ultra cliquey people and I have heard people say they didn't feel like a local even after nearly a decade in vt..


When a new face walks into the bars it can be like in a movie when the music stops and everybody looks at them in shock before deciding that they don't know them and don't want to..¬† Just one more soul from the elsewhere's of life who is going to want things to be like wherever it is they come from and take just a little more of the coveted wild out of VT.


I live in Maine now.. Vt has become overrun with people working remote since covid.. most of the farms I grew up working/ hunting/ fishing are dead and being subdivided or covered in solar panels.. Every single off leash dog walking path has mandatory leash signs now.. Saw numerous out of stater's flip out and start screaming when they saw off leash dogs in the last 6-8 years and lo and behind now leashes are mandatory.. ON EVERY SINGLE TRAIL IN THE COUNTY! We have to Bushwhack far from marked trails to let our dogs run in the woods now. Too many people move to vt and post the land we grew up hunting/ fishing/ 4 wheeling.


New people in vt have a tough time because so many that have come before you have incited change and chipped away at the wild west existence we grew up enjoying in the 90's.. you may be well intentioned but you have to prove that to us before being accepted as a local and if you don't step on any toes and keep showing up at local events for SEVERAL years maybe, just maybe we will contemplate indoctrinating you into our inner circles and tightly knit friend groups that invite one another to go do things in small units..¬†


Vt is trapped in the 50's in lots of wonderful and intolerable ways.


Vermont is quiet, peaceful, ideal for the outdoorsy lifestyle and if people know and trust you they will take the shirt off their backs with the only question being what else can I do to help.. but for you outsiders it's a bewilderingly hostile infestation of rednecks and hippies who don't know you, don't won't want to and hope you move away soon.


For all the people out there who don't like VT I request that you spread this message as far and wide as you are able
It's a bad place to move to.. VT wants as many of you as possible to stay in Massachusetts or wherever.. It's rainy and overcast in the summer, spring is aptly named mud season, gets overrun with leafpeepers in the fall and becomes a frozen wasteland in winter. It's lily white, racist, taxes are almost as high as the cost of living and the traffic is worse than it ever was. It's like nobody is in a hurry to get anywhere and the pace of life is just all slowed down like vt is under a rock.


Make sure you never go there to verify how horrible it is.¬† Take my unbiased word that it's hell on earth.. Nothing grows there.. the hunting and trout fishing is abysmal.. the food is way too locally sourced and fresh, the farmers markets are just loaded with crunchy hippies, the skiing sucks because there are too few people in the lift lines to socialize with and the trails are erie and unsettling because they are nearly empty on weekdays. The people are just way too chatty and overfirendly with each other. The cheese is just awful.. The beer tastes so good that you will become an alcoholic.. the lakes are just too damn clean because of the godawful no gas motors laws (the nerve on these people), the legal lack of billboards makes it so that you have no idea what the state of consumerism is like. The anti GMO laws are just stupid.. The cops are just way too present and friendly with people.. There are 4 wheelers and dirt bikes driving legally all over the roads (many of which are still unpaved)


You don't want to come to vt and most of vt doesn't want you here
From a Maine point of view I‚Äôd equate moving to Bennington as a 20 something professional the same as moving to a place like Waterville, Sanford, or skowhegan.
Born in Maine... guessing south of Bangor if you had rural redefined for you.
I was born and raised here. It's easy to not fit in here. I'm sorry you're struggling it's a lonely place when it's like that. There was a point in time when all my friends and family moved away or died and it felt very cold and empty here.

It's a great place when you live a lifestyle and have a home where your life is completed there and you don't have many needs from the outside world other than work. But when you don't have that already built or aren't living that way it's cold and desolate
Real Vermonters are neither pretentious nor cold. You are mistaking the annoying people who have moved here with actual Vermonters.
St. Albans would like a word....
[deleted]
St. Johnsbury entered the chat.
I have friends in Rutland lol. Granted I met them all at Killington
i laughed out loud
it doesn‚Äôt. it only seems that way when you listen purely to terminally online redditors
It's the property taxes. If it was cheaper to live here then it wouldn't hurt so much to deal with everything else.
Cause we are all weirdos who love our adorable small villages and its warped our brains? lol
This right here. 

And some small towns can be just as clique-y as your average high school, if not more so. If the Town Administrator is BFFs with the selectboard, then you're looking at one big circle jerk. And this is where *potentially* corruption, intentionally or unintentionally, can also occur. 

The selectboard wants something done that is ehhhh potentially questionable, then the TA will play daily interference, selectively edit minutes, spin as needed. All while the selectboard can overlook the personnel issues with the TA (overall poor performance, lack of necessary skills, being overcompensated, etc).

And you can't forget all the "special" meetings that only require 24hrs public notice, so barely anyone knows about them or are able to attend.

Ya know, fun stuff like that. All of which I have witnessed first hand and been a victim of.

Or maybe just my town is royally fucked up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It‚Äôs like a‚Ä¶ locals only vibe. I mean, I get it. Nobody really wants transplants unless you‚Äôre a hippie dippy transient type.
People come out of the rain.
A local NH term for back yard. 
Yes, I too am a flat lander who moved to NH in 
‚Äú81‚Äù. It took awhile to get used to some of the local culture. 
Vermont and NH are similar, though not as much today, politically. I definitely remember feeling that people were cold and unfriendly. It‚Äôs really not the case at all. There‚Äôs a charm about Northern New England that takes time to appreciate. 
I have no regrets.
I‚Äôm living in Bennington right now, covered in tattoos + stretched ears. Drive a lowered attention seeking vehicle and still no one bothers me here. Some people really just have a victim mentality.
Dude I'm a bi lady in a hybrid we are doing just fine around here thanks lol
The truck driving thing blew my mind. I went from a tiny hatchback to a tundra and it was like I was in a whole new world. Constantly being cutoff to being king of the road. Invisible to cops. Just insane how much differently you're treated based on a seemingly minor switch.
Okay I just bought a white truck, but only because VW and Subaru have been such nightmares to own, I figured let's get a Toyota, makes the driveway easier, and I can go to the dump. I swear I'm not hill people.
I've lived here my whole life. I am Asian, I drive a plug in EV, and am an independent who has voted Democrat my whole adult life. Most of my friends are guys I've met through landscaping or ski shop jobs who have trucks, guns, and love Trump. Sounds like you're the judgmental one not the so called "hicks" who live here.
The Bennington area is one of the more xenophobic regions in Vermont. Weirdly enough it sounds like this guy would have been happier in Brattleboro.
That‚Äôs a tad judgmental.
Then you get the woke women who snarl if you hold a door open or wave.¬† ¬† ¬†Between the 2 its a lonely place.¬† ¬†Im here for my dog.
Thanks for the laugh.  This is why I Reddit.
That sounds like a good plan for you. You're really not happy here. :-/
A good chunk of Bennington is low income, so you're going to be kind of an anomaly being a 20 something professional. I think you'd find the same experience in most of Vermont's "cities" (Rutland, Brattleboro, Barre, St Johnsbury, even Troy NY). There's a young professionals group in the area that might be good for networking and finding friends.
That was a really weird assumption that person made, I can‚Äôt see what got them there from the problems you have had. Having grown up in Vermont I think it seems like you have been dealt a shit hand and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work out. I moved away and my problems were the same as yours, albeit with the exact opposite background. I missed that everyone in Vermont waived when driving down the road, said thank you when I held a door open, and were always very kind. Maybe it is Bennington or a stroke of bad luck which unfortunately happens. Sorry that has been your experience but sometimes ya just gotta roll with it and head on off to the next opportunity. I‚Äôm doing that as we speak because I don‚Äôt like where I live as well.
Sooo my theory is that so many out of staters have come and taken advantage of Vermont folks, time and time again, that most Vermonters now have a heavy heavy shield up against outsiders..
Then consider yourself lucky and have a bit more patience and empathy for your "cold and standoffish" neighbors who are very likely just struggling through each and every day. We can't assume anything about you really from this post, but if you are making decent money at a professional job and finding that many lower income folks are being "cold and standoffish" to you then there may be something in your behavior or how you present yourself that makes them feel as though you are looking down on them. Struggling vermonters have a hard time with "outsiders" who are in a better place than them for a variety of reasons and may play into this. 

Not saying it's an excuse or anything, but something you may want to be mindful and thoughtful of. OR just remember so that you don't take it too personally next time. 

As an example, I live in a very small rural town that is mostly blue collar folks. I work in Burlington doing a professional job that pays pretty well. When I stop at my local general store after work wearing my professional attire I am treated 100% differently by the patrons and the staff who don't know me well than when I show up at the same store on Saturday morning in dirty carhartts, beat up boots, and an old hat on. I don't take it personally - these folks aren't really used to interacting with a dude in business casual attire and assume we have nothing in common. It may seem standoffish but they just genuinely don't know how to interact with me. Some may even assume I'm looking down on them or think I'm better than them. But if someone I know well comes up and says "hey whaletacochamp - gonna be working the woods this weekend?" anyone within earshot drops their guard because they know I'm "one of them" - i just happen to also have a white collar job. 

Vermonters are a nuanced bunch. Try not to take things so personally.
Agree. Moved here in my early 20s and have had essentially nothing but positive experiences, aside from a few minor things here and there.
My neice turned nephew is following that lifestyle, and you are all welcome.  It's not easy here, just remember that.
Do you HAVE to live in Bennington? I've been critical of Vermont, but I've never experienced this level of alienation. And I'm Black! I've never lived in Bennington though - Middlebury, with a lot of time spent in Bristol, Vergennes, Brandon, Williston, and Burlington, and Ive had about as good a time as you could possibly have being a Black migrant in an overwhelmingly white state. Maybe Bennington sucks? Idk
Bennington isn't a representation of the entire state. Move out of that town and you'll have a much better experience.
You are in a better position than the majority of Vermonters. I suggest you go out of your way to talk to some of your neighbors and actually learn about them, you'll likely find they aren't the monsters you're making them out to be and you aren't so misfortunate as you make yourself out to be. I'm also picking up that you're probably a bit lonely and having a hard time finding social connection which is understandable but not an excuse to demonize everyone around you. Therapy may be beneficial. Your job can probably help you with that.
Airbnb
It would be no problem!
As someone relatively new to VT I‚Äôve heard this a lot, and it‚Äôs simply not true. I casually and politely have introduced myself to neighbors, service industry workers in the neighborhood, and people in clubs or community events and they all respond with a ‚ÄúWTF why are they talking to me‚Äù attitude. Someone down the hall in my apt building has a welcome mat outside their door that literally says ‚ÄúGo Away‚Äù, which represents the majority well.
Oh come on... I made friends with the Pakistani family that bought the liqueur store. Stop being so crazy.
Burlington is not safe. Whoever designated Burlington as safe needs to have their head examined.
It‚Äôs okay to not be made for Vermont. Plenty of people feel uncomfortable in certain places; I‚Äôve had to work in Detroit several times and found it to be a repulsive, decrepit wasteland, but some people find that it energizes them, and that‚Äôs okay too. 

Living in Vermont means planning ahead, and it always has. In exchange for that, we get locally-owned stores, we get communities that care for one another*, and we don‚Äôt have to look like the rest of the country. I travel for work (which is the only reason I can afford to live here), and there are few places in the US that actually look tonally distinct. For all of Vermont‚Äôs zoning woes, the small towns of Vermont do genuinely have their own look. Sometimes that means we argue about sign colors and ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù flags, but it does mean most of Vermont doesn‚Äôt look like South Carolina and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Iowa and Arizona, full of strip malls and chain stores. If you‚Äôre near this stuff, like Bennington, or Williston, or Springfield, you might as well live someplace else.

*Bennington has always been rather unpleasant. I did a couple promotional projects for the town years and years ago, and even then people seemed to prefer being angry over improving their town‚Äôs image (at no cost to them, I might add). The general tone seemed to be that if Bennington were to become more pleasant, the townspeople would have no scapegoat on which to blame their lack of success. Bennington is the [‚Äúdrowning in shallow water‚Äù meme](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/drowning-in-shallow-water), made into a town.
New Jersey‚Äôs unkindness is because they wish so badly to be from NY.
It sucks because I want to but don't. I just want it to be fixed and stop sucking. But IDK if that'll happen
Appreciate the correct word. English isn‚Äôt my first language.
Well.. I think they mean it more in the sense of it's a much easier place to live if you don't have to worry about playing the single game. The average age is older, which is going to mean that the majority of people are either married or in some form of domestic partnership. Therefore, most social events are going to cater more towards the married or married with kids crowd. From there it's a feedback loop: the social atmosphere caters more toward married couples, this means the single folks are left lonely and destitute so they move out, more younger married folks move in because, "oh look at all the cute couple things we can do".
Maine is not friendly. It‚Äôs the same issues OP listed.
CT gets dunked on by the rest of NE but I love it. Great climate compared to lots of the region (especially within 30m of the water, it's *always* mild), near everything, shockingly affordable compared to some other NE states if you look in the right places since wages tend to keep up.¬†


Fuck the ticks, though. The ticks are absolutely insane down there.
That‚Äôs where I am. It is an expensive state to live in though. Prices are high on everything here.
Greenfield, for example.
This is a very clean nice area, last time I visited was maybe 15yr ago. I have a aunt in Northampton, she has been there for 30yr and is quite happy
Seems what goes around comes around
I grew up in Northampton in the '60's.  Both my sister and I graduated from NHS
although my parents were from California I was treated well for the most part 
I couldn't wait to get out and never did live there again but I will always be in my heart a "Hampster"
i.e. a person from Hamp which is what the town was called then.
My sister went back to the valley after she retired and she loves it. 
I got out and now I read it's the really cool place to be in New England 
Who knew
Keene is pretty nice.
I really miss living in PVD. If RI had better public transportation, it would be the best place to live, but their system is god awful/lacking, so you're just stuck in traffic for freaking ever.

Scurvydog might be amongst the best dives I've found.
I had a water bottle for a while with like 5 of those from different states lol.

I think it had park city, Jackson hole, vermont,  Austin
Had a lady freak out on me for an idling car. Needed an alternator and the car might not start if I turned it off. Explained the situation to her and she said ‚Äútypical man that doesn‚Äôt care about anything‚Äù. If she had been a man I might have punched her right in the mouth.¬†
Oh, I‚Äôve got a story like this! I was pulling out of a parking spot on a residential street and put my foot on the brake after a few feet because I realized I needed to look up directions. After about 30 seconds, a lady walks up on the adjacent sidewalk with a death stare. I roll down my window and she gives me attitude about ‚Äúwhat are you doing in front of my driveway‚Äù (she was not pulling out her car). I politely apologized and said I would be gone momentarily. She was not appeased, at all. She jumped in her car that was parked in the spot now in front of me and proceeds to run her windshield wipers but somehow her windshield wiper fluid continues to splash back onto my car about 20ft back. She really showed me! /s üòÇ
Nah there‚Äôs no Italians in NY to make it. And I think vermonts the only state that ever feeds grass to their cows too

Nice try
Everyone saying ‚Äúoh ya don‚Äôt come here‚Äù like they are being sly with that sarcasm bs. Let me put it in a way a guy from Vermont could understand. It‚Äôs like some skier who found great powder but tells everyone in the lodge you won‚Äôt find it on so and so chairlift. 
Like I said and what OP confirms y‚Äôall are intolerant while trying to put off some hippy love everyone facade. When in reality you‚Äôre the least diverse group of people with no patience or care to include any outsider in any fun you may produce. 

Quite sickening really. As if someone else looking at nice foliage or some shit somehow makes it less beautiful for you.  Get a grip bro.
[deleted]
Does VT offer birthright Vermontership? Or do I lose my Vermonter status after some time away? 

I wish I could come back, but the job market just doesn‚Äôt support that right now.
Just because a cat gave birth in the oven doesn't make the kittens muffins ...
Lol its a backwater state nobody actually cares about Vermont that much
Probably 2/3.  I know one dude is from CT but been here 25 years, and another from Maine originally.
Yeah, kind of.  Best I could hope for.  I feel like as much as I get irritated by cars with out of state plates, I've been somewhat indoctrinated though.
That was cool to read, thanks.  I'm not leaving though.  I am a hippy punk redneck, I'll fit in eventually.  I don't meet any of your flatlander stereotypes, don't worry.
Maybe. To be honest, Bennington had greater access to things than Waterville or Skowhegan. For example, it takes 50 min to an hour to get to Albany from Bennington, then there‚Äôs an Amtrak to NYC. However, it takes longer to get to Portland from Skowhegan and the Amtrak to Boston is less frequent and longer. I feel like Bennington is a bit more like Biddeford or maybe even Lewiston
I was born in Bangor.
Federal money downtown revitalization juxtaposed against a backdrop of homeless drug addicts and pan handlers.
St Albans is leagues nicer than Rutland or Bennington.
I think Brattleboro's actually worse than Rutland now lol.
I love St J. It‚Äôs on the up and up and actually attainable to buy a house for younger people trying to settle down and start a family like us at 31/32 (granted the one we bought in Lyndonville needed/still needs a ton of work). Writing this as I cook chili and simultaneously replace a rotted sill plate lol.

We lived in Denver for a long time and crime/homeless people here (even Burlington) doesn‚Äôt even compare to what went on out there, let alone any other city we‚Äôve been to. I love VT and my neighbors are so welcoming and sweet, even those with some *different* view points on things. The NEK is absolutely gorgeous and still has the old Vermont vibe IMO. I do hope OP finds his happy place.
Seems like towns with jails suck because they get everyone else's problems!
Lived in VT for 18 years state blows goats period. It‚Äôs way too expensive for what is available. There‚Äôs no business there what so ever. Property taxes are outrages 
Lake Champlain is a toilet . Cow shit and blue green algae all over the lake. 
Pretty mountains and  sceneryTHAT IS IT. 
Left 8 years ago went back last summer  the biggest city Burlington is a trash pile now. Run down buildings crack heads all over. 
Do not move to VT unless your rich
Nah, I'm from small town NEK. Same shit up here. Selective editing of meeting minutes and backdoor Selectboard fuckery is the norm. I've spent the better part of two years fighting them tooth and nail while they try to change the town's ordinance to allow ATV's on all roads. Guess what...all five selectboard members were ATV enthusiasts. I'm running this March to unseat at least one of them and am going to be a procedural pain in their ass until they come to their senses about it
Good lord, this sounds exactly like my town and the former Town Administrator. Shit was all fucked up.
Very true the cops love trucks it would seem
Your safe none of the hill people would be caught dead in a Toyota :)
Preach hill people can be very fun and we all get along pretty good right :)
He said in a comment down below he makes 40k. That's not really a livable wage here.
That makes sense. I‚Äôm not here to take advantage. I‚Äôm here to make an honest living working at a non-profit lol
Way to try to write off the shitty attitudes a lot of Vermonters have. I get a kick out of people who call others Flatlander, but they themselves couldn‚Äôt survive 1 day in actual mountains.
If you belong you belong and all us creepy hill people can tell " one of us one of us" :)
Also Black, can confirm Bennington just sucks.
Haha, thank you for adding the ‚Äúand I‚Äôm black‚Äù bit. Honestly, so glad you haven‚Äôt experienced that. What I remember from when I lived in VT (my whole childhood) was the distinct lack of diversity.
Well that's the first thing to move into town. I had one pop up directly next door to me I. The middle of the woods 3 years ago. Plagued!
Where do you live in vermont?  It makes a difference...
Hahaha that is doubtful. I grew up in Southern Jersey where people are much kinder; my sons still live there and are awesome people. But I moved from Central Jersey shore where most of the people are NY or Philly transplants and they are the rudest people around. So I am going with people who transplant TO Jersey from other places are rude. And people who leave Jersey because of the rude people are more apt to keep to themselves and avoid said people, especially when they visit Vermont. üòÇ
In fact most horrible drivers and people hassling locals have either Jersey or NY tags. Go figure.
Boy do I feel the same way, like I want vt to have all things we have but like more too lol and be less expensive and less sucky so I can stay
As someone  who  grew  up  in  Maine and still lives here   this is absolutely correct  people  who were born here  or raised here don't like out of staters  whatsoever, like hell people with out of state plates have gotten run off the road in some parts of the state. OP I'd highly suggest  avoiding  Maine unless your old, really wealthy  or move to the shithole that is Portland , South Portland  isn't to bad, but if you move rural it's 50/50 if your  neighbors  are going to hate you
Yeah can be. But to me high prices are super localized. We live in an expensive area but our house nationally would be a pretty reasonable price. It‚Äôs an older cape. We were able to raise a family of 3 boys on 1 and a half persons salary. (My wife stayed home for years).
Yes - I've lived in Greenfield - great young and older community - I took courses at Greenfield Community (if it's still called that).  I've also lived in Noho and Sunderland and...  Belchertown a little further up!  I spent a lot of time in Western Mass. :)  But I think Greenfield is the best place to land.
My grandparents grew up in the valley and operated a funeral home in Northampton from the 50s to the 80s. It was a very different town back then. Lots of change from the 80s on. Massive gentrification
God that is so frustrating. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd have stopped you if you did. I just don‚Äôt understand THAT of all things to get self righteous and upset about. There are so many other things people do that have a much larger carbon footprint. It‚Äôs like that‚Äôs the only thing they can do to make themselves feel important, going around and finding all the idling cars.
I get that you might have had bad experience with some people but kind of odd to be so judgmental and showing your hypocrisy. Like all love to you bud but maybe you just were around wrong area or people. I‚Äôve traveled around and love the community feel and acceptance of Vermont the best. But each person will have different interactions. To each their own and your experience might have been with intolerant people. But most of us are pretty accepting of everyone from my lifetime here. Kind of more of a live and let live than ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù.
Good forbid they photograph a pretty barn landscape.
You have not described any Vermonters I know including myself
Ha ha listen to you what you mad about ? go eat some fruit or something.
People say that about every desirable state lfmao
And you wonder why people in Vermont don't like you.   ü§£ü§£

I comprehend exactly what you're saying, and its just plain wrong.   Maybe i should dumb it down for you?
I honestly think its more of a state of mind, and an attitude rather than lineage.  I know some folks that moved here from a big city, but adopted the life and held true to the lifestyle, instead of trying to push for change.   Those folks, in my mind, are just as much a Vermonter as someone born here with 10 generations of family from here.   The part that pisses people off, is trying to make Vermont convenient and "Proper" according to how folks live in the City.  Oh, and burlington doesn't count as a city, its barely big enough, and well, failing as a city.  (I'll get a bunch of downvotes just for saying that)
Nah its state of mind some people just are Vermonters and a lot of people aren't just how it is.
If born in Vermont, you are always a Vermonter!
Agreed, that‚Äôs why I worked in NYC 30 years.
They call themselves ‚ÄúNatives‚Äù , usually white people whose parents or grandparents moved here.  The Native Americans I know probably find it a little cringey.  There is also the people with 4 number license plates, that they got from their parents or grandparents, to signal that they have been here first.
You're way more Vermont than 90% of the people here
I have an awesome job in VT  and always have
I would love to hear Trump try to explain that sentence. üòÇ
I like muffins... are there berries??
A true woodchuck has entered the chat
Benningtons not actually rural. Manchester isnt either. It's like 16k pop and 4000 which is small but it's that many people in tiny areas and every surrounding town is populated. There's very little ruralness to the Northshire or Southshire. You don't get rural until you get a few towns away from each
Id rather hang in bratt than rut or burl. It's a mess but it's a better vibe.
Agree. I‚Äôm in Barnet, moved here last winter, and it‚Äôs like heaven on earth. I can‚Äôt believe I get to live in such a beautiful, kind place. Such nice people. St. J is adorable and nothing like I remember it 15-20 years ago when I was at Goddard. It‚Äôs vibe glows. I could not be happier.
Good observation!
Yet here you fucking are
We don't miss you don't worry
Glad you left. Don't come back.
I'm also from a small town in the NEK...gotta love the BS that happens within the town.
May I ask which town?
People in the northeast in general are pretty standoffish though.many of his complaints like "not saying thank you" when you hold the door is also gonna happen in any major east coast city.
Being from away myself a new resident to Maine, I have not had this problem, except for driving oddly enough. It was noticeable on the road before I changed my plates. Once I had Maine plates other Maine drivers started being a lot more friendly. But no problem with the people and my job has me traveling all over the state talking to folks.
My family has been in this area since the 1600s on both sides. As a southern Vermonter, it‚Äôs not the same here as when I was young or even like 5 years ago. I feel like we‚Äôre cursed being between NY and Mass.
Lol, my grandma would disagree (if she weren‚Äôt dead). To her Montpelier was the biggest city she wanted to go to üòÑ.
This. Exactly this.
I'm fifth generation here. Family came here to cut stone in the early 1800's.  My eighth generation neighbor has always referred to my family as "the transplants". That shit just rolls downhill.



Neither where someone is from nor how long they have lived in a place is indicative of how  good of a neighbor they are.  I imagine most "true Vermonters" don't focus on it... there's just too many ruts to fill.
As a Vermont "Native" that can trace my lineage to the native american tribes living here and southern Quebec, i don't find it "cringey" at all.  I think that folks that have moved here can't get the respect they believe they deserve from actual natives, and have taken a lot of insult to that.   Vermont has always had a very specific way of life due to the harsh climate and difficult terrain, and it took a special type of patience and attitude to live here.  What the "Natives" are getting mad about, is folks coming in and trying to change that type of life.  In their minds, these people "from away" are trying to bring their big city problems to a usually slow, and hard life that we are used to.  Also, we tend to be very stubborn, and keep to the motto "If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it".   

Word of advice, don't judge people too hard if you don't understand their lifestyle and mindset.
I can find census records back 9th generations, all farmers up until my grandfather sold his farm when I was little.
Nah dude, we definitely call each other vermonters not natives... That's some s*** rich people came up with.
Oh I just mean that I can‚Äôt find a job/salary match in VT - not that the job market is bad.
they‚Äôre not exactly metropolitan either though
Istg this subreddit is mostly people that don't live here who have a weird fixation on the state
You wouldn‚Äôt be so offended if it wasn‚Äôt true.
***Barton has entered the chat and has started throwing punches***
Yeah I think it has more to do with plates on cars then anything else I'm black and lived in rural Maine never had to deal with  anything in person expect for the passive comments from boomers but I've definitely  noticed  some people  are Dicks to out of staters  on the road
My grandparents didn't leave the nek. That is their choice.
As someone who grew up in Barnet/St Johnsbury for my first 20 years and have lived in the greater Burlington area for the next 20 years, it's funny to see how NEK people treat this area. When I was in college I lived right off the interstate, next to purple knights pizza (RIP) and my dad would get stressed about just that little venture into "the city" lol
True Vermonters of old didnt have to think about the difference because there werent any "others" here. The fundemental Verrmonter philosophy was live and let live. Imdont care what you do, just leave me alone to do my thing. We'll cooperate when we need to, and we'll work hard when we do. 

Short history lesson, this ended in the 60s and 70s. The so called hippie commune movement invaded. Being as they were, Vermonters lived and let live. You wanna be a hippie, have at it. Slowly, the state has been swollen with ex-urbanites who moved here with the idea that Vermonters liked hippies because they shared similar values. They really didn't. Vermonters are real independent, you're respnsible for yourself types. You all probably didnt onoe that Vermont to this day has voted for Repubkucan governors and presidents more than any other state. There were few democrats prior to the 1970s. Point is, the folks that have moved here iver the last 50 years or so, as compared to the population that comes from stock that lived here earlier, were wealthier, more 'eastern educated', and considerably closer to the hippies that started then in migration than the so called Vermonters. But hey, live and let live right?

Now it's the folks from somewhere else, for the most part who are in the driver's seat. The Vermont of today is a society not exactly of the Vermont tradition. You'll hear the powers that be talk about keeping our historic past, conserving our agricultural heritage, rehabilitating our important structures, keeping our landscapes open. That's all well and good, problem is that the people deciding what to 'protect' have no idea what this 'past' they want to save looked like. Invariably, they're protection efforts result in creating a Vermont that is nothing like it was and guaranteeing it will be nothing like Vermonters ever would have planned for. But, live and let live, right?

This has left a good number of Vermonters less than excited about getting to know the new folks in town, as just by looking around its pretty clear they didn't get to know Vermonters. Vermonters seem gruff and a little uninterested in strangers. Well, that'll happen when you're alienated in your own towns. A few examples of things Vermonters look sideways at. 

For many decades Vermonters kept billboards off our roads. Despite the income many landowners could have made directing folks to ski areas and vacation lakes, the landscape was more important. Then in a matter of a decade, there are solar farms at least as landscape damaging as billboards just everywhere. "I like them it makes me feel proud!" Vermont is one of the cloudiest places on the continent. Just saying, Burlington has more cloudy days than any city in America but Portland, OR.

No development, no development, no development. Zoning restrictions and an unpredictable permitting process in a place where construction labor and material cost are always high. Oh my god a housing crisis! How did this happen? Greedy rich people?? Meanwhile, to "save family farms" the state spends millions to buy development rights from family farms injecting cash to the farm but removing the development potential the land had. Hasn't saved farms. Gave old farmers retirement money and lowered the value of the land which has been swallowed up by ever increasingly large agri-business farms. Fewer farmers, more milk, less land to develop, higher costs for purchasing land to develop for housing, and more of a housing shortage. Vermonters shake their heads. "But we're saving farmland and Vermont's historic agricultural economy!". Fun fact: Manufacturing outpaced agriculture as bigger portion of the state economy in 1830 and never turned back. Think mill towns making wooden bobbins from the timber industry. 

The conservation of the metal i-beam skeleton of the old moran plant on probably some of the finest waterfront land IN THE WORLD. How about the circ? You know the one in Essex. That was supposed to go from Colchester to where it is now to I-89 just south of the Big Box exit. Not 35 or 40 minutes from Colchester to Williston, but 10. Stopped by environmental lawsuits. It had over 80% public support, was nearly totally funds by the feds, and all the land for the right of way was purchased. Who brought the suits? Out of state in migration attorneys, chief attorney - yup, Peter Welch. Ever seen the file cabinet sculpture down near Redstone Park? It's like a 60 foot tall stack of file cabinets. It represents the amount of paper work the Southern Connector Plan, also stopped by lawsuits, made before being scuttled. You know the southern connector. That skateboard park down at the end of Pine Street? 

These and many dozens of other "Flatlander" bungles have made Vermonters very skeptical of the new neighbors indeed.
Yeah I can trace both grandfather's all the way back to French Canadian fur trappers with native wives. we were told growing up the right people stay the wrong people leave and its none of our business as long as nobody is getting hurt.
My family cut ice to send to the middle east. 

Bout a mile or two from the B&J factory in Waterbury.
Yes, 100%
Exactly. Vermonters are gruff on the outside which reflects the self-sufficient attitude it takes to live in the North Country
I think that you are right about people moving here and wanting to change things (especially in Burlington and Stowe).  Things have changed in Vermont in the last 30-40 years. At some point in time ,unless you are a Native American , your ancestors came from not here.  I understand the yankee culture, and my family has lived in New England for as long as white people have lived here.  What I judge is when people say that they are Native to belittle other people, instead of talking about the history of why we do things the way we do .  There are many things that are awesome about Vermont and should be more present other places, like town meeting day, where everyone can have their say. Self reliance , and a willingness to help others in their time of need.
Agreed
That's ok your just one of our ambassadors then :)
It‚Äôs the same in every Vermont group on the internet. We have a local town Facebook group with 16k members and there are 13k human beings that even live here. People are a virus with shoes.
Hey neighbor!!
only mass holes and new Yorkers .. Mainers like cadence and Trust in other drivers. if you feel hate from a mainer may want to look in the mirror and know your audience.. or maybe your just a victim in general?
Thanks for the history lesson - life is nuanced and complex as you point out
Didn‚Äôt really see that coming.  ‚ÄúBlame it on the transplants‚Äù is a rich trope.   Isn‚Äôt everyone a transplant at some point?  Doesn‚Äôt really hold water.  ‚Äú everything sucks, here are the reasons it sucks, and these are the people that made it miserable‚Äù.   Ok  üëå
Bro, absolutely nailed it. üëå well done.
Interesting take. You started strong, but kinda flopped at the end.
Well said!  I believe that anyone who holds themselves above other people, for any reason, is not really being a good human.  That applies to folks from here, and in all parts of the globe we all share.  I do agree also that it really doesn't matter where you are from, as long as you understand where you are, and who you are with.  What you personally believe, may not be what the folks around you believe.  Vermonters that i grew up with were very tolerant to different kinds of attitudes, we didn't care what color your skin was, or where you were born.  It only mattered how you acted and treated everyone around you.    I have travelled around the US, and Canada, a little bit of Mexico, the Middle East, and South East Asia.  For a "xenophobe" as some like to call us, i think i've done well.  But Vermont will always be my home, and i want to protect it from becoming just another place that got run over by "progress" for the sake of it.
Applause!
I totally agree! Community is so important! Living in a city can feel impersonal. We're social creatures. I love Vermont and Vermonters, a lot of us are trying to keep the dream alive. Politics are an issue but a lot of Vermonters are still trying to meet their neighbors and forge community connections! I think the effort put into talking to the locals is already a facet of integrity and strength. Lately it feels like out-of-staters bring a completely different culture to the tender yet resilient state of Vermont. 

I like out of staters if they don't judge us and wanna be friendly and curious about our way of life. It would be nice if we could all live proudly and self-sufficiently, alongside each other. We're hard workers, not hustlers.
A bunch of years ago the Barton Selectboard routinely had shouting matches and fistfights.
I mean I've personally never dealt with anybody being a dick to me on the road but I also lived in a small town my whole life so I was like you knew everybody and everybody was nice to everybody it's like once you get into Portland or south Portland that it gets a little wild Westy with people being weenies and like 98% of the time the people that drive like weenies were people from out of state you are 100% correct that pretty much all mainers are nice to each other on the road it's on vacationers and people that live from out of state come up they're driving on the road becomes a living hell
You're a transplant aren't ya?
I don't know the part about the farmland is at the end and it's one of the strongest most impactful points.

There is a reason there were "don't Jersey Vermont" stickers on thousands of cars for multiple decades, along with t shirts etc and yeah that's basically it. The surrounding states wealth gentrified the state and made it way harder to live for the actual Vermonters and changed the way they lived, in almost 0 objectively positive ways
What?! When did that happen? And why am I not surprised?
What?! When did that happen? And why am I not surprised?
2017-2020, mainly 2019-2020. Trumpanzees‚Ä¶
Ouch - might be my worst nightmare
Man - helmet and head gone for sure!
Have to agree with everyone, this is a nightmare of the rider‚Äôs own creation. You very very rarely will see this happen when someone who really knows how to ride gos fast, especially on a run this simple. It‚Äôs a case of wanting to do too much wayyy too soon.
Edge Ketchum¬†
Don‚Äôt ride 40mph+ if you can‚Äôt maintain edge control
Riding your heel edge on the toe side isn‚Äôt gonna end well at that speed
Too fast for his skills to keep up
This is a skills issue (as in lack of skill), not a random accident.
Absolutely horrible form. Lots of anti-examples in this video for beginners.
Concussion check plz
At least his gloves were tethered.
Shouldn‚Äôt be a nightmare for you if you know how to snowboard properly
That's 3 weeks on the IR concussion protocol
I think worst nightmare maybe goes to this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5ME9Swo0\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5ME9Swo0_8)
That's a pretty rookie mistake. This person was going way too fast for their skill level. 

Once you're advanced enough to ride at high speeds you should also have the muscle memory to avoid catching an edge like this without even thinking about it.
As a noob, this is my biggest fear.

Why did it happen? Was his weight on the wrong side of the board?
Guy is clearly under-skilled and over-confident. Slow down, dude... Learn to ride first.
Sucks to suck!
Ah the back edge at full speed. Classic. Get well!
This is why there are signs all over the place saying ‚Äúbe in control‚Äù. This guy is an idiot.
That‚Äôs a NASTY wipeout.. holy moly. Anyone know what resulted from this fall? Assuming a bad concussion and a few broken bones
I can't tell if he has a helmet, moving that quickly and catching an edge THAT bad causes alot of excess downward force and I'd assume dead or brain damage if no helmet. Guys, can't say it enough, know ur limit ride within it. Been doing this for 25 yrs and not once have I watched someone who is clearly not in proper control or trying to bomb a hill who'se skill level doesn't match the task and thought " man this person is so cool". People who know  know ur an idiot and will stay away from u lie the plague and the people that don't know are usually the ones u fuck up if not urself first. Anyway, stay safe but shreddit
Need one of those sniper edits added into this
good old chakra realignment. Maybe a hip too.
How are some people ok with going this fast when their edge control skill is at "bend at the waist" level? I didn't even attempt this kind of speed until I had real carving down on at least one side. When you don't have carving levels of edge control it's so sketchy going this fast I don't see how anyone would attempt it, unless they never ever caught an edge before.
You can tell by his posture and form into that turn that he is not experienced enough to be going that fast.
There‚Äôs one super easy trick that everybody should learn when they‚Äôre new, and if you do, you‚Äôll never catch an edge again. 

All you have to do is >! Be good at snowboarding !<
Worst case scenario
It‚Äôs worse on a heel side turn.

Herniated my L4-5 fully.
Slow down azzhole!!!!!!üñï
it‚Äôs cause he didn‚Äôt say 2 or 3 more
It doesn't matter if it's your first day, or 1000th. The ground always feels the same after catching an edge.
Been there done that. actually not too bad, except where you take your shit off and take the walk of shame back down the hill
If you heel edge when you‚Äôre suppose to toe edge you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time
That snowboard didn‚Äôt seem to have any edges until it caught one.
The timing on That orange slow banner sliding into view at the last second...
The glove came off
Fuckin noob
A cautionary tale. Watch and learn, noobs. Watch and learn.
I did this 10 years ago and broke my collarbone when snowboarding with my dad and little brother. We were on the way home and my dad said, ‚Äúare you hungry? Because you aren‚Äôt going to eat for a long time once we go to the hospital.‚Äù So we went to 5 guys and I had an amazing bacon cheeseburger.
Bet they wear a helmet from now on
Is this the guy that lost all his stuff when he was concussed at alto?
Too much rotation without direction, ouch
Know your limits keeeeeds
That guy didn‚Äôt catch an edge, the edge caught him.
I fully knocked myself out doing almost this exact thing, woth a helmet on. Bottom of a steep run carrying a lot of speed, caught heel edge, slammed. Resulted in a bad concussion that messed me up for a few years.  Was about 20 years ago now.
Only be worse if he caught the toe edge
Deserved. Ride within your capabilities.
Worst nightmare for the rider. Fucking hilarious for outside observers. And yes like everyone else has said, this was 100% avoidable.
Oof. Gotta really set that toe edge and don't go so perpendicular to the fall line unless you're really ready to dig it in.
Helmet everyone. Its not only for noobs.
Amazing how fast a lil edge can lay you out flat lol
AI video? 

Maybe I‚Äôm trippin‚Ä¶
if you pizza when you should french fry you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time
Kind of like owning broke my ankle. 2nd time boarding and on a black diamond, got too fast kicked my heel out to skid and caught a patch of solid ice. My rear end was touching the hill trying to slow down and the board caught throwing me face first down the hill. I went into a tumble rolling twice and sprawled out to stop the rolling. Unfortunately for me, when I did the board cut right into the ice, snapping my one ankle and spraining the other one. So, in essence my  board stopped but my body didn't. Ended up waling half way down the hill and slid the rest. Ski patrol said if I walked partially down it wasn't broken. Went to the doctor the next day and the xray confirmed it was broken.

Had a lot of trouble getting back on a black diamond, let alone go fast.  Now I am more confident and relaxed paying particular attention to what edge I am on and what needs to be done. My legs are stronger than ever so I can really dig in to slow down rapidly.  I am impressed that I didn't give up on boarding because that put the fear in me.
I‚Äôve watched this a bunch now for no reason so you don‚Äôt have to.
I haven‚Äôt ridden for a minute but I was always on one edge or another all light footed I felt like, looking ahead of me.
This bloke didn‚Äôt do any of that.
More balls than skill.
The snow sharks granted no mercy that day.
Going too fast for your ability. That‚Äôs how idiots hurt innocent bystanders.
Noob.
Look people from a guy that snowboarded since 1993 and was a certified snowboard instructor for ten seasons - OPs video shows level 0 snowboarding- basically the sled version of snowboarding.  

Save your brains and bodies and learn to get to level 1 before you go balls out like this poor guy.  Level 1 - can stay in control, turn and stop on a snowboard.  Can make toeside and heelside turns and is at least beginning to link tow and heel turns to make S turns.  

Sure- go balls out and fly down a run, but have edge control so you can stop without serious brain injuries.
I did this same thing in whistler a couple years back. I always wear my helmet, but I ended up with a broken ankle. Always hold your edge.
So this is fake right, looks fake to me. Body rag dolls too easily. Maybe the editing.
It‚Äôs weird tho, he‚Äôs toe side, but he doesn‚Äôt really turn. Looks like he swung his back leg forward causing the board to go flat, but no turn or even a lean into the toe to either carve or brake.  I‚Äôm not sure he knew what to at that speed.
We all been there
Happens to everyone. Did something similar but it hadnt snowed in awhile and was pretty much ice in the shadows of trees. Woke up to people on the liftchairs yelling and asking if they should call ski patrol. Only out for a few seconds but went and bought a helmet after I was done riding that day, which consisted of taking it easy just to get my moneys worth.
Helmet helps...but f we've all done this at one point
This looks just like me the first time on a board. That happend a lot and I could not figure out for the life of me why. Second time I had no problems.
This is exactly how I tore my shoulder in March of 2023, except I got cut off by a skier and caught and edge trying to avoid them.
Am I the only one here who thinks this looks like some AI generated bullshit? The fall doesnt even look realistic for the gradient of the slope
Ive been riding for over 20 years... anyone can catch an edge.
Still better than twisting your ankle skiing.
I‚Äôve done it, random edge caught nub on snow. It can happen to ‚ÄúANYONE‚Äù I thought I was going to break my neck and die as I was tumbling. Just messed up my back. 15 years later still going with intermittent back issues.
Every part of me hurts watching this
You always remember your first time catching the heel edge üòÇ
Mouse trap üëèüèª
He tried to commit suicide or what
Remember kids, don't ride lazy.
Caught heel edge on dust-covered manzanita bush yesterday and bout busted my wrist. Hurt like a bitch.
Is this the guy from copper that woke up in the hospital after only riding blues?
Riding when you are tired is how a lot of seasoned riders get hurt
Nothing worse than catching a heal edge, especially at that rate of speed‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs hello concussion‚Ä¶

Goodbye consciousness‚Ä¶

My dude was starched‚Ä¶
Meh they are fiiiine
Damn.  Thought he snagged a trip wire.
Going way too fast for your skill level is a totally good idea.
r/endedtosoon
![gif](giphy|l46CsyBPj9ajF9Y4M)
Happened to me going about that fast.  Hit some moguls on the other side of a catwalk.  I caught a toe edge on one and smashed into another.  Three broken ribs.
My dude! It looks like you tried to nose roll at high speed. Get well and get good. I hope this didn't cut your vacation short. 

Btw what was the name of this song?
My dude this is a daily occurrence.
I did this as a kid full scorpion knocked the wind outta me for the first time in my life. Thought I was dying ü§£
RIP, but I mean the dude turned by rotating his hips. That was on him.
ya‚Äôll know this was his Run after his ‚Äúlast run‚Äù right?!?! it always gets you. you get to the bottom after  you call ‚Äúlast run‚Äù have an awesome time and go, ‚ÄúJust one more‚Äù turn onto the lift and this happens as soon as you get speed.
I had something similar happen to me 6-7 years ago on a pretty casual, easy run. I have bumped my head a few times over the years. But this one knocked me out. I was foggy for a week or so. Scary stuff. 

I used to like to chase top speed down my local downhill run. I ride it, but I don‚Äôt chase anything anymore. Just not worth it.
r/snowboardingnoobs 

This is some great footy. You can see this guy try to change from his heel edge to his toe edge. If you watch the video, you can see that he tries to use his back leg to initiate the toe edge turn. This left his center of mass over his heel edge instead of his toe edge. That dug in his heel edge and well.. you saw how well that worked out. 

To avoid this: 

A: use your front foot to initiate your turn
B: push your hips over your board to the new edge (in this case the toe edge) to lock in the new edge.
Had this happen once when I was much younger. Long runout at the bottom of the Boa run off Super Condor at PCMR (formerly The Canyons). Spring conditions, so the snow was alternating mashed potatoes and ice based on whether or not there was tree shade at that exact spot. Turning toe-side, hit a little bump, lost control, and whiplashed. Shattered the plastic shell and foam liner of my helmet and knocked the wind out of me. I remember it happening, so I don't think I was concussed, but god damn I really should have been.

For those of y'all saying "not a problem is you know how to ride hurr durr hurr durr": people crash. People lose control. This happens to people of literally every skill level. Slow your roll, ya dingdongs.
I mean it looks like he literally hit something, not that he caught an edge, no? I‚Äôm a noob, that was my first thought.
That‚Äôs why I started wearing helmets long ago, lol...you‚Äôve gotta protect your noggin üß†
Ever since I started riding switch I never catch edges anymore. I swear you could blind fold me and I could get down a green run without falling. But I remember when I was learning‚Ä¶. Oh my god do I ever remember the face plants, scorpions, smashing your face‚Ä¶ the list goes on lol. Fuck now I‚Äôm thinking about this‚Ä¶.
Once you‚Äôve done this you have PTSD for life
I did a similar thing once on my toe side, so falling onto my face. Not pleasant, I was shaking badly for a while afterwards.
Literally trying to turn the board flat üò≤üò≤
ü§∑ dont ride flat and that will never happen to you lol

Learn how to snowboard before you bomb shit
I got a concussion watching this. Damn. Hope you are ok.
Not something I probably shoulda seen whilst at an icy resort atm haha
Gotta be tough if you're gonna...
Wakeboarding made me basically catch-an-edge-proof, and I‚Äôm damn glad now lmao, it‚Äôs wild to me that people with zero skills send it this hard üíÄüíÄ
Waits til the flattest section of the run to turn‚Ä¶
Man I really wish I got my first edge on camera. Idk how tf I'm still alive üòÖ
why did this happen?
Bombing is easy, same as on a longboard downhill, controlling your speed takes skill
At least tell me that all the ladies were impressed.
I did a slow version of this today. Half heartedly doing sliding 360s must have not been paying any attention and put my heel down when I was looking uphill. Just a little roll and my butt is a little sore, but that's why I wear a fucking helmet.
You gots to lean over a bit ! 
Ya Think ?
Your really shredding !!!!  Your body üòÇ
That‚Äôs happened to the best of us.  You aren‚Äôt pushing your limits for edge feel and response if you‚Äôve never done this near this speed.  I‚Äôm all about style; riding in a way that looks almost loose and lazy but still fast and controlled.
Why are people here pretending like they don't fall over? Shit happens.
This is why I watch my speed and try to never get out of control.  Snowboarding falls are the worst.
Great way to learn a lesson. Hope the person is alright. Stay humble out there‚Ä¶

(Sorry not sorry but I got a good chuckle out of this, and yes, I‚Äôm an asshole)
That's not how you use the edge.
I transitioned from skiing to snowboarding for a couple years and this is the reason I transitioned back
He was French frying when he should have pizza‚Äôd
Going way too fast for his skill level
u/redditspeedbot 0.1x
That wasn‚Äôt even close üòÖ
You only make that mistake once.
Jesus the guy put all his weight in the middle of the board and turned like 75 degrees.  Definitely rookie lesson learned
Ran out of talent.
Clearly riding way above skill level
S A F E
Worst nightmare is not knowing how to ride?  We‚Äôve all screwed up on the slopes, but that situation was one of the riders own doing.
can someone explain why his form is bad and why this happened? like why did he go sideways? weight distribution? plz explain so i dont do this as a beginner!!
When I first tried snowboarding, I tried to turn like that as little as possible because I just couldn‚Äôt get the stance right and would cut too deep. Granted, i wasn‚Äôt stupid enough to go that fast, but still occasionally ate shit albeit in less spectacular fashion.
My first time I ever got some good speed going I caught my heel edge while on my toe edge and rag dolled for probably 20 or 30 yards.

Thank the good lord they just had a boatload of fresh powder, i learned a very important lesson for a MUCH smaller price than this guy.
If your nightmares take place in a pleasure dome, you might be privileged.
Perisher is jerry central
Dude had no business going that fast. Literally as soon as he tried to do a tow side turn he caught‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs some beginner shit
Wear a quality helmet
I caught my heel edge today when I was riding medium fast down a green run while waiting on a friend to catch up. I‚Äôm at the point now where I don‚Äôt really catch edges super often, especially my heel side edge but I just wasn‚Äôt paying attention to what I was doing ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è embarrassed AF lol
Hello? Concussion town? It's me, ya boy.
I *love* helmets. I **LOVE** HELMETS!!
RTX ON for rag doll effect
I had something like this happen, broke my collar bone and dislocated my shoulder after catching the edge, I went snowboarding 3 times after that accident and every time I dislocated the same shoulder, snowboarding is not my sport but I enjoy watching and hearing the stories from my friends.
i HATEEEEE falling like this..     you carve, and hit a little bump, and your body rotates..

then you land and catch an edge.. it happens quick and the fall is like in slow motion.. its awful
Caught my back edge like this going much slower in some powder about 15 years ago and still got a nasty concussion. I‚Äôll never forget the pain I felt the next few days. This looks nasty.
I did this exact same thing except on skis, the skis popped off and I landed on one. I found out exactly how sharp skis are that day. Got a cool scar out of it though.
I didn't see a yeti, not that scary.
200% user error
So, isn't it bad for your joints when your feet stick to the board when it does stuff like that?
Catching the back edge with your back downhill is the worrrrsssttt!!     I've reverse scorpioned at least 3 times.  Every time my back and neck hurt for a week after.
Been there done that lol. But face first on a rly steep slope
Caught an edge letting up approaching the lodge at Mountain Creek. My guard was totally down as I was coasting in. Going faster than I realized but knew I was supposed to be naturally slowing down soon. Superman flew through the air, my board went vertical to horizontal in an instant. Scorpioned. Board nailed me in the back. Bruised collarbone. Sore neck. Partially collapsed lung. Fractured kidney. Lost 30 lbs in hospital and IV leaked into my arm couldnt bend right for 2 weeks post discharge.

Got back on the board 4 years later.
Choose your edge or the mountain will ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I did something like this once. Nice groomed blue square under the chairlift, I thought why not I'll go max speed. Was going hella fast, basically flat lining with my board. Caught an edge where another run crossed over. And I'm cartwheeling. I think I might have been knocked out for a sec because people on the lift were yelling asking if I was okay. I gave a thumbs up and I did not do that again. Was wearing a helmet. But by my half conscious count I probably did at least 4 cartwheels and I slid about the length from one chair pole to the next if not more.
Am I the only one who sees CGI here?
Ouch. Caught an edge and feeling it for sure
When I ride this fast I never toe side‚Ä¶always heel first
Hahaha! Seriously, that's funny. I've been through FAR worse than that and came out laughing. That seems like it was fun, honestly. I did that on a black diamond and slid for like twice to three times as far as that and was laughing the entire way. Learn the art of how to fall, and how to fall with fun.
Going a little fast for a first timer.
Skier to snowboarder in my 20s hit 30s back to skiing. :) fuck catching an edge
Man, I‚Äôm sitting in a sling right now with a broken shoulder waiting to go back to Atlanta ü§£. Same thing on Wednesday, first day of the last trip of the season. Caught a back edge (luckily at the end of the day on a green back to the house). I hope you‚Äôre feeling ok my dude.
Weak calves?
lol how perfect, he comes to a stop at the slow sign.

Snowboarders that send it like this when they don‚Äôt have the skills are the reason people hate us. At least he‚Äôs on the appropriate slope‚Ä¶ fucking hate when they‚Äôre trying to do this at the top of the mountain endangering everyone and ruining the runs for everyone.
That‚Äôs exactly how I broke my collarbone
Looked like he was about to skid turn then hit a patch of packed snow or a mound. Hard to tell.
It sucks, but it's really not that bad.
![gif](giphy|11Zj50WZvBqCTS)
Happened to me once, although I flipped and landed and slammed on my stomach/chest. 
I saw what looked like fresh powder but was very very wrong, and it was in fact frozen ice. Going to fast, caught and edge on it and tumbled like that before slamming hard. Broke a rib. Ski patrol even showed up quick and asked if I was ok. I asked ‚Äúdid you see that?‚Äù And he kind of grinned and said ‚Äúyeah, it was bad‚Äù. Uh memories.
This dude has no idea how to ride lol. Flat spin into a carve going that fast? What‚Äôd you think was gonna happen.

Most dudes so this once or twice when you‚Äôre 12 then typically learn the lesson.
As a snowboarding fan that only watches, what just happened?
This is animated. It would be awful to have happen, but this video did not happen.
I'm very experienced and had a wreck like this when tired. I felt my brain move inside my head. I was very very lucky. I always wear a helmet now.
That second whammy hurt
Actual footage of when I separated my AC joint...
As someone who doesn't snowboard what happened? It looks like he just ate shit on flat snow?
Criminals get what they deserve. Karma
I‚Äôm still more afraid of avalanches
Looks like homie was fresh out the lodge after a couple morning pitchers
My friends and I call that getting mouse trapped
I did that on my first run ever. Broke my neck. I didn't know how to slow down.
Is that the snowboarder equivalent of getting a pebble stuck in your trucks and getting sent flying.
Ive had a similar crash, maybe not quite as bad but definitely glad as hell I was wearing a helmet
Im not a snowboarder. But. My best buddy got a snowboard as a Christmas gift one year. We went out and he absolutely did this same fall/move. It was epic. He did 3 full in air turns. And 'skillfully' landed it. We trugded up the hill and I did the same. Full somersaults. Young bones and unspoken escapades are mythical.
On my second day ever of snowboarding I did something similar to this at hidden valley. The snow was packed and mostly man made so it had become more like ice and I caught a wicked groove that shitwhipped me. Managed to keep the chin tucked and take it mostly to the shoulder but had a full blow yard sale.
Yard sale for the bargain hunters
Can we talk about the camerawork though?

Perfectly framed the entire time, almost looks fake.
All black, no gas.
Squid
Caught my heel landing a massive booter at loon mountain years ago. No helmet. Got absolutely wrecked and scared me out of the park for years. Never felt comfortable after that tbh.
I may be high but this video looks fake. AI got me paranoid. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Backseat hehe
Not as bad as it looks. He's fine and will learn. Pushing your speed and catching an edge in the process is a universal experience
Not sure why he twisted so hard to heelside.
And this is why you wear helmets üòÖ
If you ride a standard camber board and know what you are doing this is pretty rare
He died‚Ä¶ hand shoes fell off
I'm trying to reconcile all of these "Jerry has no skills" comments with the fact that someone is recording the guy, and doing a rather impressive job keeping him in frame.

Did this guy wake up, say "Imma bomb a run today, while being filmed by someone who can do a great job keeping me in frame" while simultaneously not knowing how to ride that well? or ... How did this whole shit show come together, exactly.
Whistler right now
‚ÄúOoo a penny‚Äù
smiggins? haha
How I imagine the conversation before this went:

‚ÄúFilm me while I flat board bomb this for Reddit. What do you mean do I know how to ride my edges? Of course I can do this, just learned to smooth the peanut butter in my first lesson yesterday‚Äù
Never caught an edge like that‚Ä¶..oooff!
I smashed incredibly hard like that after trying a bs 180 on a side hit
YARD SALE!!
I went straight back to skis after that.
That was a good one. Any dislocations?
Whew! That is a serious concussion. Imagine if he didn‚Äôt have a helmet.
Didn't even think you could get a reverse scorpion.
To you - it's your worst nightmare, to me - my best attempt at snowboarding

Next post fits‚Ä¶
Hey! That‚Äôs how I broke my collarbone
Accidents on a ski slope always look like early 2000s videogame ragdoll physics
Those flat turns will get you every time.... Did this the other way around. Hurt like a mothe*****.
I took a nap like this once in Targhee.
He didn't have much upstairs to protect anyways so a helmet isn't required.
The price of an asshole 15 second of fame
Been there. Don't wanna go back
Did they wear a helmet?
My worst nightmare is riding off piste near population. There might be a burried fence in the snow, my snowboard goes through rhe planks/wires, but my legs get stuck and i eat shit.
Snowboarders‚Ä¶.. either look awesome or complete prats‚Ä¶ nothing in between üòÅ
N00b
Stay on your toes kids!
He didn't fucking send that stop. When you're going that fast you've gotta know you got the balls to lay it down. Confidence is huge
I've had a few good headsmacks, although most were on cat tracks. Only one good one at speed like this trying to avoid a little skiling. Rang my head like a bell.

Wear your helmets kids. Looking cool is great now, brain damage is forever.
Happened to me at the end of last season, except, I didn‚Äôt roll, so none of the momentum got lost. just slammed straight on the face and got the wind knocked out of me. I just laid in the snow for about 20 minutes
Broke my neck and arm like this in Japan üòÇ
Makes me wonder if this was intentional for views with the cam. Because that was a pretty rookie mistake. RIP his noggin
Ummm
Bet that sign he almost takes out said Slow.
Kind of looks fake tbh
where did you get this video of me
Decide which edge you're riding on or the mountain will decide for you.
Hopefully, this is your wake-up call. Don't be like me, First, I tried to launch off a head wall as far as my buddy skiing. On the third attempt, I matched his distance, landed, and then caught the back edge. I tomahawked, hitting my head twice. I stopped when my toe edge dug in. It tweaked my ankles, causing bone spurs. I didn't learn then. Years later, I caught a front edge, breaking my foot (lisfranc) and knocking myself out.
Good night. I had a yard sale on a flat section at Breck, so not even close to going as fast, and ended up win a solid concussion with symptoms that lasted like a month afterwards.
Yeah, I know I've done this before. Maybe a few times. Can't remember.
Raggedy Andy.
An experience like this is exactly why I had to stop snowboarding. That...and I'm getting older and can't bounce back as quickly
Dude‚Äôs dead right? Or at the very least quadriplegic?
Happened to me once. I was going down the hill and this guy comes out of nowhere and cuts me off so I turned and my edge caught and I went face first into the ground. I blacked out and woke up flying through the air and blacked out again. When I came to at the bottom, there was a trail of blood and my dad (skiing in jeans) is laughing his ass off. Went to the doctor and I had a concussion.
Caught an edge coming down that big hill at the end of Ramshorn at Vail. Couldn't breathe for like 30 seconds. Just threw my thumb up when someone checked on me. Hurt like a motherfucker
I mean, going fast isn't the issue. Going fast while not on your edges is. You're asking to high side if you ride like this on a flat base
I've had close to this once, but with a massive caveat. I have big feet, and we had an impromptu weekend away where I didn't take my board.¬†


I rented a board, which wasn't wide, so my boots were hanging off.¬†


Saturday afternoon all good in the late season slush.


Sunday morning, up high, late season, pretty icy and steep, my toes pushed my toe edge off the "snow" (ice). The ground just instantly fell away from me. I somehow ended up on back, caught my heel edge into the snow and then in catapulted me like this guy.¬†


Broke my sunglasses but that was it, but I was pretty bloody shaken up as I just felt like I couldn't trust my toe edge on that board anymore!
Yeah, bro hasn‚Äôt earned it yet‚Ä¶ painful lesson.
For. Sure. Bombing down a hill with the hands out front like that is a dead giveaway that person shouldn‚Äôt be   going that fast.
Your description is accurate af. I thought I was the absolute boss my 2nd time going down the hill. Riding fast as fuck in a straight line with the board flat instead of keeping an edge down and the wrong edge touched and fucked me right up. It  scarred me for the rest of that season. Always need to be doing a little bit of a zig
Yep, been riding for over 20 years, I cannot remember the last time I caught a back edge. You just don't let this happen, because as seen in this video, it's fucking terrible if it does!
Idk I‚Äôd say i‚Äôm pretty solid, can ride pretty damn fast, but every few years I‚Äôll hit a ‚Äúphantom‚Äù edge out of nowhere. That being said, people tend to fall when pushing their boundaries, and it‚Äôs tough to get better without doing so. Although the way this dude tried to turn at that speed was never going to work.
This!
Intermediate abilities with expert desires. You don‚Äôt turn your board at this type of speed, just use your edges to slow you down. If you‚Äôre going to stop you have to fully commit and slam it on. He tried to do sloppy slide turn.
It was a washout slide ‚Äúturn‚Äù‚Ä¶ typical of self taught riders
Only time I‚Äôve caught an edge like this is when I was carrying a backpack half full of beers and lost my balance‚Ä¶ it started as a backpack full of beers
Never forget the first time you catch an edge, and you rarely do it again üò¨
>Have to agree with everyone, this is a nightmare of the rider‚Äôs own creation.

for sure, yea

&#x200B;

> It‚Äôs a case of wanting to do too much wayyy too soon. 

well. isn't this just *going to happen*? like if you're trying out a new trick you're prolly gonna fall right? i eat shit pretty much at least once every time i go. maybe i just suck at snowboarding lol
Or‚Ä¶ alcohol :/
My neck has never been the same after a double cartwheel with no hands only head for contact.
Camberd boards were a game changer.
This is what happens when you ride too fast in shit conditions
Unfortunately i fit into the idk wtf im doing but sendin it anyway category..
Ya, catching the heel edge, or any edge lol, is Rough! My horror story is a buddy hit a bit table top and caught the heel edge landing. And it laid him out like a whip, his head smacked the landing snow. Me and guy #3 split up to check on our friend and block the take-off and he was okay but this was back in the day before helmets were normalized...
I‚Äôm at the point now after a few seasons that I have pretty good control, but I‚Äôm still just scared to pick up any more speed in case this happens.
Sometimes muscles just give out or spasm, screws could have come loose, a binding comes loose, we don't know the full story.  Just about every professional has a horror story because they have been doing it for that long.  Accidents happen.  But, yeah, this looks pretty amateur, lol.
I'm very experienced and had a wreck like this when tired. I felt my brain move inside my head. I was very very lucky. I always wear a helmet now. Don't need to be a noob for this to happen.
üòÇ you clearly have NO idea what you are talking about. No amount of experience stops a slight misjudged line, deviations in the snow, quick caught edge, etc. This comment reeks of inexperience and all ego.
Mistakes happen, could be a newbie, could be experienced. I‚Äôve been riding for 20 years but first run of the year I caught an edge, not nearly this bad though. Also can miss a lump in the snow.
I caught my heel side edge starting out fresh and had a bruise from my above my knee twisting around my thigh all the way up to my waist for 3 weeks lmao. The most beautiful colors of bruising ü§åüèª
You say you got them guns but I've never seen you bang.. You say you got them drugs.. But I have never seen you slang.. say you're in the game but no one sees you play. Say you're going hard but nobody feels the same.
Gotta break ‚Äòem all.
üíÄüíÄüíÄ
üòÇ
Agreed. Noodle legs at the end of the day trying to catch edges is how I know it‚Äôs time to unstrap.
Whiskey is not a performance enhancing drug
Typically my edge control is really good when I‚Äôm off the slopes
id say this is like 30 :p

which is still fast, yea.
Yea what could go wrong as I let my board run flat with my back turned going 40+ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Agree, BUT. Something like this happened to me few years ago. It was a late winter where during the day things melted and froze at the evening. Snowcat did a good job squashing the snow but it was such a slushy that got squashed through tracks and on some spots they left small ice bolders unintentionally in size of a golf ball. So i made a turn like this dude with full speed and got hooked.. i did  720 backflip and landed on my chest, It took me 30 min to get winded and realizing with buddies what happened. Shit‚Äôs crazy when you get cought off guard like that.
Wow man, but they looked so badass riding fast & flat! /s
That was my thought- whytf is he kicking up snow heelside...when he's turning toe...it's like trying to snowboard in reverse.
[deleted]
Hahaha yeah wrong edge dude! just started twisting his torso while flat footed... He probably was getting good at high speed carving just that day and was overconfident

At that speed you gotta stay on ur edges
see he french fried when he should have pizza'd and you're gonna have a bad day

yeah I don't get why he didn't lean\* and dig more toeside on that either, probably just had a brain fart
He definitely ran out of talent on that one!
I don‚Äôt think this was a skill issue at all tbh. They just intentionally seem to be trying to flat base it for some reason lmao. Their body positioning tells me that they at least know how to ride‚Ä¶. This was just allllll on the rider being lazy and a bit of a moron imo haha.

Edit: on second review, he was not in as good a stance as I thought.

Edit in edit: damn y‚Äôall I get it lmao. I agree this dude wasn‚Äôt experienced. Quickly watching this cheeseburger recorded video while at work gave me the wrong initial impression.
Can you explain for the beginner lilke me?
What‚Äôs wrong with his form
That‚Äôs a big 10-4!
Yes. He got one.
Don't know about you guys but I had to do this a few times as a kid to learn how to snowboard properly
When I caught my backside edge I was out 4
PTSD flashback. I need the reminder though. I‚Äôve been WAY deeper down a well than that dude, literally disappeared from site now you see me now you don‚Äôt. If I didn‚Äôt have a good air pocket it could have ended badly despite multiple witnesses on scene wondering where the hell I went. That and long arms to dig to bindings and free myself while suspended in branches and snow. Then climb out from 10 feet down branch by branch. It‚Äôs a weird little hidden world down there I don‚Äôt plan on visiting again.
Holy shit, having been trapped in a tree well once, this triggered a panic attack. I actually had to skip through the video to the point where he is able to breathe. Worst nightmare by a long shot.
I am not a skier or snowboarder, what is preventing the rescuer from falling in to join the stuck boarder?
Yea I‚Äôve seen that - I think going backcountry solo is just stupid though!
holy shit
Scaryyy
the only thing I didn‚Äôt like was he did it close to the lift, at that speed he could‚Äôve crashed into some kid getting pulled up by the lift
Going too fast without knowing how to control edges. He took a stance/turn that turns your back down the mountain, in that scenario you need your weight on your toes. His weight was on his heels which dug the heel edge into the ground.
If pause at the start, you can see he‚Äôs massively broken at the waist with his arse well out over his heels. Only his head and shoulders are over the toe edge. His lower body is stacked over his heels so his board catches on heels at first opportunity

All the time but on toes in particular, don‚Äôt bend at the waist like this. You want your hips out over the toe edge so your weight is riding the edge you‚Äôre on
Just don't go so fast until you are completely in control. The person in the video is clearly a total beginner
Turned toeside while maintaining heel edge
You're gonna catch your heel edge and fall backwards. That is inevitable when you are learning. You're smarter than this person though, so you wont be going this fast when it happens. You might bonk your head, but you wont tomahawk backwards down the bunny hill then ragdoll your head into the ground.
If you aren‚Äôt familiar with what stacked means, learn it. As others have said he bent over at the waist- that is a death sentence to control. The beginner turns with their upper body (bad). The beginner but starting to get the hang turns with their hips. The intermediate rider initiates turns with their knees and the advance riders initiate turns with their ankles. This guy messed up because of speed and he didn‚Äôt keep his body stacked over the upslope edge. In other words, when he bent over, his butt shifted his weight back onto his heel edge- which is why he ejected it off the snow. That is a massively bad crash and even with a helmet could have moderate/sever concussion and hopefully will be ok one day- but it won‚Äôt be for a while.
They turned the board sideways relative to where they were going and didn't lift the downhill edge.
Riding Flat is what did it

Always be on an edge, its where all your control is

Terrible stance also doesnt help either, his body is in a position that he almost cant possibly get the weight over the right edge for the direction hes going

Jyst dont ride flat and youll be fine
Lolz maybe learn how to snowboard before getting your buddy to film you rippin green runs
I've never done this and almost never seen it happen. Is it a classic/common?
The run is at smiggin holes in Australia
[deleted]
Guess you're looking out for ice a lot more too? I think a headlamp on our helmets could work wonders, especially in flat cloud lighting.
I don't think this guy is either of those
Lol
In spring several years ago at Vail I hurt myself. I had been hitting this sidewall that led to a tree that was stripped and you could ride up it about 15 feet.

The next morning after a very cold night Born Free was super fast. I hit it and went right into a branch above the 15 foot stripped section. 

[Here‚Äôs the scar.](https://imgur.com/tYf3uTj)
Same! Was my second day boarding. Never been in so much pain. My wife who is a skier came up on me, snowed me and told me to stop being a pussy and to get the fuck up. If not for her I wouldn‚Äôt be the well seasoned boarder I am today. But damn, my ass still stings when I think about it.
Yeah, I've been riding for 23 years and can run just about any terrain, but every now and then shit just goes wrong you catch an edge and its all over.
You don't need to be on edge to bomb.


If this dude was a better boarder he'd have fallen on his face uphill having slid out on his toe side.


This dude is beginner as fuck to catch his heel edge on a toe slide
Like one never should slide flat? Is always have to be edge to edge??
Not really.  They just haven't developed the reflex to get the board on the right edge at all time.
[deleted]
We all lose it sometimes, but not quite like this. You can see the guy is just flat base without any awareness he‚Äôs rotating. 

Just recently I was in some choppy pow and got caught up stopping short and face planted. Chest first knocked the wind out of me for a sec. But in that moment I knew it was coming and could do my best to not be flipping or hit the ground really bad. 

So happens yea but still this screams riding way above what they should.
I ride pretty damn fast and this never happens. Not once.  That board was at a 20 degree angle and he didn‚Äôt dig his toe edge in.
[deleted]
I mean I understand what you‚Äôre saying about pushing your limits, and you are going to fall when you do that, but there is a difference between pushing your limits and completely ignoring them.
Good way to not ride the rest of a season and learn next to nothing lol
Seasons don‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs days/time on snow. Once a season for 4 seasons is 4 days, just as an example.
It‚Äôs pretty clear what happened here to me. All amateur board control.
Nope, it‚Äôs super clear here what happened
No, the move here looks noobie 100%. No lumps, no experienced rider gets this sideways compared to where they are going fully flat based.

I see their head go bang on the ground if that counts
Orbital! I choose youuu!!
Thanks god he didn‚Äôt lose a glove
I have a hard rule of no last runs. Always that 1 last lap you want to take when you‚Äôre cooked and shit goes sideways.
Literally me this week. Knew I should have stopped since form was getting bad. Caught an edge and now have a cracked rib....
This is when I take a couple chill runs on greens or easy blues before calling it quits for the day
Vodka on the other hand...
It‚Äôs performance enchanting for fighting and fucking
30 is faster than beginners should be riding lol
‚ÄúHow do I carve?‚Äù
Seems like he was maybe trying to do a nose lift into a goofy stance and got lazy with it? If not then this guy is just an idiot for riding that fast
Literally never. If your torso is facing uphill, stay toe side. If your torso is facing downhill, stay heel side. There is no exception regardless of level. No amount of skill can overcome physics
No never.  You are connecting skidded turns, so your uphill edge is the edge you ride on when turning.

(On toeside your toe edge is uphill.  On heel-side your heel edge is uphill.)  

In between turns your board is pointed downhill, and this is the only time in skidded turns you can choose either edge.

 This rider went to his downhill edge right after his body rotated. Thanks for coming to my shred-talk.
[deleted]
Nah ive been lazy at those speeds lol, you dont just catch an edge like that if you know what youre doing.
He's in the "this is the stance they taught me to get into 2hrs ago during my 1st real lesson" stance.
>I don‚Äôt think this was a skill issue at all tbh. They just intentionally seem to be trying to flat base it for some reason lmao.

100% skill issue, there is no reason to ever ride flat on a hill, especially while turning

Thats the shit you do when youre first learning, i literally did this exact thing on day 1 20y ago, i picked it up quickly, got cocky, wasnt on edge and rode flat around a turn and fell in exactly the same way and broke 2 ribs lol

Flat as fuck, big mistake, and rookie mistake
[deleted]
10 minus 4 is 6
By the looks of it, he might have two.
Ya and not while you‚Äôre going 40mph
Yeah man. People in here take mistakes way too seriously. Yall think he meant to do this?
Fr. Honestly it was never even that painful to do it because when you're hauling ass you actually lose a lot of the impact to the slide. Slamming on snow is not like slamming on pavement. Sliding on snow is a lot like when a skater rolls after slamming off a drop
The snowboarder went head first into a tree well. The guy saving him sees that so knows not to literally dive in head first after him. Basically the dude is stuck in ten feet of snow upside down with the board stillstrapped making it impossible for him to wiggle up and out. Bad situation and people die every year from suffocating
You know what else is stupid? Full sending without knowing how to control the board on a green run where you could smack a kid.

This could end with a kid paralyzed. At least backcountry solo only hurts the rider himself.
he wasn't solo according to description. ya know somebody's gonna be in the back of the group, and they're not crawling down the mountain constantly making sure they can see every person they came with
IIRC he wasn't solo. he was the tail in a group of 3 or 4 or something like that but still super lucky the skiier caught him. part of the reason i think maintaining vlos of your buddies is so important in tree runs in the backcountry.
Not as stupid as riding like the inexperienced guy in the video

Edit: whoops!! My brain skipped over the solo part - I also disagree with my above statement! Solo is crazy
The only thing? Not the potential TBI or taking someone out on the slope regardless of the t-bar?
Not to mention balling himself up so not actually moving his center of balance how he was thinking he was. Trying to look steezy close to the ground without knowing how that actually works.
More specifically, his front foot turned toe, but his back foot maintained flat, or even went heel. Like he was doing torsional twist, which is suicide for this speed and line.


Correct me if I'm wrong.
Yup, 100% accurate across the board

Bad form, bad position, too fast for the skill level, flat and no edge control all in one beautiful 6 second clip of "everything you shouldnt do" lol.....

I believe every single one of us has done exactly this at least once, or supermanned down the hill from a toe catch

I had this exact crash for all the same exact same reasons on day 1 of snowboarding 20y ago, like, im going to send this clip to my friend that taught me that day like "look familiar" lol

Picture perfect case of Day 1-3 "I got this shit" cockiness
That's a 'smiggin holes' blue mate :p
I think when learning for the first time and still getting the hang of it most people will catch their back edge and have a little slam at least once, but not while going so stupidly fast. Definitely teaches you a lesson is board control either way
He learnt the hard way going full pelt, fucking sucks and hopefully he won't go at this speed again until he has sorted out his technique
And everybody commenting like it‚Äôs real or sumn
Oh yea, I caught some a few weeks ago and just rode it out.
Chick's dig scars
That looks like it was nasty
Oof! Sorry this happened to you. Amazing how conditions can change drastically over night. Maybe a good general rule for snowboarding (and skiing) is to treat the first run on any given trail, as a slower test run, even if you were on the same one yesterday.
![gif](giphy|RG3lm5VlrbDV7YNana)
Your wife sounds awesome
Yeah but at speed you are constantly focused on not catching an edge. Hyper aware of which edge I am supposed to be on above 40 mph.
yeah, definitely beginner. Focus on his board again. Dude tried to turn toe side without lifting/angling his board, like, at all, to go on edge
[deleted]
I'm far from being an expert, I can comfortably ride blues. But to me it looks like this dude really did a very newbie move. He tried a sudden turn to his toe side at this speed, while crouching! He didn't catch an edge, he sabotaged himself..
I mean I don't know if you're being facetious or just dumb but you will go significantly faster on an edge than you will on the base. Friction be like that
Sliding flat is a bit trickier but a great deal quicker. I have no idea why all these other guys are telling you otherwise.
Pretty much. Your edges are faster and allow you to turn. If you want to straightline runs, go ski. Snowboarding isn't about speed.
Correct
They didn't catch - my toes pushed my board off the snow so I didn't have an edge, so I fell forwards over my toes - then somehow ended up sliding downhill on my back, and due to the speed, when my heel edge caught in whilst I was down, it catapulted me forward like this person.¬†


In 16 years of riding, this experience of having my toe edge disappear has happened to me just this once, and it was on this narrow board.
So two others think he was trying to turn. Sounds like you and me think he was letting his board slip out without realizing it. I think we're right.


Moral of story, keep shoulders aligned with board!
It's funny because I cannot ride base at all. My dyslexia throws me off on which edge to pick back up on and I almost always wipe out.  This winter was the first time I could get on base(to make a small jump goofing around) and pick the edge I actually want coming off base.
I‚Äôm not saying I would have tried to turn like that,  just saying even someone pretty good sometimes catches an edge.
I mean catch an edge hard like this. Idk tho maybe I was lucky.
idk i guess the video didn't look that egregious to me. i have fallen similarly many times for sure.. and it doesn't look injurious either, he wasn't around obstacles or people. just looks like a relatively normal fuck up imo
How she goes sometimes
Same, code word for let‚Äôs go get some beers and strap off for the day is ‚ÄúTwo more.‚Äù but only go once!

Im not a very superstitious person but last runs are a no go for me.
My solution to that is to always make the last run a cruising one. I like to do some soft zigzags and take in the views, appreciating the atmosphere
"Two more, skip the last"
Not at all.  limp dicks and limp wrists.  Cardio is completely tanked there is no good part of alcohol.  If you think so you‚Äôre delusional
yea that's true i was just pointing that out because i was bombing some hills trying to get a top speed and i struggled to break 40 haha. going a decent bit faster than this for sure
Not quite. With true carving, you can face uphill momentarily while on your heel edge.
Is it true for goofy riders as well?
This guy sciences.
[deleted]
Bro yur not even reading what I wrote right.  We talking different things.  You gonna argue with everyone on this thread that said the same thing I did?  Yur shit is nonsense to me.
I‚Äôve seen many sick riders go from riding on edges to bombing it flat based down the fall line, for fun. Many many times. 

I was assuming that‚Äôs what this dude was doing (and was lazily doing it). But on second watch, I noticed he wasn‚Äôt crouched / bent in the position I thought he was ([aka in a ‚Äúperformance‚Äù stance for duck footed riders like this.](https://youtu.be/FPhc5VMs05k?si=uHqCuTLACzzzm07e)
The giveaway for me and honestly the reason this happened is his weight distribution. Dudes chilling on his back foot down a hill. 

Definitely skill issue.
lol. I‚Äôve seen so many riders (actual ripping riders) bombing flat based for the fuck of it mid run (I always assumed they were just practicing their balance and balls?!). Also, you won‚Äôt catch an edge if you are going down the fall line. 

Regardless, I‚Äôm never flat based because I‚Äôm not an idiot.
Glad to see reddit is getting an accurate reputation
Carving should be a prerequisite to flat basing it.
I have definitely caught an edge flying when I was younger, more than once. Guess I'm just a hard learner lol
You clearly were not a reckless enough child. For me the name of the game was to tuck and bomb as hard as possible. We even had a GPS speedometer to see how fast we could hit the fast parts.
There is no reason to go that fast if you are very much still learning. You‚Äôre a danger to yourself and everyone else on the slopes.
Yeah should have said also not though!!
You know what else is stupid? This guy lost a friend shortly before this incident just like that, difference is, his friends wasn't as lucky as he was. And he is a local as well.
hard disagree. way stupider to go backcountry solo (without some ***solid*** prep). way more risky overall.
Good point, I‚Äôm still quite new to snowboarding but skied for many years. I know the concept of catching an edge all too well, but after reading your comment it‚Äôs so clear he wasn‚Äôt shifting his weight in a conscious way
Pretty sure I‚Äôve done this a good few times while learning! Maybe not going as fast but it sure felt like it with the pain that ensued!
Just a slightly different shade of white. Sometimes it's whiter, sometimes it's less. Sometimes it's the consistency.
Glory lasts forever

Cute boy‚Äôs love scars
It was so cold out I didn‚Äôt even know it happened. I got to the gondy and could feel blood pooling in my boot. I pulled up my pants and all friend freaked the fuck out.
Going fast is just too much fun.
![gif](giphy|lX22d3irD6CPK)
Been together 24 years she‚Äôs definitely a keeper.
100% agree. I usually catch an edge when hardly moving 5mph on my way to the lift line when I'm paying 0 attention to what my board is doing
Did the guy i the video try and do a turn in his mind that he was going way too slow for in real life?  I‚Äôm super novice and can‚Äôt tell


Thx
Bunny hill level this guys a danger to bomb this fast
This dude didn't fall cus he wasn't riding edges when bombing, He just sucks.


You can see¬† him try being on toe edge a second before he falls he's just a total noob going way over his skill level


¬†I've bombed at 50mph 100s of times and am not on an edge, maybe a tiny bit? But basically I'm just weight forward. I don't feel at risk of falling from edge catching at all

I believe this is incorrect, at least based on what my instructors have told me - Flat base is faster (while also more being more perilous). The more surface area of your board in contact with the snow, the faster your board will go. Something to do with hydrodynamics, but don't quote me, not a scientist
Then why don‚Äôt we wax our edges?
Chill brother. We agree, you don't need to be on edge to bomb.


Yes you can go faster on edge. But you can still hit 100 kmh bombing flat¬†
Confidently incorrect
Each to his own, but I strongly disagree with this. Edges certainly aren‚Äôt faster, and an experienced boarder isn‚Äôt going to have too much trouble riding flat. Sure, skiing is going to be quicker, but that doesn‚Äôt mean snowboarding has to be all about gentle carving turns.
[deleted]
Who made you king and let you decide what a sport is "about." I'm a snowboarder who likes to focus on speed, carving out perfect turns and hitting the park doesn't interest me at all.
It totally slides away from him without him naturally knowing to be on edge. You can see him reach with arms like someone on a box trying to stop a spin.
[deleted]
IMHO it's probably subconsciously related to fatigue which is why I tend to call it earlier as I get older rather than milking every last drop out of the day (unless conditions are all-time, in which case you're falling on pillows)
It looks real bad to me. Guy‚Äôs flat based and has no clue he‚Äôs rotating until the edge hits. 

It looks to my eye like a guy who would be going slow on a green, then the board spins a little in a way they don‚Äôt know how to control. But they took that to 30mph‚Ä¶
Oh really ? You had many falls like this ? At this speed?
To me at least, rotating like that without engaging an edge shows a lack of experience, but I 100% agree with you that this going to happen just saying it makes more sense to me to take falls like this at half this speed so you can learn to avoid them when you are going this fast.
2 more, skip the last
Yep, I never call last run or one more, gotta say two minus one or something like that.  Friend broke his wrist on a last run after I called it, never saying it again‚Ä¶
Yuuuuup! I do the same shit. Feel that fatigue and slop coming into your riding? Time for the air quotes and "two more runs?" Then beers and NO broken bones.
Yep. I call it a last run and I make it very very easy. Easiest route down just cruising. Won‚Äôt go over like 25 mph.
There‚Äôs diminishing returns after a certain point
The good part is only after the first drink, when you have the confidence to pick up moms at the apr√®s.
I don‚Äôt drink for a lot of reasons- but this is dead on in my book-
I hit 42 the other night and I was definitely going a lot faster than this guy. That was just about how fast I was willing to go at night and not being able to see all of the fluctuations in the snow
He‚Äôs probably going high 20s, low 30s
Yes
[deleted]
If you're bombing it flat you still know to switch to an edge if things get dicky, this is lack of skill by the rider
Y‚Äôall.. you can ride flat base if you can maintain good body position. Pure skill issue. Easily bomb-able flat base there.
Ya not when you barely know how to ride
The tree well guy I assume?
Right on!

My worst ski falls are on bunny slopes when I‚Äôm not paying attention too lol. Totally focused on more advanced grades and speeds
He is pretty bent at the waist.  He should be bending at the knees. 

I‚Äôm going with he is a beginner going quite quick and not entirely sure what he should be doing. 

The benefit of snowboarding is bad technique is self correcting.
More surface area = faster speed.
>The more surface area of your board in contact with the snow, the faster your board will go

Yeah your instructor knows nothing about friction, that's why he snowboards and isn't a physicist
So are you dumb or are you just asking a dumb question?
I'm pretty sure you can go faster flat versus on an edge. Far less stable though.
So you are being facetious

Next time try saying nothing
Confidently, most of this sub are noobs who don't even ride. You're probably one of them
Edges are faster because there's less surface area that contacts the snow and thus less friction.
If you're ignorant about the realities of the two sports, sure. Otherwise, go ski.
You're a skier in denial.
Falls like this at this speed, at least a few. Similar falls at a slightly lower speed, many.
This is the way. 2 skip.
I always say, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see how we feel back at the lodge‚Äù lol
2 more. We all know that means head to the truck.
Dude is casually trying to kill people with a reddit comment. dumb advice my ass
An edge of course meaning both feet moving to the same side, rather than just one. So important!
It‚Äôs the skiers ‚õ∑Ô∏è fault tho, it‚Äôs so obvious
Who is downvoting me ?
Yup 100%
I caught an edge on a cat track, that one hurt.
Surface area doesn‚Äôt affect friction. While more surface will mean more contact, it also means the weight is more distributed and the force between the two objects will remain the same. What does affect friction is the roughness of the material in contact with another object or the ground in this instance. So going faster on an edge or riding flat is really determined by two things:
1. If a board is properly waxed and maintained then the flat surface is often smoother than the metal edge, but marginally so

and more importantly 

2. The skill of the rider as riding flat you will have much less stability and not feel comfortable reaching a maximum velocity because you‚Äôre more likely to eat it.
Well if you‚Äôre going to make dumb statements. Common sense be like that
lol damn, like where was he being facetious and do you know what that word means sir ?
Don‚Äôt be mad you can‚Äôt flat base ya fuckin jerry
Except I wasn't wrong. If you're actually riding down the fall line and holding an edge, riding your rails is significantly faster. If you start skidding, you're obviously gonna slow down

Ride a cat track flat vs on your edge and it'll be very obvious
He edited his comment
Lol, I'd ride circles around you
ü§£ yeah definitely Jerry. Definitely
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Bernie came to Plainfield today
One of the local residents who lived at the (now destroyed) ‚ÄúHeartbreak Hotel‚Äù lit up as he approached her.
Bernie came to check out positive pie in montpilier when we opened back up. Love the man, feel the burn!
https://preview.redd.it/lwznaedsk7cd1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4541d3e319c71140d091dc7c11b5759b70d2be41

Low key just talking to home owners.  Wouldn‚Äôt have known him from anyone else if it wasn‚Äôt for the two Vermont Public staffers running around like he was important.
He was sitting two rows in front of me on my flight home from DC last night, boarded right behind me. Gotta love him flying commercial and dealing with his own bags.
A class act, Bernie.
I was literally standing next to those salad bowls putting together meals for people who were on the other side of the river and somehow completely missed him being there. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (I did hear he was there, just didn‚Äôt see him‚Ä¶)
Bernie for President... üò≠
Always the man of the people.
I love that we can all just spot him being his Vermonty self and walking around. Saw him on church street in Burlington a few years ago with an aide and they were just chatting with their leftover lunch. Just such a normal dude
If you had knelt to take that picture it would have been 100x more epic. lol

I love the man. One of the very few honest and consistent politicians in my lifetime.
Certainties in life:

Rain is wet

You can‚Äôt avoid death and taxes

Bernie always was and always will be a man of and for the people
Look at those melons!
Welch showed up earlier, too.
I remember the first time I met the guy. My father had cornered him in the Putney general store back in the 90‚Äôs when I was little and was haranguing him on some bit of policy and Bernie just stood there and listened to my father and engaged with him man to man, not powerful political rep to peasant or something. That doesn‚Äôt even begin to get into how well he treated the Vermont troops at the capitol after Jan6. Treated them like equals and went out of his way to help them with whatever they needed (my brother deployed down there) 


I don‚Äôt agree with some of his takes but the man is  straight up honest and cares deeply about this state. We will be so much the poorer when time catches up with him. 


Now bring it on maga trolls. Your tears and cope responses sustain me.
Good.  Glad he was there to see first hand and offer empathy and support.
Love me some Bernie!  What a mensch!
Me at my job; ‚ÄòHey there! Picking up? Last name-OH F**- hi sir let me get that for you..‚Äô 

Told him how I won a reading competition in elementary school and won a trip to go bowling with him. Obv didn‚Äôt remember *me* but knew it was *insert my school* :‚Äô) sweet man, has remembered my name and asked for me when he‚Äôs came into my establishment ever since :‚Äô)
[removed]
How big of him
He should learn to stand up straight.
i love bernie so much
Our king
Did you ask Bernie what he did with all the Veterans money in Vermont - we are still waiting from 2012
Bernie spoke at my high school in Summit, IL (just west of Chicago) in 2016 & I worked on his campaign that year & in 2020. News¬† confirmed what I always suspected: DNC railroaded Bernie in 2020 because the Wall Street donors didn't like his policies. To be fair, I'm a little down on Bernie ATM because he said what Isn't-real is doing to Palestinians isn't a genocide. Anyway, in a trip to Vermont this week, love this state.¬†
Commie!
That sounds like such a special moment. It's amazing to see local leaders connecting with the community like that. I remember when I met a politician at a local event, and it really made me feel more connected to the issues affecting us. It‚Äôs great to see those moments of joy and hope in our communities. Thanks for sharing this experience. It‚Äôs inspiring to hear about the positive energy around us.
I like Bernie quite a bit, but struggle to find where he and Leahy have been effective. Vermont education is not so good and people, almost everyone I at least, know really struggle.
Can we just write him in? If everyone writes him in that would be awesome üëçüòé
[removed]
Tell him it‚Äôs time to retire
Is he using any of his millions of dollars to help? Or was it just for support/press?¬†
I feel  sorry  for Plainfield
Gross
Not sure why people like Bernie. He hasn‚Äôt really done anything to help this state out in the 1000 years he‚Äôs been in politics. If he really wanted to help, he‚Äôd talk to these a-holes raising our taxes by 14% this year and nearly 30% next year even though people can barely afford food
Man had a USSR flag in his office when he was mayor of Burlington, took his honey moon to USSR as well and were cheering on communism now. Traitors to this country.
You sure it wasn't just a crotchy old man? Cuz that's what it looks like
Commie‚Äî‚Äî
Thats Bernie in a nutshell
My friends dad once spent a 6hr flight next to him and they talked the entire time
Hah! Had the same thing happen to me coming back from Detroit once. I watched the little air nozzle blow his white hair around for a few minutes.
man of honor
We could have had him for 2 terms, but no, we can‚Äôt have nice things
Huge regret for me is not getting pictures with him when he showed up for the Strolling of the Heifers and Brattleboro‚Äôs Fourth of July parades.
Indeed it is. You can see videos from Vermont Public filmed yesterday of him and Welch walking Plainfield. I did not see Welch, but he was in town at some point.
Cue the flatlander‚Ä¶ Bernie is around everywhere here‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt crazy to see him around or take a selfie with him. I have one with him from 12 years ago..
Well that‚Äôs because what you‚Äôre seeing problems with and what you‚Äôre mentioning is the responsibility of a state senator and legislature, not our DC reps.
Yeah don't do that.  Normally I would support that. But the opposing party is pretty scary.

Good point, he might lose a tough race if he doesn‚Äôt pander.

/s Since you must be brand new.
Yeah he probably will do something like that. As an example a few years ago his inauguration meme photo merch raised $1.8 million for various charities. He along side other Vermont‚Äôs reps were also very involved with ensuring FEMA funding/ action was expedited after last years flood. He‚Äôs very good at giving back where he can and is in touch with needs of Vermonters whether those Vermonters want to realize that or not.  No politician can be perfect, but out of all politicians he‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve had, by far, the least problem voting for.
He pays taxes and is willing to pay more in taxes. What is your point?
He's probably not the wealthiest person in that picture
A quick google would tell you how wrong you are. 

Bernie is also not in charge of state politics, if you want that to change vote for different state reps and govs. He fights for us at the national level.
You realize he was exploring a relationship as a sister city to burlington in a time when the us was attempting to expand its relationship with the Soviet union and not on his honeymoon right?
ZOMG Communism Socialism Marxism Stalinism Leninism Bolshevism Menshevikism!
Cool! Now do Trump!
Mother fucker like 5 or 6 US republican congressmen went to bend the knee to Putin on July fucking 4th not a few years ago. Fucking please.
And he was in Plainfield today surveying the damage, talking to the people there and *will* take their stories and needs to DC and is in a position to help get VT much needed $$$ from the federal government to help people clean up and rebuild. So you can be hung up on the Cold War (seriously, the fucking Cold War!!) all you want, but the guy works at helping Vermonters and that is his job right now.¬†
Wait, do we pledge allegiance to our capitalist ruling class now?
You would be LUCKY to become old enough to be a 'crotchety old man'

https://time.com/5422714/what-is-democratic-socialism/
Your friends dad is so fucking lucky. I wish I could listen to Bernie discuss things in that setting
A real mensch!
I truly believe he would have beat Trump in 2016. The DNC really screwed him and worked to make sure Hilarie got the nomination

*edit* The DNC really screwed all of us, the country and arguably the world.
100% agree. He is what a senator should be like. He‚Äôs not wealthy and he is with the people. He‚Äôs popular but not a pompous baboon to people.
That‚Äôs because both the DNC and GOP are in-run by the neocon imperialists‚Ä¶
That fema funding were 2/3s went to admin costs? He‚Äôs not that good at giving back if he has amassed more wealth then he will ever be able to use or need. I love the idea of Bernie but the reality is he is just another lifelong millionaire politician. Is there a group collectively that is more to blame for where we are currently at?¬†
That he doesn‚Äôt really give a shit anymore. He shot his shot and now he is part of the establishment.¬†
I count ten. Which one or ones do you think are wealthier?¬†
It‚Äôs the end of the world as we know it‚Ä¶
This comment is lightning in a bottle, you made my weekend
Cool and those congressmen should be thrown out of office and out of politics just like Bernie.
Why do you feel the need to lie?
My grandparents are dead.   Even if they weren't, they should have been disqualified from such an important position. 

What's the percentage of Congress that has the "walking farts"?
Oh absolutely he would won. His policies were the antidote to all the factors that are driving the rise in the far right. The pickle we‚Äôre in now with Biden is a direct result of Democrats rejecting Bernie and his policies. I‚Äôll vote for Biden‚Äôs dead corpse to stop Trump, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm happy with Democrats for putting us in this position.
That‚Äôs because they are in the pockets of the imperialist neocons, Hilary is arguably a neocon, as is her husband, and other democrats like Joe Biden, Victoria Nuland, etc... They may claim she isn‚Äôt/they aren‚Äôt, but judging by her track record of voting yes for wars and pushing American imperial hegemony she definitely is‚Ä¶ same with Biden, he appointed Victoria Nuland as the acting deputy Secretary of State. The 2014 coup in Ukraine is her fault, where she used literal Nazi‚Äôs (Right Sector/Svaboda, C14) to overthrow Ukraine‚Äôs government. Look up the ‚ÄúF the EU‚Äù phone call leak between her and Geoffrey Piatt‚Ä¶ neocons used to be republicans. Not anymore‚Ä¶
Did you just say Bernie Sanders was not wealthy?
disagree, Bernie only appears for Vermonters when it‚Äôs convenient for him.  he‚Äôs as bad as all the others.
But Russia is capitalist now so it's ok lol
Oh the only lying involved in that scenario is their lame ass cover story of why the fuck they were in Moscow on the 4th of fucking July.
He could've won with the popular vote, but I think that the electoral college would have prevented him from getting in.
Sure he has some money. A quick google says net worth of ~$3M, which is honestly not all that much these days. He wrote a book and it sold well. He has the net worth of a reasonably successful doctor, or other skilled professional. Literally orders of magnitude less than the billionaires he rails about, and he made it through his own work, not leeching off others. 

Bernie achieved the American dream of moderate success that gives him a comfortable life by dedicating his life‚Äôs work to helping the rest of us. Nobody should begrudge him for that.
Compared to many career politicians, no. He really only got significant wealth after he wrote a book
He is fairly wealthy, but who are you voting for? Because a lot of people like to complain about bernies 3m. When meanwhile they vote for Trump. Or other political dynasties. 

Truth Is compared to most politicians he isn't that wealthy. But you do have to have some wealth to be a national level politician. Personally I think this is something we should change and I don't necessarily think Bernie would be against that.
What a remarkably dumb thing to type out and hit send on
Sure if you compare him the the big dogs in politics, however he is still in the 1%. However the comment I replied to said "He's not wealthy" that is not true.
Honestly I'm voting for Trump because I believe he is better for America and for our economy. We need to get back to trying to become more self sufficient as a country.
just speaking from experience.  
glad that hasn‚Äôt been yours.
What do you think the 1% is? I didn't know so I looked, Bernie has a net worth of 3 million: https://www.thestreet.com/lifestyle/bernie-sanders-net-worth-14678955

And the 1% appears to be 33 million:
https://www.bankrate.com/investing/income-wealth-top-1-percent/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20second%20quarter,of%20more%20than%20%241.52%20billion.

Disclaimer: I took the first two websites to give me relatively recent numbers for both, you may find other sources
I mean, compared to pretty much every other Senator, he‚Äôs downright poor.
He‚Äôs literally the poorest member of the senate and he does not come from generational wealth, so don‚Äôt be a troll.
not even close to the 1%.  look up the 1% to see how much money those people actually have. the numbers are staggering.
You actually need almost $6M to get to the 1%
A /net worth/ of $3m at his age is ‚Ä¶ not really "wealthy", no.

If Trump kicks out all the undocumented immigrants like he says he will, construction and farming costs will go through the roof, and inflation will be much much worse.
[deleted]
Bernie is in fact the poorest member of the Senate.
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/bernie-sanders-taxes.html
If you make $652,657 a year you qualify for the 1%, idk where you got your stats from

It has changed my bad,

*According to the Economic Policy Institute, the average annual wage of the top 1% was $819,324 as of 2021*
I enjoyed it when things were more affordable and America was getting it's own oil
Make a good faith effort to follow [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette).
I made $50k per year and I didn't get more than $5 in my paycheck from Trump's tax "cut."  It was only a cut if you make more than $80k.  I really tried to figure out my effective tax rate, not just withholding, calculated the whole thing out and there was honestly almost no savings.  Certainly not $100.   If a 3% tax cut saved you $100, you would have to make $4000 per pay check, which every two weeks is only like $100k, but that's ASSUMING you don't get any back, because if you do, you have to subtract to get your actual effective tax rate.  That's why mine was almost zero.
The context was wealth, not income. I don't know what Bernie's annual income is.
Making close to 1 mil annual I think it takes almost no time to save up 6 mil
Like it did under Obama. If only some jackass from NY hadn't fueled white fragility with some birth certificate nonsense, we might have had an intact pandemic task force, a flatter curve, and less dramatic inflation.
Things got way more expensive under Trump and continued (probably still continue) to get more expensive as a result of his administration‚Äôs policies and legislation enacted during his term as the worst president ever. 

You remember what happened to the housing market because interest rates were held artificially low?

You remember how he ‚Äúsaved American oil companies‚Äù by ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù Russia and OPEC to cut production and boost global oil prices?

You remember the price increases we saw on tons of consumer goods as a result of tariffs on Chinese imports?

You‚Äôve been falsely convinced that Trump is good for the American economy. He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs good for the ultra rich. Not regular people. Like you. 

He‚Äôs a fraudster and a sleaze.
Nonsense.  We produce more crude oil than any other country.  We import more than we export, but that's because "Most U.S. crude oil imports take place when it is more profitable for U.S. refiners to process discounted heavier grades because those refineries have already invested in the additional complexity required to refine them."

Our dependence on oil is sickening & so are the humongous profits that greedy oil companies make.  How about investing some of their profits into renewables or figuring out what to do with all the plastics they contribute towards.  Just typing this pisses me off.  Complain to corporations, currently luxuriating in profits, about increased prices run-amok.

Minimum 7 years years without expenses, so over 10 years?

Almost no time...
I wasn't a fan of Obama, especially when he droned bombed an American citizen and blamed the father of the child instead of taking responsibility for killing an American child. 

However Obama would have been better than Biden. If Obama was in office he probably would've done the same thing as Biden in terms of trying to stop drilling, fracking, etc on American soil. 

The pandemic was an issue because the government used fear porn to try and scare everyone. It's pretty evident that covid was nowhere near as bad as they first claimed. If states didn't shut down and allowed people to work and do what they needed we would be in a better position. 

Inflation is do to Biden and his policies not Trump.
That checks out, thanks üòä
If you got a confederate flag on your truck we need to have words.
Muh heritage? Fuck boy, you born on the other side. 

I'm sick to death of all these pathetic plastic pavement princesses rolling around with enemy insignia. 

Please stop and have a word, or two.

If I had to choose two, it would be fuck, and you.
This post has broken r/vermont containment, and now we're getting an influx of random trolls, shit-stirrers, and the absolute dregs of neo-nazis and fascists of reddit; as such, I'm locking the post.

Agree! For people who are really into their heritage, they should fly the flag of the Vermont Republic (1777-1791). Much cooler than the Confederate flag anyway. It looks like stoned Betsy Ross designed it lol. I especially like the completely random star positions.
I agree.

Why the fuck would someone fly that flag in Vermont of all fucking places?

We were part of the underground railroad, fought confederate soldiers, and countless other things.

Also - the union won! Fuck off with that Confederate flag bullshit.
I saw this hot mess parked in front of the St. J post office once, and I thought it was the perfect metaphor:  an ideology that can't stand on its own two feet.  

https://preview.redd.it/5nv3hg9ijx1d1.jpeg?width=4128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b665f69d59ab38e29811d87ffb3cdce4143619cc
Well, it's easier to identify the clowns when they wear their suits. So you do have that.
I usually yell out my window "YOU GUYS LOST!"
The one thing I find odd in VT lately are all the Confederate flags I see. Isn't that offensive to people from here as there are many cemeteries around full of dead union soldiers from here? 

I saw one guy with one on his truck AND a support the troops sticker as well as a sticker for each military branch in the US!
Isn't that a huge contradiction?
*"Muh heritage..."* 

Yeah Cletus, "your heritage" lasted less than four years and ended 159 years ago. You also have precisely zero knowledge of any ancestors, 8 generations ago, that were actually involved in the fracas on either side. **-_-**
You really don't need to keep reporting this ‚Ä¶ it's staying up.

Fuck the Confederacy, fuck the traitor flag, fuck the "lost cause" bullshit. The only "cause" being fought for was white supremacy and the ownership of human beings, and that is an abhorrent thing to celebrate and fight for.
I'm from the South. The Confederate flag is embarrassing to me. The Civil War happened because half of America wanted to build its economy on the backs of enslaved humans. That's not heritage to be proud of.
Saw a confederate flag on a truck in a social security office parking lot in Vermont. Talk about not getting it.
In a way, I‚Äôm fine with it because I‚Äôd rather know upfront to steer clear of that person. I don‚Äôt engage with these people, but if you feel safe doing so, by all means.
A boy I went to high school with got it tattooed on his chest. He was born and raised here. What an embarrassment.
The Civil War was about slavery.  Every single declaration from every state that joined the Confederacy mentions slavery in the first paragraph.  Look up the historical documents. States rights, my ass.  That pathetic flag is the biggest participation trophy this country has ever seen.  Traitors.
Nice of them to identify themselves. Speaking of traitor flags, I tried to get some body work done on vehicles at a local shop. They kept putting me off for a couple years, saying things like "no openings, try us again in a month."

I pass by regularly and always see different cars/trucks. Meanwhile, I talk to someone at the hardware store who tells me about the nice work on their Subie. Just a day after a fender bender, their car was in there getting fixed. Hmms, I have to wonder if my Asian eyes inherited from my beautiful mom, rest in peace, are somehow the issue?

So I'm biking past this body shop soon after and saw my likely answer.  Parked proudly out front, parallel to the road was a General Lee-themed hotrod with the traitor flag on the door panels. Fresh wrapped, it sat out there a few days advertising their custom services. If the shop just flew that flag it could have saved me some time and frustration.
I am with you‚Äîanyone wearing, waving or carrying a confederate flag can go straight into the garbage can.
I grew up in the south and seeing this in VT makes me scratch my head.

I remember the first time we went to visit my parents, who had just moved to Mississippi. The next door neighbor had a yellow school bus on blocks in the front yard - yes, with one of those stupid flags proudly displayed flying from the rear of a non-functional bus from a non-functional school system. 

Why would anyone in Vermont want to be on team Mississippi??
Of all the Union states, Vermont lost the highest percentage of its population in the war. Flying the traitor flag here, of all places, is vile and beyond disrespectful. It is like taking a shit on Arlington Cemetery. I wonder if we could get a law passed banning the display of the traitor flag on public property in Vermont?
No different than flying the swastika in front of a synagogue. Sure, it‚Äôs your constitutional right, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt despise your ideology.
When I last visited Vermont (drove across the country from NW Arkansas) I was surprised at how many traitor flags I saw in upstate NY and all over Vermont. I hate seeing it here in Arkansas (where it is displayed on approximately 10% of homes), and I hated seeing it in Vermont too. I share in your disgust.

  
Sadly, the flag is a form of white-racist-bigoted pride, and that sentiment seems to be getting worse in our country.
I flew and wore the confederate flag when I was in middle school, I feel embarrassed knowing I supported it now. Don‚Äôt even remember why I did, bad family influence or something
We're the literal origin place of the term yankee. If you have a rebel rag than there's literally no other explanation than you're a racist. Vermont's had it's problems with bigotry but neo-confederate shit is especially egregious.
When I was in high school I was dumb enough to believe the whole "heritage not hate" thing and somewhere out there, my name on a petition to keep the Confederate flag from being banned at school. God, I was a moron. Now that my brain is fully developed, it's obvious that it's a diet-swastika these days but doesn't get the same reaction. White supremacists don't even try to hide their views
The other day I saw a dude in a sleeveless shirt with a tattoo on his upper arm that was a blended confederate and US flag draped from a staff, topped by a deer skull (Central VT). I just had to shake my head. Of course as George Santayana wrote ‚ÄòThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.‚Äô What that means to me in this context is that those of us who are anti-racist are in a war‚Äîrhetorical/intellectual at the moment‚Äîto remind the racists in our midst that their ideas are not welcome here.

still is in 2024.
I saw multiple Confederate flags on houses up around the Jay Peak area. My wife is from VT, but I‚Äôm from NC and we were visiting and it blew my mind that even in the brave little state there are confederate sympathizers that I‚Äôm sadly desensitized to seeing here down south. In NC, there is quite literally a 50ftx30ft Confederate flag that flies over I-40 on the way to Asheville. Disgusts me.
I once knew a guy who had one on his wall. He was born and raised in Vermont. Never left the state even. I asked him why he had it. His response? 

‚ÄúI like the way it looks‚Äù 
ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®ü§®
It‚Äôs the loser flag. They lost. Whoever waves it likes waving flags of losers
These are people who will claim to be patriotic and love America, but literally fly the flag of people who tried to separate themselves from the country.

The math doesn‚Äôt math. Stupid does what stupid will, I suppose.
As a person from the deep south 

A: fuck these whiny idiots who don't know the difference between heritage and propaganda.

B: if you fly a rectangular battle flag of northern Virginia, you are simply saying your heritage is from the anti civil rights era when stupid racists bought reproduction flags to scare black people (the original flag was a square)

C: Southern states are by in large held captive by gerrymandering, boomers and silent generation racists who want things to go back to the way they were i.e. lead paint and lynchings. The overwhelming majority of young people are not in favor of racist policy or practice. It's the loud mouth idiots you hear, not the normal people who keep their mouths shut.

D: Please talk to these idiots and say this shit to their face, tell them they don't know their own history, their stupid little factory farms based on one of the worst ideas a human ever thought of failed over a century ago, and they are a disappointment to their heritage by living near all those yankees. Their bark is so loud, but 99% of them have no bite. (Do be careful engaging a large group, mob mentality can do crazy things) 

E: Seriously, find them, point at them, and laugh at them. They are a disappointment to human decency and progress.
It‚Äôs even more confusing when you see them up here in Canada‚Ä¶
The south will rise again.......cause shit floats!
Your heritage? My heritage is burning anything a Confederate flag is attached to.
I started flying a union flag.

I grew up in a part of VT where you‚Äôd see this stuff.  Unfortunately seems to have spread. To me these people are the ones that had the Calvin pissing on Ford stickers or truck balls or whatever offensive, stupid thing they‚Äôd found at the store.

Maybe it‚Äôs naive but I never really took it as they knew and ascribed to the ideology. Perhaps had a general idea that it‚Äôs a symbol of the south and ‚Äúwhite pride‚Äù but not much more beyond that. I felt it‚Äôs more so that when regular minded people are like ‚Äúwhat the fuck do you have on your truck?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù They can then have a confrontation. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs wrong to confront them or to have an issue with it. It‚Äôs stupid. And ignorant. Just that it‚Äôs a intentional means to confrontation. These are the guys that punched me in the stomach on the playground. Dumb and potentially violent.
Fellas with that flag on your truck, I meant what I said, we need to have words. I'll meet you. You will be convinced. Anywhere in Bennington County.
I think most folks who have confederate flag stickers on their vehicles are ignorant about what it actually stands for because they think it‚Äôs just some symbolism of being redneck and country
I always found it funny that the side which claims to be the real patriots is also the side which openly supports the most notorious traitors in the nation's history. The cherry on top is when somebody thinks they are making a good point by pointing out that the conservative south called themselves democrats back then, as if it has anything to do with the modern parties and their names. The mental gymnastics and hypocrisy is insane.
‚ÄúMy heritage has a tradition of killing those who fly the confederate flag‚Äù
I‚Äôm y‚Äôall‚Äôs neighbor (originally from Boston). And I highly agree ‚Äî when I see this flag on trucks in western mass, Vermont or somewhere I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ dude, fuckin why?
They're just racist. That's really the long and short of it.
If I see a person with a confederate flag I think of them the same way I think of a person sporting a swastika or the hammer and sickle. 

I don‚Äôt hate you, but I don‚Äôt trust you and I don‚Äôt want to hang out with you.
The American swastika
I watched an older episode of Unsolved mysteries recently, think it was early 90‚Äôs based on fashion. Guy being interviewed had an enormous confederate flag in his wall that was not part of the story or acknowledged. At least we have come to a place where TV shows will find a less racist background for interviews, I guess?
Treason Flag*
The stars and bars is a treasonous rag
I don't have a problem with them supporting their heritage tbh. If they want to fly a flag saying they're irredeemably racist and an absolute fucking loser, so be it.
There were confederate sympathizers in union states.  Ain‚Äôt nothing new.  At least the enemy can be identified.
From what I know of Vermont it is one of the freest states in the Nation.  You do not have to have a permit to carry a firearm and are free to walk around in your birthday suit if it pleases you.

Try walking around in the nude in 90% of the other states and see where you wind up.  While 29 other states also do not require a license to carry a firearm (at the minute) Vermont was the first state to have constitutional carry.

What do they have to bitch about?
That flag has no business being flown anywhere really, but it especially confuses me when people do it in the northern union states. 

2 summers ago I drove across South Dakota twice. There was not a single time that I saw a Trump flag without an accompanying ‚ÄúStars and bars.‚Äù  Just sickening.
But....but....but..... Heritage!  Well, it's my heritage to burn your city to the ground as I march to the sea but you don't see me advertising that.
If they were celebrating their heritage they probably should use a flag that actually existed during the civil war.
Imagine driving around with an image of Benedict Arnold emblazoned on your vehicle or flying a flag with his face on it...yeah, you'd look fucking stupid.
People think VT is so open minded & liberal but they don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs really full people like this.  Confederate flag owners, racists, homophones & just a LOT of ignorance all around.  (I‚Äôm gay so I 100% know it‚Äôs true from very personal experience, all the time)
The Traitor-loser flag. The "I hate America" flag
I avoid Castleton for this reason. Only place in VT I‚Äôve ever seen confederate flags. I know it‚Äôs rural, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you are in the south.
I'm from Mississippi, and they're becoming a rarer and rarer sight there.  I'm so puzzled when I see them up north.  Like, especially if the person waving it around isn't from or connected to the south in any way.  In any case, it should be a white flag.  They surrendered.  I don't care about their heritage (of hate) or what they claim they were fighting for (states' rights to do *what*?), they are choosing to fly the flag of a traitorous movement that fought for slavery, and that lasted for a pathetically short time before surrendering and its cause going underground.   And wanna know who took up that cause and resisted integration and reconstruction?  The KKK.  If you fly the confederate flag and claim that heritage, you're boasting about what most 1800s racists would only do with bedsheets over their heads.  


Also, as a reminder, here are some things that managed to last longer than the confederacy:

- Ghostbusters Cereal

- The Microsoft Zune

- Doritos Locos Tacos 

- The Obama administration

- MySpace

- The War in Iraq and the War in Afghanistan

     - (racists sweating as they realize that the Taliban not only won their civil war, but is only a couple of years away from their *second* government outlasting the confederacy just like their first one did, and that the Taliban is literally just living their shitty theocratic fascist dreams) 

- Pokemon Go

- The MCU

- My phone number

- legal gay marriage in the US
I kinda like it.  You know straight away the type of person they are so you can avoid them without having to engage.  Plus it's fun to point and laugh at them.
Self-identify as a racist loser.
It annoys me more these people fly the Confederate Naval Jack rather than the battle flag they think they are.
Because American public and even private education is shiiiiiiiit
They want to piss people off - someone to rail against. They probably didn‚Äôt even become ‚Äúconfederate‚Äù til the 2016 election.
Us Vermonters can‚Äôt even make a case that it‚Äôs ‚Äúheritage‚Äù because we were nowhere close to being a confederate state. In fact, the only time we involved ourselves in the civil war was to fight AGAINST the confederacy. I think the reason why a lot of snowflake conservatives in our state fly their confederate flags is by means of being a rebuttal to BLM flags being flown. A ‚Äúyou be exclusive I‚Äôll be exclusive‚Äù type situation, even though if you rubbed two brain cells together and started a fire, you‚Äôd see that BLM isn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúonly Black Lives Matter‚Äù but rather ‚Äúour lives haven‚Äôt mattered as much as yours.‚Äù The reality is right in front of their faces but they just aren‚Äôt willing to see it.
But you don‚Äôt really. At some point you just need to not give af about other people
that and these ridiculous III stickers everywhere

some weird spartan cosplay or some shit?
Knew someone from Vermont who looked down on how backwards people in the South were. They held a BLM protest at their rural Vermont college and good ol boys showed up with Confederate flags on their trucks. Really eye opening experience for them.
Michigander here, and we see these the further you get from cities. 

My brother started using the flag to show that he identified as a 'rebel', independent and living by his own rules.

I told him that was a perfectly fine lifestyle, but he's using the flag of a **loser** who got told what to do by the North something fierce to showcase that he's independent. The math didn't add up, and on top of that, it makes people think he hates them.

He heard me out, thought momentarily, and then agreed and took the flag down. I didn't yell at him or anything; just used my rational voice and asked him to think for a minute.

Now, he just focuses on the Harley Davidson "I'm independent" message, and I'm fine with that.
I lived in Pittsburgh in an area that was predominantly Black and some a-hole would drive around with a HUGE confederate flag flowing in the wind. It absolutely blew my mind that someone had that kind of audacity. Also, the very definition of f*ck around and find out.
Live in Ga. they are the proudest losers in the history of man‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ except for Germans
I see a few on my normal commute, not just trucks but I'm pretty sure I've seen an SUV and car with a rebel rag front license plate. It's kinda nice when losers identify themselves from a distance. 

It would be cool to see more of these [bad](https://gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/13VT-4c_2062.jpg) [boys](https://gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Vermont-4c_2068.jpg) around instead.
Get one of those Calvin pissing stickers and casually put it above the flag.
Recently saw a sticker on a truck:

*PATRIOT!* in an edgy font over a confederate flag background. 

You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.
Go to the state fair in Rutland and they have all kinds of confederate flag stuff for sale.  Like wtf?
Losers
Read the Confederate Constitution, it says the quietly racist part out loud.
Ever go to rural New Hampshire? It‚Äôs the Deep South of the north
These types usually talk a good game about supporting the military and veterans, yet they disrespect the veterans buried in nearly every Vermont town that defended America in the Civil War.
They sure do love to wave their treason participation ribbons.
I had a fraternity brother who pinned a confederate flag in the hallway outside his room. And in hindsight, I really regret not putting a stop to that.

Idk why, but at 19, I don't think it properly registered what kind of statement he was making by doing that - I just thought it was weird and ignored it. And even in hindsight, my house wasn't a bunch of racists - we had a couple guys who were problematic out of like 90+, but to our shame, we didn't set them straight like we should have. We even had a couple of black brothers at the time. I don't think they felt like turning it into a big fight - but I can't imagine they felt good about it being posted in a  common area of the house they were living in.
[removed]
>Muh heritage?

Always makes me laugh because the confederacy existed for all of 4 years.
It was so common in Brattleboro during the 90s. Their team is the Rebels and a bunch of them would have Confederate flags and bumper stickers that said "Pride of the South."
I live in Franklin county and it‚Äôs everywhere. For a long time there was a house on Main Street in Enosburg that had a giant one, proudly displayed.
When you got Cs in High School and are punching the clock in your repetitive task wage slave job, it‚Äôs your symbol of rebellion against the system.   Same as a Trump sign on your lawn or a red MAGA hat.   Half the country got Cs in High School and have mind numbing repetitive task jobs.   It‚Äôs why populists get all those votes.  All the resentment.
Maybe their ancestors checked out a bank in St. Albans, looked around, liked what they saw and stayed?


/s, obviously.
The wording on this is spectacular lmao
They think they're owning the libs, but they're really just showing us that they're proud of losing.
If you fly that flag in Vermont, you are cowardly saying ‚ÄúI hate black people.‚Äù So yes, fuck you. Your ancestors also, btw, think you are a piece of shit. 

Looking at you, Route 11 outside Chester.
Make racists afraid again. You get rid of racists by letting them know their bullshit won't be tolerated. You get rid of them by letting them know there's consequences for being bigots. They may be toddlers having a temper tantrum to some of you but as an immigrant, as a queer woman, as a person of color, these people are deadly serious to me. I've had people like this lay hands on me and threaten to kill me multiple times. So yeah, the confede-nazis deserve no tolerance. They are not all talk, they just don't harm you because you aren't the object of their hatred.
I will openly smack the shit out of anyone i see flying that in Connecticut. Thems is fighting images. I‚Äôve had to rip them down a few times. People here get a little too comfy with their hate. My daughter is inspired too, she wanted to tear down peoples trump signs so I took her. Still not back up and they will only be for a few hours it‚Äôs right on our street. Hate isn‚Äôt allowed around here. We will fight you. And we‚Äôre stronger. Hate gets stomped out we don‚Äôt have discussions. We don‚Äôt respect your hate. We just overpower it and dominate you. This is why Connecticut is such a diverse and amazing place. Come walk downtown New Haven you‚Äôve never seen anything like it where you‚Äôre from. We don‚Äôt have big problems with racism and hate here, because we don‚Äôt allow it. We all stomp it out in our own way. Magnet schools are big here. We integrate as kids. My friends were of all races. We never learned to hate. So when we see it, we treat it like a spider in the house, and stomp it to death.
You have MAGA to thank for that.  Like the idiot carrying the rebel flag thru Congress.
So‚Ä¶when you see them‚Ä¶have words
The original loser logo, often paired with the 21st century one: Trump shit.
So, not to sound like a dick, but did we really win when we stopped the south from seceding? Imagine how much better the US would be if we got rid of most of the states south of the Mason-Dixon?
30 years ago if you came to Vermont with a Confederate flag decal on your truck window one of the many liberals with an arsenal that makes the federal government nervous would have "removed" the window and added a bunch of "ventilation holes" to your truck body.
It‚Äôs ‚Äúmuh Hurtage‚Äù
I drive by one in Lyndonville and cringe at the sight of it.
Imma just fly a Caesars flag from Fallout New Vegas, it's the same thing pretty much
I drive by a house with one hanging over a window. I just want to throw a rock through it every time i pass
Be sure to tell anyone waving one of these flags to go back to their own country. Oh, wait... it doesn't exist!
They‚Äôre all over upstate NY too. News flash assholes: you prob had relatives that fought on the Union side.
If they want to openly announce they are racist assholes, you should be thanking them. It really helps you to focus your goodwill on people that matter.
At least they announce themselves. These guys (if you‚Äôre a guy) or ladies (if you‚Äôre a lady) are *suuuuper* fun to hit on in public and wink at and such.
Far right extremist political organizations in **other countries** fly the stars and bars, to include Australia, Argentina, and the UK. 

It was never about heritage
I had ancetral men on both sides of the war, and there is no way I am claiming that flag as part of "muh heritage."  The Rebel was from Pennsylvania, too.  

It just astounds.
Nowadays people running the confederate flag is ultimately about triggering people. Thats it.
And they always bring up "It wasn't about slavery, state rights over federal?" State rights to do what?
I find it especially confusing when I find someone living in Saint Albans doing this, where there‚Äôs a green historical plaque stating how the only attack in New England was when a group of confederates came down from Quebec and raided banks and killed a person. They literally attacked you and saw you as an enemy.
Living on the border between VT and NH is interesting because you spend most of your time in one of the most left leaning states there is, and then you cross the river and the bank behind the ice cream stand is covered in manic DEMS 4 CHINA and STOP THE STEAL signs >.>
 Lol you should take a trip to northern California.
Slavers.
üî• Plastic pavement princessesüî•
There is no point in arguing or trying to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù the enemy. They don‚Äôt see it as an enemy flag simple as that. They don‚Äôt even know what the flag stands for. 

When you‚Äôve been brainwashed your entire life and someone tells you you‚Äôre wrong you don‚Äôt concede, you defend. Trying to reason with these people just force them in their shell. 

It‚Äôs basic tribalism. It‚Äôs not about being right, correct, or even proper. It‚Äôs about not letting the other team or allowing them to progress. It‚Äôs human nature.
I had a hot sauce company from 2013 to 2018. I got put next to those belt buckle, blanket and teeshirt booths a lot. The amount of white kids in new england that would buy confederate belt buckles, hats, blankets and merch was unreal. I asked the other vendor if that was his best seller jokingly and he said ‚Äúabsolutely. It‚Äôs the first design to sell out every time‚Äù

The flag vendor said the same thing. People in ct/mass/ny/vt fairs love buying confederate flags for whatever reason.

I wonder if it‚Äôs just kids thinking it‚Äôs edgy or the taboo factor, but it‚Äôs really awkward to watch someone order a king sized fuzzy blanket with a huge confederate flag on it
How often do you see this?


I haven't seen a single once since moving back to Texas over a year ago. I don't recall seeing one for year before that.¬†


You guys actually see this irl?
That and the desecrated American flags are near as bad. Same dumbass mindset but more cowardly.
They like to race thru neighborhoods throwing crap. Neighbors son got hit by a glass bottle thrown at a group of boys walking home from school. Truck was covered with Trump stickers and a huge Trump flag. The boys were 8-12 years old, just happy little kids walking the 2 blocks home.

Took 12 stitches to close the wound.

This is not the first time this has happened
The fact this is in Vermont is confusing. Doesn't make any sense.
Word. Feel the same for just about any flag that isn‚Äôt a state or USA flag.
Why don‚Äôt you say this to them instead of reddit
There‚Äôs only one flag that flies above the rest
Some of us remember the St. Albans Raid happened. Also Vermont was a republic for longer than the confederacy existed, obviously not at the same time.
It‚Äôs the flag of losers and traitors to the United States of America. 
The only good thing about people flying it is that it‚Äôs a good warning to stay away from them, and also to never hire them.
Sherman should have never stopped burning the South and more traitors should have been hanged.

They can go live in Florida.
Can't fix stupid and we've got plenty of that around here.
If they could only hold onto their teeth the same way they hold onto this flag. The Confederate flag is a symbol that comes with the understanding that if you support it, you support Jim Crowe laws and suppression of blacks and minorities.
I had an American flag on my push cart at work and one guy says "now you just need a confederate flag, too" 

I said "yeah, while we're at it i could also maybe get an ISIS flag" 

He said "whaddya mean? They're nothing alike" 

I said "yeah i guess you're right. ISIS existed for a longer time, but the confederates killed more Americans, by far" 

The blank, braindead look on his face said it all
‚ÄúMuh heritage‚Äù your heritage is losing‚Ä¶ literally
I wouldn't say anything to them. 

I'd write down their license plate, then look up their address, and then send them Floridian real estate brochures.

The way to defeat racism in Vermont is not through confrontation, but through subterfuge, concern trolling, and slick marketing campaigns.

We should use marketing and sales techniques to convince racists that they are happier in the South.
Get a few stickers off the 20th of Maine flag and whenever you see it as a confederate flag bumper sticker, slap the Maine flag over it.
Because they want attention. They feel invisible and any attention makes them feel important.
It takes a certain mentality to embrace the Confederate flag.  These people choose their method of performative rebellion against society by aligning themselves with a racist, seditious movement that was eliminated almost 200 years ago.  Much like MAGA swag, it lets you know that the person is racist, bigoted, homo-and-transphobic and likely woefully ill-informed, thought they can probably repeat all the current extremist right-wing talking points they get from Fox or OAN or whatever.
As someone from VA. We also don‚Äôt like these type of people. It isn‚Äôt really a south and north thing, more like just a idiot thing.
It has nothing to do with the actual confederacy, it just means "I am republican".

Unfortunately, a significant % of Americans have been led so far astray that they are never coming back. It is in no way an exaggeration to say Trumpism has become a full-on cult. His followers will turn their back on their friends, family, and country before they turn their back to him.
It just shows they are some of the biggest losers around flying the flag of the all time biggest losers
My favorite is when they have both a confederate flag and an American flag. Like they have no idea that those two ideologies were at war‚Ä¶
I am from the south. It's treason. It's hate. Every one of the "my heritage" people are racist or tolerates it. I grew up with these people. All over the south. They can wink and smirk at someone who didn't live in their world. I did.

You fly that flag, and you are a traitor who supports racism. Period. 

Don't play their games. They rely on people's reluctance to call it out.
Its is ignorant to fly that flag. But I really doubt you would do anything about it face to face. Reddit muscles. lol
It was never about the heritage, it's about the racism.
Also the confederacy only lasted 4 years. That is it
There's this one house in Alburgh that I always pass going to NY with a big fat rebel flag on it. I always flip that place off, fuck that guy

I like your style
Ah yes Vermont, the land of more BLM signs than actual black people
To the folks saying this is just to get attention, I think I have to disagree. At this point in our cultural evolution as a country, it‚Äôs an explicit and intentional statement of prejudice and racism.
It's branding these people wanna feel like the strength they project into those beliefs instead of just being strong through actions
Descendants of the Glorious Dead. 

Still assholes.
Born and raised in western New York‚Ä¶ it was sad to see this tradition carried on to my generation and young folks are still flying it proudly
I‚Äôm not American let alone from Vermont, I don‚Äôt get how many confederate flag flyers think they are more patriotic than not‚Ä¶ they lost the civil war ffs AGAINST THE US! it‚Äôs almost like flying a Vietnamese flag and saying ‚Äúlook how patriotic I am‚Äù
I mean, sure I‚Äôm not from the south. But what if my heritage is just ‚Äúbeing racist‚Äù? You tellin me I can‚Äôt celebrate that without upsetting people?

/sarcasm
Obligatory "Not a Vermonter". But at least where I live, we had a bunch of people from the South migrate over the course of a century or so after the war in order to get those good manufacturing jobs as subsistence farming became economically unviable. So I always know there's a chance that people flying those flags migrated here from their shithole home states and then tried to make our state more of a shithole. But at the same time, it's always fun to bring up the fact that a lot of stuff around us is named after officers of the 4th Michigan Cavalry Regiment which was responsible for the capture of Jefferson Davis after the war as he was trying to flee to Mexico; or the fact that Benjamin D. Pritchard is buried about one county down from us.

Ok.  As an outsider who happened on this post I will tell you why.  Various groups, gangs, clubs, lone wolf's that are racist as fuck LOVE VERMONT because they can still buy guns way after blue states say no way and they can get them quicker.  I bet half of them run guns to blue states.
Only someone who would never do anything about it in person would create this post.
It's called the rebel flag for a distinct reason and people will fly it in far away places like Scotland and Norway; it's also a Christian flag with the cross of Saint Andrew on it and thus it further resonates with the christian(especially protestant) conservative types. 

In addition to this people will simply fly it for shock value and to piss people off because they're sadists; when you feed them your angry emotions you're giving them exactly what they want and you're being played like a fiddle.
This is one of the facts I share w people about Maine and NH to people in the state I live in now when I talk about home lol (from MA)
People like that are not typically good with words. Or hygiene. Or life in general.
When we lived in Tennessee I noticed that trucks flying that flag often also had a MAGA-related flag.  Tennessee has a large number of specialty license plate options, and vehicles with confederate or Tr\*\*p 2024 flags or stickers often had the Gadsden flag license plate.

So how's life in Vermont?

Some stable, reasonable folks may need a place to live.
I view it as sign that their parents are related and they're a dangerous animal that needs to be avoided.
lol
Ask them if they support the confederate history, why are they not flying the right flag? 

The closest to it was the Naval Jack, and the colors were different. The rest were square battle flags. NONE of them were the actual flag of the confederacy. HERITAGE!!!

I'd be curious why they have it on there, but they have that right. If you looking to use force you are no better than any other authoritarian thug out there. Free speech matters when you don't agree with people not when everyone says and believes the same thing.
Wow sounds like a blast to live in Vermont
Have words with them then. Nobody is stopping you. You say you see so many, you're gonna be having a lot of words for people.

I thought it was state's rights?
Go confront them. Record the interaction and report back. Do it or you are just another keyboard warrior.
You‚Äôll wonder if they‚Äôre even human after watching some of this couple‚Äôs videos: https://youtu.be/Ba3itBPqGo4?si=eT05Md1K46NqR6mK

This country really needs to split into 2‚Ä¶
Why are you telling this to Reddit? Need some karma for that dopamine hit?
Here is a thought stop letting what other people do get your knickers in such a twist!!!
Does it really hurt you in any real way if someone has this sticker or that sticker on there vehicles or flag or whatever .
I mean please tell me how this in an actual sense this negatively affects you  and not just makes you angry or feel bad but actual real consequences.

Do you feel the same way about all the college students and hired protesters and their Hamas support?  If not, you're just another blowhard hypocrite.

Yeah, I get the hate and rightfully so.  But we live in a democracy and freedom of speech is key.  If the guy didn't have the flag on the side of his truck it wouldn't change his attitude/beliefs. It's good to know where he's coming from in advance.  

I'm not a Trump fan (or Biden) either, but people should be allowed to have their own beliefs even if they contradict ours.  To force our beliefs on others undermines democracy.
Freedom of expression.  You don‚Äôt have to agree with it but it‚Äôs still a right people have.
If i had to choose it would be fuck and you. Do i have to send royalties everytime I steal that?? thats amazing lol
I don‚Äôt agree with what the flag represents. But I agree you face the right to fly it.
Is this really a big problem in Vermont?  üòÇ
I believe in free speech.

I will fight for your right to say things I don‚Äôt agree with.

That flag just means Republican now. The civil war never ended it just quieted down.¬†
OP is such an internet tough guy lol
I actually don't know what is worse the idiots with a flag or the idiots that get so bent out of shape about a flag. You're giving them the attention and the reaction they want. Good job. If everyone would just mind their own business these guys would eventually fade away because nobody would be noticing them.
*stoned Betsy Ross* lmao
I have one on my wall lol. I hate that the movement for the second Vermont republic co-opted it since they are conservative nut jobs but I love my Vermont republic flag.
I love this so much!
Green Mountain boys and the Vermont independence movement screw the federal government.  

We the people ‚úä

https://vermontindependent.net
Broooooo. My eyes. How could you do this. Please fix the stars.
Additionally, Vermont was the first state to outlaw slavery.
Vermont was a republic 10 years longer than that puny confederacy and you don't see us crying about bullshit like "heritage".
Be sure to inform them they aren't even flying the correct [flag](https://i.imgur.com/KSa1MZh.jpeg). üè≥
The South lost. Slavery lost. Racism lost.

It is literally a symbol you put on your vehicle, body, or place of residence to state ‚ÄúI am a loser.‚Äù

Like bright colors in nature that warn us of the presence of venom, or in the case of the aggressive black and white striping of a skunk, an awful stink, I view the Confederate Flag as a sign that I should avoid an unpleasant encounter.
It‚Äôs meant to trigger people
Thank you! It's about as far from the confederacy as you could get, but I still see these dumbshits flying that flag.

GTFO of my state with that bullshit.

The state motto is Freedom and Unity. Speaks for itself.
Because they are racist fucks.
A guy in my neighborhood used to fly the confederate flag. He said he flew it because he was originally from Mississippi and wanted to celebrate his time from Mississippi. My point was that I‚Äôd be more likely to believe that bullshit if he ever embraced other more palatable aspects of southern living. If he was planting hardy magnolia trees in his yard, inviting neighbors over for some southern BBQ, sharing copies of William Faulkner‚Äôs works, playing some classic soul music. There are a ton of ways to embrace southern culture that has nothing to do with the civil war and continuing racism. Flying the confederate flag is the worst way to do it.
Ahh flag draggers the people who need you to know they are a mentally deficient loser form as far away as possible, virtue signaling a lack of virtue, giving themselves the I'd ideological reach around no body else will give them. my favorite is when they drag the American flag around behind them in the rain to show how much more they love America than the rest of us, by desecrating it. we got it you jerk happy to kick your Confederate ass again anytime you want
Absolute ignorance, stupidity, and a pathological need to trigger libruls that you don‚Äôt quite understand but is cool in your Facebook groups
Robert E Lee conceded and the Confederate flag was revived by the Dixiecrats as Segregational symbolism.

Just like the KKK

Why you would embolden the dark past of Traitorism and firmly entrenched racism of the past? Just shows the "age of information" failed millions of people.
I went to Maine for a work event and saw a dude wearing the stars and bars on a jacket as he bicycled up the road.

I would never condone violence but I'm surprised someone from Maine who knows a little history, didn't clip him.
Drive through central Maine üòÇ A lot of Confederate flags and signs that say ‚ÄúThe South will rise again!‚Äù Swear these people don‚Äôt know whats what.
Whaaaa'!? But what about mAh RiGhTs (to own slaves)!?

/s
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. The South lost. Why the fuck would someone be so proud of losing?
its the same jackasses that claim to support the troops. always a fun fact asking them that question, then asking why theyre flying the flag of someone who killed 360k of our troops. its like flying an isis flag
Because fuck you, your feels hot hurt so that's their goal. 


Most people also fly the wrong Confederate flag.
From NC just popping in to say I 100% agree with your sentiment. I got family in Indiana, I see motherfuckers flying it there too. It‚Äôs baffling.
>Why the fuck would someone fly that flag in Vermont of all fucking places?

  
There are plenty of examples in the Ohio subreddit as well, and Ohio wasn't part of the Confederacy, either.
Hijacking the top comment to inquire if there are any Pantera/Dimebag Darrell fans in the theater tonight?

Get 'em up against the wall!
Dude it‚Äôs not even just a Vermont thing. I live in Minnesota, literally the first state to send union volunteers, and these dingbats still fly confederate flags on the back of the truck. Hell I even had a neighbor flying one next door growing up. I really don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs generally not even southern people from what I‚Äôve seen so they can‚Äôt even try and portray it as some southern pride thing. Though that argument would also fall flat pretty quick
Why the fuck do they fly it in Indiana? I grew up around it in Arkansas, but it blows my mind to see it north of the mason dixon.
There are pics from the BLM/Covid years from damn Hawaii of trucks flying that flag.
I travel around the country for work. The place I see the most confederate flags is Maryland. Always makes me laugh/cry.
I've seen them in the backs of windows or flown outside of homes here....*in Michigan*. Like, do these rubes even *know* Michigan history? Heard of the Michigan Brigade from the Civil War? Sometimes called the Wolverines?

From Wikipedia:
> Composed primarily of the 1st Michigan Cavalry, 5th Michigan Cavalry, 6th Michigan Cavalry and 7th Michigan Cavalry, **the Michigan Brigade fought in every major campaign of the Army of the Potomac from the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 to the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House in April 1865.**

But yeah, let's fly the Confederate flag here in Michigan. That'll show em!
The confederacy is less a part of our heritage than McDonald‚Äôs
The other side won is the weakest argument for the whole thing and sort of undermines the point.
Apparently, just to piss you off.

Sounds like they‚Äôve succeeded.
Maybe they're just some good old boys, never meaning no harm.
This is exactly the type of mfer I'm talking about. Sick of this shit in our state.

I'd be happy to provide that driver with a compass. You wanna rep the south? Then fucking live there, easy win. Go own the libs by getting hookworm in Georgia or some shit.
Tire looks over-inflated.
Golly gee, I wonder which candidate he'll be voting for?
The wheelchair in the back is [kiss].  I have to mention my siblings live outside Atlanta, and even they know the Southern Swastika, should be illegal. Like the Germans made the swastika illegal.
Did you knife his tires? You shouldve knifed his tires.
It's always a truck
That‚Äôs always been my argument for this kind of free speech. First, if you only have acceptable free speech then you don‚Äôt have free speech. Second, I‚Äôd rather an asshole be allowed to demonstrate they are an asshole rather than secretly be an asshole. If we banned the confederate flag he isn‚Äôt suddenly going to be magically not-racist. He‚Äôs just harder to spot.
Hahaha the flag of ‚Äúlosers‚Äù that‚Äôs a great spin to use. Go straight for the ego.
It's really strange that people speak about The Civil War (I prefer The Slaveholders Rebellion) in terms of Union vs. Confederate. 

It makes it sound as if the Conferates fought something else, some other Army that sprouted from the pages of William Lloyd Garrison's The Liberator. This hides the fact that the Slaveholders and those who joined them fought against the United States.

We are talking about the United States Army and the United States Navy. Each is the one and only of ita kind in the United States.
Same and it‚Äôs disgusting. I‚Äôm utterly sick of seeing this flag and the mentality that goes with it. 

OP is correct: it‚Äôs extra pathetic and fucked up
In a Union state.
I love the clip going around the internet of the bigger dude holding a confederate flag and defending it, saying ‚Äúthis is the flag my family stood under for years!‚Äù When the crowd around him asked why he supported slavery, he replied ‚Äúmy family didn‚Äôt have slaves! Do you know how much a slave cost back then?!‚Äù

The conservative nut jobs probably loved it thinking he ‚Äúowned the libs‚Äù. But in reality, thinking it‚Äôs ok to rep the confederate flag in 2024 because your family was simply too poor to afford a slave is an absolutely ridiculous concept.
Also from the south. Went up to the Northeast (Mass, Vermont, Maine, NH) was blown away how many confederate flags I saw. Honestly more than I see usually driving around North Alabama.
Yeah that's fair. I got three kids and when they see some dumb mfer with a Confederate flag flapping behind their truck they know to steer clear.
I get where you're coming from and agree to some extent, but on the other hand I'll never be "fine" with displays of bigotry
Its literally a red flag
I'm always afraid I'm going to meet somebody, have a few things in common, maybe want to hang out a bit... they see their car plastered with MAGA and these stupid flags.  

It is a 100% turn and walk the other way situation.  YES, I am judging you.
[deleted]
Also the people defending the confederate flag belong there, too.
When I was a teen in the 80's, I don't recall the confederate flag having the same connotation.  If someone had a confederate flag on display it usually was some edgy teen trying to advertise their rebellious nature.  You had the General Lee screaming around on TV with it emblazoned across the roof ... nobody gave it a second thought as a symbol of hate.  Yes ... they were from the south, but plenty of us Northerners kind of identified with those "Good ol' Duke boys fighting the system".

Nowadays, it's definitely changed and taken on a more sinister and hateful meaning.  Anybody flying those colors today and doesn't recognize that it's now a symbol of racism and hate has had their head in the sand for the last 15 years or so.
Totally agree.  My great great grandfather led the Irish regiment out of Boston and died on the battle field.  I‚Äôm getting a union flag and F anyone who flies the confederate flag.  My families blood was spilled for the union.  If you fly a confederate flag you are a traitor.
The hard part is that Trump caters to these folks and they behave like a big mean cult.  So no matter what I feel on any other issues I have to vote against Trump.  That means I have to vote for a candidate with a reasonable chance of winning.  I‚Äôm sick of people describing the election as a Trump camp vs Biden camp thing like a football game.  For me it‚Äôs anyone who will beat Trump since he is the ‚Äúhate‚Äù candidate and encourages racism.  But it‚Äôs not just racism, it‚Äôs fascist rhetoric that he is pushing.  Lately he is describing building a new Reich.  So he‚Äôs super into Nazis too.  We literally fought wars against the confederacy and against the Nazis so anyone celebrating them is a traitor.  End of story.
Rhetorical at the moment indeed. It's just, we are all getting a little frustrated by the illiteracy on the other side, and they're clearly chomping at the bit tor a proper shootout. 

I just wish they'd read the goddamn book they keep throwing at everyone else (the new testament) and then maybe all this could be avoided.
That's just dodging the confrontation. I say the same thing when someone asks about aesthetic choices that I make which really do have meaning, but I don't want to argue over. It's all about picking fights, and they knew they'd lose.
Well done!
How about a T-shirt with that flag and the caption ‚ÄúThe Winning Side‚Äù or something to that effect?
That's exactly it, you nailed it. Dumb and looking for confrontation.

I hate bullies, always have.
My nephew is one of these types, dumb and mean. When he got his first car years ago, he put and ‚ÄòAdam and Eve, not Adam and Steve‚Äô as was popular in the 90‚Äôs. The thing is my mother (his grandmother) is gay. She said to him, ‚ÄúWhy do you have that sticker?‚Äù His reply was ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt mean you, gramma‚Äù

Um, what? Yes, he‚Äôs got the confederate flag nowadays. SMH
They‚Äôre truck nutz not truck balls, but I still see and agree with your point
Oh stop with the chest puffing bullshit. I couldn‚Äôt agree more about the confederate flag but you dont need to go threatening to kick Reddit‚Äôs ass.

The hammer and sickle is not equivalent to those other two.
I have family outside of Atlanta. They call it the Southern Swastika.
So much so that in countries where it‚Äôs illegal to display a swastika it has become a common stand in.
I have heard it was the ‚ÄòBattle Flag‚Äô.
I am a loyal Yankee, and don‚Äôt like that flag. It doesn‚Äôt impress me!
But if you want to use it on your own property, that‚Äôs your right!
And if you are one of the fools who want to succeed again, try really hard to concentrate and remember how it worked out last time for the rebels!
Eye here ewe. Seaing mails around hear with hateful flags on there trucks makes me want to give them a peace of my mined. Wear are they're white robes?  Give me a brake!

Dam homophones!

/s

Couldn't resist the irony that these pea-brained homophobes probably couldn't identify a homophone.
The voting records disagree with you. I will say though, the fewer bigots there are, the louder they seem to get. It's exhausting.
It's legit 50/50. 

Half my town is old, liberal hippies and young progressive folks and the other half is afraid 5G is going to put covid in their brains.
Aw, come on - homophones are cool.  :)
Much of the state is what I would consider either "old school" Republican (fiscal conservatism, small gov't., etc...), or even more Libertarian.

Vermont _definitely_ has a history of racism (though not slavery) and xenophobia, and many of those old-timers definitely aren't interested in progressive policies.  A certain amount of that comes from the fact that there just historically _haven't_ been a lot of people of color in Vermont ... as much of an accident of history as it is anything else ... the place was settled by white people and there was never a concerted effort to "import" people from other places.  In a place that isn't too keen on outsiders, a person of color is easily identified as someone "not from around here" and draws a fair bit of unwanted attention. 

That said _most_ of them just want to be left alone to do their own thing with as little governmental intervention as possible.  They're "good fences make good neighbors" type people who are perfectly happy to pay no attention to what's happening on your side of the fence, so long as you stay the heck away from their side. (Unless you get your car stuck in a ditch, then every neighbor around is showing up with tractors and yank straps to help you out).

These folks probably aren't flying flags and drawing attention to themselves, but they're also not voting for social programs and increased school funding.

The liberal veneer that Vermont has, largely came out of the 60's and 70's where lots of hippy-dippy folks were looking for a place to live their alternative lifestyles and they found abundant, cheap land available in VT.  They were young, politically active, voted like their lives depended on it and made a lot of impact on Vermont's political landscape.
Plus its funny all of the keyboard warrior comments, go tell them. 
I have, I banned the flag and any other flag that isnt the American flag from being flown as president of my hoa.
It sure is funny how many people have not "whooped the dog shit" out of me. They typically log into a neighbor chat forum and cry to people that don't care. Then they get mad that people don't care about them crying so they are here. 
Losers.
Oh, same stupid shit at South Burlington High School back in the day.  They rebranded as the Wolves a while ago but they used to be the Rebels.  Team colors were light blue, grey and white.  It was the most confused shit in the world.  And of course half the football players, many of whom were intelligent and not racist, would fly the stars and bars as a team logo.  Used to hate that shit.
A business near us put up a trump flag and I thought "why would you want to piss off half of your potential customers before they even walk in the door ".. They closed up about a month afterwards.
Little do they know, they got Cs and passed high school because the teachers knew there was no point making them repeat grades.
This is the only comment in this entire post that even comes close to describing this.
Lmaooo
Raw statistics agree with you, but there is a humanitarian angle to consider. Some people just have the rotten luck of being born in the swamp, doesnt mean they should be condemned to die there.
I agree with all you said, but be careful with the ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù description. 

I think people often interpret that term to mean views or actions like that are normal and they are entitled to them.

I would amend that to .. was it Brazil or Argentina the OG confederates and Nazi's ran off to? ..either way send them pamphlets from there.

I coulda threatened to dust off my carbine, but I said words.

Y'all afraid of words now and that is telling. 

Words lead to thoughts, and thoughts lead to questions, and those things are terrifying to an autocratic regime. This country ain't been right for some time now, and not least of all because of this sick, deluded vision of the good old days.

There were no good old days. This day is better, and more fair and just than any that came before it, and that's a damn shame too cause we got a long way to go.

Don't advocate violence, kthx.
States rights maybe a little, though it is a pretty weak notion
That‚Äôs a rather big assumption. Why would you think people would find racism abhorrent and condone genocide of another race? That doesn‚Äôt make sense.
I'm ready for that conversation.
I am against the confederacy and colonialism. Is your point is to talk down to the people who want to make things better for all people, or do you want to be allies?
Many of us are aware of all of those issues and do have dialogue around it.  Would you suggest that we don‚Äôt take issue with or support racist ideology further?
I'm a queer immigrant of color originally from the south, and a fellow anarchist: this commentary ain't it. White people talking about home grown problems and how to deal with them is a GOOD thing. These bizarre, delusional, racist ass homegrown Vermonters should be discussed, and there absolutely should be brain storming on how to confront these douche bags because every single one y'all ignoring them comfortably in your privilege let's the people of color around you, the immigrants around you, the LGBTQ people around you know that they aren't safe and you don't care.

Is the US a neoliberal, imperialist sham? Absolutely. The US destroying my country is why I ended up here in the first place, but that doesn't mean you stop talking about racism inside the US because the government uses racism as a tool of colonialism and imperialism.
You're an anarchist, your opinion is irrelevant
Blah blah whataboutism blah lol

Well unless the feds are rolling up in this thread, the right to free speech has nothing to do with it.  

 The ***government*** can't infringe on on a person right to self expression, but the rest of us sure as fuck can.
Agree, in principal, but in practice there are some things you shouldn't say in polite company if you dont wanna get turned inside out like a dirty fucking sock.

One of those things you ought not to say is that you have the right to own other people, and that's what that stupid fucking flag says.
OP is exercising their right to free speech by saying f\*ck anyone flying the confederate flag, yet you seem to have an issue with it. The irony is strong with you.

Nah mate, you cannot ignore an infection. If you ignore it, it will grow and fester. Best off popping the zit when you happen to find it in your nutsack.

Ignoring cancer isn't the way to deal with it.

This logic literally never works.¬†
The people flying the flag representing bad things are worse than the people objecting to bad things, by far.  That's pretty obvious, eh?
Nah, ignoring this shit is what has allowed this country to be infested with Nazis voting for a fascist orange blob that tried to overthrow our democracy.
Yeah, look at them fade away into obscurity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

Are you even paying attention to the world? How dumb do you have to fucking be?  Seriously, put down Reddit and go open a book. Preferably something about history.
People like OP get triggered when others have a different opinion than them
It's very cool! Where did you find it?
Technically we banned slavery before even becoming a US state. You are still right but I thought that it was a cool caveat.
If I remember right from the museum in Montpelier, part of the reason why Vermont joined the Union was that it disagreed with the federal law allowing owners to forcibly take back enslaved people if said people had made it to a free state. 

\*I know enslaved people is a better term but am unfamiliar with a better term for these bastards
Right. [This](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cDFIdtuiQ-E/TtDxM_xWzvI/AAAAAAAAAnU/f1U-e6Wo4m0/s320/white_flag_surrender.jpg) is the actual flag of the Confederacy.
Racism is still alive and well, unfortunately.
Yep - celebrating traitorous losers.
^participation trophy?
The problem is that racists still don't realize they lost. They thought 2016 was overtime.
Sociopaths love to do that shit. Get a charge out of causing people to react.
genuinely don't get the trend of making yourself look like an asshole as a weird political statement. Like, there's no commentary behind the provocativeness. There's no statement behind rolling coal other than "i like making everything around me look worse".
And it works!!!
The only thing it does for me is make me laugh at how stupid they look
It's cause "Ah'm a REBEL!! Don't step on mah snake!!" /s
Wasn‚Äôt Maine a big KKK state? Maybe it still is?
Vermont sent over 10% of its population to put down the traitorous rebellion and lost nearly 1.5% of its population to the war.  This was devastating to the demographics of the state.  Flying the flag of an enemy that bled the state of a brighter future in the name of chattel slavery is disgusting and disrespectful to the very real sacrifices of Vermonters to stand up for what is right and secure a brighter future for our country.
It's  clearly OK to have a confederate flag on your cherry 1970's charger if you plan to jump it off some stuff while on the run from a corrupt sheriff, after sleeping with your scantily clad first cousin. (Like a modern day Robin Hood) but that would be the only time it's acceptable.  And Waylon has to sign off on it.

Fortunately he'll be pissing in the wind in this state.
I think the problem is multi-faceted. 

Primary and secondary education in the South have never been the highest quality, and schools still teach the political rationalization that the Civil War was about states' rights.

Also, Southerners are proud people. There's not a lot of money in most of the South. People are working class and they work hard. They want respect for that.

Unfortunately, even when it's true, a lot of the invective hurled against them is the opposite of the respect Southerners want. Like they say down there, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. So that's another piece of the puzzle.

Even though flying the Confederate flag is misinformed and racism is indefensible, I just don't think we're gonna get 'em past it by yelling "fuck you" at pickup trucks. All that does is make the proud boys prouder.
Imagine refocusing your strident, angry energy from something you can't control to something you can.
Like a MAGA hat, it's an idiot identifier.
Nor ragrats!
I felt the same way at the time. The General Lee and Dixie playing when you honked the horn and all. But - I'm not talking anyone's experience but mine - all that was wrapped up in a huge tangle of implicit (and sometimes explicit) racism. It wasn't hate because we "weren't racist - I don't have a hateful bone in my body". We were just "aware of differences." You know, "different folks have different abilities" and such. Looking back on it, I think southern racists didn't feel the need to express hate overtly because the systems in place did such a thorough job in constraining black opportunity.

I think for me it feels like the past 15 years have just exposed more truthfully the hate that's always been behind these symbols in one form or another. And I completely agree with you - anyone who doesn't see it now is making a choice not to see it.

(Oh, and General Lee was a brave man who fought for people's rights to choose their own government, and he would've won if the Union hadn't had so many more bodies than the brave freedom-fighters in the south. Yeah - I was taught that.)
I was going to say the same thing. I remember when I was in college in the 90s there was an Asian kid from Richmond, Virginia, who had a stars and bars on the wall above his bed in his dorm room. When I asked him why he said he thought it looked cool. I don‚Äôt think it crossed his mind that it had anything to do with prejudice.
They do read it, they cherry pick verses that support their opinions. When you counter with a point from the bible they tell you, "you took that verse out of context" to try to cover their rear. It's pathetic.
I would settle for them having the same devotion to the rest of the library's contents beyond that one book.
Oh trust me. This guy was a POS who sexually harassed me and made me fear for my safety when I asked him to stop. He is absolutely a racist shit bag but didn‚Äôt want to actually speak it into existence outside of the klan meetings he probably attends.

Haha damnit, sorry!
Thanks yeah that was super cringe.
No? Cold War USSR is better or worse?
Hurr
It's a known fact that the monkeys with the smallest testicles make the most noise.

Life is changing faster than they can keep up, and now we're at this point where they feel backed into a corner and doomed (cause they are), so the howling gets louder and louder.

There is a certain inevitability on the side of progress, but also a very real danger that those loud ass, tiny testicle monkeys will do something crazy to keep themselves in power.
The problem is the ignorant ones are MUCH louder & literally in your face about it while all the progressive ones just sit back & watch you get called a faggot.  

Number of times some redneck hurled a slur for no reason in public in the last few years 7, number of times someone defended or said anything about it  ZERO
Nobody is saying they couldn‚Äôt emigrate. It would just leave the rest to wallow in their own misery without brining the rest of the country down.
Yeah this dude's weird.
America is the land of double standards.
Interesting. Your OP says otherwise.
lol when has america ever wanted to make things better for all people?
I appreciate the reply here and mostly agree. The core of my point is that this liberal handwringing of the confederacy more often than not is just a rhetorical exercise in purification. Confederacy bad, America good. When the confederacy is just mask off America. 

> White people talking about home grown problems and how to deal with them is a GOOD thing. 

Yes! And that includes analysis of the overlap between america and the confederacy (which is basically a circle imo) and that an important piece that‚Äôs usually missing.

> These bizarre, delusional, racist ass homegrown Vermonters should be discussed, and there absolutely should be brain storming on how to confront these douche bags because every single one y'all ignoring them comfortably in your privilege let's the people of color around you, the immigrants around you, the LGBTQ people around you know that they aren't safe and you don't care.

It‚Äôs easy to oppose obvious white supremacists waving confederate flags but it‚Äôs not so easy to unpack how these attitudes bleed into policy by well meaning liberals. An example would be how Bernie Sanders wants to use Bibi as a fall guy but will not challenge Zionism itself, which is the root cause. We will never get anywhere without soberly confronting root causes. Something I don‚Äôt think these liberals that handwring about visible confederate flags are capable of. 

> Is the US a neoliberal, imperialist sham? Absolutely. The US destroying my country is why I ended up here in the first place, but that doesn't mean you stop talking about racism inside the US because the government uses racism as a tool of colonialism and imperialism.

I feel you. I‚Äôm also from another country that has been by and large fucked over by the us. 

If you got ‚Äúwe should not talk about racism inside the US‚Äù from what I‚Äôve said then I‚Äôm not being clear because I think we need to talk about how the confederacy is just an old tumor inside of a larger creature that seems to have a knack for creating many similar tumors within itself and we should be examining the whole and the root causes rather than just isolating one symptom.
why?
But they all continue to benefit from their extermination and curiously don‚Äôt much to help and if god forbid some white person tries to even do a land acknowledgment 1/3 of the population would see them hanged in public for it.

edit: typo
which virtues am I signaling?
That isn‚Äôt free speech.  If any speech is oppressed by violence it should be dealt with by law enforcement protecting an individual from violence.
The actual confederate soldiers were of the mindset they were fighting the yanks because the yanks were murderous savages that were coming to kill them and take their land. You are aware how media works right?
Violence is not the answer.  Debate and understanding of each other creates real change.
Ding ding!  We spent a lot of the last 25 years ignoring it and believing it had disappeared.  Then the most self-involved president in history got elected and gave voice to these biases and it came back hard.  Ignorance doesn‚Äôt end an issue.
You seriously think America has nazis? Lol conversation over. I won't converse with delusions.
You can also find them easily online. Pretty sure i bought one from amazon for my dorm in college
At the Vermont Historical Society in Montpelier!
True. I remember loving the fact we outlawed slavery first, allowed civil unions first, and were the first state to allow gay marriage without it going to court. My hometown also ran out the KKK in the early 80s. It makes me laugh when people talk about how progressive Vermont has become. We have always been progressive.
Bring on the downvotes, but I don't think we should jump to pat ourselves on the back. Not only is there still tons of anti-black racism and disparity in VT, but we very much did have slavery in VT. Explicit laws outlawed the trade of slaves, but that's about all it was clear on, and that makes some mighty suspicious suggestions. Furthermore, it's not like it was strictly enforced. And because it was "illegal", records of slaves were not recorded, or may have been listed as "servants" etc. For instance, Ethan Allen owned slaves before he lived in VT, and when he was in Vermont, he had several black "servants". Yeah, sure. So it's likely there was quite a lot of slavery in Vermont, and though it may have been more along the lines of indentured servitude, it's still not something to be proud of. I agree that Vermont was still the best, but the bar was very low. And it still is low.
While "Slaver/Slavers" in International Law does carry a specific definition of those who force people into slavery and are engaged in human trafficking, the term which is used most commonly and applies more broadly is "Enslaver." 

The IRC has more on the topic, as does the NPS (though theirs is under revision, it is pretty good for discussing slavery in historical contexts).

A relative of mine just moved to a state that has several license plate styles to choose from. He said he wants to get the *In God We Trust* design because "that'll piss some people off." He's not religious. I can't imagine having such a mindset to go out of my way just to annoy people, but I guess it's pretty common.
Gotta ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù
like a rainbow flag
To be fair, I get it, I dont wanna get stepped on either.

But that's a far cry from what the other side is doin, which is ACTIVELY STEPPING ON SNAKES OF ANOTHER COLOR. Like..how they dont see this I dont know, it's such obvious hypocrisy and yet they are unaware. I legit think it might be a symptom of a malformed brain.
The irony of how don‚Äôt tread on me has been used as confederate/conservative narrative. When it‚Äôs original purpose is the opposite of that shit
The gasden flag is completely different. Yea it‚Äôs been co-oped by some racists, but it‚Äôs original meaning is bad ass.
"Pwease no steppy uwu" is still peak comedy to me.
Don‚Äôt tread was originally a libertarian flag. Altogether the right use it much more is see it as a fundamental American ideology
All of New England had pretty sizable kkk groups in the 1920s. The kkk was stronger in the northeast and Midwest than the south at the time. The big target of the klan back then were Catholics (along with Jewish and Black people, and ‚Äúpublic morality‚Äù), and Maine had a sizable French-Canadian catholic immigrant population that came to work in the mills. The KKK even helped elect the governor of Maine in 1924. But VT definitely had its own history with the klan, and I‚Äôm not trying to diminish that history in anyway through comparison with other states. 

There was a resurgence in the northeast in the 80s. There were attempts at rallies across the northeast that were mostly shut down.

Recently there was an armed white supremacist group buying land up in northern Maine for a training ground. The leader called it ‚ÄúBlut Stamm‚Äù, German for ‚ÄúBlood Tribe‚Äù. Seems like those plans have been abandoned. But according to the SPLC, there are 9 hate and anti-government groups in Maine, 15 in NH, 3 in Vermont, 11 each in MA and CT, 7 in RI.
Its a dukes of hazzard reference lmao
I don't think most people know about that show.
I guess people in Vermont don't have a sense of humor or are too high brow for the duke brothers.
Florida actually has more registered democratic voter, but sadly, it‚Äôs gerrymandered to hell.
NH state moto should be Live Free AND Die with the number of loud AF fart motorcycle riding people that don't wear a helmet. Just this morning into work not only did I see this, but this fool was also splitting lanes, it's like he was begging for death.
I am from the south and there are plenty of decent people to model your pride from: Dixie chicks, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings,  Merle Haggard, Kris Kristofferson, Loretta Lynn, etc. There's more to the south than Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood, and Miller lite. Certainly not f*cking Trump from New York City. So anybody claiming racism and treason are how they express their pride, then they aren't proud of being Southern, they are proud of being racist.

Dudes that fly this flag are letting these uppity people of color who demand fair treatment know that they are the "silent majority" and they won't be silent anymore.
Yall have plenty to be proud of, that's what is so frustrating. Why TF do people wanna cling to the worst part of their history when they could champion current achievements instead?

Hell, if the flag was a pot of sweet tea beside a plate of scrapple with two (totally hetero) dudes high fiving, nobody would have a problem!
It is very multi-faceted - I‚Äôve resided here for 40 years (very unfortunately). 

The kinds of folks that we are talking about here do not deserve honey - they are twisted by their own simmering stew of ignorance, resentment, and alcohol. All of that, of course, makes them very easy to manipulate. 

I had a lot more to say, but I slept poorly and my lack of sleep is catching up with me - and I need to save my juice for the work day :)
That‚Äôs cute, thanks for the life advice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
My husband and I live in Burlington and rode our bikes down to the waterfront a few hours before the eclipse started. A mother in a MAGA hat and her two teenage kids (I‚Äôm assuming) said something to us about being in their way so I told them to fuck off and go back to where they came from. She was clearly wearing that shit to get a rise out of Vermonters. I guess it worked on me üò¨
Or ashes on your forehead.

Yes, modern times have been slowly pulling back the veil of systemic racism, and opening the eyes of those willing to see the _implicit_ racism that underpins a lot of US culture.

We have several centuries of unfettered racism to unwind. It takes time and doesn't follow a linear course.

Currently, those who would like to put it all back in the bottle are feeling threatened and are fighting back ... largely due to one man who decided that their fear and outrage was politically expedient.
Ha! ‚ÄúVeterans for Trump‚Äù is a special kind of stupid
It is a symbol for worker solidarity. Various groups have co-opted it over the years but it does not strictly represent the USSR.

That is what I'd like to see change.


Just because we aren't assholes doesn't mean we can't be vocal.


Lord knows this country needs a militant left wing to balance out the crazy shit going on over there on the other side.
No it doesn‚Äôt
You're correct the United States of America's policies do very little for the good of people. I am not America, I am person who wants my country to be better to all people than it has ever been. So again, are we enemies or allies, or do you just want to come in here and troll?
You are stifling conversation, that's what I got. Your points are valid, but in a conversation on what to do with outspoken bigots, it dilutes the conversation. Suddenly people are having to discuss the laundry list of American ills instead of the concrete and material conversation of what do we do about this bigot in our community? Bigots who fly nazi flags, Confederate flags, etc are not harmless, and that's an ill that needs to be addressed in the immediate. Any conversation that deters that is not a useful one.
Someone who lacks enough common sense to support such a nonsensical ideology AND have hypocritical positions at the same time makes their opinions have no validity or credibility. In other other words, anarchist detected, opinion rejected
We all benefit, from Argentina to Alaska
Eh nah. I don‚Äôt mind treason being against the law. ¬†
You‚Äôre joking right?
Vermont has always been about individual liberty, which is a very different thing that having "always been progressive" in a political sense.
You can put asterisks on it all day but our point still stands.

Neither of us said things are perfect. Just a fact. 

Downvoted because you asked me to.
People are really unhappy and unwell. They have fully bought into the division rather than seeing through the divide and conquer tactics. We all need to unite against the very few who rule everything
The best thing to do is to do something that'll piss him off in return. Like wear a shirt that says, "Don't shit talk the troops, my girlfriend's husband fights for your freedom"
I know people who have  "choose life" plates in Fl. They could not understand why I would not ride in their car.
But in Vermont? I look to Vermont for good examples. They are easier to find there.
I have a co-worker that was a huge satanic atheist who now went Christian to trigger the libs. He is a sack of shit.
Yall remember back in the day when rednecks hated cops and the government? I member..

Now they all show polish connoisseur boot licking sobs. Life is too strange.
I'm from NH, every single Libertarian I know is a conservative going as far back as NH becoming known as the "Libertarian state." It's really mostly Reddit where you find the type of Libertarianism that borders on anarchy.
I agree.

I just think it would be more badass if it was 'don't tread on us' with a collection of newts, toads, frogs, snakes, and maybe an otter for good measure.

Now that's my kind of heresy!
I now refer to that as the 'manbaby flag'.
I agree. We have to stop letting the POS's take away everything.  Every rune that people aren't immediately familiar with is by default looked at as "is that nazi?" Hell, the regular American flag will trigger some folks because they think you are a "patriot" and a MAGA tool.  It's all just getting out of hand.
Love seeing cops fly that.
Their babysitters didn't tune into TNN in the 80s.
Minus the flag that was a bad ass car.
Without Gerrymandering, the GOP would have far less power.
Gerrymandering doesn't really impact statewide elections, and they have a Republican governor, two Republican senators, and have voted for the Republican candidate in the past two presidential elections. If there really are more Democrats there, they need to get off their asses and vote.
Sadly not anymore, as of a couple of years ago. There are anywhere from 100-200k more Republicans than Democrats now. 

Florida is solid red.
NC too
Your response was perfect.
> a few hours before the eclipse started. A mother in a MAGA hat and her two teenage kids (I‚Äôm assuming) said something to us about being in their way 

you were in their way ... of viewing the sun during an eclipse? How?  The sun isn't big enough in the sky? Geez these people are insufferable.
And the swastika existed long before it became a Nazi hate symbol.  Before WWII, the swastika was generally regarded as a positive symbol representing auspiciousness and good fortune.
oh ok
Based on what you‚Äôve said we‚Äôre allies. And if we are going to address the issues of America from within we need to be realistic about what we‚Äôre dealing with and all this handwringing about the confederacy shows an extreme lack of self awareness.
fair enough but I personally don‚Äôt see how me expressing that handwringing about confederate flag stickers being displayed is the lowest hanging fruit is stifling conversation when I‚Äôm actually urging for a much deeper one and why it‚Äôs needed. most people cheering on this thread will conveniently reject ‚Äúconfederate‚Äù ideals and just stop there and never care to see how current American policy doesn‚Äôt differ much.  Or to put it in other terms, MLKs stern warnings about the white moderate. 

Do we need to be concerned with the extremely obvious neo nazis? Of course. But I am equally if not more concerned about the liberals that uphold the same systems of harm under the American flag. That‚Äôs all. Plus I just personally just enjoy making liberals squirm on the internet so there‚Äôs that.
I could say the exact same thing about wannabe capitalist liberals. 

Anarchists believe in self-organization and voluntary association. That power corrupts people and most politicians are selfish and useless. 

Anarchism is just following common sense and democracy to their logical ends.

I see you‚Äôre not ready for that conversation since you just go around defending capitalism with all your energy.
It‚Äôs also always been about responsibility to community.
Well, Vermont's state motto is Freedom and Unity, which is pretty progressive, especially when compared to the motto of some neighboring states I won't mention.  The motto was adopted in 1788, so, yeah, I think we've always been progressive.
What I commented was also just facts. Also, I agreed with your point. Just added on to it. I think that's valid.

Apologies if I sounded accusatory--I didn't mean to, because it is a cool caveat. I left the comment for the folks who would invariably read the original comment and stick it in their back pocket along with their "I got a black friend".

Georgia has two democratic senators, and voted democrat in the last presidential election.
Sure but if you just wait a few years they‚Äôll all die.
Oh, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that but not surprised. When we bailed on our Florida ‚Äòretirement‚Äô and came home (2017) there were more democrats. I guess we aren‚Äôt the only ones that fled when trump was elected.

True and I fully anticipated someone would say this. The difference is that many socialist groups today still use the symbol and are absolutely not hate groups. You may dislike or disagree with socialist ideology but ultimately they believe in and advocate for equality. Modern groups who display the Confederate or Nazi flags or symbols are predicated on hate and discrimination. No one is displaying the swastika to advocate for peace and good fortune any more. Big difference in my opinion.
Vermont's dislike of slavery closely aligned them with Abe Lincoln's Republican party, so if you consider Abe Lincoln to be progressive (he was), then in that sense you're correct.  But Vermont continued as an extremely Red state for very long period of time.  In the 1930s, very few states were voting *against* FDR.  But Vermont was.  I wouldn't say that a state voting against FDR has "always been progressive".

You don't look like a newt
That is 100% true, but I and the the person I replied to were talking about Florida?
You‚Äôd be surprised by how many not so old rich people who don‚Äôt want to pay income taxes have moved to Florida. And they vote Republican.
They actually have a pretty solid red voting block with Hispanic immigrants. Hispanic vote has swung pretty hard from blue for Obama to red for Trump. Mainly because of "communism/socialist rhetoric and fox news."
Yeah‚Ä¶perfect timing on that exit, by the way. 

I wanted to leave then but it took longer for my husband to give up. He was born and raised here and can‚Äôt believe how bad it‚Äôs gotten.
Make a good faith effort to follow [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette).
Yes, the Soviets didn't _fully_ destroy the symbolism of the hammer and sickle, but they definitely tarnished it a bit, and you're right ... it never really became a symbol of hate either.

That said, the Soviets were never _really_ Socialists or Communists either ... they were just dictators with furry hats.  They just used the banner of Communism/Socialism to control all means of production, and enrich themselves while sucking the people dry.
I got better.
I‚Äôm not surprised.  I keep getting /r/Florida suggestions on my feed and everyone there is like ‚Äúhey does anyone know anyone who is actually from Florida?‚Äù

Eagerly awaiting Florida deciding to build a wall against retirees.
Correct - it‚Äôs not really Hispanic/Latin voters either. It‚Äôs primarily Cuban voters with historical trauma.

The moment they hear the word ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù they become absurdly irrational and combative.

Like, you could give them every great social benefit but the moment it‚Äôs ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù they will reject it violently to the detriment of their own well-being.

Or, in other words, exactly like your typical Republican cheering on the death of Medicare or being fully against universal healthcare while relying on insulin or other key prescription drugs just to literally survive.

Why are these clamps on my rear struts and what purpose do they service? 2011 Chevy Impala
I had a brake job done recently and I was told my car shouldn‚Äôt even have these. Something about only needed if your car is lowered or has a lift. I couldn‚Äôt remember which one. My car hits bumps really hard and makes loud thud noises on bumps. Could this be the cause or is that something else? Should I get these clamps removed or do I need them? Pictures 1 & 2 are left rear. Pictures 3 & 4 are right rear. 2011 Chevy Impala ~225,000 miles.

JC Whitney DIY lift kits, generally pieces of junk and should be removed very carefully.
These are to mask sagging springs. It‚Äôs a bandaid. Can be flipped the opposite way to compress the spring to lower it.
This is a hack's attempt at a suspension change.  I'd recommend removal.
Impala? that's so u can stack blades up unda there
Probably on the car to keep a larger diameter aftermarket wheel and tire combo from rubbing.  Assuming there's nothing wrong with the car's suspension you shouldn't have an issue removing.
Don't need those clamps. They are added on to raise the car slightly and they are not needed.

The bump noise might because of worn out struts which is not the fault of those clamps.
Really fat people put these on so the car doesn't drag on the ground. Also useful if you're transporting dead bodies. Considering this is an impala, either or both of these scenarios could be true.
They aren't clamps. Their purpose appears to reduce compression of the spring. No clue beyond that though, hopefully someone else knows.
Poor man‚Äôs lift kit‚Äî-
I can't believe these exist and people buy them. All this will do is bend your coils! Spacers are the only "acceptable" way to add a slight lift to coil sprung vehicles without new springs... And even, then they suck.

Remove those asap
Somebody tried to turn your impala into a donk!
Be easiest and safest to just swap your struts. Its only 5 bolts and a lot of expletives.
Basically the opposite of a clamp
These things are raising the ride height of the car the previous owner must have had big wheels and they rubbed so he jacked it up. Remove them and it will ride better
Probably lifted it for some 22‚Äôs that the PO took off before selling the car.
shitty suspension lift.
seems like a cheater fix to avoid the more costly replacement of the entire spring.
I just want to say, really good job getting a 2011 impala to that mileage. They‚Äôre reliable, but usually not that reliable so I‚Äôm impressed
Kind of like the Popeil Pocket Fisherman.  19.99
Someone used to run drugs in your car.
I could run this in the winter so I don't get stuck in the snow.
Helper brackets to keep it at the level it's suppose to be
CHEVY RIDIN HIGH BOI
Am I the only one here who remembers the w-body drag racing days and putting these or the G8 transportation spring blockers in the rear to prevent squat on launch?

Not saying that's the case here, but we used to do shit like that, lol
People talking about blowing a hole in your chest, only way that would happen is if you take the whole part off your car to take the thing off. Leave it in the car, loosen it or cut it. It‚Äôs not going to hurt you
In the 60s I put a torch to the springs on my 1952 caddy(lowrider),the weight of the car dropped to the wheel wells,had to put these in to spread the springs to lift car(real stupid kid 16yrs old  we called them spreaders
bootleg diy lift. i did that to my deville.
I started using Reddit because someone thought I should post my similar setup to r/redneckengineering . I used them to lower  my car though, my second ever post if you wanna scroll down my profile that far.  Not lower, so much as level. It sat like a horny cat when I bought it.
I'm guessing you bought the car used with those already on there. A previous owner probably put them on so he could fit some ugly 22" rims on it and never bothered to take them off when he put the stock wheels back on and sold it.
There not clamps they are spacers. To spread the coil for a firmer ride or to keep your fender from rubbing your tire if you have wider tires
Ha, nice. Agree with everyone here: They should be removed. Here in Australia, some of the import cars have them fitted at the factory, ONLY for transport. Ie. so they can belt them on and off of the boats and trucks with no fear of damaging bumpers.

  
Generally the cars ride like shit if they're left in.
Shit way to cure sagging springs
In answer to the questions posed, they are there to raise the spring, and thus the car, likely due to sag. They are also there to help sell the car without replacing the springs.
Someone did that because the springs are worn out for whatever reason.  Once removed, your car will sit lower by 3 to 4 inches. Watch out for speed bumps.
Lmfao!! You young bucks don‚Äôt know a cheap lift kit!? Dang! That‚Äôs how we stanced things back in day!
Whoever owed the car before you probably had big ass rims on it so they stuck them spacers in there to lift the car
It's a dodgy hack which raises and stiffens the suspension a bit. 

You probably want to put new springs in.
Install those instead of doing new struts
Those don‚Äôt do anything but damage your springs and make your vehicle unstable. Carefully remove them and throw them away.
I would look for used springs at a wreck lot.  the springs sagged so they added that clamp.
I wonder if they has this car lowered and heated the springs. When u heat the springs it lowers the car but makes them much weaker. If u take these out and the car drops significantly and rides like junk then you have had heated springs and it is time to change them.
You need new springs, that was a stop-gap
You springs are more than likely bad .that is why they are on your car .
To lift the car, the spings are worn
I tried those years ago - had a 64 bonneville convertible - rear end was sagging bad and replacement springs were not available- they were shit then - I‚Äôm sure the ones in the picture are no better
They probably often had the extra weight of many bodies in the trunk. It's to keep the car from bottoming out.
Looks like some kind of Chinese finger trap
You should just able to loosen them and take them off. Even if you cut them off the spring is attached to your car so it‚Äôs not going to hit you
Remove it by jacking the car up to remove tension from the strutsthe you can more safely remove the clamps
To raise the vehicle or compensate for worn out springs
Jack up the car and slowly release tension on those nuts until they can be easily removed. 

Use penetrating fluid/wire brush and wear safety glasses probably
Do you have a trailer hitch on this car?   I could see these being put on to prevent the rear from drooping too much with a trailer hooked up.  Either that or the previous owner was transporting lots of heavy things in the trunk.
Owner jacked it up to try and sell it.
I'd say to he safe, just take it to reputable mechanic and have them remove it. Another option is to buy a new set of struts/springs
Someone had some rims on that bitch.
Seeing the mileage of your vehicle,  the previous owner(s) may have added these lift/drop supports to compensate for sagging /worn springs.

Just something to consider if you decide on removing them.
Lift or increase load rating.
Cheap sorta lift kit, would recommend removing. Super easy it looks like, put some PB blaster or WD 40 on those bottom nuts, give them a loosen and it should come right out. Probably would lift the car up before doing it too.
Spring tension expander, remove it and your suspension might drop some, or was used for towing
Looks like a poverty lift kit
They pick up the ass so you don‚Äôt have to >;‚Äô‚Äô-P
Well, it's kinda like a push up bra....   But for trucks.
Saggy rear end
It's a 1990s cheap mechanism to raise or lower your car by an inch.  You can flip the brackets around and they will squeeze the spring.  It's currently set to spread the spring.
It's dumb that's what it is
Get another set to spread the originals lose.
Soak in pb blaster for a day or two
For added clearance for bigger rims tires I'd imagine.
It looks like you can just screw it back down. The bottom part of the coil looks like it has a covering on it so I don't think it's stuck there. 

The top, by the time you get it all the way screwed back into its smallest position, there might not be any tension on it. You may be able to hit it out.


I'd jack it up and go for it. But definitely carefully.


 Or I mean... you could take the struts off and take it to a shop. No shame in that approach.
I put a set of these on the back of a 78 2 door Malibu when I was 16 cuz I had really wide rally wheels with radials and blown out shocks. It was a fun car
They stiffen your rear springs.  Makes your car oversteer more.  (looser)
That many miles, if you care to fix it replace with new strut tower assembly‚Äôs, shocks are only good for about 80k and the springs may have issues do to having those on there for so long.
It makes the spring stiffer, and it can affect the steering of the car. But as long as it works leave it be!
50 heavy duty zip ties! 25 on each side should hold the pressure. Remove clamp and then cut zip ties one by one until the pressure just snaps the rest.
Spring anti theft device. Spring cartels
There are threads right through, can be safely removed without this nonsense. Just tighten right up after loosening lock nuts.
Why are there small holes in the spring?

How long have you had the vehicle?
As has already been written, JC Whitney sold these as a cheap way to slightly lift a car or truck. That also takes out one coil's worth of the spring from being springy, so it stiffens the spring.
You can always play it safe and replace the whole strut assembly. No need to mess with the clamp at all then.
A new strut VS trying to free potentially dangerous rusted clamps on a tension spring? Easy decision.
I'm guessing someone put the wrong sized wheels on the car but they rubbed,  so this was their fix.
Like a rollar coaster. Added risk to make it more exciting as you wait and anticipate the future failure thus creating a thrill ride right off the road‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs an easy diy fix.

If when operating power tools you don't have proper safety glasses, close your eyes for protection from damage due to flying debris.
springs are wore out, sagging so these were installed to get height back
I would imagine since this is here, when you hit bumps this prevents the spring from compressing and shock absorbing the bump, it will essentially just put all that force into the spring and this thing and right back to the tire so yea I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a rough ride in this lol
These things were used by people who wanted to lift up cars to fit ugly oversized rims. You can remove them but they warp and ruin the coil springs and honestly the spring should be replaced if you want to keep the car.
If someone asked, I missed it - does the car sit high, or is at a normal ride height?  If the latter, you may need new springs, and whether that's a DIY job or not depends a lot on whether you have the tools and what your confidence level is on working with struts.  I say this because those spring spacers may be compensating for springs that are sagging without them.  I guess if you remove them you will find out.

If you end up replacing springs you will likely want new bump stops, upper mounts, etc. etc. etc. as well, if those are the original struts you might want to get new struts while you're in there.  Or, if this is a beater car/you don't see yourself keeping it long term, you could buy a set of preassembled "quick struts" which come with new springs and all the hardware, making it an easy DIY job again.

Personally I don't use quick struts because I tend to drive sportier cars, so I want to pick my struts and springs (or reuse the originals) but for a high mileage Impala, quick struts can be a good option to just keep it safe and legal for another 4-5 years.
Somebody had rims
I found a pair in my dad‚Äôs shop and made steering wheel puller out for one lol
Choices are:

Paint them

Remove / replace with new

Look the other way

Sell the car "as is" before it breaks

Chrome plate the springs, and jack the car even higher

Forget you even saw them

The spring clamps are a cheap way to lift the car and make every joint in your body feel the road and get more headaches and feel like cool dude.
They are definitely limiting the travel your shocks can move. Someone put those on there to stiffen up the rear end to keep it from dragging perhaps
Ricer trying to lift the suspension
I've never messed with these before, but just from looking at it aren't they holding a section of the spring decompressed, not compressing a section? So couldn't you just tighten the nuts down on the bolts (relieving some pressure then jam a pry bar in the and twist them out?
Im more concerned with the metal the struts mount to, they lookin rough
Its a coil spring isolator, it keeps the suspension stable, eliminates rubbing in the strut housing, it also stabilizes the spring, you remove it you‚Äôll have more problems than squeaks or other problems with suspension, I would find a different mechanic , sounds like they‚Äôre not very knowledgeable
They get used for one of 2 reasons a shitty lift job or locking the shocks down so the tires don‚Äôt rub.
Just jack her up and see if they come off if not slowly undo it I doubt there much tension on it especially after in the air
That‚Äôs sounds about true. I have an old bronco that‚Äôs just rust. Everytime I shut the door part of the rust falls off onto the ground
$5.00 lowering kit.
Wow! Someone didn't want to change shocks. Or perhaps they wanted to stiff in the shock in the dumbest way possible..
Spring jackers for a super cheap lift or to prevent sag when the boot is LOADED (with bodies or drugs or whathaveyou). Almost certainly bends the shocks and definitely kills the springs so its probably time for a new set of coilovers.
Cheap way of raising the vehicle
The spring was sagging (weak) and someone put that in there to level out the car.
It‚Äôs the budget fix so you can fill your car up with fat girls ü§§
Someone raised that up to fit some bigger wheels.
Stance, yo
Rent spring compressor from autozone and cut the shit off easy
How big are the tires/rims? Is the fender rolled?
Those are to strengthen the spring because it had gotten soft. I personally installed them on one of my cars. This is alternative to coil spring replacement. üöô
Have to ask. Why would someone raise an Impala?
That may be the stupidest ish I‚Äôve come across on this thread.
I can‚Äôt imagine why anyone would lift an impala
Lift to keep the rims from rubbing
Once went on a long trans Canada trip with friends, and the car was so loaded, thatbthe rear suspension was taking a beating and car was lifted in the front. Installed these things which ‚Äúraised‚Äù the rear, or in reality prevented the rear from sagging now, and we went on our trip. Took them off after the trip. They are spacers. The old/different version of these

2011 impala you say?  I guess is that your car was owned my someone who wanted BIG wheels, and this is how they either raised the car, or just held it from moving so the wheels would fit.
Ooh! Ooh! I know this one!  These are used as a cheap, simple way to level vehicle out when a spring starts to sag prematurely!

üòÉ!
Looks like they‚Äôre doing next to nothing in terms of lifting when the spring isn‚Äôt compressed, so I‚Äôd just cut them off
springs likely have sagged or the previous owner installed them because they wanted the rear to be higher than without them
When using your angle grinder make sure you do the Saftey Squint and you will be fine. That‚Äôs my only advice today !!!!
That's a weird clamp. I thought clamps compressed not extend.....
drug mule car?   load it up heavy, no sagging, and that 2011 impala disappears into the flow of traffic unseen..
Previous owner's "levelling kit"
20' of det cord should remove it ok
Smuggling vehicle
Cheap way to lower the ride height.
I used something like this on my 1968 Impala to level the car. The spring on one corner was sagging.
They are to raise the ride height. If the car sits okay leave them alone. They are not a problem.
They are a cheap way to add height to your suspension.   Possibly the tire would otherwise rub on the fender without them.  If that is why they were installed then the tire size is too large or your suspension has sagged over time.  Either way not a recommended way to deal with suspension or fender clearance.
These are likely the original struts. Notice the bearing plate is rusted through. 

Time for new struts. Monroe's can be had for under $100 each.
Just get it airborne, they‚Äôll come out by themselves üòÇ They usually don‚Äôt last long enough to even rust before they exit the chat.
Springs are shot and need replaced. Those are used to hold up or pull springs together
What's going on at the top of those struts?
They probably put them there because the springs are clapped out, typical Impala things. I'd just replace the entire strut, cheap and easy.
These are just coil spring lifts. Originally meant to add a little more stiffness to the coil spring. Some used it for small trailers to add some did it for a little more clearance. Usually, 4 were used, not one. One will only make the coil shift to one side. 
They come in different forms now, too. Some are rubber twist ins, some add to the strut cap or spring pedestal.
Jack it up
Old lift kitüòÇ
Remove them and find out when you hit a speed bump lol
Torch them, gradually adding heat across the length of the bolts with an oxyacetylene torch. They‚Äôll slowly give and release tension.

Did this guy survive the removal process?  How‚Äôs the bumps?  I need N update
The old sht lifts
They supposedly increase the strength of the springs, usually fitted to cars that tow a trailer/caravan.
What they actually do is ruin the springs...üôÑ
Oh boy had them on my 64 biscyann so cool to lift the car until one broke 25 miles from home and no tools  to the left left left Indy 500 all the way home
Tighten them more to ensure proper tension then get close enough to inspect you are cutting in one of the threads and cut all the way through they will gently fall to the floor
Your hearing loud thuds cause the shock is blown. 

Whoever did this did to stiffen the spring so it would help prevent bottoming out the shock (which you are doing when you hit a bump. 

At this point you need to replace both components. Do so before you send that shot thru the tower
Get a bolt spanner and butter it up then spank it and twist till these suspension parasites are terminated.
 UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN....
Full send. At your own risk of course
Stock rear coils were sagging, this causes a negative camber and extreme inner tire wear. A quick fix and obviously in this case a permanent one is to lift the rear suspension back to stock height. Dont waste your time removing without upgrading the rear coils first.
idk, but I just did my struts ob my 06 infiniti m35x with my real mechanic uncle, and he took them off and said they're just a useless waste of time. car drives perfectly fine without them, no issues.

not important
They're not lift kits. They support the spring from sagging
Someone had wheels on that car..
Spring Boosters, they had bigger rims on it at some point. Just remove them if not needed.
Cheap lift kit
The reply about ‚ÄúJC Whitney lift kit‚Äù is the right answer ?
The clamps on your rear struts are likely bump stop retainers, typically used on cars that have been lowered to limit strut compression and prevent damage. If your car hasn‚Äôt been lowered, these clamps may be unnecessary and could be contributing to the harsh ride and loud thuds when hitting bumps. Given your car‚Äôs mileage (225,000 miles), it‚Äôs also possible that worn struts are the primary cause of the issue. I recommend having both the clamps and suspension components checked at [Matrix Auto Repair New Westminster ](https://matrixautorepair.com/)to see if the clamps are needed or should be removed, and to assess the condition of the struts.
Just a hack method of adjusting ride height. This method ruins the spring, and makes every aspect of suspension geometry worse. This is just the uninformed making literally EVERYTHING worse. Stop it.
 These are to compensate for vehicle ride hight, with mother fucking worn out springs,  that is what happens when you go fucking cheap and only replace the shock portion of the strut assy.
Haven't seen these in years.
Get a set of spring compressors, put them on, cut those off, release spring compression tool.
Cheap way to make it ride lower?

![gif](giphy|aztdjHO5QbjLa)
Spring compressors. Keeping it at what ever height it is at. 
Take them off and ride height will be taller..
Take tire off, hook chain to one vehicle the other end to the diy lift kit drive fast
Remove it, according to ChatGPT. Even rubbers aren‚Äôt recommended.
Looks like a cheap spring compresser that somehow flipped inside out as a "DIY" lift kit.
[removed]
The trouble is, now that they are rusted, how do you safely release the tension on them so that they don‚Äôt blow a hole in your chest when you cut them off?
It's a 2011 vehicle with 250k miles just replace the unit with loaded struts and call it a day.
Like the old leaf spring shackles. Some were absurdly long and did a lot of damage. Poor mans lift kit we called them.
This...and from what I remember, you can flip them to drop your whip too. Sketchy set-up for sure.
If I didn‚Äôt see this comment I would‚Äôve automatically just thought that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there.
Just be happy they‚Äôre not welded in.
I had an El Camino where a previous owner put those on. Eventually one of the springs actually broke where that thing was attached.
Lifted impala?
Yes
The opposite of clamps for one!
[removed]
Yeah just looking at these makes me uneasy
They are also used to lower your car by clamping coils.
They're homemade spacers to keep your coil from bottoming out and the back of the car off the ground. Need new set of preloaded struts my guy
In my younger days this was a cheap ($9.99 per corner) way to drop the car an inch. We had fun back then.
And they are sagging because the strut tower is rotting away.
not an attempt at a suspension change, but to lift sagging springs without changing the springs.
Ain't nobody gonna mention the strut mounts that are mostly nonexistant? Them spacer shits is the least of their concern. I'd recommend not touching that shit at all and drive it til the wheels fall off...cuz it don't look like long.
But there‚Äôs got to be a better way. Better way
Could I, Would I Should I break em?

I gots to chop bladesssssssss
Blades ?
So I have a similar bump and clunk issue in mine coming from the passenger rear. I figured it was the loose spare tire stuff and then maybe the exhaust but those don't seem to be it. Is my problem more likely struts/suspension 
?
Could be hauling dead fat people.
Also these are needed when you always drive around with 7 people with you.
Simultaneously
My first thought was to hide overloading so "da police" will not catch them.
People who run 26" rims on rubber band tires but are too cheap to have the proper suspension work done to lift the vehicle and/or keep the tires from rubbing. 

Exhibit A: it's a 2011 Impala
They actually are clamps if you flip the brackets upside down, you can pinch two coils together for lowering the car. They should always be used in pairs, if you use them at all.
Used by smugglers to limit the appearance of a loaded vehicle by law enforcement
Hooptie!

It‚Äôs a 2011.  Bring a sawsall, an air chisel, cutoff wheels and a torch.  

Shits gonna be borked all over
Just restating what everyone else has said, these arent good they fuck up the way your suspension travels. If you can‚Äôt get a good reach on them might be worth taking the whole strut and spring out to see if there‚Äôs anything else funky
Aw man taking me back. I wonder if they still sell those
With the Gangster Music!
We used a 2x4 wedged into the coil springs
I used these spacers to jack my 80 olds cutlass 2 door up for stance
Just jack it up?
how tuff are those clamps to be able to withstand constant 2 ton weight on it?
I think the bit with the holes isn't actually part of the spring. Probably a rubber piece that fits into the last coil of the spring
No spring compressor needed. Simply loosen those bolts and pull it out.

Not a safety inspector here. 
I am a big advocate of the safety squint. 
As you were.

Yep, someone had weak coils so they reversed the tool to raise the coil to even out ride height, this smells like jean shorts and dirt driveways.

More like the alcohol will make you able to take the hit. Don't know whether you pass out due to the alcohol or by uppercut. Morning after should be about equally painful
Jacking the car up by the frame so the wheels sag down should stretch the springs and take some tension off
They dont even look that bad. Some kroil and a wire brish should be fine.
You call that rust? Cute.
[deleted]
What if I want to blow a hole in my chest
I'm envisioning a Sawzall ducttaped to a jockey stick and safety squints.

I also do work on garage door springs.
The real danger with springs like these are the springs themselves, specifically the inertia they can create under their own weight.

This shitty little ‚Äúlift‚Äù bracket, i reckon you could pry it outta there once the car is jacked up , they most likely wouldn‚Äôt have much tension on them because logically they are only ‚Äúcrushed‚Äù by two ‚Äúlimbs‚Äù of the spring.
I‚Äôd def try unscrewing em first but would also fearlessly pry them outta there if they were seized up.
Dude,those aren‚Äôt even that rusty. Soak them in power lube and they‚Äôll likely move no problem.
That's why I said very carefully.  I'd jack it up until the wheels are hanging, then torch them off with a very long nozzle.
Cutting them off is a task for a son in law, watching from the porch is for us master techs
If you are good with a torch you can get them soft enough to slowly release tension. The trouble is not getting too soft that they blow up in your face.

Remember kids, always wear your safety squints
Hit em with a torch. They'll come right off
They are not dangerous, just unscrew them.
Those will come right out.
You can use one from a new kit to apply a little bit more tension on it and remove the old one when it is loose. Then remove the new one.
It probably comes right out once the tension is off the spring and the spring isn't pinching the tool. You might not even need to loosen it, depends on how much sag the spring had before they installed it.
You see those threads?  That means it‚Äôs probably a few months old.
You're right. Just get a whole new car at this point.
Put on your safety squints, turn your head, and send it.
Install a good lifting device next to it, uninstall the rusted device by whatever method, uninstall the good lifting device.
Use a newer JC Whitney DIY Lift kit to expand them more, remove the thing.. and then uh. repeat. over and over, and over again!.
Cut them off with a grinder and put your face really close to it. That way it will go through your face and not your chest.
They aren‚Äôt compressing the springs, they‚Äôre pushing them apart.
Hire an intern
that is light rust, just use a wrench and dont cut them off
Pull the strut, use the proper tools to disassemble.
Use a spring compressor for safety backup and grind away maybe?
I‚Äôd just do the struts and call it a day. No sense killing yourself over 150$
Best bet is to loosen them with an impact slowly. They wodn't blow off when done properly.
replace the whole rear shock/strut, coil over . whatever you wanna call it. About $300 in parts for piece of mind ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I‚Äôm not seeing why it would come flying off towards you. It‚Äôs vertically stressed why are you thinking it will come off towards you?
oxy/acety.  Melting them will release tension
Im gonna assume you dont live where it snows?üòÇ
A valid solution if you have the money.  I'd be concerned about what other high-tech mods have been done.
These were even poorer.
There were even worse versions, solid chunks of metal with a helix shape you just twisted in between the coils.
It shouldn't be there.
After another winter they'll be rusted in, the winter after that they'll be rusted out.
I can't explain what people try to do to their cars.
Donk attempt likely.
Yes, very versatile pieces of shit.
Those are not home made, I haven't looked for them in years but they use to be a staple of low end auto parts retailers.
When we were young lads we always cut the springs. Most of the time we‚Äôd cut them while still in the car. I cut more spring out then I‚Äôd keep.

Worst idea is when I had a 1st gen Integra. Found out they were torsion bar in the front so i files out the key way and turned them‚Ä¶.then I cut the rears haha. 

Like you said we had fun back then and still here to tell the story.
Or raise the car for wider tires (1970s)
I just cut a coil off with an angle grinder
Cheap fun
This just happened to my rusty mercury mariner back strut‚Ä¶ totally rusted out mount or tower or whatever‚Ä¶
They used to have rubber spacers you could wedge into your springs for that.

Based on the vernacular, shanks and shit to cut fools with
It can be but better get someone you trust to verify. Otherwise just have someone make nothing is loose or broken in the rear suspension or brakes and you can then drive as you then don't have any safety issues.
I'm not a structural engineer but just based on looking at it that seems like a really sketchy method. You're reducing total compression by isolating two specific points, which I imagine creates stress points around them and also puts the rest of the spring in greater stress.
Lol you could not run a car with stuff like that for more than a few days where I live. And I'm very happy about it.
Oh wow, now there's a use I wouldn't have guessed.
A 2011 is old to you?! Uhhhhh here in the rust belt those look brand new, shit looks easy

Before jacking the car up, break the nuts loose.  Finish removing them once jacked and lifted.

Exactly, jack the car up and remove with an open ended spanner. Would be a different story if they were compressing the spring.
Oh, you are right. OP can just leave them a few weeks and they‚Äôll rust off.
It is under compression. It is like holding a wet watermelon seed between thumb and for finger. When it gets loose you don‚Äôt know which way it will go.
Gotta be careful not to get the springs themselves hot and ruin the heat treatment on them
Oh, I think you're right...I remember one that looked like a brace (with dog bone shaped ends) that 1/4 turned into place as well. Totally forgot about these things.
Ah.
They were great when I was 17 when trying to lower my Cutlass Supreme 2‚Äù back in 1988 without having to remove and cut springs.  I would never ride that cheap auto zone spring claps on my coils‚Ä¶lol
Survivor bias?
And here I am debating for a year about whether to lower my truck.
2nd CRX, lowered it by heating up the springs.
When I was in high school I had an old Mazda B2000 rwd pickup. Cranked those torsion bars down and put lowering blocks on the rear. Slammed that ride to the ground.
Bought a 84 rabbit with cut springs - cut so far they weren't actually supporting anything anymore, and the dampers were totally gone. Driving it home it would spontaneously change lanes over bumps. Good times.
I know an even worse idea than cutting the springs to lower a car: Heat the springs up to a temperature where the weight of the car permanently compresses the spring (don't do this, obviously)
Did this to a second gen integra and crx back in the day. I miss those nights of turning wrenches with friends even tho we were idiots and didn‚Äôt know it yet
Cousin and his friends would put 4 bricks under each corner then take a blow torch to the springs to lower them.
I always used a hack saw‚Ä¶. For safety. I was worried about the angle grinder damaging the spring‚Ä¶.. I was not a smart person back then.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying man, a torch, some WD-40 and mild degree of patience will get everything done without hacking anything apart. 

I own 20+ year old vehicles in Michigan and only twice I‚Äôve needed to hack shit apart. One bolt was for a lower control arm and the other were sway bar end links purely because it was faster to zip the bolts than fight the rust.
Just depends.  You don‚Äôt know what you got til you‚Äôre in there.  Especially for a home gamer

I used to live in Chicago,  JC Whitney and Warshawskis were famous for bad solutions to automotive problems.  The catalogs were full of absolute  junk interspersed with some actually useful items.  If you went there for something you needed it was always out of stock.

I flipped the keys and cranked the t bars on my ranger back in the day. Then hooked a few batteries up in series and threw a 7018 rod in some jumper cables to weld in a couple trailer leaf spring perches to flip the rear axle.

We just use pure rust and form it in to whatever part we need here in Michigan.

Planes were returning to airbases filled full of holes from enemy fire.

The general said reinforce those areas where the planes have been shot.

A tech pointed out that these are the planes that returned home, so they proved you could be shot there and make it home, reenforce the parts that weren't shot, cause odds are on the planes that didn't make, they were shot there, which caused the plane to crash.

Tommybuilt T7 Part 2
This will be my last post about this thing until I have an update that is more positive. I absolutely hate being negative about things but this information had to be shared. I do not know who this guy is in these big FB groups but he seemingly knows everything about these guns yet the only information he shares is negative and degrading. I can confidently say that regardless of what this guy says, and Tom telling me that he tests these guns with Hornady Black ammo. Mine does in fact not work with it even with about 450rds through the gun. Along with the other issues this gun had for me out of the box that I showed in my previous video. I am not trying to shit on Tom as a person nor a business owner I am simply sharing information that I found to be useful. I now have about 500rds of Hornady Black that are useless to me and if somebody else can save some money by watching my videos then great! Thank you to this subreddit for allowing me to share my experiences. And I hope that Tom only takes this as feedback to make changes in future designs or is more transparent about what ammo should be used and the break in period required. 
That dude was defending Tommy's rep like his life depends on it lmfaoo
That last 40 seconds was unreal. 8 failures. What a piece of garbage.

4k and a break in period. Sounds bitch made.
I‚Äôve never had to break in anything that wasnt made of stamped steel. Enormous cope.
I don't even know Sirris Sirris and I fuckin hate that dude already.  What a fuckin chud. 

I hope ya get your shit running OP, and don't dare let those fools tell you that the gun is without fault. I'm my opinion, anything beyond 250 rounds should be well and truly broken in when it comes to rifle-esque cartridges. The muzzle velocity and speed of the action should have that thing smoothed out well enough before you ever get to 400ish rounds. 

Not trying to shit on Tommy Built or Wilson Combat or whoever else... but when I hear about a high priced firearm requiring a break-in, I die a little inside. Either get it smooth at the factory, or shoot the fucking hell out of it before ya send it out. I'd be willing to tolerate break-in on a Tisas or a Rock Island or a PSA, but I'll be damned If a four figure gun won't run at least ONE type of ammo right out of the box.

BuT dId YoU bReAk It In?

It's hard to break in something with constant failure to feeds...
The HKpro mods are embarrassing the fuck out of themselves with this shit. The gun has major problems on a mass scale and it cannot be kept secret no matter how much they wish it to be. They are trying really hard to sweep the problems under a rug and make it seem like no biggie meanwhile a shitload of people that just dropped almost 4k on a gun can't get it to run right.¬†Tom is a big boy. He's also very honorable. Im sure hell fix it. Im sure he can handle the hiccups without grown men cheerleading.
>the MLOK isn't his fault

It literally fucking is, he's the one who decided to put it there.

The Sirrus guy is an absolute TommyBuilt dickrider. He has some kind of close relationship with Tom because he posts most of the updates on products, problems, etc. Not a good look either way.

Lol how is "break in" going to fix any of this
‚ÄúYou either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain who charges $3k for a gun that the customer needs to break in.‚Äù    -Harvey Dent
Aren‚Äôt the g36 Tommy builds also trash?
Crazy that a $4k gun is super picky with ammo, but my $400 CZ will eat through anything without a hiccup.
Thank you for keeping us informed. Thanks even more for saving me a bunch of money.
FB groups are so cancerous it‚Äôs insane. Just a hive mind circle jerk where all they talk about it having sex with one another‚Äôs dad, literally.
Lmao imagine kicking someone out for pointing out it has issues is such a fortnite crybaby .
Definitely sticking with the PS90. I can't even recall it ever jamming on me no matter what ammo I used.
It blows me away when people suggest that a gun should run correctly after 400+ rounds. Like dude, no, a good gun should just run.
I don‚Äôt have a dog in the fight. All I‚Äôll say is that the gun is pretty cool and it‚Äôs a bummer that people are having issues with it. I think (guess?) Tommybuilt is pretty well regarded in the HK world and hope that he works with people to get their guns sorted out and working well.
Hard to break in a gun that can‚Äôt shoot üòÇ
I recall Fudd Busters doing an episode on the T36C where half of the polymer was more mushy than a rubber dog toy.

I missed the drop, I guess it was a blessing in disguise, I do appreciate what Tom Bostic tries to do but the guy is a major league shithead every time he drops a new thing.

The only reason we don't have civv G36s and MP7s is because of Germany's export laws and hatred of the American citizenry. The German government has perpetual ownership over the rights to HK so you cannot even get around it without reverse engineering and rebuilding it. So for brand aficionados...no other way around it than TBT.

I really hope Tom and his groupies unfuck themselves, fix these, and produce more because I totally want one still. Just not in this state.
Jesus what‚Äôs that guys problem? A 3-4k dollar gun having issues is pretty rough. Hope the gun gets figured out for you sir!
Lol you‚Äôre supposed to provide critical feedback and let them know what breaks or doesn‚Äôt work well on an early production so that it can be fixed. Siris just seems delusional.
I'm gonna be honest, I really REALLY don't get the whole HK thing in general.  From the guns themselves to the nature of the company to the people trying to clone them and then this whole shady reproduction business, I flat out don't understand it.  It's like some kind of gunsoomer battered wife sydrome.
I have a Tommy PSG8 ‚Äúlower‚Äù on my SL8.. it works and is a mild improvement on the stock setup since I can run (some) AR trigger groups in it. However if my lowers build quality and fitment are an indication of what one of these T7s, I wouldn‚Äôt pay nickel one for one of these.
The 3D 2A community will have a working MP7 before too long.
Siris sirus is the guy that squeezes of a round while the gun is down and he isn‚Äôt aiming .
Like all this criticism is valid.

First off its not an HK so its not going to work like a real MP7 does. (Granted the real ones have issues after a lot of suppressed use)

But also like, it is an expensive ass gun it shouldn't need a break in and you should expect it to work.

Some people apparently don't have issues other people do and when you're paying the price of this gun it shouldnt be like buying a century gun of maybe youll get a good one.

But to like go after someone who is having legit problems, not cool.
Keltec is teasing a 5.7 pistol, might be time for an upgrade
Damn dude, save some jam for the rest of us...
I'll add my 2 cents on Sirris specifically - Ive done several deals with him on the forums, in both directions (although I think usually him buying from me); he's been a good dude to work with. That being said I'm not buddy buddy with him by any stretch of the imagination, and I've been pretty disappointed by the visceral reaction from him towards people posting on the FB page and his censorship of issues or anyone that had to anything remotely negative to say about the T7. 

I don't know Tom personally either, but I fully believe that he's trying to do his best and will take care of people who have issues; Sirris as far as I can tell is a friend of Tom's and he stumps for him a lot, but I don't believe there's any employer/employee type relationship there. I personally feel his antics don't looks good for Tom though because there's a strong appearance of an association there, and his attitude to the customers with issues has been very offputting lately to say the least; I'm trying to keep the mental delineation between Sirris and Tom though. 

I get his (and the other members on HKPros) mentality that they want people to go to Tom first instead of airing their grievances to the internet, but to me that is more apt for non-constructive content that would only serve to be defamatory to Tom. Content like this which just show the issues they are experiencing with the product to serve as a warning/heads up/ or whatever you want to call it, to me is a good thing cause it brings awareness, and people can make educated purchasing decisions. 

Is every gun like this? No, probably not. Am I glad that I know the risk is there before I purchase one? Yes, I am.
Keep sharing OP, we are following this for updates.
One expensive bolt action
someone really should just make a 5.7mm direct blowback gun that just looks exactly like an mp7
Dang, that's a lot of F2F in that last mag. I'd be returning any firearm if I had that much trouble with it

"jUsT bReAk It In" no bro if I have to break in something as expensive as a firearm for it to work properly it isn't worth the price. Imagine if you had to put up with 10k really horrible, clunky miles on a new vehicle before it worked properly. Would anyone keep that kind of vehicle?

I have no dog in this fight, just thinking about the malfunctions. Have you tried the Hornady ammo unsuppressed? A lot of the feed failures look like bolt override which could be from excessive bolt speed related to the suppressor use. Obviously that would still be a problem Tommybuilt should have identified, just trying to understand the issue better.
That dude who posted on Facebook is what is wrong with the 2A community. Way too many people defend all these companies putting out dog shit that doesn't work.
I suspect Tommybuilt rushed these to market after word got out that PSA was making a "clone" and a couple other companies dropped parts kits / chassis to convert pistols into (vaguely) lookalike MP7s.
Let‚Äôs be clear about some shit, because I‚Äôve seen this shit with numerous guns and I‚Äôm quite tired of the bullshit:

**IF A GUN NO MATTER THE COST OR MATERIAL, REQUIRES A ‚ÄúBREAK IN‚Äù PERIOD / NEEDS TO BE BROKEN IN TO WORK AS INTENDED, THEN IT IS NOT A GOOD GUN. PERIOD.**

You‚Äôre talking about fucking with tolerances in order for a gun or part to work as needed. That shit literally makes no sense. The firearm has to beat itself up to fit and work with other pieces because a manufacturer was too fucking lazy to ensure quality and performance before letting it leave the factory. In this case, TommyBuilt knew he had demand behind this shit so he knew yall would dickeat, run to plop your credit cards down and buy it no matter what. Therefore he didn‚Äôt give two fucks if it worked properly or not. Once again, **he got yall.**

But this also speaks to you dudes in the community with more money than the average gun person. When are yall gonna learn to stop being suckas? Honestly. The reason that these companies keep doing this bullshit is because yall are so quick to pay for the bullshit they put out instead of standing down and talking with your wallets. Yall fuel their mediocrity with every hyped gun that comes out. Stand up, shit.
I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve seen it. This guy posted another video of him shooting off his last 60 rounds of ammo he bought for this gun. The Hornady black was trash and the other brand that starts with an F idk how to spell worked pretty alright.
Ive never really heard of anything solid of Tommybuilt guns unfortunately.
That's a few too many failure to feeds for me. I wonder if there a bur on the feed ramps or if they need to be polished more. Also I thought it took about 500 rds to break in a weapon system. Either way I hope there's a fix for this.
My 2 cents, in my experience anything TommyBuilt runs MUCH better with as many German parts as possible. I have the TMP and TG36 and made sure to use German parts and they run great. I had another TMP from his vendors and it did not run well. ¬†I believe his designs are fine, his sub contractors on the other hand have poor QC or don‚Äôt have tight enough tolerances which leads to his guns not running well when assembled. ¬†Guys have to remember this isn‚Äôt the first drop, this is just the first drop of ¬†using all his parts. He did a separate run of about 25 a while back with German parts kits. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a video of those not running.¬†

I will say Tommy has excellent customer service. He privately sent me a video on exactly how to file a g36 lower to fit his receiver. ¬†He milled my UMP bolt for me the same day he got it and turned it around the next day. ¬†He will resolve issues with his product.¬†
Should review bomb the piss out of the website
Went to the ramge with some co workers about 4 months ago. One guy brought his new tommybuilt g36 clone and it was doing this kind of stuff. Just wouldn't run at all. Another guy brought his absolute cheapest possible psa ar15 and it ran flawless after we showed him you have to oil the gun. Buddy with the g36 was very disappointed and pretty peaved that his very expensive rifle would cycle a full mag without a malfunction.

Is Tommy not going to warranty or even look at it?
That dude definitely has a Cybertruck in the shop that he hasn‚Äôt been able to drive yet, but is thanking Elon for it every day.
People are fan boys and get mad at others for there negative post lol keep posting
$3.5k shouldn‚Äôt have a break in honestly. A $450 gun shouldn‚Äôt have a break in. I would expect it to not eat some ammo. But 3.5k I should be able to put the shittiest of shit ammo through it and it run flawless.
Buy more ammo, break in until 1,000 rounds, still shit? But more ammo break in until 2,000 rounds still doesn‚Äôt work? Buy more ammo break in until 5,000 rounds‚Ä¶.Tommy is a secret malfunction trainer/4.6 salesman.  This is better than any course because it‚Äôs unexpected and more expensive.
I'm sorry since when is having to put 1000 rounds into a gun to make it function normally considered normal???
Sad face üòî I wanted one of these but guess this ain‚Äôt the one. I will say my g36 from Tommy functions flawlessly with anything I put thru it. But that doesn‚Äôt mean everything he puts out is good
Welp glad I didn‚Äôt buy mine yet. Really hope he gets this worked out but until I see better I‚Äôll jsut spend my money at Templar Precision buying more caliber barrels for my ACR
I had the comment section expanded and thought he had it in super safe when in fact it was not.

No way I would pay that price tag to risk getting this garbage
Dude didn‚Äôt look happy at the end
I‚Äôm convinced Tom has the only working T7 guys
I honestly would‚Äôve been more happy if PSA released an MP7 clone. They seem to be more reliable at using people to beta test products
~~Tommy~~ Trash Built
Hard pass on Tommy built after that ridiculous guy with his crap attitude. Made a point about break in but still loser
I‚Äôve been HK fan for more than 20 years, Tommy built tactical has always came off as an egotistical prick. Before mp5 Turkish clone came to market, ghilliebear, Dakota tactical, Turner fabrications were other builders who made quality clones. Tommy built always came off as I‚Äôm a master at what I do so stay in the que for years for a clone to be built. Funny to see these mp7s not going so well at launch.
Once I saw Summery, I stopped reading
How does it run without the can?
Prob bad mags
I got first rounds through mine today. Out of 150 I only had one double feed in the middle of the second mag, besides that it worked fine, including a mag dump on my last mag. This was the Fiocchi 40gr shooting unsuppressed. 

Also didn‚Äôt seem to have any of the QC issues this guy did. So it‚Äôs not like every gun is having major issues.
Fuck that. I‚Äôm sorry but i also simply don‚Äôt buy into a fucking break in period. That‚Äôs hilarious. These are catastrophic failures. Not hiccups.
What facebook page is this Sirris Sirris dude on?

I've shot cheap to very expensive bolt guns,shotguns, ar15 and hand guns. I have no clue about these. What I see is the safety selector above safe when he was ranting at first. When the shooting started it was pointing between fire and safe. It was on mute so no idea what he said.
Absolutely cope
It‚Äôs sounds dry as fuck.
Bro looks like a wojak
That's actually not bad if it's a dry firearm. I watched 2 videos and he never mentioned what he used to oil it. If he clp's it in the next video and it still acts up I'll be on his side.
probably the mag, dude
Could this be a potential mag problem? Are they authentic HK mags or Tommybuilt?
Dude you should check out the HKPro forum on it for pure entertainment. That Sirris dude is such a clown the way he is instantly threatened for any criticism of the platform. He definitely has some personal relationship with Tom and slobs all over his knob acting like paying customers should be thankful just to breathe the same air. What a tool
It's wild. Him and the fan boys were telling me that I shouldn't have released my video on the issues we had, saying that I'm ruining Tommy's reputation or something lmao.
Like dude I'm just reviewing the gun in the state I got it in
Probably his burner account lol
He's a massive shill and Tom doesn't even need him but he does it anyway.
I‚Äôm glad you said this as I‚Äôve always thought it was strange how he rides Tom‚Äôs cock. He‚Äôs a dick riding douchebag.
Who are you taking about. I just read this guys post and saw his video and then this comment. Who are you referring to?  Who is defending who?
Brought to you by the Book of Boeing.
I saw an [interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hPolURAmJc) on the design of the T7.

TLDW: The auto sear on the real gun serves an important function for safety/reliability. Without it, there are malfunctions that can occur.
And that was to the point of ‚Äúbroken in‚Äù‚Ä¶ sure looked broken
I‚Äôm gonna go with ammo on that one

Edit: 

To those downvoting, if it runs 60rds with one failure for 1 type of ammo and malfunctions every other or every few rounds with the other type would that not be an ammo problem?
Kimber told me that I needed to put 750 rounds through a custom II when I told them it wouldn‚Äôt make it through a whole mag
‚ÄúI test it with this ammo and it functions perfectly‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have to break it in‚Äù

Choose one
PSA products so far have never failed me
Lol this exactly right. I dropped thousands on a HK SP5 and it required zero break in. It just runs flawlessly.
the only time I'm even semi ok with it is HK.

relatedly, it's also why you should always just buy used HKs. with ammo prices today, letting someone else break in the gun and decide it shoots like shit is a $200-$400 discount right there.
Hk‚Äôs own manuals on the 91, and the mp5s recommend a thousand round break-in
My beretta 1301 had to be broken in. First range trip it just wouldn‚Äôt cycle more than 2-3 target loads without something. It would eject the shell, barely, but didn‚Äôt have enough pressure to trip the shell release and chamber another one. Looked around online and saw that it was kinda common and that the solution was to buy 50-75!rounds of buck/dove/turkey/slugs, anything with a lot of pressure behind it, and just mag dump them as fast as you can so that‚Äôs what I did and it‚Äôs never given me an issue with any ammo since then and that things round count is well north of 10k.
Imagine telling that to anyone who‚Äôs life depends on that gun.
Reminds me of Apple telling people they were "Holding the Phone Wrong".
A good firearm doesnt need a "break in" and doesnt need specific ammo. My glocks dont, my walthers dont, my sigs dont. Hell the cheap psa 5.7 pistol didnt need that stuff. But omfg the kimber 1911 wouldnt run on any ammo after any amount of rounds.
Ya having to break in any firearm for mechanical functionality is bullshit, especially $1000 plus firearms. Every firearm should be tested to perfection no matter the cost of ammo. It should never be on the end user.
psa is trash built. Thats facts. 

  
Looks like these mp7s might be built to psa specs lmao.
You pay $100,000 for a car and it has a break in period. Guns are machines and machines need break in periods.
Might as well just get a B&T TP9

Just looking at SIRRIS SIRRIS fb page, complaining about politics, people, and shitting on those who criticize what he likes is his entire personality. Doesnt get invited to many parties, id imagine.
Exactly. From a mechanical engineering standpoint, there‚Äôs literally no good excuse for requiring a customer to go through a break in process on a firearm.

If your company prides itself on tolerance stacking, manually perform the break in yourself at the factory. Even then, I‚Äôd be inclined to believe your design is just flawed at that point anyway. Requiring a customer to sit through hours of jams to break in springs that are incorrect strength or mate surfaces together with whatever procedure they think will work is shitty. Starting to realize tommybuilt is a grift
My wife has a rock island that has ran like a top since she bought it. 

Break ins are a joke.
Yes exactly. We are all now along for the ride.
The anger of having to break in your $3500 semi-automatic clone as a bolt action.
> The HKpro mods are embarrassing the fuck out of themselves with this shit. 

Apparently haven't heard of the Streisand effect. Been watching and liking everyone's YouTube videos today.
Perfect
I'd bet you $38.50 and an ice cream sandwich that he's a Tommy Built Investor, employee, or family member.
Not sure, but I figured I would try it out.
Don't need to break it in if it's already broken!
I've never been a huge subscriber of long break in periods either. I know that it's a real thing up to a certain point, but it's mainly the smoothness of the action where metal touches metal and slides/rotates. I've definitely gotten ahold of some rough AKs and cheapo 1911s, both of which got infinitely smoother with a few hundred shots. But if the gun straight up doesn't work, then you need more than a break-in
Yes
Mine did this exact thing
this! you can get a p10c for 299..
Facebook groups say the same about reddit lol 
I'm happy to see both sides.
To be fair, just about every group on the internet can be cancerous.
Calling other social media a circlejerk on Reddit is something though. 

Not that I disagree
I know a guy that bought a gun for CCW but never shot it. It's still brand new. 

Thankfully he got a Glock so I'm not worried about it having to be broken in to work. 

But same concept. If good, it should work right outside the box.

They have the rep they do for a reason. Their firearms have great reputations because they are great guns. The MP5 is still only now staring to get pushed out of service, and it‚Äôs still popular on the civilian side. I like the UMP pistols and I know people like the striker fired guns they offer. This particular thing with the mp7 is just because it‚Äôs an iconic firearm that‚Äôs extremely hard to find. The clone market is also only really huge with the mp5, all of the other reproduction is a much smaller scale than you think it is
Yeah, it looks like and acts like a Keltec, but for 20x the price. 

I've never understood it.  I think it's silly
Video Games
I saw that, you can kinda see him checking for a jam too.
The crazy thing is the ammo is by nature super sonic so a suppressor isnt even really all that great anyway. I personally dont get the hype. Its like a buying a semi auto Mac-10, like what the fuck is the point? The MP7 was designed first as a submachine gun, thats like.... its whole point. Compared to the SP5/MP5 it seems like a very poor platform for civilian sales. Expensive ammo, a pistol/sub gun that is super sonic by nature and semi auto only when the dang thing was only ever designed as a submachine gun. Its like the opposite of an MP5. I can see why HK doesn't care to sell it here, its too much trouble for a gun that simply wont sell well, outside of maybe its first year when everyone that wants one will buy one.
Them and PSA too
Gonna need some more PB for all this jam
Very, very well said sir! And I agree 100% I think that whatever the relationship between Tom and Sirris his conduct is doing absolutely nothing to help Tom in any way. In fact I imagine it is making it even worse for Tom because by the time someone reaches him they're already fired up based on this guy's antics. Regardless, these are only my personal opinions, I appreciate you giving your two cents on it and commenting! üôèüèª
PSA is designing their PSA X57 that kinda looks like an MP7
I have indeed tried it suppressed, unsuppressed with the SF MD as well as back to the OEM MD with the same exact malfunction. It happened less frequently with the factory MD every 5-3rds vs every 1-2 with the can. I would be perfectly content running entirely Fiocchi that seems to work with it. However, I was told that the Hornady works great. And I have 500+ rds of it.
This is the same question I had. I also have no experience with the MP7 as a silencer host so I'm not sure what the system expects from additive impulse.
I don't disagree with everything that you're saying, but TB guns are usually well regarded and perfectly reliable.  He may have indeed rushed these out due to demand, but I don't think he intentionally sold non functional guns just to "get over on the suckas". 

Unless this is a very elaborate "exit scam" on Tom's part, he'd be committing career suicide to just not give a fuck if the guns worked or not. Him and his people fucked up somewhere along the road of making this thing, and it's gonna be a headache for them to fix it. But I'm willing to bet that they attempt to fix it.
Right on.  I made a mistake of buying an early Q Fix in 6.5 creedmoor, thankfully they gave me a full refund, but I will never be first in line buyer for a new gun ever again, especially from niche gun maker. 

I just don't get the appeal of a non-HK MP7 clone, like if it was doable, leave it to the pros who make good quality MP5 clones that are half the price of legit SP5s.  This is the opposite, a clone gun builder, at an insane price.
People with *less* money than average do the exact same shit with companies like PSA. 24/7 coping about their QC or design issues. 

Idiots are everywhere, wealthy or poor.
Honestly, tolerances are something the manufacturer should be worried about, not the end user. The end user should worry about putting ammo in the gun and shooting it.

Now i didnt buy mine, i borrowed it from a buddy for my video, and hes a guy who has a large collection and wanted a MP7. But even hes becomming disappointed by its current lack of functioning.
I've heard a lot of good about their TG36K and their UMP conversion kits, but that's it. I'm not in the market after seeing this.

I've spoken about my interaction with Tom in previous posts so I won't repeat myself but if you want the full story you can take a look at my YT video and what Tom said about the whole thing.
I plan to!
At 1.00 a round.
He has never denied it. He said from the start that there will be hiccups. It‚Äôs a generation 1 firearm that he had to build from scratch. It‚Äôs not like HK just handed him the blueprints, molds and tools and start right up.
And when PSA releases a gun, they‚Äôre expected to have issues due to their price point, so when you dont, its great.
The same just less often. Every 3-5 rds instead of 1-2.
What do you think is wrong with them? They're brand new, out of the bag, German HK mags for reference.
The selector is something I haven't mentioned at all in any of my videos simply because I don't have a real MP7 to know if this is typical or not but comparing it to platforms I do know there isn't really a positive snap and lock into position. There is a click but they about 1/4 inch travel in either direction with the weapon on safe or fire. On fire the selector moves about a 1/4 inch either direction without ever actually changing the selected position. Same goes for when it's on safe.
No, they‚Äôre factory MP7 magazines from Germany.
All authentic H&K mags and tested with the included 30rd mags from Tom but I believe those are also HK
It‚Äôs just sunk cost. Anything that has exclusivity based solely on cost will have people violently defend its flaws because they‚Äôre afraid of their investment losing value or feel personally attacked that the exclusive thing they desire is being maligned.
He is riding Tommy built‚Äôs dick extra extra hard
He‚Äôs reverse cowboying him
Hey OP I respect and appreciate your 2 part review, I hope to see a part 3. Can‚Äôt understand why that other guy is criticizing your transparent review of a product. Yes there will be a break in period for new firearms before it operates smoothly but I‚Äôm seeing a few more issues that I‚Äôm comfortable with. Clean that boy up and cycle through a new more rounds let‚Äôs see where that takes up. Good luck with this one!
I mean Tommy ruined his own reputation by selling so many defective guns. I know that probably was not his intent, but hell thats how it ended up and at the end of the day its majorly damaging to reputation. Even if he fixes them all eventually, much fewer people are going to take a chance on whatever he builds next. I think the most damaging thing to his rep is the clown guy that keep shit posting in defense of him. He is tolerating it, which means he is ok with it on some level.
Tommy ruined his own reputation with this one.
That‚Äôs what I was thinking.
That Sirris guy who posted that facebook post clowing OP for his criticism? You have a comprehension reading level of an 8 year old or something?
I‚Äôm convinced Tom has the only working T7 guys
> if it runs 60rds with one failure for 1 type of ammo and malfunctions every other or every few rounds with the other type would that not be an ammo problem?

I‚Äôd speculate the downvotes stem from similar (though decidedly less cuntish) rhetoric to the FB Nuthugger guy, but your edit sounds like sincere inquiry, so my sincere response follows.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The short answer is no. The gun may not like the ammo as much as it likes the ones it only fails on infrequently, but an ‚Äúammo‚Äù problem would, as I (and I think most) define it, occur on other weapons as well. ‚ÄúAmmo problem‚Äù is also a pretty vague description of the concern- are we suggesting a bad batch, or suggesting a bad load/hardware combination? Either way, the propensity for the firearm to experience failures leads to a pretty compelling inference that it‚Äôs the gun. 

Imagine a hypothetical gun that could only reliably fire one brand/load/hardware combination of ammunition (an absurdity, for illustrative purposes). Every other ammo fed through hypothetical gun causes extreme, repeatable, and frequent failures. But ammo X, for whatever reason, always works. I would call that a firearm problem, not an ammo problem. 

These are pretty accepted off-the-shelf brands. Moreover, I‚Äôm not familiar with MP7‚Äôs having issues like these requiring super-picky ammo selection.  I‚Äôm not sure I have a threshold in mind where the problem shifts from gun to ammo, but the extremes seem pretty clear- most ammo works fine, but a few non-standard variations don‚Äôt is ‚Äúammo problem;‚Äù using a variety of ammo to figure out who fails the least, but still every mag is ‚Äúfirearm problem.‚Äù
"You have to shoot more rounds through it"

"Motherfucker it physically CANNOT"
That‚Äôs the quickest way for me to never even consider getting one, even for free‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want something unreliable anywhere near me lol even a .001 % chance I grab it in an emergency and I can‚Äôt rely on it.
Kimber is one of the worst manufacturers of all time, everyone I know boycotts themÔøº
Metal guns require break ins. Poly guns don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a tolerance thing and not your fault.
My cheap rifles get used and abused more than the expensive ones...and they for some reason will eat anything I throw at them...some dirty ass wolf that has some rust spots cause I left it in the garage??? PSA: Hold my beer.
I agree, my Ak-V, Jakl, & Daggers (all of them) have never given my issues, and I do not baby them in any way.
Exactly my thoughts as well, I paid $2500 for an SP5 and it has NEVER malfunctioned on me. EVER. I didnt run NATO spec ammo either to "break it in". Ran subs from the beginning, no issues. Amazing gun. I would expect a more expensive HK clone like the T7 to run just as well.
> Letting someone else break in the gun and decide it shoots like shit is a $200-$400 discount right there.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if HK releases its own civilian MP7 (SP7) in the future, and it will work great out of the box. I remember hearing people having to break in their PTR and other MP5 clones, but my SP5 worked great out of the box with no issues shooting FMJ and JHP.
All I can find for reference on "break in" for hk products is for the barrel. Not basic functionality of the gun. I highly doubt that hk could have gotten the 91 or mp5 through military trials if they were jam'omatics for the first 1k rounds. "Ja, ze veapon needs one tousand roundz before proper function ja"
The PSA still cycles better üòÇ
Show me a 100k car with a break in period and I'll show a 100% owner population that doesn't do that.
I‚Äôve been eyeing them up a bit üëÄ
Looks like a typical wanna be gunfluencer. 

I was going to say annoying and trying to project ‚Äúbadassery‚Äù, but that‚Äôs kind of understood with being a social media profile based on guns.
They‚Äôre kinda scarce right now, but I‚Äôm a great scrounger, and it helps to have friends in low places.

The REAL question is how, in the process, I ended up with TWO 249 kits! (Have a complete SA/closed bolt kit after the dust settled)ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÜ
I have a ‚Äòs‚Äô I could convert, but I wanted to push my skills farther, so this is a full weld-up receiver and mil-surp parts. So an open bolt post-sample MG. üòÅ
For sure. I‚Äôll be likely listing a closed-bolt semi kit soon,too. Long and short barrels, both standard and M4 para stocks. 100% complete.
Even the guns I was told would need breaking in, didn‚Äôt actually need it
I've had guns that needed some break in. The manufacturer recommended 124gr nato ammo and it stovepiped almost every other round when I didn't use that when I got it. After my ammo showed up, it ran that flawlessly and then ate everything after that. But that's just 1 case. Every other gun has ran flawlessly running whatever I throw at it.
Exactly. To me, a break in means that the gun gets smoother as it keeps working. Not that it finally works after a lot of malfunctions lol
Sort of glad I couldn't get through to order on the drop day. Crazy excited that there is finally an mp7 option on the civilian market, so I hope all these issues get worked out. But as of right now, I'm very happy I didn't drop the ~$5k on the complete setup to just have issues. 

Will just enjoy my 2 stamp tp9 to scratch the itch right now.
Worse than a bolt action. At least a bolt action ejects every time. Several of them pulling the bolt didn‚Äôt fix it.
which videos?
https://preview.redd.it/pv9rn6cdvyad1.jpeg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99676a4dabf9b84911fb45fa6e62d3d980195d8b
What if he's really Tommy himself???
Anecdotally, I've heard bad things about Hornady Black in .300 Blackout. It could very well be an ammo problem.
I‚Äôve never had a FTF with keltec, just saying.
The psa is a little more interesting since the Keltec will probably be straight blowback
If only you bought the FDE version. It'd have all the PB&J you'd need for $3.6k lol
Any idea if the Hornady chronos slower? Could also be short-cycling if it's failing to eject the empty brass and then override feeding the one in the mag.
Maybe so, but what I‚Äôm saying is not all of his guns are just a walk in the park. He has had numerous issues with his other guns in the past allegedly. The T36 I‚Äôve seen have issues. The TMP or UMP clone I‚Äôve heard had its set of issues. 

It would be in his best interest to get this right, considering most people are SBRing these things. $3500 is a lot to plop down on a gun. He isn‚Äôt new to this thing gun stuff. And like homie said in his video, even if it took an extra 6-12 months to get it right, he would‚Äôve waited because at least he would‚Äôve had a working gun. I just think he needs to get off the internet unless he‚Äôs putting out a statement on the repairs and look at how he‚Äôs gonna fix this stuff. 

Reminder, it‚Äôs only a few people posting about it. We don‚Äôt know how many out there are having issues.
I give PSA leeway when it comes to issues because their guns ARE less expensive, same as when i reviewed a turkish shotgun, i state off the bat that ‚ÄúThese dont have the best reliability so we will see what happens‚Äù and it worked pretty¬†good (unless you used a drum mag)

But theres a price point where failure becomes unacceptable.
**They do, that‚Äôs not the point tho.**

When we‚Äôre talking about low tier companies like PSA, not that it should be accepted, but it‚Äôs more understandable. We know PSA‚Äôs goal here. Just to push out products to people and fix em later. They have enough products to do that and that‚Äôs their MO. We get it. Again, not accepting of it but it‚Äôs to be expected. Most of their shit is under $500. With respect to them they‚Äôre barely just above BCA in terms of quality.

However TommyBuilt? His products are not only expensive than a mothafucka, they are more limited. Taking a $500 L is easier than taking a $3500 L. I don‚Äôt want to take one at all, but Tommy knew better. The problem is that he rushed this shit out because he knew no matter what, 100 dickheads were gonna salivate over it, crash his site, pay the fee and take it to the chin no matter what he put out. 

Tommy‚Äôs core market is the guys/ladies with more money than they know what to do with that want to live out their COD dreams. Your wallet as a consumer, has more power than you think. If you looked at his other firearm drops, they all have had their set of problems. Them just shutting up and accepting it is the reason we‚Äôre here.
And a company with "imperial" in the name...
Lmaooo right?

Are you sending it back or no? Sorry there was another video of a guy who had similar issues who said he was sending his back and had a return label already.
Agreed. With how much interest TB got for his MP7 clone it would be interesting to see if PSA could get one made. For anything south of $2k and actually a faithful attempt, I think a lot of people would jump on it
What a turd it is! lol I haven‚Äôt seen a good review on any platform
Should be fine then. Just missing context.
That‚Äôs the answer right here.
This, dude is embarrassed at his choice and is convincing himself he is right while trying to bully you. Dude probably has more dollars than cents and it shows.
Cybertruck is a great example of this.
You could have just said Scar owners.
Yo, don't bring my CZ Scorpion into this...
Sunk cost fallacy at its finest. Dude is desperate to maintain his guns value
I can think of several examples of groups like this in the AR15 community. It‚Äôs always hilarious. It‚Äôs like they refuse to accept facts
I hope it didn‚Äôt have a failure to feed
[deleted]
He is too emotionally involved for him not to be either Tommy himself or someone very close to him
No, but it looks like you should try Hooked on Phonics. Obviously English class was never your strong suit.
That‚Äôs how it was talking to kimber. The most surprising part was they weren‚Äôt shocked at all about it not cycling. They‚Äôre like nooo this is normal
*You must operate it as a single shot for the first 750 rounds*
LMFAOOOOOOOOOO
I think this is the evolution of serious gun owners. I own countless guns, I love collecting them and I will never sell them.  That said I keep a few dozen "duds" - examples include : a 1911 I bought to be a suppressor host - only to learn it can't go through more then 2 or 3 magazines before it gets too gunked up to function.  A few cmmg pccs that also tend to FTF or FTE a few times a magazine. Even a ruger pc charger that runs flawlessly unsuppressed but after 60 rounds is also to gunked up to function properly.   Meanwhile I own other guns that despite abuse, neglect, and dirty ammo run like a machine and I'd trust my life every time with them. They are my prized possessions.
Hell I‚Äôd take any firearm for free assuming it‚Äôs not stolen.
Ive got guns i know are reliable and proven, everything else is for fun.
It took over 700 rounds, me polishing everything that moved and the feed ramp and shooting the gun soaking wet and upside down  (to help it extract) to make it through a single magazine. I strong armed it,
Used 5 different types of 45acp, limp wristed it, ran it dry ran it hot ran it cold. 

Then I gave it to my dad for Father‚Äôs Day as a ‚Äúpretty gun‚Äù he shouldn‚Äôt protect his life with.
That makes no sense. 

If everything is made to spec you shouldn‚Äôt need a break in, it doesn‚Äôt matter what the materials are. 

Hell, all the locking surfaces are steel in a Glock, and the slide rides on steel nubs in the frame. How do all those metal parts magically work with no break in?

My m9a3 has the one of the tightest, smoothest slides I‚Äôve ever felt on a pistol, and it‚Äôs been 100% since I pulled it out of the box. All metal, no break in. 

Plenty of AR uppers are capable of sub MOA and run reliably with no break in.
*Looks at Sig 22x and CZ75 series guns in confusion*

Nope. That‚Äôs not true.
gtfooh, it is 2024, all new guns from a real brand have to run for many thousands of rounds right out of the box. Accept no less.

A glock (which is your camry/civic in this analogy) will run longer then most people will ever shoot in their lifetime without even cleaning.
Well said!
I recall an armorers guide that specifically calls for head spacing check before shooting and after the first 1k rounds as it is prone to drifting in this period I wasn‚Äôt saying they were jam o‚Äômatics, just that different builds have different needs in maintenance. None of that is an excuse for a short stroke piston system like an mp7 failing to feed, this particular ‚Äúbreak-in‚Äù is nothing more than kicking the can down the road hoping it fixes itself.
depends on the one. Undersized ports and misaligned gas blocks are not uncommon.
There are cars that unlock rpm ranges like accomplishments in a video game after mileage intervals.  https://youtu.be/giw1r2ZIMb4 .  You really have no choice because the PCM won't allow you to rev past it.  There are such things as engine break in oils.  They are usually heavier weight.  It's not uncommon to see metal shavings in the first oil changes. But even during a "break in" period that bitch better run.  That many failure to feeds isn't acceptable though .  I could understand 1-2 every couple hundred rounds but not every other round.
Guns are mechanical systems comprised of mutiple different parts that each have their own tolerances. Sometimes you get parts that are on the extremes of their tolerances and might be a tight fit even though they meet the requirements. Tolerances are a fact of life and sometimes they need a little work to break in, especially if they‚Äôre bearing surfaces.
Literally every single car with an engine, especially high end expensive cars, have a ~500mi break in period. You‚Äôd be an absolute fool to floor a $100k car out of the showroom.
Trigger sucks but it certainly does not have any functional issues.
I just wanna be a wholesome, check out these guns..and these goats!, kinda guntuber.
This never gets old
This is true, I've also experienced 300blk issues with Hornady. I am going off the fact that Tom himself told me he uses that ammo to test the guns and it works great. Whilst that is clearly not the same performance I was getting. So I'm sharing to let people know that this ammo doesn't work for me personally.
I didn't, but my girlfriend did. It's still sitting at the shop unfired while we decide what to do with it.
On the box it claims to be 2100fps also on the box the Fiocchi claims 1900. I haven't validated that because I don't have a chrono.
Fiocchi 40gr FMJ chronos 2040 fps for me. Hornady Black 38gr VMAX 2150 fps
And how many people are afraid to come forward with issues because of the fanboys.
One could just as easily say that it's unacceptable from PSA due to their size, valuation, and purported mission...

Or say that TommyBuilt deserves some leeway due to reverse engineering and re-manufacturing a gun no one else is willing to bring to market, as an extremely small business entity.

What's the truth? What's cope? Depends on who you ask.
I almost wonder if it was fomo, with SHOT 2024 being the year of the Mp7 at home, once PSA cranks out X57‚Äôs for 700.00 (idk actual price) well a 3500.00 MP7 looks less appealing no matter how it clone correct it is.

I have a theory that most people just want a gun that gives them MP7 aesthetics, or close enough, and thats what they will buy.


The thing is there is going to be a market for buyers who are willing to drop 3500 on a MP7 clone, but they want a gun that seems like it costs 3500.00
For the time being, I am not right now. But I never once stated that Tom refused to fix it. I am simply addressing the issues I had out of the box. I told Tom about the issues before I posted anything, and he apologized and offered to take it back. I chose to hang onto it and try to remedy it myself as I believe if I did send it in, I wouldn't see it for quite some time. If I cannot fix it I will send it in, but I am atleast going to try other ammo, other conditions and give him a full feedback report on specific circumstances that these issues happen with so he has all of the data to fix it. For now, I am choosing to let this whole situation boil over and Tom to get caught up after the chaos.
I mean, it is *HK* after all. Practically begging zee Germans to kick them in the balls again as they open their wallets to pay $120 for a set of cotter pins.
Facts. At least the Scar works, though. I was like that before, thinking that the Scar was the best rifle ever. Now I'm just a KAC fanboi lol.
Ehem, don‚Äôt hate us because you anus.

We *are* the superior race
Scar-17 for for sure my 16 SBR is great
You gotta think about it this way, your first 100 guns should have been examined under a microscope and put through their paces at the range. Work the cost of the ammo into the price of the gun, knowing that running 100 rounds of various ammo through each gun should be the minimum. This is your first impression, and you know folks are going to be critical of ANY issue. The fact that there have been so many problems in a sample size as small as 100 is really bad. If he sold 10000 then you'd have thousands of people unable to use their guns, thats awful.

This is a massive lack of QA, instead of trying to meet deadlines this guy needed to focus first on QA and make sure each gun was running properly before sending it to the customer. There is NO EXCUSE for a gun this expensive to be this shite.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve read about even a single person *not* having issues with these. That‚Äôs a super bad look for such a small sample size.
From what I can tell, it‚Äôs someone who works in the shop. I have dealt with Tom for many years and he never lashes out like this other Siri‚Äôs guy does.
Definitely. Either way it‚Äôs embarrassing. Tom either needs to cool it himself or put his family and friends on a leash.
hes probably 10-15k invested in tomguns and needs to justify his investment.

  
its no different than the aero simps here just a higher tax bracket.
Not tommy. Fortunately.
When I worked at a gun range, shit like that is why we quit carrying them. They were a pain in the ass for both the customer and us to work with.
To be fair to kimber this was like 2012
Not running IS normal for a MIMber.
Ya my days of buying random shit just for fun are over. A have a few that are fun to shoot but wouldn‚Äôt trust with my life, but I don‚Äôt care to buy anything else like that. Every thing now serves a purpose.
That sounds horrendous. My CZ 75 worked right out the box, no break in required.
I too love my m9

Picking up a sp-01 tactical Tuesday, have no doubt that it'll just fucking work.
"Wearing in for smooth operation" =/= **failure to cycle because your tolerances are shit.**

Back to your example about car break in period....the manufacturer wants you to take it easy. They don't tell you the engine is gonna seize every other time you try to turn it over. "It is typical in the first 300 hours of operation that you will need to perform a full fluid flush in the engine system. Occasionally you will need to perform an engine rebuild and hand fit some parts. This is not covered under warranty."
Being able to consistently cycle rounds is like flooring a car out of the showroom. Got it. You must buy Kimbers for their reliability.
And it‚Äôs hot.
Let me fix that for you:¬†https://www.gigliottirifleworks.com/phone/index.html
Ah fuck, that sucks man! I don't know enough about 5.7 or MP7 clones to make a recommendation, but have you ever thought about getting a P90? If you're gonna spend $8k on two guns, you might as well have some stamps.
Roger that. I wonder if the Fiocchi is actually hotter or something. Clearly there's something different between the two. I doubt that Hornady is selling out-of-spec ammo (ie, cartridges too long or brass wrong shape), so it's probably most likely something different about the load - either under or over powered, or a powder burn rate issue, and the T7 isn't built right to handle ammo variation.
I did see one other user that sent theirs in and got it back within a few days and says it works great now unsuppressed.
Seems that both of you guys are stand up dudes.

Other than that dude described in the video, he's a little cope machine. I hope to see the issues resolved!
The irony of it is, is that I own a 16. It's just a black one so I'm considered a castaway.
The Sirris guy insists his gun is flawless and everyone else is wrong lol
Yeah thats even worse then, just shows he himself is incompetent and putting out guns that don't work now he is crying about it online when people call him out. He is also just making tommy look bad too
Not true, I had him lash out when I told him to stop playing with colors and custom guns and just release the MP7. He said something on the lines of well Ill put you on a list not to buy one and blocked me and all his fanboys were laughing on Facebook not knowing it was a burner account with no pictures and no real name lollll. I got the email to buy the thing and didn‚Äôt because I thought this would probably happen! Glad I waited
You‚Äôre a reflection of your leader‚Ä¶.
> hes probably 10-15k invested in tomguns and needs to justify his investment.

This is true. He was in the "Midtier Snobs" Facebook gun group, and he likes to flex his Tommy Built/HK guns. He was literally talking about his XM8 the other day before leaving the group after being clowned on about the T7 thing.
That‚Äôs still modern Kimber if you‚Äôre curious. Family had 4 of them including one bolt gun, none of the 1911‚Äôs could make it through a mag, and the bolt gun would get stuck cases so bad it was sent back to them with a fired case still in the chamber after it refused to cough it up. Needless to say, no more kimber products. I have less failures on my 600 dollar rock island 1911.
Yup! Now if I find something I want I‚Äôll do research on it for a week and then watch the price trends for a couple months to know when to strike. I‚Äôd rather have 10 amazing guns than 20 okay guns.
I‚Äôve had rock island 1911s work right out the box too
She‚Äôs a beauty
Nice. I need to try that thicker grip on mine. I‚Äôve been putting it off because I prefer the thin look but I just don‚Äôt shoot it as well as my other pistols lol.
Yes, I personally don't like the ergonomics of the p90s I think they're badass guns but just not for me. I certainly could've spent my money on many other things but that ship has already sailed. I think my next purchase will probably be one of the B&T SD models or a 14.5 KAC.
So my assessment of it is the soft tip of the ammo isn't jiving with the feed ramps and or chamber of the T7 I had a similar issue with my SR-30 and after talking with KAC they said it was the ramps. I haven't sent it in yet. I just use different ammo, and I didn't really like hornady anyway with all the inert powder left over. But that's my assessment so far because the issue and malfunction is identical. But I could be wrong.
Worse than not having one at all 

I have a black 17 üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è searched for months for a tan 17. Bought the black one, and the DAY I put my stamp in for the 13‚Äù barrel.. 2 tan ones locally.
No he even admitted in a video in a fb group I‚Äôm in that he had ftf/fte issues. But he just insists it‚Äôs due to breaking the gun in.
Yeah the guy is a clown and it unfortunate, Tommy has always been super cool and up front about a lot of stuff. Hopefully Tommy figures out a way to tone that guy down.
Seems like this is a half sided story‚Ä¶ which it may not be. I can only assume you have a ‚Äúburner‚Äù FB account because you like to ruffle feathers and are in fear of getting blocked or banned. I‚Äôve had FB for quite a while now and couldn‚Äôt think of a single reason for me to want another account to keep track of.
Probably because he couldnt ban them for clowning on him.
I'm in that group and a few others. 

  
I think HK non roller guns are starting to get clowned on more and more.
I shoot the absolute dog piss out of a stainless 2 made by old Kimber. A handful of malfunctions due to dirty ammo in thousands of rounds. Doesn‚Äôt much care to eat HPs but ball ammo works swimmingly. The most I‚Äôve done in 1 sitting was 600rds, the front of the gun turned black but it never jammed.
Ty and if shoots super smooth.
I couldn't get behind the P90 either. They're fun, but not my thing. When I'm done with my AR10, I'll probably be starting on an 8.6blk.
It do be like that sometimes. I had an fde one and ended up trading with my buddy for his black one because the color didn't really matter to me. I think both colors look dope.
Snowden. I had a burner and vpn since that leak. Apparently you didnt think long enough!
the groups get pretty brutal lol
My Fn 522 has over 4500 rounds through it with 2 light primer stokes over all those rounds. 
Over half of them are suppressed 

3k rounds suppressed actually
Oooo yea an 8.6 is on my list as well I just have to do some more research on them. Badass caliber though for sure.
I've been following it closely since I came across it on IG maybe 2 years ago. Extremely interested in getting a Q Mini Fix and slapping a Nightforce ATACR on it. Probably going to shoot 300gr Berger subsonic hybrids, but I'm not sure what suppressor I want. I may also go the other way and get a GF-10, ACOG, and send some 300gr Sierra Matchking.
All of those are great choices, at least in the limited research I've done. I got the chance to shoot the Q Fix for the first time on the 4th and was very impressed with it, to be honest. I've heard mixed reviews, but my experience was great, the thing was thumping steel with subs at 165yds with a 4x acog like cake.
Will using a ‚Äúcar cane‚Äù damage a car door‚Äôs striker?
My father is very elderly, and I‚Äôve noticed he has a hard time getting in and out of my parents‚Äô car. I was researching mobility tools online and came across ‚Äúcar canes.‚Äù They are inserted into the loop striker of car doors to give a person leverage to get in and out of cars (see image). My question is if using such a device could damage the striker? I think it will help my father, but I don‚Äôt want to give him something that would damage their car. He is quite skinny/light-weight BTW. Thanks!

It‚Äôs fine. All parts of the door latching mechanism are regulated to hold 2000+lbs of vertical and horizontal force. Kind of an ingenious idea for the disabled.
Maybe if you forget it‚Äôs still there and slam the door
I've seen the foot hold version of this tested with no damage.
It should be more than fine. Those strikers have to withstand impacts that are much stronger than the weight of even a fat old man.
My concern would be that the handle is only stable when weight is put straight down. If he pulls at an angle it may move and cause him more issues
Be careful, car cane is a helluva drug.
TIL in this comment section that these things are hardcore.
When using jaws on a car the hinges pop before the strike plate or the door just rips, it'll be fine
My dad uses one, all good!
Those strikers are intended to keep the car door from swinging open during a crash, and thus are one of the stronger points of the entire car. As another commenter pointed out, when you open a car door with the jaws of life, the door rips off of the latch. Id be sincerely impressed if you damage a car with one of these
Look at this video to see the strenght of it : 
https://youtu.be/SqJamen1trs?si=JIc3Et5CIUry0CiR

While the technique used is quite bad, is shows quite well that you easily tear a door apart before damaging the striker
Striker May need a whack after a few thousand times if the door starts clunking when shutting. Other than that no.
No, those are meant to support a lot of weight. A little pressure won‚Äôt cause any damage.
Hell, I'll get one to get in and out of my project car...
Them latches probably the toughest part of car
My dad used this every day for years, and it didn‚Äôt damage the car at all. It was an amazing product.
Ermagawa ...this is life changing. I went to bed on Tuesday and woke up to a left knee from hell. No idea how it happened. Getting one of car canes ASAP! Thanks OP!
I‚Äôve literally never seen one of these
Unless your grandpa is an elephant, it should be totally fine, that type of latch is very strong and sturdy, I used to camp out of my Silverado by using that hook to hold one end of my hammock ü§£
In SAE we call those critical fasteners. They are basically rated up to a certain level of strength and safety in order for them to be allowed on the vehicle. You are all good my friend!
My wife and also my MIL use those in the cars, and I haven't seen any problems with the door hardware.
I have a TON of experience with striker plates. I work as a fitter at an auto manufacturing facility bending and adjusting 700+ strikers a day. I‚Äôm going to disagree with the majority of these comments and say that it WILL cause your door to come out of alignment. However, with that being said, it would be so negligible that 99% of people would never know. The clearances on panel gaps are usually at spec between 6-7mm. At the factory, we can fine tune these clearances by putting directional weight on the striker plates. By applying weight with a leverage device we can adjust +-4mm. This isn‚Äôt very noticeable at all, it took me hundreds of vehicles to see the difference. I would buy one of these if in need. However, you can‚Äôt say without certainty that it will have ‚Äúno effect‚Äù on the striker tolerances.
Should be fine.  The angle and rounded edges of the cane in that picture scream "slipping hazard" to me, though.
It can
Even if it bent the shit out of it over time, it would be so worth it just  to help out your dear old father.  New strikers can be bought.
Those door pillars are generally a harder metal (idk if steel, but not aluminum) so you'd have to REALLY try to pull the striker out. If it can hold a door during a high impact crash, a couple hundred pound water bag won't make it blink.
Should be fine, but word from the wise. Check his vehicle to make sure it's compatible. A lot of vehicles have a different style striker that is incompatible with car canes.
Not the carcaine I expected
I have one of those for my mother, and she loved it. I haven't noticed any damage at all to the car. Now my older sister who has cancer uses it, and she likes it. Make it easier for them to get out.
No it‚Äôs fine you actually us that as a step to get to the top they hold about 1 ton
Those automotive bolts for the latch are super strong and have an insane sheer strength rating
On a newer car, maybe. On something old and solid, no
I see most people saying it can hold a lot so it's probably fine but anecdotally I once closed my seatbelt in the door pretty hard (car was parked on an incline) and the seatbelt punctured that latch completely into the body of the car. It was a pain to repair no one wanted to do it for liability reasons. The shop that said they would want like 2k to basically section out the whole part of the body from a junk car and swap with my broken one. I ended up finding some welder guy who did it for $200 and some mcchickens. I see people saying it can hold thousands of lbs but personally I'd be cautious if the person using it weighs alot.
They're regulated for far more then human weight that's why they make the step version of that to wipe down the roof of your truck or lifted suv
Not unless you are 350 lbs and really putting some ass on it. You have to think they are made to withstand an accident and keep you inside. Granted, they do pop open in some wrecks, but it takes a good wallop
That striker plate is one of the strongest points on a vehicle.
My wife has been using one for the last 2 years. Hasn't been a problem.

Probably could be a problem if you pressed down on it with the strength of the hulk. But a normal human being no issue.
Depends on how fat one is.
I‚Äôve seen those latches resist the jaws of life. A little grip won‚Äôt hurt it.
No, it will be fine. It takes a few thousand psi to damage. Source, I was a vehicle extrication tech.
Yes it will. Have seen it damage the plate welded behind the striker. Breaks the welds eventually.
You really think he should be driving if he has hard time getting in and out of the car, also if driver can‚Äôt help him out, that that driver shouldn‚Äôt be driving also.
Tighten the bolts in the striker so it won't move and make the door hitting it wrong and becomes out of aligning.
Unless he's on my 600 lbs life, that striker latch is really strong
The lock mechanism and the striker are regulated by the federal government thanks to a safety focused zealot named Ralph Nader. In the 70's he pushed for legislation to make car doors able to withstand some measurable amount of force as applied in an accident. I do not know if that includes downward force or not, but they are very strong. And when they were a bolt with a bushing astound then they were called the Nader Bolt.
Unless you're like extremely obese, I doubt you could do any damage, if you're like #500 plus, it keep an eye on it
they are hardened stainless most can support a lot of weight for a little piece of metal
Yes it will. I have had to fix the door jam on alot of cars.
Make sure the screws are tight.
If he's very elderly, is he still able to drive ?
Also, while he still can, shouldn't it be better to offer him options to be independent of his car ?
Definitely won't damage. They even have ones you can stand on but can bend overtime. So I wouldn't recommend standing but this should handle it fine.
It's ok, can withstand much more weight, the only thing, please try to test that cane yourself in every situation you can, make sure will not slip if there is a non strictly vertical force applied, etc, make sure it will work 100% of the times or that you have enough time to know is not working before putting your weight and stability on it, it's something he's going to put his weight on, so if it fails, he will go down to the floor. 

Or if there are precise instructions, train dad on how to use it very well
Won‚Äôt hurt a bit and thank I have a low two seater sports car and that is a great idea where did you find it?
I doubt a cane style for the elderly would, seen those step ones tho and they have bent the frame out enough to stop the door from closing from what I‚Äôve seen. All pretty large folks tho who had that issue
PT who works with elderly folks here. I‚Äôve recommended these many times. People ask ‚Äúwill it hold‚Äù and I always say ‚ÄúIt better or you need a new car!‚Äù. 

These can get a little awkward because they aren‚Äôt super stable and they reduce how much room you have to maneuver. But it‚Äôs a cheap thing to try and works well sometimes.
I have seen small steps that clip in there to help you access roof top storage.
Ask Ralph Nader. That's one of the strongest parts of your vehicle. A spud wrench isn't going to hurt it at all.
You know that's what handles in the headliner are for
Will it damage the striker?

Ford: no     Chevy: yes
I‚Äôve had to adjust them before but it‚Äôs bc of the grips on the door side wearing, not the hook. Except one car that had a plastic sleeve over the hook part. That thing kept wearing out. What a dumb idea even if it does make it quieter
Just stiffen your core and squat up FFS.
Over the years sometimes the bolts that hold those can come loose just make sure they're around 15 to 20 ft pounds and no worries.
The only issue would probably be the screw becoming loose
There‚Äôs a ton of reinforcement on the other side of metal sheet under that thing, it‚Äôll be ok
My grandma has been using this for years. She did scrape the paint a little in the door jamb otherwise, there was no damage.
Even if it can fatigue the striker over time, it's much better than using the door for leverage to stand up. My grandma wore out the door hinge pins very quickly in my mom's car back in the day doing that.
No. I even have one of those steps that you can stand on to reach the roof of your car. It‚Äôll be fine.
Probably in the long run but like considerably, this kind of crane is done thinking about the direction the striker has to endure stress, if you‚Äôre careful in the positioning of the crane and use it like in the picture without it laying on the upper side of the striker but only pushing it laterally it shouldn‚Äôt be too much of a problem (it also depends on the car you‚Äôre talking about the thickness of the striker and the materials it‚Äôs made in)
It‚Äôll likely mar it up a little, but won‚Äôt do damage to functionality.
It's perfectly fine, unless they forget to take it back off and slam the door shut, and even then it doesn't really cause much damage.
Your dad is not wrong
When my elderly father had knee replacement surgery I got him one of these.  He found it very useful.
I'd be concerned he wouldn't get it inserted correctly and have it slip out and fall.
My father used one for a while, was never a problem.
I'm using it to insert a step to access roof rack. I'm putting way more pressure (+ 85 kg), and it doesn't move. I would say your fine.
I have a similar thing that inserts into the door striker loop that provides me a step to reach the roof box, so no it really won‚Äôt damage anything, just remember to take it out before shutting the door‚Ä¶
They're fine to use, my dad had psp and ftd. He was very unstable on his feet and had frequent falls, needed alot of support in the last few years but liked to try moving around himself often to our dismay.
They're good for getting into and out of cars and they  fit virtually all cars.

There was one situation though, he'd get himself up out of the car and then lift the handle with him to be helpful and put it away and as such taking away one form of his support and then immediately started to slide sideways down the car.
Just something to keep an eye on
I‚Äôve never used one personally, but I always have to put my hand on the striker to get out of cars. Anyone I‚Äôve spoken to that has one says they love it and it works great. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre all a little different and some may scratch paint, but it‚Äôs a decently clever device
Interesting thing is that it was a simple question asking if the door strike would be damaged yet here we are all talking about drivers and accidents and all that...

 sweetheart the door strike will be just fine there is no way you can damage it
I valet at a hospital and we keep 1 of these on our stand if someone needs help
Make sure there's a secure place for that when it isn't being used. It could become a lethal projectile in a crash.
I think it should be fine , those are meant to hold a lot of force with those 2 big old bolts holding it in and the door probably weights about what ur grandpa weights so I think it‚Äôs perfectly fine
There will come a certain point where you might just want to get what is called a ‚Äúgait belt‚Äù. It‚Äôs a vest that straps on over his cloths and is super easy to use. He can just have someone, ie a caregiver or family member help him in and out of the car no problem.
Meaning side pressure strength like pushing down or up on it instead of trying to pull it out which I am sure it has an equal rated strength for that as well but usually the weakness is the sheer strength/max load  but not in this case
That will hold well. Unless he is tremendously fat. Or the part is otherwise damaged. Any modern vehicle will be fine
I don't think it will damage it but you may eventually have a door that's out of adjustment.
Nah. The part he's putting force on isn't the part latching the door, so even if it did do some minor damage it wouldn't matter. And worst case if it does damage it, that's a small, very easily replaceable part, that should be (relatively) cheap (for a beemer). Any possible damage over time I'd say is worth the cost for the quality of life benefit he gets from this device. Though I honestly doubt he'd damage it much.
Why not just get him a cane?
Absolutely not.   Just might scratch your paint possibly
Not unless you're extra fat.
used one of those for transporting my aunt for a few years, never had any problems, even had a little flashlight built into it.
This is one of the strongest areas of a vehicle (former Honda engineer here), great design for your Dad!
No, it won‚Äôt hurt anything. Those door parts are designed to hold way more weight than he could put on it‚Ä¶
You can always hammer it back in place
The latch will be fine, but be careful of the shape of the cane you go with, some have the point of contact on the paint of the door and have chipped the paint.
The risk of damage is only with improper use. Aka the human element. If used strictly for its intended purpose it will cause zero damage. Buuuuut forget it in the door before you close it? That‚Äôll definitely cause damage.
Replacing a latch is way cheaper than replacing a hip or a father.
Unless he is a very, very heavy man, then no.
My father has been using one of those door canes for a few years now and I've never even noticed the scratch the door Loop catch holds a ton of weight plus the way they're designed most of the weight goes into the door frame he loves it it's the best thing he says he's ever bought
Thank you everyone for answering my question! I am going to do a bit more research on the various brands, and I will most likely order one to trial. For those that are wondering, my dad is mostly the passenger. Cheers!
The ground itself will break before that latch loop does. You'll be fine.
Link? I need one for my mom.
No this should be fine for him.
I read it as "crane"  and was thinking yes absolutely if you pick a car up by the door hook it will damage it, took me a moment lol. 

Putting the weight of a human on the hook however shouldn't do anything to it unless it was already damaged.
I‚Äôd add a caveat that the age and condition of the vehicle matter. Most older door strikers are way rusty.
Make sure whoever you get this for can easily fit around the thing. My dad isn't even fat, just a brick shithouse and has to squeeze into most cars
I use the jaws of life on car wrecks here and there. The door is the failure point. Not the latching mechanisms.

Fuck.. that means my mother in law is over the weight limit
yeah really, i can't imagine a better hard point.  if your pops can damage the car with this handle then he isn't disabled!
I'm sure it is fine, but this is leverage force, not just direct force.
Didn‚Äôt know that. Thats insane
As a private CNA, I loved recommending these. Very useful.

But even 10+ years ago, they were absurdly expensive for what they are.
They have a step version to get things off the top of your car. Saw it on shark tank
But leveraged at 1 to 7ish with this device it would only be 300 pound.
Aint no way that latch could hold 2000 lbs of dead weight sitting directly on it
Regulated by what authority?
‚òùÔ∏è this is the way
Would the continued weight put on the hinges would cause them to bend though, making the door sag?
They're definitely handy for loading shit into a rooftop carrier on an suv
I found one of those in the spare tire compartment of a vehicle I bought and tried it out.   I had to google the name to find out what it even was. Felt pretty solid.
Depends on the car an person standing on it. I have put a crease into the metal that it places the pressure on.
I use one every single weekday to access my pipe rack on top of my leer cap. Three years at least, no damage at all
I‚Äôm modern cars they are engineered as part of the occupant protection system, I‚Äôd hang off none in a pinch.

This comment is not getting the recognition it deserves. Take my upvote.
This guy's dad olds.
If my old dad jumped off a cliff would you?

Wait

Something like that
You‚Äôre right. That filming technique was horrible.
I agree. Everyone stating how a door striker is designed to handle excess pressure lets out that they are designed to do so in a direction other than straight down. I used to be a body tech and that‚Äôs how I adjusted strikes if they only needed a little tweak. Didn‚Äôt take a very big hammer either! Even door hinges designed to take the weight of the door were easily sprung with a socket placed in the door jamb.
Plus, if this is truly for an elderly old man, the odds are he probably doesn't weigh a ton, and these are meant to hold your car door shut in violent crashes, they're rated stronger than people think.
Are you old like me? Because injuring yourself while sleeping is something that happens when you get old.
I recommend to get a really good quality one not a cheap knockoff that might fail and get him hurt
Thank you. People in here are talking about how they're meant to withstand accidents and weight like it's not just a damn metal loop meant for a door to grab onto. It's not a structural piece of the car, it's held on by a couple bolts or whatever.
Ya, but the strength of an old man or woman isn't going to be enough pressure to cause any damage. I've had one for my mom and sister, and they left no damage at all.
Yup, Ive seen this a lot on early 2000s Chevy trucks/suvs
Some people in here have never drove an abused Chevy S10/Blazer lool.  You look at the striker wrong and it falls off.

To be honest though, they usually get damaged in older cars where people neglect their door pins and the doors start to sag and slam into the strike....

If he has mobility issues then driving is probably his only way of leaving the house.
Do you mean the driver who can't help them out shouldn't be driving at all or driving them around?
hand controls exist
You think a 500# person could exert all their weight on the striker?
so only drivers can get in/out of a vehicle on their own not the passenger?
99% of roof handles are held on with a small coarse thread (think deck screw) in a plastic insert, if you try to actually pull yourself up with them they just rip out the screws. Most trucks will actually have a 8mm/10mm bolt but those are usually only in the A pillar handle not the roof
These are more stable than a traditional cane, and with needing to lift and rotate simultaneously, the added stability is nice.
It's not the latch that fails. It's the sheet metal getting torn or the b pillar. Both of which are not cheap repairs
There are plenty of options, search for "car cane door handle for elderly" on Amazon, and you'll see all the various brands.
My father was a firefighter and he repeatedly said to me as a teen that the failure point of my car was the driver.
Here and there‚Ä¶. Thanks for being there when we fuck up. Always nice to see you all
I use the jaws of life here and there. Legend of a sentence right there. And thank you for doing that sorta stuff.
Jaws of life always makes me hear the line from Nutty Professor - I‚Äôve never had to use the jaws of life without an accident before
Yeah we were explicitly instructed to never use the cutters on the door pin, it will destroy the cutter blade.
The jaws of life are so cool. Once my car blew a tire right next to a fire station, they let me pull in to change the tire but the mount underneath the truck bed was totally rusted. So they got all excited and brought the jaws of life to crush the piece that was holding the tire up, was a cool experience. And on Christmas Eve too, just super friendly guys.

Sure but we have an issue of people driving cars and putting people in danger when they really shouldn't be. There are other ways.
I don't think so. the only way is if the 500lb person used it as a step.
Don't attribute me lines I didn't say
I mean I don't drive current year cars like most grandpas I'd imagine do. But on old german cars you could flip over a car yanking on those things so i thought they still make them as robust. (By old i mean 90's and 2000's
Still cheaper than the $75k for a hip replacement.
that is classic firefighter dad advice :D

In the IT world we call it PEBCAK. Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard
I'm using this from now on
Smart man that papa.
as a retired firefighter, can confirm. also the  3 leading causes of fires are men, women and children.
PEBKAC is the cause of half of all computer issues, and PEBSWAS is the cause of half of automotive issues.
Highest failure rate part in a car is between the steering wheel and the seat
The Driver is definitely the Mechanism of Injury in this case.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HAGMb\_jAdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HAGMb_jAdU)
Replace the driver with a door latch!
My favorite mechanic saying is "most problems can be linked to a loose nut between the driver's seat and the steering wheel"
My dad was not a firefighter, but always said I was a failure.
What's his take on current autonomous cars?
Yes I do. But the general public doesn‚Äôt know that.
I can't believe this bs. I got an S10 and this has been the biggest pain in my ass, the doors aren't aligned. I think I can replace the passenger pins but the driver side weld is coming apart and I'm at a loss what to do. terrible design.
I‚Äôve had 9 s series trucks‚Ä¶. 4 of them had the striker rip off

It was called a "Moki Door Step".  Tell me you'd find that in a trunk and go, "Yep!  I know exactly what this is for!"  :D

Just so I understand your point, you‚Äôre saying that having mobility issues that make it difficult for them to enter and exit a car should preclude somebody from being able to drive? Why?
I would just trade in the car for something that fits better
They have seen some shit.
that is classic ~~firefighter~~ dad advice :D

Part of that is how we consider fault. Find yourself on a skating rink in a vertigo inducing white out? If you‚Äôre in motion you‚Äôre going too fast for conditions. Doesn‚Äôt matter that you‚Äôre 50 miles from civilization and will freeze to death out there, you made the mistake when you chose to drive that path.
Add in poor maintenance as driver (owner) error and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs even higher
I have a self driving car, this is not correct. If I let that thing drive it would kill me faster than I can. (less on the highway more likely on town roads.)
When I was a technician, we'd say it's the "loose nut behind the steering wheel."
Chair to keyboard interface error
PICNIC - Problem In Chair Not In Computer
It‚Äôs a layer-8 problem.
USER = ID10T
As a retired firefighter, now IT guy, I either use pebcak, or ID10T error.  Also, please wear a seatbelt. I never went to an accident and told someone, thank god you weren't wearing your seatbelt, that saved your life.
End user competency error
I've heard it as  a id-10-t error.
ID10T error
He seemed to always yell that advice at me.
:(
That seems generous on both accounts.
I think my dad was just calling me a failure:(
That I‚Äôm too much of a failure to be able to afford anything like that.  I‚Äôll just go on being a danger to society being the failure I am in the failure point of my car.  All that except with yelling.
Dorman makes a entire hinge replacement......it is not a easy job
Thanks! Now that's cool.

My first thought would be that it's something for a tree stand lol
No shit. My mom is in a wheelchair and has a vehicle with hand controls.
Can you check your blind spots properly? React to an emergency situation properly? I'm not necessarily saying having a hard time moving means you shouldn't drive but there's should be a line. Knowing someone "has mobility issues" isn't enough information to base any decisions on.
I would just trade in Grandpa for a newer lower mileage one. Grandma said she‚Äôd pay the down payment and insurance.

Change the statement to 'driver error' and we can blame the autopilot. The point was it's very rare for the wheels to fall off or the brakes to stop working. Most wrecks are because the driver (human or computer) made a bad choice and caused a wreck.
Contraindicated use of the self drive system would still be human error. It's not like it switched itself on.
Feels like that would still be human error. The human giving control over to something that shouldn‚Äôt have control being the error
So what's the percentage of serious crashes that involve self driving cars if 94% of crashes *aren't* due to human error?
So then you don't have a self driving car since it can't drive itself
I was going to respond to that but you seriously made me mad right now! Your user name has reminded me how old I am and *starts singing* I'M NOT OKAY!!
Seriously though love the name
>it is not a easy job

This is why I've put it off for years.
That was awesome
How would somebody having a hard time getting out of a car stop them from checking blind spots? You‚Äôre reaching here.
I think you have an extra bum there?
^ Just in the same way most aviation incident investigations find the primary cause to be pilot error
many bells historical memorize ripe cautious physical cause groovy abounding

Well technically it‚Äôs all ape error‚Ä¶ we evolved from apes and blah blah blah. (Whataboutism goes all the way back to the creator/Big bang). Stop being foolish.
I mean, you could equally well argue that if the engine blows up *that's* human error because the engineers designed an engine which blew up. It's technically correct, perhaps, but clearly not what's intended to be communicated.

/u/KeepItUpThen makes a better point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/17y9uxk/will_using_a_car_cane_damage_a_car_doors_striker/k9subue/).
Less than 6% obviously. But don‚Äôt let these things loose, that‚Äôll go way up!
Oh, it can‚Ä¶ poorly‚Ä¶ it just causes heart attacks and aneurisms trying to stop it from killing me.
Idk how it wasn‚Äôt taken
If I'm reaching you're also keeping your eyes shut. My grandfather who had a stroke and lost majority of use in his right arm moves slow, has a hard time getting in and out of vehicles, and also can't look over his shoulders. Not that far of a reach

The whole point of what I originally said was simply agreeing that whether or not someone is fit to drive a motor vehicle should be thought about more than not at all.
'tis indubitably so
I agree that driver error would cover who or what is currently driving the car but at this point in time there is not really a system out there that can truly self drive your car completely, that‚Äôs available to the public, and without human intervention so at this point in time the human driver should always have some level of control over the car. 

As to your comparison I would argue that most engineers design their engines not to blow up and it is often material failure that causes an engine to ‚Äúblow up‚Äù or human error due to poor maintenance and improper use causing material failure. Most this that go wrong are pretty much directly caused by human error and often more than one human‚Äôs error.
Human error, yes. Not necessarily the engineers' error, but *someone* failed to maintain the engine.
Wear your helmet.
Caught my back edge. Glad it's not my skull that looks like that. I didn't even know it was broken until I finished an hour later, bc my goggle strap was holding it together.
Maybe get checked for a concussion, you might not realize you have it. Take it easy the next few days and have someone check on you when you are sleeping if anyone is around. Glad you seem to be okay!
Glad you‚Äôre ok! Surprised you aren‚Äôt concussed though! Or maybe you are‚Ä¶ keep an eye on yourself, sometimes you don‚Äôt show signs of a concussion until the next day.
Road forever using my helmet. One day I decided I was good enough and was ‚Äújust going to cruise‚Äù so I decided I didn‚Äôt want to wear my helmet, plus it was an older helmet so it was uncomfortable to wear with my earbuds. Played by all the rules and ended up getting mowed over by an out of control jerry that was there on vacation. The edge of his ski gashed the back of my head dangerously close to my spinal chord, and I had a concussion from my head smacking the ice (it was spring time). No permanent damage other than a scar, but it made me realize the dangers of the sport, even when 99% of the time it seems so mellow. Stay safe everybody
I like to do fast butters sometimes and my way bigger smacks have been from that more than any hits in the park. I absolutely fractured one helmet but not nearly as bad as this.

I ride a lot on the east coast and people really don‚Äôt understand that 90% of the time it‚Äôs dust on crust. Hard pack and ice is a way of life out here and the hits hit a bit harder

Please get check out. I‚Äôve had 2 concussions and one was from an incident like this.
Were u riding on snow or asphalt?
Ya but now it‚Äôs ruined and you need a new one. Not wearing it would have saved you like $100.
This is why I don't catch my back edge
‚ÄúHaha whatever Jerry I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôm invincible!‚Äù
I will never not upvote this. The amount of people doing shit without helmets is insane. 
Wear a lid people
It's important to state that helmets are single use device. One big hit and you should replace them
Send the manufacturer a thank you note and some pics. Maybe get some free swag?

![gif](giphy|YLghfz0W895Ty)
Holy! You are lucky.  Please make sure you get checked out.
Sir ü§îü§î You destroyed the helmet and your ok?
Probably will need a new one in the next couple years
I see a lot of people here giving advice about concussion protocol and going to the hospital. 

Your protocol of zinc/magnesium/omega 3‚Äôs is perfect. 

Sounds like you only have mild symptoms - avoid to much screen time/bright lights is my only advice to add. 

I‚Äôve had close to 13 concussions - background in mma and the mighty military industrial complex, after so many times you get to know the feeling of severity. 

Which you a speedy recovery and god bless helmets!
Looks like you went heli-riding and got clipped by the rotor
Glad you're safe, catching edges are the worst, I usually tuck and roll. My brother picked one up for my Christmas, I used it when I was at 49¬∞ in Washington.

Bolle bollle
I was doing a season at a B.C resort. Young kid doing a tree line and wasn't wearing a helmet. Head hit a tree and brains where everywhere. 

Definitely wear a helmet.
Me too buddy happened on friday. Mild concussion

So what's your next helmet going to be?
Absolutely!
Anyone heard from OP today?? Looks savage
Send that to bolle and see if they‚Äôll give you a new one.  

Seriously, they might be interested in analyzing it in order to improve future products.
I was going to make some joke or reference regarding this, but reddit is too soft to handle the smoke. Glad you are ok G.
Smacked my head so hard once in the pipe I saw all the stars. If I didn‚Äôt have a helmet on I would‚Äôve been seriously hurt.
According to my wife I'm so hard headed I'd probably break the rail
Helmets are cool. Those who say otherwise are idiots and aren‚Äôt worth your time and attention.
My skull is stronger than your helmet
Dude wears a helmet, says he‚Äôs taking precautions and going to hospital soon, and r/snowboarding idiots still roasting him.
Helmets are non negotiable for me
Dude. I‚Äôve never seen a snow helmet get damaged like that. Did you catch an edge on a rock?
All these people saying to go to the Dr. Do you not live in the USA and have good health insurance?
[deleted]
Actually your helmet only helped you from avoiding an abrasion on your skin and wouldn't  help you avoid any sort of brain injury. Beanies are way steezyer and you look cooler while your riding so fuck helmets /s JK always wear a helmet, keep yourself safe while doing extreme sports nobody cares about how cool you think you look on the mountain glad your okay stay safe out there.
Off topic but I heard somewhere the cushioning in your helmet expires after awhile. How long do they last before they‚Äôre essentially not protective anymore?
I‚Äôd seriously be questioning the quality of that helmet to exploding like that. I had some Bolle goggles when I first started. They were the cheapest of the cheapest back then and I‚Äôm sure that hasn‚Äôt changed in 20 years.
Are we still checking if he is alive? When can we stop?
Don‚Äôt trust your noggin to a $50 Costco helmet and this won‚Äôt happen. Buy a smith
Yeah, but you didn't look cool. Wouldn't you have rather been looking cool?

Glad you had that on, one hell of a hit.

Just been to Les Arcs for week and I was shocked at the amount of people without helmets, guarantee you won‚Äôt look as cool with brain damage!
OP is a dolt, man will not go to the hospital even if his life depended on it, which it may.
Man i wish i could but i aint even got a helmet so yeah lmao wish me luck
More like "don't buy this weak helmet that can't take a minor hit without cracking because of the poor vent design."
Hell no, not after the way yours exploded!
It's hilarious to me that you posted a helmet warning and proceed to ignore basic concussion protocol because you're taking some vitamins. Classic!
How old is the helmet? Is it a mips?
Yea that is DEFINITELY a THI‚Ä¶.ur lucky it wasn‚Äôt a TBIüòâ
Preach. #HelmetsAreCool
MIPS my ass, that's a SIPS for sure.
Those aren't my skis mate. Cheers!
Did the same thing and I've always worn a helmet since. Caught a back edge after the sun dropped on a main run and turned it to chewed up ice, I don't remember the crash, just waking up facedown. I guess I had fallen backwards so hard that I bounced fully into a backflip and landed facedown, full cracked the back of my helmet.

I was the last one down the hill (worked the lift) and the ski patrol had just said "hey man I gotta get down the hill, you good if I go before you?" and then of course I completely ate shit. Was maybe 200m into a 2km run and had to snowplow/slide down the rest of the mountain.

When I got to the bottom my boss said "hey how was the new guy you were working with today? What's his name?" and I legitimately couldn't remember his name because of how bad I rung my bell.
I never wore a helmet, too cool for that shit. Then my dad had a pretty nasty wipeout and fractured his skull, and he WAS wearing a helmet. So I decided to start wearing one this year, and literally today I caught an edge and smacked my head pretty hard on some ice. Probably would‚Äôve been a concussion had I not had a helmet on. WEAR A HELMET! Also op, definitely go get checked out at a hospital just to be safe
Glad that wasn‚Äôt your head homie

Jesus, you almost got Schumachered
I am ashamed to say this but I have shattered 4 helmets they are worth every penny and I am reminded of that everytime
D‚ÄôFUK?  How do you hit something hard enough to do THAT and just shake it off? 

I took a heel edge slam that only put a dent in my helmet.  (‚Ä¶ upon inspection it did pop the mips liner) It took me about 10 minutes just to be able to sit up.  Probably another 10 or 15 before I felt well enough to ride off to the pro shop to get another helmet. ü§£
(‚Ä¶brand new Giro MIPS roached!  But then that‚Äôs why I paid money for it!) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòéüòâ

Glad you seem to be OK,‚Ä¶ But everybody commenting is right you should keep an eye out for signs of concussion for a few days.
God hope your ok and yeah I always wear mine I rather be alive and keep snowboarding then that to be my final run
ive cracked a helmet before, coulda been my skull
One thing to note, helmets have an expiry date printed inside as materials degrade over time. Not always a big deal for most people but for a hard impact it could decrease the protection offered. Similar to if you've taken several hits before, it may not be protecting you as much as you think. Stay safe!
Glad you‚Äôre OK! I hit my head skiing yesterday. The helmet is fine and even the back of my head doesn‚Äôt have any soreness or tenderness at all. But my front and side neck muscles are wrecked!! Didn‚Äôt really set in until overnight. 

Wear a helmet!!
I never wear my actual snow helmet too much and instead opt for a lighter skateboarding one, might think twice now that i saw this
Every year without fail I take 1 fall where I think ‚Äúdamn good thing I have a helmet‚Äù really in todays age there‚Äôs no excuse not to wear one. Traumatic brain injuries isn‚Äôt cool or hip
Glad you‚Äôre ok!
I am taking my fullface mtb helmet to my trip next week..
I'm sure I've got a minor one, but I'll be alright. Taking zinc, magnesium, and omega 3 and taking it easy for a few days for sure.

Thanks!
I probably am. Bit of a headache but no nausea or dizziness. Taking magnesium, zinc, and omega 3 to speed up recovery.
Not even a helmet can save people from serious injury in such cases. We need goggles with a small rear view mirror in the HUD so we can spot such missiles early.
Yep same, the one time I ride without a helmet I catch an edge and slam my face into the ice, gnarliest concussion I've had.
I ride the same stuff so I'm all too familiar. I'll probably get it checked out early in the morning.
Literally just ate it p hard for the first time in a while doing a butter yesterday lmao 

Started turning toward the mountain and next thing I know I‚Äôm doing a backflip & looking at the snow

Got winded & was a bit dazed. Besides my ass hurting a bit, I was able board again. Also my neck is sore as fuck rn lol
East Coast pow day üòé
So you're saying my flex seal isn't gonna work here?
Not all helmets. Flexible helmets with softer foam, such as vinyl nitrile or even EPP, ARE usually reusable for even moderate to heavy impacts, as stated by the manufacturer.
It's also important to get a new helmet regularly. That helmet should not have cracked like that. The foam is supposed to compress. If it cracks its either because the helmet is too old and the foam has dried and become brittle OR there was a fault in the helmet that caused it to crack (could also be from a former hit).
Everyone else saying concussion this, hospital that. You've got your eye on the prize. I respect the hustle ü§ù
This. I got a brand new helmet from a brand and they asked me to send in the broken one so they could use it for RnD.
More or less. Built different üòé
(optional)
That's rough. Yeah this is my 4th and I can tell it's gonna be a couple weeks before I'm 100% again. I'm actively monitoring my coordination/balance, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movement ability, and memory. I wrote down what happened, and I test myself every couple of hours to make sure I'm not suddenly getting worse. 

Ik it can worse in the first few days, so I'm being careful.

Thanks!
Not sure yet. Any suggestions?
Reporting for duty ü´°
I asked if they wanted it. They didn't say, but they gave me a discount on a new one.
Hit me with it
Your skull might be, but the brain inside won't.
Probably.
The kookiest sub on this site, easily.
Good!
No I was doing one of those ground spin tricks but going to fast to switch edges. It happened so fast. Going - > smack.
üá®üá¶ I'm just eating soup rn and I don't particularly enjoy waiting 5-10hr for them to tell me to take it easy. But yeah Im leaning towards going.
It doesn‚Äôt even look lame. The lamest thing you can do is think that you‚Äôre too cool for a helmet then wind up with the medical team checking you for a concussion later.
Safety beanies for the win.
It does vary a bit, but in general, yes, helmets should be replaced if you use it regularly and drop it from time to time, OR if you have any sort of major crash, OR if it's been 10 years and you like to take risks, OR if it's been 3-5 years (as per manufacturer's recommendation).
 I don't make helmets, just break em.

I've had this for a year. I don't see why the cushioning pads would expire, but the main foam can weaken over time bc of exposure to sun, heat, cold, small impacts, etc. Different types of helmets probably have different life expectancies, probably around 3-5 years I'd guess.
I'm alive
It was $110 and did its job, but yes I'll be looking into better helmets.
Thanks. Wouldve looked like Groot's head without it.
This is snowboarding group mate
The skis aren't mine jerry.
1yr. Yes. No prior notable impacts.
Idek. I've taken far worse tumbles going 3x faster and yet this happened about 100ft off the chairlift only going about 25kph. I think I just hit a sweet spot or something. Gonna talk to Boll√© about it. Maybe they want to examine it.
Bruh, you can have a brain bleed that progresses from headache to veggie cassarole real quick. Go to the hospital
I feel like you‚Äôre American and you got some Canadians/Europeans arguing with you below. Us Americans don‚Äôt run to the hospital for a head scan unless we‚Äôre near positive we have to. Even with good insurance it‚Äôs going to run you at least a grand. Close to 5 large without it. 

Sad country we live in when it comes to healthcare, but ‚Äúlet me swing by the ER for a head scan just to be safe‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a thing here.
+1 to others saying go see a doctor and don't ride again for a while... that helmet damage is serious whether you picked out loose parts or not.

Even if it's trivial, you just wanna be safe with something like this!
That‚Äôs not how it works man, go check shit out, a lot of people who said that, didn‚Äôt wake up.
You should be avoiding screens and yet‚Ä¶
People voting you down jesus christ this sub is ridiculous sometimes
Dude, just say you went to the hospital and got checked. Shut these people up.
Get checked out dude - having a symptom that quick can get dangerous fast
Go get checked out.
Fun story, I knew a guy whose cousin wrecked on a mountain bike, his helmet was nowhere near as bad as yours. No apparent injuries or symptoms that day but the next day had a headache. He apparently didn‚Äôt recognize this as a red flag and by the time he did it was too late. The family got him to the hospital and he died before getting in to surgery. From headache to dead was something stupid like 8 hours.
What were you tryna do when you wiped out?
Sounds about right. Maybe check for concussion to be safe. Feel better!
If that's what pow does i never wanna touch the stuff
So concrete.
Gonna be built like a vegetable if you don‚Äôt get checked lol
I think he‚Äôs saying to use duct tape
For the folks that are new to helmets here, no flex seal will not work
![gif](giphy|7zJivlhQurdLVTeeX6|downsized)
Great work honestly, it can be hard for people to recognize what recovery protocols look like from an effective and active standpoint. Fuck the noise and keep it up.

Might sound silly but I do a lot of small yoga balancing exercises and that helps me a lot with coordination between my eyes/head/and feet. I normally do 5-15-30 minute sessions as I recover more and more. Sounds like your doing all the right things and then some üëçüèª Personally I still haven‚Äôt had any issues with memory, probably because of my age. And unless the injuries are really at like TBI level I haven‚Äôt seen to many cases of people with memory adhesion. But a good thing to keep at none the less.
Contact Bolle and they will probably give you a big discount on a replacement! I‚Äôve just done the same with my Giro
Nice, glad you are good!
One time I hit a tree head on, killed the tree.
Glad you‚Äôre okay. Like some other comments mention, you might want to get checked for a concussion. I unknowingly was concussed from a snow accident and if caused me to miss work for 2 weeks and get vestibular therapy.
I live across the border in Washington.  I don't have insurance.  I probably wouldn't go , because I don't want to go broke from a medical bill. 
The snow at Baker should be soft tomorrow though.
You have free healthcare, yet you're hee-hawing over losing 5-10 hours of your day to get your head checked out by a doctor???

Best case scenario: you lose 5-10 hours of your time and the doc tells you to take it easy and rest. 

Worst case scenario: severe, life threatening consequences, even death

But you're just so tough that you don't need to get your head checked out because you're built different, huh? Not like the rest of us mortal human beings. Smh. Show some humility and realize you could have or develop brain bleeding, brain swelling, or whatever else. Soup and some vitamins don't replace a doctor's visit. This isn't some scratch on your knee or a papercut.

I hope you do more than just lean toward going and you actually go get your head checked out. Health is sacred.
Since they're thin, they provide little room for deceleration. The smaller the thickness, the higher the Gs/concussion severity. Hence why I go for a helmet with softer foam.
Yeah the foam I meant. So weird. I feel like they should have expiration dates on them if that‚Äôs the case.
Should probably check again tomorrow
Bolle is garbage. You need high quality mips and koroid at the very least if you‚Äôre pointing it or hitting park.
Get one with MIPS brother! You seem to ride harrrrrrd lol
The Giro Jackson is a pretty good helmet. Comfortable and mips.
I have a 157 public, we good jerry?
How fast were you going? I hit my head all the time and have never had this happen
Is it a relatively new helmet? Or is it old? (‚Ä¶plastic deteriorated?) Past impacts that may have compromised the shell?   

Because yeah,..  if you don‚Äôt think the impact was all that serious?   it‚Äôs really shocking to see that thing in pieces like that.
But  didn't you hear that they're taking zinc, magnesium, and omega 3s!?
Lmao this didn‚Äôt escalate quickly at all. Reddit is a weird ass place
>veggie casserole

Jfc bahahaha I just woke up my partner with the laugh you got from me with this
He could also be completely fine, which is far more likely...
Yeah I'm not riding for the rest of the week for sure. I'll probably go to the hospital early in the morning.
It‚Äôs scary the theme in here; like one should be a doctor to know that hitting your head is wildly dangerous?

This isn‚Äôt a story of how a helmet didn‚Äôt let a skull crack. If you hit your head, and your helmet doesn‚Äôt turn to bits, you can still have a concussion.

This helmet fucking cracked.
You got me there.
![gif](giphy|xEpTspH9hGwHS)
The right answer üòÇ
Idk what it's called. 360 but on the ground. Just spin but switch edges quickly. I've done it do many times without issue
Will do for sure. after reading the comments here def sounds like the smart thing to do
Actually, it's the day after a pow day, got 25cm Friday night/Saturday. Packed down a little bit since, but there is ice under the snow still, and I think that's what did it
Good one üòÇ
Instant noodles + super glue
A high end tape though, not that cheap gray stuff. This one calls for gorilla tape.
That's a lot of damage
Thanks! Feeling sore but alright.
When I did that, a stick broke off and impaled my chin. You really are built different.
I had a really bad boarding accident at Jay peak 12-13 years ago. Glad I was under my parents insurance back then. You'd be glad to have it if you end up in my position.
Holy shit you people are so fucking annoying lmao
I think I've seen expiration dates on bike helmets. But they're not as tough as snow helmets anyway.
See you tomorrow then ü´°
This one has mips. I've never heard of koroyd, but I'll look into it. Thanks!
Lmao that I do. Just out of sight on the left of the helmet is the mips label. It just didn't "activate" here for some reason
Yeah you would downvote you POS. I'm on my board at the top enjoying the view. Bunch of jerries in this group downvoting people showing others their helmets. Get a life. Kids these days, nothing better to do.
You don't even know what a public 157 is. you're a joke jerry.
Got it last winter. It hasn't been the main point of impact til now in any of my falls. I've also never dropped it.
I'm not stupid. I know those don't stop a brain bleed or fix brain damage, but they do play a significant role in maintaining brain health, and they all drop after a brain injury. Taking them asap and daily following a concussion speeds recovery.

Edit: Not sure why I'm being down voted here, I'm not wrong. Taking those is literally part of concussion protocol from the hospital near me.
Why is this sub so snarky?
Based on the history, some physicians would get a head CT and others would not, but either way, I‚Äôm not sure why retard redditors with no knowledge of medicine are speaking on the matter at all
who is they?
You work EMS, you don't ignore head injuries.

I watched a kid hit his head playing baseball have to relearn how to speak due to a brain bleed.
Lol i love doing that but its like a 5% chance with each turn i crash.
Oh yeah I‚Äôve seen that. That shit is harddddd.
Gross. Come to the best coast bro, we'll treat ya right.
My Mom called me Elmer Fudd Straight outta tha womb
MIPS is just a little layer that allows the inside of ur helmet to shift around on impact thus deflecting the shock somewhat, helps prevent concussions and damage to ur head in general, but has nothing to do with ur helmet cracking. it probably worked fine, deflecting some of the shock which is probably why u feel mostly fine.
Wow yeah see it. I don‚Äôt think they make helmets for you‚Äôre kind then Bahaha
I get what you're saying. Last time I hit my head, I *knew* I had a concussion. Doc told to my wife to check on me that night. That was the only "treatment."
Commenter from above is correct though, you should get checked for a brain bleed if you have not already. A hit hard enough to explode your helmet like that was likely not absorbed completely by the helmet. These things can go from 0 to 100 quickly, better safe than dead.
Michael Schumacher called. He said go to the doctor.
Ignore the armchair experts, the helmet did its job.

It would make sense to see a doctor if you had extreme dizziness, memory issues or a persistent headache for multiple days.  

It's still a good idea to take it easy for a couple days though.
You are talking about part of concussion protocol, not all of it. 

But you dont have a diagnosed concussion. You have a suspected concussion. There are protocols to make sure that its just a concussion and not something more.

To make things worse is that a concussion puts you in an altered mental state. You might not realize shit is more serious than you think
You are downvoted because yes, this CAN help, but you still self prognosed which a huge no no specially on crashes like this, where your judgement is not even remotely credible. I did race downhill and I‚Äôve seen people being taken for a check for a lot less and later taken to the hospital.
Man if you think you have a concussion get off your phone. You should go to a doctor but atleast don‚Äôt stare at a bright screen.
people on reddit soft as hell i‚Äôll be downvoted too but if u post a cracked helmet u better say you‚Äôre going into the er cause redditors will get second hand nervousness. and then they‚Äôll say ‚Äúu should be trying to see a dr not posting this‚Äù so just lie and say ‚Äúi‚Äôm currently with a team of brain surgeons and they‚Äôre all so proud of me for coming in‚Äù
If you have insurance walk in the emergency room and just say you fell and smacked your head hard. Make sure you check your ER copay first. It‚Äôs a no downside scenario
Fish oil is an anticoagulant.

They‚Äôre doing this protocol *after* a CT of the head to make sure there isn‚Äôt a significant bleed.
What's the big deal about getting a MRI?
Are you recovering okay from the possible concussion? Hope you are doing well, such an insane close call.
Idk man. I never said I'm refusing to go to the hospital. What I said is valid concussion protocol, so I don't get it either.
It‚Äôs Reddit‚Ä¶people love to get condescending and shitty about their own opinions.
Because people can be annoying for no reason.
Ive was an Emt for years. If I saw this, I 100% am telling him to go to a hospital.

Sure, a phyicisian might tell him to rest, but he might not. Thats why you go to an expert.
Yeah I think it was that I wasn't on a flat section when I did it, so I either leaned too much or too little mid spin.
ü§ù One day for sure.
Yeah I meant it didn't detach and shift. Still probably did something and I just don't know what to look for there.
Iirc proper concussion treatment is lots of sleep and a very dark room/no screens

I suppose I shouldve clarified in the post text. The helmet didn't explode on impact. It cracked but stayed together. That pic was after I moved the pieces to the side once I got home so the cracks were more obvious.
I completely agree. I'm monitoring my coordination, memory, vision, and just relaxing.
Thanks. I am on dark mode and 0 brightness
I'll give you an upvote.
üá®üá¶ Skip all that money talk.
$2000 yeah you‚Äôre good, go home. Come back if you start vomiting or have a severe headache.
Thanks. Yes my head is alright actually. No brain fog, no memory issues, no headache. Coordination and vision are fine. Not fatigued, no difficulty doing math. 


Tbh I think the helmet did a great job of taking the brunt of the impact.
It's because a lot of people has been giving you really good advice to get checked ASAP and your response has been "I'm taking this, this, and this, which is a valid concussion protocol." You're not wrong that those are valid concussion protocol, but they're a valid *prescribed* concussion protocol. Meaning, one gets checked and doc states that you're good with just the protocol, no further injury than concussion. Other than that, I do wish you fast and full recovery, OP!
A CAT scan is the valid concussion protocol. But hey, you do you. Sleep well bud.
Glad you're ok by the way. I'm a big advocate for helmets at all levels. You never know when it could literally save your life
Developing a routine because it's the only way to guarantee I don't forget something, which I inevitably do anyway. 

Also fellow football player for a long time. My last concussion in college was when I knew it was time to hang up the cleats.  Didn't know who I was or where the fuck I was for like a week.
That definitely makes a difference, but you never know man. If it were me, I‚Äôm going to the hospital. Head injuries are nothing to screw around with. Wish you the best man.
Dude, the fact that the helmet turned to any pieces stresses me out. I‚Äôve had 3 concussions and Idk really if that matters but at least have someone check on you every 15-20 minutes. 

Even if the helmet had not cracked, your brain is jostled around. Also, last concussion I had the doc said 7-10 days of avoiding any activity where I might hit my head.

Don‚Äôt do any kind of criminal substances for the next so many days and if you suddenly feel strange then please go to a doctor.
Literally had the exact thing happen. It‚Äôs probably minor but still have it checked.
see. they‚Äôre even downvoting this! reddit is sooooo annoying with some stuff, they can‚Äôt handle a helmet crack pic.
If you‚Äôre in a country with functioning healthcare please have it checked out regardless. It‚Äôs a no lose scenario. Better safe than sorry etc
Hate u
The pure swagger of this statement... Love it!!  üá®üá¶
Then wtf dude?
A lot of plans have no ER copay and ER coverage.
That is great to hear!
Fair enough. I do appreciate everyone's concern tho. I didn't expect so many people to comment.

Thanks!
Thanks! Me too. I'm a cyclist in the summer and I see far too many people going without. I wish helmet laws were enforced more, and I wish hills enforced helmet rules better.
Ahh yeah.. for me it was when the team doc came up with a plan that would allow me to continue to play and avoid double shoulder surgery for "as long as possible"
I love watching football but it should be straight up illegal
If OP was able to finish out their day after this and feel fine, it‚Äôs a mild concussion at most. Imaging is not standard treatment for a mild concussion. Stop being a Reddit doctor and leave this dude (trying to spread a valuable message) alone. Urgent care has better things to be doing than to tell OP exactly what any of us could pull from the internet.

Bruh you cant just tell a snowboarder not to do crimes
Thanks for the advice.
Weed isn‚Äôt bad after a concussion

Instead of downvoting maybe just look it up.
Dw I'll probably be waiting 5-10 hours to be seen.
I don't agree with that. Especially now that college players are being paid. I do believe that the age of tackle football should probably start at a later age. I lived on a huge football town and started tackle football in 4th grade, and I know I could have started earlier. 

I can think of a few ways that it doesn't have to necessarily be flag football but not full-blown tackle football. At least not while they're still learning the basics of the game. 

When I played in college, we never went full contact in practice unless it was a drill specifically designed to work on tackling technique. I think this school of thought is becoming more widespread for younger age groups, but it sure as hell wasn't when I was growing up. I'm only 26. 

We played bull in the ring, Oklahomas, and numerous other games, some of which are illegal now. None of them did anything to teach you fundamentals, but to "toughen" you up.
Still some people die in their sleep no even after feeling semi ok the rest of their day..albeit rare though.
The whole point is to go see a doctor if you experience a potentially very serious injury. A doctor is the one who will tell you whether it‚Äôs a mild concussion or something worse. That‚Äôs literally their job and urgent care or the emergency room triage their patients accordingly, it‚Äôs up to them if they have ‚Äúbetter things to do‚Äù. Besides, they‚Äôd be much happier helping someone avoid a potentially life threatening problem than dealing with the run of the mill cold and flu symptoms people come in for.
Just tell the redditors that you‚Äôre on your way to the hospital so they‚Äôll leave you alone lmao. Good on you for wearing the helmet, get you a new one with all the money you saved on healthcare by being in Canada!
I didn‚Äôt mean to not do physical crime or consume criminal things. I meant to just feel out your mind with no influences.
I wouldn‚Äôt up or down vote this. I just did some crime, I‚Äôm gonna take a nap and then go out and do some new, more creative crime.

But - I get emotional when I think about how my mind was before I had two concussions within seven days. I just don‚Äôt want anyone to experience that unless they choose an experience like that.

I trip and do crime all the time.
I've been there. Pro tip : If you throw up in front of them, your waiting time will be of around 10 minutes instead of a few hours
NDA's for this work have expired and I'm free to share! 
These are all pulsed (Fronius) in a positioner but this spool had a nozzle and the positioner was sporadic and 100% xray 
Oh wow a flange, two of em even. Welded to a pipe. Good thing you signed that NDA, design could have been copied. 

Just kidding it looks good. Lovely welds.
Pulse mig can look so clean sometimes
https://preview.redd.it/s2lh8s7cvzwd1.jpeg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cde28383b6c49f79998d9239ed91836a58dcb45e

This was for the inspector
What process is this? Just GMAW? Looks clean as fuck dude
Wow. Super secret flanges. Who patented that? Dude's gonna be a bizillionare. Those would work for a lot of shit!
Looks like a channel for a heat exchanger. Not exactly anything secret if that‚Äôs the case. However, I e worked in half a dozen exchanger/pipe shops and none of them did pulse mig. Was your whip fixed to an arm like a bug-o or did you do this freehand?
Now I‚Äôm hard.
You'd be surprised how much sensitive information can be divulged in a serious corporate espionage attempt. Maybe company X had a dozen parts snooped but your flange here completed the jigsaw and they got to market 2 months ahead of time. These are just extreme measures that a rival country might try to do, but unlikely to happen with a corporate entity unless its korea, South Koreans apparently do alot of corporate espionage on each other.
Nice. What is it for thats so secretive. Lol
Damn...my tattoo artist can't make lines that straight.
It dont get much better than that, imo. Looks like a robot weld
What type of welding work is this? Boiler maker?
I smell particle accelerator.
Id let you fuck my wife
Fuck me, you should always sign NDA‚Äôs
Pulse and a roller? To a lot that‚Äôs a cheat code, still, those are some nice dimes.
which Fronius model and what settings were you running?
Gonna ignore that LOF in the second picture?  No wonder you hate the onspector
Cherry welds my broh
Love pulse
Would you mind sharing your pulse settings? Are you running 316 LSi 0.035 wire?
Looks like some work I machined for water companies, with that ‚Äú rust‚Äù casting lol not really rust but handling the middle section is very dusty
Didn't know you could pulse arc pipe. Looks absolutely beautiful.
No respect from me if you said ‚Äú is this a good weld ? ‚Äú To be honest I love looking at perfection in a weld but I‚Äôm sick of looking at great welds where the welder is looking for compliments . Yeah , you know what your doing ‚Ä¶ I would hire you on tomorrow, if you have a good attitude too . Fuck prima donnas , I had enough of them . Good work there fella !
Really ‚Ä¶. they x-rayed a socket weld ? I‚Äôve seen that before , but wonder if UT is better as one can detect LOF easier  with UT
Parts for Babylon gun 2.0?
I think there's a guy on YouTube that'd pay you at least $22/hr for those welds if you believe in yourself
Mind sharing those pulse settings?
Since the NDA is up, what did they pay you for a job like this?
Iraqi supergun?
Looks like shit
this is pretty much what i think every day. I wouldn't dare post that pic of 3 bungs welded into a piece of 2". Someone might think to weld bungs into their pipe!
Yeah I wanna kno what the job was. Why you hadda sign and nda ?
Tell me, without telling me, that you hate your inspector.
Pulse GMAW. really fun. Flashes high/low voltage rapidly. Makes a weird noise but welds like butter
\>UFO debris in the background
Yep, heat exchanger. That positioner had GO and NO so it's freehand, run 10" hit pedal and keep up then 10". 

We exclusively did pulse (short arc or TIG roots)
pipe flange metal spooky
Heaps of builders and companies have a 0 social media policy. Doesn‚Äôt matter what it is, could post a photo of your balls if it‚Äôs on their site they‚Äôll come down hard for 0 reason
DOD infrastructure is generally held as "secret", even more so with something like a heat exchanger that could be critical to run a data center, communications, or a hospital. Pictures in the areas that will have infrastructure like this will also often have printed building maps or other information on the equipment.
There's still a cap pass missing in that picture. You can see 1/4" of bevel.
It was years ago, it was .052 wire in the range of 350ipm but I don't remember settings
Only because I could stay mostly on top with a positioner. I also was using a fronius (water cooled with machine parameters controls on the gun :change any setting on the fly:) I could pre program 6 completely different profiles and change them with a trigger tap or use the controls to adjust arc length or wire speed while I ran. Damn near a wire feed tig
You‚Äôd be surprised by how strict some places are about photographing anything, even with spools being built off site in a contractor fab shop
Wait a second, is that what they're for ? *Makes frantic notes based on picture*
We had DOD contracts and that made the whole shop a no social media zone. 

Even mentioning the NDA was mostly tongue and cheek. I do have pics in folders that notify me when I can share. These popped up so I showed them.
Why is this hard for the inspector?
Nice. You did an amazing job dude. You deserve top pay
Most places discourage you from taking pics of your balls in the middle of the shop
Yea that makes sense but they don‚Äôt usually make you sign ndas. I‚Äôve worked plenty of places where you can‚Äôt post pictures of the product. Never had legal obligations though lol
That makes sense.
Pretty slick.
trust me i've been there. I get it to some extent, some parts might be sensitive, and it's easier to say "no pictures ever" than to say "no pictures of these specific parts"

That's why i said 3 bungs in 2 inch pipe. It was actually (redacted) bungs in (redacted) pipe.
Strict no photo policy at the petro chem facility that I work at. So called proprietary processes is the official reason. Liability is what I think. In the event of an accident or incident, can‚Äôt have photographic evidence contradicting their version of events in a court case or OSHA investigation.
Exactly. You never know where the piece you're working on is going or what it's really for, so I've always blurred over any sensitive numbers that could be used for traceability. Even if it was just in the background of a weld Pic.
I remember I went on a tour of a machining shop in high school and found it odd they let us hold muzzle brakes for 30mm artillery
Does DOD make you take pp tests ?  I stopped smoking weed for about 35 years because I worked at a job that required randoms because it was under DOT rules ( offshore pipelines ) . They could not make me stop drinking beer though or attending a stripper place once in a while ,which forced me to tell my wife I was working overtime .
That one might waste their time...
Bet he‚Äôs making 60 at least
I had a customer helper ask me ( rig welder at the time working at a gas plant if I wanted to see the BRAIN ‚Ä¶ Of course I said yes. He wheeled around pulled out his hairy balls and said this is the brain . I laughed for a few days ‚Ä¶ and am laughing now
But, not all... the funs ones are out there somewhere
Could be a military contract or something to do with hiding a patent. It‚Äôs not uncommon these days
Yeah I hear you man. I get you were being a little sarcastic, my comment was more for the people that haven‚Äôt been around those types of contracts before. A lot of people don‚Äôt get the exposure of working in nukes, government research labs, pharmaceutical plants, chemical plants, refineries, etc all of which have strict no picture policies even for something as simple as a 1/2‚Äù socket weld on a steam trap.
Even just having specific parts be "no photo" could provide information about processes and projects.  It also tells a bad actor what to focus on for valuable photos/information.  If everything is no photo there's nothing highlighting some part as being "special."  Since there's no real need for the contractors to take pictures, it's pretty much a no brainer from a security standpoint.
If my last worksite allowed any sort of photography they'd be fined and sued into oblivion by the end of the week.
Oh yeah for sure. I‚Äôm working in a refinery right now as well and if they even see your phone out at all they‚Äôll search it and walk you straight to the gate, even pressing changes in some extreme cases but frequently banning you for life. Nukes won‚Äôt even allow you to bring a phone in, they‚Äôll search you on entry and you throw everything in a locker before entering the work area.
That's not exactly top secret technology
Come on ‚Ä¶ a short little spool with a flange at ea end ain‚Äôt no top secret thang !  But i understand with the internet today . Everybody is paranoid now . Hell I had two Chinese peering in my window the other day ‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt figure out if they were spy‚Äôs or just wanted to see assault with a dead weapon ! ( That‚Äôs a joke son !)
‚ÄúI know this part. I know because they changed the flange on the right how we can improve the yield of OUR nuke by 150%.‚Äù - *hypothetical North Korean hacker on Reddit looking at the picture posted by someone disregarding an NDA*
This made me chuckle.
Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong bro I agree 100%, i got in trouble for posting an Instagram story of a vertical up stringer at work
Can't help but to think a shop installed mug nuts the wrong way. 
2012 hyundai elantra limited. 

Was changing my brakes & noticed that the lug nuts seem weird. First Pic is how I it was installed, second is how I think it should be. 

If I install the same as the first pic, it starts to strip around the opening a bit. 

Please confirm if I'm just crazy.

We had a kid get demoted *from* lube tech.¬† I'd never heard of that happening before, but it looks like we've found a second candidate for that.


That's fucked up.
He obviously missed Lug Nut Day at the Tire College
They now owe you wheels, those are fucked.
I‚Äôve seen customers do this, can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen a shop do anything this dumb‚Ä¶
That's because they did put them on the wrong way.
The wheel is damaged because the holes are now oblonged/egg shaped. Even when you put them back on CORRECTLY as you suspected from the beginning the lugs won't hold the wheel on correctly. 

They may have also damaged the studs as well.

For safety's sake install your spare tire and return to whatever place last touched your wheels and tires. Check the other 2 wheels as well and provide documentation and photos.
They are supposed to be on the other side of the car!
They did. Can't make this shit up
Now you know why companies put end caps on the lugs to prevent this.
[deleted]
I did this once when I was first working on my car. I was slightly confused and figured they had just chamfered the lugnuts for style points. I suppose a later shower thought is what saved me and that wheel.

Also it appears those lugs successfully machined some counter bore into your wheels :-)
Yeah those are definitely backwards.. and looks like they damaged the rim from putting them on backwards.. how stoned was the guy that did this
You need a new rim and lug nuts
That takes a special kind of dedication to stupid - totally fucked up!
Edit: Lug. Didn't feel like deleting & reposting.
Edit 2: Back passenger i broke loose a lug screw. Front passenger, one of the lug nuts' threads seems messed up, i can't hand tighten it like the others. Will replace that one. So far got 3 new sets of roters & brake pads on. Also, not the piston on the caliper but the screw next to the anti rattle clips is seized. Guess general wear & tear comes with a 12 year old car.
I didn't read all comments. But yes he did and he "widened your holes" so make sure the lugs still seat properly when installed correctly or I might even demand they replace the rim also.
Lol. Got what you paid for it might seem.
How even?
How fucked up is fucked up?

That's fucked up.
Hilarious 

Had lubie helping me one time on a chevy and he hand started all my lug nuts like this lol

It happens, new techs do some dumb shit some times, bet you they wont do it again after all the jokes about to be made at their expense lol
I've never seen that before
You are not crazy.  The lug nuts are on backwards.
a lot of rims are lug centric as well meaning the lugs are used to center your wheel. Some rims are hub centric. That tire probably wasn't even properly balanced installed like that as you need the lugs to center the wheel. Also since the wheel isn't being centered on the lugs, the studs can bang up against the rim if it shifts damaging your rims. What a fuck up who ever did that. Smoke another one.
Not crazy, they‚Äôre backwards. They owe you a new wheel.¬†
What's the torque spec for a coffee mug?
Sure did
Acorn nuts. Acorns going pointy end into the ground.

Looks the tech ground the hell out of the rim trying to seat those. They owe you a new set.
This is why I do as much as my own work as possible
Can someone explain what‚Äôs wrong here in the pics?
New wheel time
"I know a guy who can do it cheaper"
Im impressed by how strong those lug nuts are, enough to make the rim eaten away
Your rims are now stuffed
Yeah deffo go to the shop which has lug nuts, not mug luts , mug luts are knock off
Way to many uggas in that dugga
Yea second pic is the right way. Hopefully it didnt tear the rim up to bad...
I did this back in the day when I first worked in a shop when I was 15. My boss corrected me but I remember the embarrassment now 25 years later.
They owe you a wheel.
They absolutely installed them wrong
Literally got blamed and almost punished because of the brain dead lube tech we had emphasis on had. I did the inspection and then handed it off for the oil change, kid did that exact thing on every wheel during the rotate. One of the wheels fell. off. the. car, on the highway, and the rest of the wheels mounting holes were wallered to hell and back. Fucking God bleased miracle the family wasn‚Äôt injured. And were it not for the fact that our shop foreman and 2 other techs explicitly remembering that exact car I wouldve been suspended without pay for a week (not to mention management didn‚Äôt like me because i wasn‚Äôt a lap dog for them and constantly called out their bullshit, so I had a target on my head 24/7 and they were more than happy to punish me regardless)
No I think the mug nuts are in tight. The lugs in the other hand is a different story üòÇüòÇ
As everyone else said, very wrong. The first and easiest thing to point out is the rule of thumb that you should never be able to see any unused thread on a lugnut. The point of the cone side is to seat into the rim to allow 0 empty space between the sruds and rim and make the rim center perfectly aligned with the rotor center. As the first pick is, you literally have empty air pockets between your studs and rim. One solid bump at high speed and you're either shearing the bolts off and losing a wheel, or you're going to experience something very similar to death wobble.
You might be right
agreed. wrong way!!!
Mug nuts eh?
I'm concerned by how clean that axle nut looks, i.e. did the person who screwed this up also do suspension work on the car?
Looks like they Ooga-d the DOOGA out of them too
If i use an airgun to take them off, is it a *mugshot*
What kind of shop? dealer, small, quick lube,...?
Imagine a shape sorter. You match the shapes.
Those are f'd. Mine aren't open-ended like that. I can't even remember a time lugs were open like that.
I have seen this in the wild. Actually test drove it before we popped the caps. ‚ÄúA slight vibration on the interstate‚Äù was a very understated symptom.
Ooooooof
They owe you a new rim
WTF........your fired!
This is why most have caps on the flat ends.
The tapered side is so you can get the impact on faster. Like the Nascar guys.
I was on a parking lot and saw someone putting them on wrong. I stopped and helped then do it right.
Started working in shops at 16. No prior experience. Not an excuse but I have made that mistake.
r/Justrolledintotheshop
Mug nuts are indeed backwards
Jeeebus
Yes, cone in, flat out.
LUG
I have seen this a few times in my 35-40 years in the biz. One led to multiple nuts coming of and nearly wobbling off. One guy got fired, the other got demoted to runner, and the other (whom was manager) got ‚Äúa talk‚Äù with no action taken.
Just think how many cars that tech put the lug nuts on incorrectly. Do you think that the shop will contact every owner whos car that tech worked on tell them free inspection. Fat fucking chance‚Ä¶At Discount Tire I have witnessed seasoned techs over watching the newbies.
see, they installed Mug nuts not Lug nuts.
You thunk right OP. Those mugs are on backwards.
![gif](giphy|l46CyJmS9KUbokzsI|downsized)
They are on the wrong way. How does one fuck up THIS bad.
Mistakes happen but, damn..
How do you even fuck up THIS bad?
First pic is 100% wrong.
A mechanic was trying to show me how to replace wheel bearings on a trailer once, and put the outer set in backwards.  I thought it looked wrong, but said nothing.  When he had finished and the wheel wouldn't turn, his remedy was to try to drag it round the yard until it loosened up.
Those are the new aerodynamic lug nuts. The smooth tapered shape helps cut the wind and cuts drag. It also help to not create turbulence with the air around the wheel and helps promote brake rotor cooling!
Some nuts were mugged for sure.
Don't the square half stick out? Is this a new fad?
I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about your mug nuts but did you notice the lug nuts in your picture? They are installed incorrectly.
What the PHAUCK!l????????
Looks like the person who fitted them was away with the fairies the day they were taught which way wheel bolts are fitted ü§Ø
Some idiot thought they looked better that way. They have damaged all your wheels.
Thats fucking crazy
Look how they massacred my boy.
All I can say is that I almost did the same thing after a long day of repair.  I work in the industrial setting and the lug nut reminded me of a lock nut.  Which I began to put on.  Caught it though lol
And they messed up your wheel
It's complicated...how is a tire guy supposed to know the direction lugs are supposed to go
You  mean  Lug nuts??
Damn mug nuts
100% correct, they are backwards
Drive it back, ask for a manager, inspect rims when they have them off, demand any damages are paid for, if they refuse take them the small claims court and report to the BBB
Yup, those nug luts are definitely backwards!
I think you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. They look back to front to me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..ü§î
I would avoid any shop that would do this and also any shop that would put lug nuts on with such force as necessary to dig into the wheels. 

Jesus.
There are actually different lug nut styles pending wheel design.  The lug nut needs to be installed to match wheel seat. If wheel isn‚Äôt tapered, then tapered nuts should not be used.

How the hell they destroyed your wheels seating surfaces is criminal.

Take pictures and go back to the place that made this mess.  Inexcusable.  Obviously hiring inexperienced help and not training/overseeing their work.  This could have ended up being a big mess/accident.  They should not give you any argument about paying for a new wheel.  Don't drive around like this, especially on the highway.
On right, but bastard used a 12 point socket that was    standard not metric
I was never a professional mechanic, just a hobbyist/DYIer. Have done my own repairs since I was 17. Family and friends vehicles too. I never put lug nuts on backwards like that.
Yeah, they did. 

You also need a new rim as those holes are rounded out. The wheel will most likely fall off soon.
If it hasn't been said already but those are completely wrong lug nuts. Those are conical shape lug nuts you need long shank/collared lug nuts I'd suggest getting them asap to prevent further damage to the wheels and potentially the hubs
Looks like it
how do you fuck up this bad??

I didn't even know that lug nuts had a "specific orientation" to them. but even I was able to intuit that "hmm, this nut, which always faces this way and has a unique design that i don't see on any other part, should probably face this way for a reason."
Holy zhit.  I never consider installing it that way.  That mechanic is think out of the box.
What a damn shame. I feel somehow responsible, having brought millennials into this world, for which we are all doomed to witness the terrible demise thereof.
You are lucky the wheels didn‚Äôt fall off while driving.  If the lug nuts aren‚Äôt seated in properly, they will loosen from the vibration and the wheel will absolutely fall off.  What they did is extremely dangerous.  I would be very upset if i were you.  I know this from personal experience having a wheel fall off myself for the same reason.  My wheel came off, car veered to the right, and i crashed into a telephone pole.  It was scary.  Somebody owes you an apology.
I‚Äôve seen this happen many times , it‚Äôs what you get when a shop hires idiots that use mug nuts instead of lug nuts.
Had a kid straight from UTI do stuff like this. It was so bad they ASKED him to quit. He got so offended that he did. had a contract and could have stuck it to them too. Glad he didn‚Äôt.  

Shit was unbearable .  Had to be showed how to rack a car and slammed a rim right into the lift day one.

Then, dude starts taking lug nuts off with a 3/8 ratchet. He has a brand new snap on half-in impact in the drawer. Doesn‚Äôt make the connection.

And one more:
I had a personal cylinder head on my bench that I was slowly porting and polishing on my lunches or downtime.
Dude gets all inspired by it and decides to pull his Chevy sonic into the shop on his lunch, Remove his plastic intake manifold‚Ä¶ to port and ‚Äòpolish‚Äô it?
Then realized he couldn‚Äôt get it back together and it sits in a bay the rest of the day disassembled. His ‚Äúhandler‚Äù had to stay and help him put it back together.

After like his first week they wouldn‚Äôt let him touch anything and just had him follow around a top tech like a puppy dog. The tech let him do one part of a job, (bmw valve cover gasket)
And he snaps the valve cover in two. (Left a couple bolts in and just yanked.  That‚Äôs when they asked him to quit on his own.

He went from shop to shop getting treated like a hot potato. It was kinda sad to watch tbh. I hope he gave up. Because this kid did not have it.
Obviously missed tire day at school!
You are correct
Ruined alloy for one
Yep. Those are backwards. The conical side goes towards the wheel.
This just seems like poor design. My truck's lug nuts are closed on the outside end, for example - you *can't* put them on backwards. All lug nuts should be like that.
Please tell me the shop didn't give you any shit about replacing your stems and wheels? That is a monumental fuck up.

I'm not even a mechanic, but I've popped and thus changed quite a few tires. It's pretty fuckin obvious which way the lugnut goes. Somebody needs to stay away from the wrench...
That‚Äôs a setup!
No mechanic work ever make such a mistake
What‚Äôs a mug nut?
Oh Jesus ! That‚Äôs bassakwards
I see they used your mug nuts on the wheels, which brings me to my concern. What's holding your mug on?
![gif](giphy|t3kTdgwnfPIygXpm6z)
Dealership did this to my car not long ago. Went in for a brake fluid flush. 

On my first trip back from work I could hear a creaking noise coming from all 4 wheels at low speeds. They did this to all 5 lug nuts on all 4 wheels. (I drive a 120 mile round trip to work so I was very lucky the lug nuts stayed on the car at highway speeds). 

I sent a picture of it to the dealer and they offered my next service to be on them. Never got that free service because that was the last time I ever took my car there.
i dont understand.. you literally only take wheels off and put them back on all day. how do you fuck it up? i had an alignment place forget to tighten my lugs once... they drove it to the front of the building all the way from the back bay. i noticed within 10 feet of driving what was wrong. i dunno how they either didnt notice or didnt stop and fix it. they gave me a free alignment and rotation for the future. lets just say after using the free services, i never went back. sucks too cuz its a locally owned business, not a chain.
They did this on my car too
Mug nuts?
What did you say to piss those guys off?
Nooooo
Mug nuts go on reverse to that of a lug nut.
Should've gone with the Yeti mug nuts
Jesus that‚Äôs bad
![gif](giphy|3oEjHAUOqG3lSS0f1C)
They owe you a wheel and a new set of lug nuts. Wow.
That sir is the visual definition of bass ackwards. Must have been a Coll√®ge  graduate.
Yup, and impacted...¬†¬†


Fun fact...¬† I work GSE (aircraft ground support)for a Boeing facility...¬† We recently hired a whole crop of mid 30s Army/Marine veterans who are basically fully ret*rded...¬† One of these geniuses kept putting lugs on backwards and impacting the fuck outta them....¬†¬†


Well, he got tired of us giving him shit for not being a mechanic and applied to go work on ACTUAL aircraft for Boeing...¬† He was approved and is now installing shit backwards on fucking PLANES ..
"Mug" nuts?
is this Costco? Had my tires rotated.  Before rotation I marked each tire to see if Costco was rotating them correctly.  The left front tire was marked #1.  When I got the truck back the left front tire was #1.  The manager was notified, and rotation was done again.   I recently bought new tires somewhere else.  Left front wheel was missing one lug nut. FU Costco.
![gif](giphy|3o6fJ9Oi4zEBLjzCow|downsized)
It's like he gunned it so long that the mother fucker friction welded your lugs, the studs and the wheel together...wtf I've never seen this, and we have some wild shit happen over in our quick lube lanes. Go back and complain like a mother fucker, pre write a review of the service center and go in there ready to submit that bitch. Google, yelp and the brand/dealer pages. He made your wheel look like its made of Play-Doh. If that's what they are calling anything close to a quality service, I would check everything they touched with a flashlight up close....
Saw a prep guy drive a new Honda Accord into a light pole trying to show off!!
He was fired instantly!!
I used to be a tire tech. Can confirm that's wrong. Also by the looks of it they put your lugs on with the pneumatic wrench which is why the lugs are stripped.
Wow, backward lug nuts. That takes a special kind of stupid. And here I am, a dropout from a tech school thinking I couldn't make it "in the industry"
Meanwhile the boss is happy paying the kid minimum wage instead of a mechanic rate.
Mug nuts is good lol
Installed wrong. Id request to have them buy u a new rim, lug nuts, and a wheel hub
Boeing?
So how does one prove that the shop did this? Like if they did it to me, i walk into the shop and ask for full repair, if they deny it, how do you actually prove they did it and you didn't go home and flip it around? 

I always wondered.. today I had my tires rotated and they said a tire was bent. How did it get bent? The same shop didn't mention it when they first put the tires on. What if they bent it doing the rotation?.. 

Just some deep thoughts, it seems really hard to prove anything. Also had issues when we bought our house where damage was just ignored in the attic and probably painted over. We were told you have to prove they knew and that's always near impossible
The trainee has poor observation skills.  Probably mind wandering about the weekend.  Probably safe as a service writer.
Customer states "I put the tire on myself, and it took all day, don't mess with it."
I would be pissed!
Hahahaha yeah, they did...
Ha! Well that's a 1st for me,it's nice to see that some shops hire "special needs" kids as well.
I think if you are calling them mug nuts, they are just fine
Never in my life have I seen something that retarded
Yep and now that wheel is ruined too.
That wheel has a very high probability of flying off after getting off of the freeway. A tire shop did something similar to this on my vehicle and I ended up in the aforementioned situation. Luckily no one was injured (the wheel almost hit someone walking). Wrong lug nuts (tapered vs flat, open vs acorn) could also put you in that spot.
Bought some alloys from a tyre shop once.
They had a special needs kid working in there.
They got him to fit my rims.

He forgot to tighten the lugs one of the front wheels.
Drove away unawares until the car starts feeling dicey on the road.

Pull over and the lugs that were obviously only hand tight when I left were only just on.
Ffs.
An accident waiting to happen...
There is no doubt the helper that did this isn't ready to be on their own
I think everyone saying wheel is destroyed is just being dramatic. As long as the wheel hasnt been loose, it should NOT have structually damaged the wheel in any way. (Holes are not ovals) Shop should drive after repair and retorque that wheel. You can try and get them to get you a new wheel, but dont be shocked when they say there is nothing wrong. Either way they should know it happened to check up on their "tech"!


The taper is smaller than the hex side, or else they would not have been able to put them on backwards. Often times there are shoulders on lugnuts to prevent this. Its a common mistake unfortunatly. 

Youll have marks around all the holes but luckily its got covers over the lugnuts.
Was it wobbly?
One plus, the socket goes on easier.
The rounded part should definitely be toward the vehicle, that's how it indexes and centers itself properly.
I did this when I was 16... Lol thanks to my friend's Dad who noticed and set me straight.
They owe you a new wheel, or multiple wheels, assuming it was like this on more than just that one! I'd check the lug studs too. Installed upside down like that, the wheel could rotate where the lug holes would be riding against the lug studs, although it looks like the jerk that installed them that way torqued the crap out of them! They actually ate into the wheel where the hex head of the lugnuts contacted the wheel! They should have a "we don't hire lugnuts here" sign posted!
 Whaaaaat,  noooo. What makes you think that?
Lug
cant believe you think they're called mug nuts lolü§£ü§£ü§£
Thank god I do my own work
They are wrong and may have damaged your rim
Me thinks you're right.
Are they... fucking backwards???
Yeah taper is to the inside, what a joke
Yep
The jagged bits of metal are a dead giveaway
Just a couple ugga-Duggas there
Yep, those are backwards. Ask me why I do my own work.
I seriously don't understand what I'm looking at, how did the cv axle just disappear in the second photo??? My perspective is a ll fucked up
Something tells me this was before it was taken to a shop. You got two wheels in ‚Äúhuh this is fucking my wheels up pretty bad, let me make sure I‚Äôm doing this right‚Äù and posted here. üò≠
Worked with a guy, kind of a dope but could turn a wrench, most of the time anyways.

Went to pull a car out of the bay [length of front pavement, then two way street and then a fence]

Started the car, and was floored...this loud roar went through the shop abd apparently he was the only on that didn't notice or he just freaked---this car had to be at 8k + on the tachometer. It made everyone jump, and not a little. Brain fart sets in and he throws it in drive [?!]

Never found our the reasoning but did mention it later during the filing of an accident report--this car hole shotted through the garage door, ripped the hood clean off, which popped but not up, shot into the street, still at unreal roms, tires billowing smoke---went through the chain link fence and down an embankment. I just stood at my box kind of in shock and blown away by the noise and the car somehow not hitting any cars on a busy two way street. Made a clean straight shot. Apparently the floor mat had rolled on the pedal and started it when floored and was still screaming when it hit the fence.
The problem is they gave you mug nuts and not lug nuts üôâü•¥
What the fuck üòÇ‚Ä¶ Mr George the new guy isn‚Äôt working out.
The fucks a mug nut?

Diabolical‚Ä¶.ü§£ü§¨ü§£ü§¨ü§¨ü§£
Christian lugs.
Just tell the shop and hopefully they‚Äôll take accountability.

The tech who installed em should get a warning or write up. He won‚Äôt do it again because the next time he‚Äôll be let go. He‚Äôll be triple checking the lugs from now on.
I just bought a car recently that would die randomly, code for a coil. Cool, no big deal. The weekend comes around and I get to looking at it and wiggle all the coil wires. One is loose. Push really hard, *click*. Starts and idles fine now. 

Same car, some vibration on the front passenger wheel, over say 45, now that I'm driving it more. Look at the wheels one night after work for the heck of it. Same. Dang. Thing. Every single one was installed backwards...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Better aero! ü§£
Probably going to need new hubs and bearings unless there's  enough clearance to replace just the studs, cause those have definitely been stretched out.
As someone who used to work in a shop I‚Äôd hate to use supplied tools. Some people do not care. Good case in point. A coworker had borrowed another coworkers jack and absolutely fucked it up. Needless to say said tech was pissed. He bought a new one and had it locked up. When asked why won‚Äôt he lend it out he said you didn‚Äôt pay for it I did. 

Always return tools in the same if not better condition then when you got it and after 3 times time to buy your own.
I love when people call out others lazy work but then can‚Äôt even write one sentence correctly. Proof reading is free.
Demoted‚Ä¶ to WHAT? Customer?
Reminds me of a time a customer came in to the dealership I was working at and asked for a rotation and for the wheels to be removed by hand. An apprentice that was there got the job. About 15 minutes later, he came to me, the lube tech, for help with his fingers red saying he tried his hardest but couldn't get those lug nuts off with his hands.
Lmao. When I worked at a dodge dealer, we had a lube tech get demoted to detail lol.
That‚Äôs the opposite of the first shop I was in. We promoted a porter to lube tech just to keep him from wrecking cars in the parking lot
Alright, let's start a list of "what's lower than a lube tech"?

I'll say "combustion prepper". He turns the key on, but doesn't start it because he can't even be trusted with that.
We had a guy that seemed... uhm... special. His first day as lube tech he walked in with zero tools, struggled to rack his first car, then  proceeded to double gasket that same car, and drove it out onto the service drive just spewing oil. Poor dude.
Soft firing.  Happens a lot.

We had a guy we couldn't really fire because he had perfect attendance, never really fucked up, but was absolutely useless and lazy.  

Now he has to grease and clean and sweep.  Not a tech anymore, and has the worst job.  

It's a play to make em quit.
We just recently demoted a trainee tech to porter. Reason: brake caliper bolt wasn't even run all the way in (the bolts in question have dry thread locker on them; he only screwed them in with his fingers, as far as the thread locker), *and* he just kind of made a dumb laugh about it. He was given a choice: porter, or gone.
We had a kid promoted to then demoted FROM lube tech after he spent thousands on a Snap-On box, tools and other misc items the truck guy was selling him lmao
We had two I saw get demoted to lot boy over the years. 

One gave back a car after a rotation with none of the lugs tight, and told the manager he didn't remember if it was making that sound when he pulled it in.
So did I in my shop, except he was promted to a service advisor "to get him off the tools". 2nd year apprentice as well
I've also had people demoted from lube tech. Granted, wasnt cause they fucked anything up. Dude was just slow af. We expect 15 min oil changes and I can get 3 cars in & out in around 12 minutes if I'm going really fast. We have 3 bays so im just running around swapping filter, pulling drain plugs. This dude would take 20 mins to do ONE car. Just to spin off the filter, install a new one, and take off/torque the drain plug.

Kinda funny, after they demoted him, he was re-certified the next day. So he's still doing his thing, taking forever just to do one car.

He was given a choice: porter, or gone.
I was demoted from Lube Tech at a dealership over mistakes that were blamed on me but weren't my fault. There was mistakes that I made too, but the ones that ultimately got me demoted were not my doing. Now, I run a successful mobile repair business making 4 times as much as I did hourly as a lube tech, doing all the work they assumed I couldn't do because I didn't have a pedigree, and could not do their entire oil change, tire rotation, upsell needed items, do work related to successfully upsold items, perform 24 point inspection, all in the 30 minutes they wanted it done. If I tried pushing that time constraint, mistakes got made, double gasketing oil filters generally (caught during initial start after fill, so only harm was a small mess).

I ended up quitting a few weeks after my demotion because I could not take out trash, and run errands for the mechanics I worked side by side with days ago like that, even other mechanics felt bad, one guy always would invite me to his bay claiming he needed help to do something, but in reality, he was just making an excuse to put a tool in my hand so I could wrench and do what I enjoy, working on cars, didn't even care that he got the money and credit for it, I got to stop playing shop maid and do some real work.

But know I run my own business, projected to be turning 100k gross a year in my second year, and honestly just laugh when I think about what the dealership lost when they took away the precursor to my dream job (lube tech lead in to Master Tech)
Gonna be the new spark catcher whenever someone is grinding something.
Ron White agrees.
Apparently he went to mug nut day instead.
But Sears still let him work on my van‚Ä¶
[deleted]
Yeah I'm sure those are the only scratches on those 2012 Hyundai wheels... Besides it looks like it has a center cap anyway.
Seen one other post on this sub‚Ä¶
Idk, if you squint and tilt your head it looks passable
They also stripped the fuck out of it
I would suggest not touching it at all. Instead, get the car towed, at the shop's expense. 

If OP touches it, well, then the shop can play dumb, because they weren't the last ones to touch it.
I call bs! There are ZERO signs of the wheel being loose!
absolutely do not change or remove anything before getting it back to them
Yeah, typical newbie mistake, installed the passenger lugs on the drivers side
After you make coffee, can you put lug nuts on this guy‚Äôs car? I have an emergency at home.
Came here to say this, that rim is destroyed! Depending where you are, you should be able to get a new one easily enough at a junkyard.
I read this and was thinking "nah the rim should be fine" but did my due diligence and looked again and you sir are correct.
100%
New studs too
Shop installed mug nuts, you installed lug nuts
Nah, you had it right... mug nuts seems appropriate¬†
That's totally lucked up
you did not have to write it like that tho
The tapered ends that you see pointing out are supposed to be pointing in.  Why?  Because the wheel itself, where the holes are, are also tapered.  This ensures the wheel is properly centered on the rotor.  When backwards, as in the picture, can't guarantee that the wheel is properly centered on the rotor.
Bruh lol
You do know that the aluminum rim is softer than the steel lug nut, right?
Naa he didnt lol. A couple of years ago I had the axel replaced. Car started to make grinding sounds as I turn. I believe it was around 130ish k mikes when it was replaced. Currently at 189k
Made me go back and look‚Ä¶.too bad the staking is facing away from the camera
Never heard of a bearing able to be installed backwards. Was it a thrust bearing?
No, mug nuts. Can't you read?
I was an assist manager at a national tire chain store.          
The idiot techs, no matter what could not put the proper PSI in the tires. I would sell a set of $1200 tires only to have the customer come back 3 min later to tell me the pressures are wrong.      
I'd go look and I would see 76, 52, 43, 30.           
This happened over and over.          
I finally got every tech together and held a class to show how to put air in the tire. I could not believe these people were so incompetent, they would not learn, didn't care too.          
Basically, Dumb Ass was a good enough title for them, and they didn't care.  I actually had one of them claim Workmans Comp because he fell off his Porch at home while coming to work.
Yup, go get them from the dealer.
The thing that sucks is I have covers so I didn't really noticed till now. It's been almost 3 months with all 4 tires like this.
*mug nuts
Is that how a new door was made in the fuselage? üòÇ
Yay, I didn't noticed any wobble when the lug nuts were on like that for 2 months. Also didn't feel/notice any wobble after correctly installing all the lug nuts on all the tires. I even broke a lug stud & currently only have 4/5 on one wheel until Monday when a mechanic can fit me in.
Didn't notice any wobble at 70mph. Ended up breaking a stud & currently with 4/5 lug nuts till Monday.
Lmao, sorry was typo. Didn't feel like changing it.
Sadly yes lol. All 4 tires. I didn't noticed till I purchased a full set of brakes. They are usually covered so I never noticed.
Rear tires
Now I have to take it to a shop, I went to take the back passenger wheel off to do brake pads, but one wouldn't come off. I ended up breaking loose the lug screw.  

Front passenger, one lug nut seems like the threads are messed up, not putting that one on & will just buy a new one. 

I feel like an irresponsible 2008 nissan owner. FML ü•≤
Floor sweeper.¬†¬†


Nice kid, now he drives for one of the parts stores.¬† We're always happy to see him... Without a tool in his hand.
Whenever someone gets fired I always tell people they got promoted to customer.
I worked at Jiffy Lube for a summer during college. Lowest employee. I told customers which bay to park at, pulled cars in, vacuumed interiors and washed windows. If there were no customers, I stood on the sidewalk holding a sign and waved at cars.
Oh man good one.
Homeless guy haha
At Amazon we *promote* to customer.
No that's a promotion
worse.  a customer that thinks they know more than the mechanics.
To a close sign on the door lol
Please say he was not literally using his fingers. I hope I am reading all of that wrong...
Demoted to detail? Lol my dealership detail was above parts driver, lube tech, shuttle driver, etc. Detail actually takes skill and knowhow.
Now he gets to wreck them inside the shop.
We just promoted a tech to salesman. He kept fucking shit up in the shop and costing us money. Salesman is commission only so the company won't even have to pay him more than minimum wage unless he actually makes them money.
He didn‚Äôt know how many duggas it was going to take to strip those lugs‚Ä¶. but he knew how many he was gonna use.
Oh man, I haven't heard that bit in a looooong time. Thanks for the nostalgia trip!
üò≠ yeah she is old but the car has 190k miles & no problems, just spent $900 on rotors, shocks, brake pads. Now spending more for rims lol
Have to defend the ol hyundai.  Just replaced an engine in a 2010 Santa Fe.  Easiest job I‚Äôve ever done.  The engineers designed everything with the mechanic in mind.  It was so refreshing to go to remove something and Lo and behold!  A hole through the cover specifically for the bolt I need to get to.  Wait, the bumper pulls off in one piece with all wiring attached!?   The engine has enough space to come out without dropping the suspension?! Magic!  It was such a fun job.

Now I hate the fact it was a head gasket that went out at 140k miles.  But the engine damage was from the family continuing to drive it to shops to get quotes and then forbidden chocolate milk.
Good thing it is not a collision situation, the shop cannot total your car, nor can their insurance.
They have destroyed the lug seats on the wheel, the lug nuts will no longer get proper torque as the seats have significantly more friction now.
yes, deep scratches that were not there before. anytime a shop leaves your car/parts in worse condition they owe you compensation or replacement. this is an embarrassing mistake that should never happen in a shop.

also, this is a big safety hazard because the nut bites the outside of the rim and makes it impossible to tighten to spec. these nuts can easily become loose after some driving. thank god he saw this on time
I did see that
I didn‚Äôt say the wheel was loose. 

I said that it wouldn‚Äôt be held on correctly because of the damage. Over time it will work loose and probably break studs in the process
Installed bass akwards
I didn't know how else to say it. Figured it was better than "stretched out your holes"
I get that you are right, but you redditors need to stop raining on peoples parades. God.
Timken racepak tapered roller bearing type.  He put in the second race so that the taper obviously didn't match the bearing surface.
It says  mug!
Wouldn't doubt it....¬† ¬†Nowadays, when Boeing hires people, their only concern is if new hires can obtain a security clearance THEN they just do "OJT"...¬† Skill, competency & experience aren't really a concern anymore and it seriously reflects in the end product...
Yeah someone went a little too crazy with the impact üò≠
Had a guy like that where I used to work. Dropped a car off the lift so owner told him no more lifts and had to pay for some of the damages (idk details of it) but then like a month later he drove a car in from outside into a bay for like a alternator change and drove it right into the owners snap on box. Mind you the owner supplied us tools so this was a huge ass box with thousands of dollars of tools lol. Messed it up pretty good. He quit 2 days later lol.
I take it he managed to bungle that, too?
Holding the brush end
‚ÄúIs that a tool in your hand or __‚Äù 

Never mind.
Trash barrel attendent.
‚ÄúThe most important position in the company‚Äù
I don‚Äôt think you are.
He was literally using his fingers.
That was the caveat to working lube; don‚Äôt get to drive ever again. That was the new porters job. Of course we had gone through like three shitty lube tech before him so the manager figured it would be a win win for the shop if he turned out half decent.
They owe you.
You're not spending money on new rims and nuts, maybe even studs if the threads are damaged.

The shop is.

This can't be fixed, don't let them try to repair it, or just say "Hey, we'll just put it on the right way."

No, this NEEDS replacing, its genuinely dangerous as without them being seated properly, they're going to shift around a bit, and it's not a matter of if they will fail, but when, even if placed on properly, the wheel will shift on the hub under braking/acceleration, and it will get worse over time.
>Now spending more for rims lol

YOU ARE SURE TF NOT.
I hope you read these peoples amswers. You do not need to pay for anything, this is 100% the shop who liable and needs to stop this person from damaging another persons vehicle. They are being nglectful by onstalling them the wring way. You would win in a court of law any day of the week. Make the shop pay for the repair. And do not be afraid to feel happy they made it right.
Go to the owner and he will give you back the money cause you can sue for this. Backwards lugs do not seat properly and can be a safety hazard. I'm surprised no one else caught it since they need to be torqued down
They pretty much can.

If the car is only worth $500 and you ask for them to unfuck their mistake that costs way more, they can negotiate to just buy the car, or you can pursue the whole thing in court where a judge will limit you to recovering actually damages, in this case the value of the car if it's less than the value of the wheels.
[removed]
Safety hazard my ass
And better than ‚Äúwrecked your holes‚Äù
Are owner supplied tools rare in the industry?
Likely had to pay the shop‚Äôs insurance deductible for the incident. Legally, some employers can do that, but it has to be explained up front (different state‚Äôs laws vary. May not be true in your location)
That‚Äôs a fucking wild story
Good thing no1 was reaching for a tool.
Hol up. He QUIT?  You mean he wasn‚Äôt fired after all that?  Your boss has a lot of patience. Sounds like a good dude. Probably coaches little league or something.
Fuck, the box alone is a mortgage payment
No, he just saw greener pastures.¬† It makes sense, I'd rather drive around all day delivering to people who are happy to see me than follow a broom around.
Pushing lines in the dust with the wood handle.
safety hazard when you catch a charge when that wheel flies off due to improper torque
Yes. I have never worked in an automotive shop where they supplied the tools.
Depends on the employer. The Sears I worked at supplied a basic variety of tools for oil changes and tire work. But any work beyond that it was expected of us to get our own, preferably craftsman, tools (we got a STEEP discount on any Craftsman/eVolve branded tools. I still have an eVolve swivel head 3/8‚Äù ratchet i still use 20+ years later). 

I filled my toolbox at over 50% off at times (oh yeah, mechanic discount stacked with promotions, unlike normal employee discount)
I work in a body shop but it's kind of different than the norm. I work for a privately owned large pipeline company as a painter/bodyman. But we also have a mechanic shop, and a diesel shop. We work on everything from pick up trucks to heavy equipment. Our owner buys any disposable items and also big ticket items. If we need anything and request it then they order it "for the shop". But a lot of us also have our own tools. If you have a tool box with several personally owned tools you can get a tool check added to your check for purchasing more tool or disposables needed for some tools. It's honestly really cool. If we are doing work at home we are free to take home any tools as long as we bring them back in.
Not sure honestly.
Owner supplied tools are rarely good, anyway
The closest we had was a community tool box. Random tools people had extra of as well as things that briefly employed people there left behind. It was handy for new lube techs that didn't quite have everything they need to borrow from.
In America 
If you want in the trade people will let u borrow tools to learn etc 
If you do t have such n such expensive tool or specialty tool

But 90% of places require at least basic tools 

And then beyond that you buy more tools for your trade....
That's the way it works where I'm at 

Idk bout yall 
Nut I've never not had the tools 
If I borrow it more Than Once I buy it next
Ya good possibility he had to.
Not mechanics related but when I was operating a feller buncher on the reservation, any marked trees I damaged I was financially responsible for.
It was a sight to see lol.
It got pretty tense in the shop. Ever walk into a room and you could feel the tension in the air. Lol
"I don't know who designed this thing, but he was a real idiot, it hardly does anything!"
You can torque it just fine. The actual seat of the lug nut isn't even affected.
This is actually the norm in Europe, atleast here in the netherlands it is.
That's crazy. I'm from belgium and all the owners supply the tool's here, if i want anything i just have to ask. And it aren't cheap tool, it's all wurth or beta
That's fucked.
I worked in a small engine shop (Husqvarna dealer) that provided all tools. Not exactly automotive, but in the same general category. Mostly Harbor Freight, with a smattering of Matco.
Damn I wish i could have worked at sears. Or shopped at one even tbh. Rip sears wish I would have gotten to know you better.
Yah there is a dealership near me that includes free tools as part of their hiring package. Starting at Lube Tech. They‚Äôll get you ASS certified as well as 4 day work weeks and 5 consecutive days off every three weeks. I‚Äôm looking to get into the industry and thought that seemed pretty nuts compared to everything else I‚Äôve seen around me.
Sounds like an owner that gets it, and understands that if you give to our people some care, freedom and responsibility, they will return the favor. You need to make sure that everybody is on par with the honor System you guys have, one person eventually will destroy that by keeping tools, or trying to lie about the tool check
I‚Äôm not a mechanic but I watch a lot of mechanics YouTube and anecdotally it seems the guys working for internal shops or servicing machinery are treated much better than dealerships or retail shops.
Ooh. Tree law can be a cast iron MF depending on locality.
Lol
you‚Äôre straight up blind
Rare in the UK. 

At least from my experience!
Yeah I‚Äôve worked in 2 mechanics shops in the uk and me or any of the mechanics there had ever had tools provided by the employer
Absolutely not the norm in the whole of Europe.
You ALWAYS want to OWN your own tools. It gives you Autonomy and you ultimately have leverage and more worth to the company. If you don't own your tools, the company owns you... 

But If you have a vast amount of tools you have curated over the years and they are sorted neatly, presentation is everything.  Every Tool has a spot, in my Truck and Shop.. I have every tool you can imagine, from Welding Equipment to Wiring, Soldering, Brazing, Wrenches, Organized Nuts and Bolts, Grinders, Security Bits, Impact, Drill press, Tubing Bender/Roller, 3D printing, Castings, Aurduino Projects, Robotics and Programming ... the list goes on and on ....it all started at age 12 with a love for dirt bikes and Go-Karts... now I , for the most part sell houses and do Handyman type of things for mainly people I know, clients and referrals... oh and still make Go Karts and Ride Dirt Bikes lol still a kid at heart 

But investing in your own tools is one of the biggest investments you can make in yourself...become a "swiss army knife" type of person with vast Mechanical Skills and you will always have worth in this world..and will never be poor. 

And Just a pro tip: Never be a welder for a career choice lol, do it as a side hustle and wear a respirator... Breathing in Toxic Metal fumes for 10+ years will absolutely ruin your skin and lungs.
Here in Freedom-land, you get to pay for the privilege of laboring for someone else's profit.
Exactly, we use Facom/Sonic. If i need something, i talk to the parts manager, he orders it.
I‚Äôve had one high quality European tool in my life as I live in America. It was a pair of snips left by a telecom or cable guy. They were rusty and sitting on  a ledge by the service box. They had been outside in the weather for quite sometime, I cleaned them up and used them for years. I realized no tool the average person sees here for sale compared to these, I looked them up, they were German made, all I can say is they made the tools off the Snap On truck look like garbage.
We're compensated appropriately though and to be fair, having worked in both styles of shops, I much rather prefer my own tools. They're where I put them, in the condition I put them away in and I know exactly what is where. This makes me more efficient and since I'm paid flat rate it literally improves my income.
For the automotive repair industry, not really. Tools are expensive and get abused. Most shops are not backed by a corporation or company, so it just works better for the professionals to own their own tools. I personally hate being handed shit tools and told to work with them, so choosing what I use is also a plus to this.
No. Because shop supplied tools always have legs. Or is it wings?  Point is, shop supplied tools are like cockroaches.
It reduces theft. I'm a me hanic and I can't count the ammount of gear I've had go missing either through light fingers or theft by borrowing
When I worked in a bike shop we had all our own tools minus a handful of shop tools like a truing stand. 25 years later I love my toolbox and use the non-bike tools regularly.
Nah. It was ok at first, I made 5.55hr+commission. On busy days I did ok for myself. Then they changed it to $9/hr for the level i was on. Seemed good at first but then i realized on busy days I was losing money for the work I was doing, especially if I managed to get other services sold (i didn‚Äôt recommend services that customers didn‚Äôt need). Thats where i used to make my commission money before. 

Sears wondered why their technicians no longer tried to upsell services and worked slow as hell.
Sears is probably the only department I actually miss. Pretty sure my first credit card was a Sears card, that got used often.
They used to be the best place to buy socks and underwear. My top drawer has never been the same since they closed.¬†
I went to my local Sears twice when I was a kid. (God, that made me feel old in my mid 20‚Äôs üòÇüòÇ)
I work in a shop in the us and they supply all tools.
I think you misspelled Freedumb.
I love it when someone calls America "freedom-land" because ironically. America is ranked like 60th in the world for political and civil freedoms. Lol
I work in industrial refrigeration/hvac. Basic hand tools and cordless drill and impact? Mine.  Anything specialized and industry specific is on the company.  Basically, if it's a tool I could see myself using at home, I buy it for myself.
Imagine if everyone had to share tools.  There wouldn't be a 10mm anywhere to be found.
Exactly right. Common tools are either stolen,  broken or lost because no one cares. Or they are the cheapest tools money can buy. Having my own tools is great and i'd not have it any other way.
Not just the repair industry.  Used to work in the building construction industry (carpenter, built houses).  Besides your tool belt, you brought your own circular saw, reciprocating saw, and extension cords.  I've seen too many $175-$200 worm-drive saws treated like absolute crap.  Dropped off buildings, thrown on the ground, cords cut, etc.  If it's yours, you're going to take better care of it.

  
Have a friend that's worked as an auto mechanic for years.  He worked for one guy that supplied the shop tools.  Countless ones walked, typically right after a new kid started.  Others got left in customer cars.  Again, if it's yours, you're going to take care of it
I think the upside to being a car mechanic versus working in HVAC is that people are more likely to do car maintenance as a hobby, thus increasing the likelihood that *every* tool you own related to it is something you might use at home.
My dad worked in an industrial setting, and they made him bring his own tools.  Once he broke a tool, though, they would replace it.  Nobody bought good tools to start with, everything was junk made from Chinesium.  You'd think the whole thing of "you buy your own tools but we'll replace them" would mean they were chill about people taking tools home, but they weren't.
Lol just the one I brought with me in my lunch box every day.
Or the people will learn to put it back where it belongs or who lost pay for the new one.
You found mine? 
Last year I had three 10mm sockets. They‚Äôve all walked away.
I run the tool crib and the warehouse at an industrial electrical shop and we have a lot of expensive Greenlee specialty tools and expensive test equipment. We have a lot of guys that are great. Comes back clean and working. Other guys I just can't believe how they treat the tools. Won't tell me if there is something amiss with the tool, leave trash in stuff, dirt and dried mud. Had a $4500.00 crimper come back that had been left out in the rain...... And these are guys that will loose it if you glance at their tools.

This post is unlawful in the state of Alabama.
Stop i can only get so erect
must be nice having CLEAN material to weld!
I believe my cock has exploded
After seeing that one Chinese gif of a guy using precise silicone beads and spray painting them chrome, I have issues trusting perfrct looking welds.
This should be tagged NSFW.  That's weld porn.
Supurb!
Bravo sir, bravo.  üëèüëèüëè
I hate you.
10/10
Holy Jesus
Still drooling. Glorious 11/10
Do u want a job
Damm bro! 10/10
God damn it: 1 you're probably married already and 2 great job lol
This is a piece of weld art.
Perfection‚Ä¶
Bitch fuckin how?
I hate you and your beautiful work.
Good lord
God damn!
Beautiful. I like the angle iron (Aly) you used to brace. Do you just use a zip disc to cut the tacks then finish with a file then flap wheel? 

I‚Äôm not sure I could cut those angles off and blend it to match the quality of the rest of the part
Damn!  Do you preheat that and how many amps you running?  I have trouble with anything over 1/4 inch.
Beautiful! What settings?
Beautiful. Looks like a piece of art. After you‚Äôve welded as many years as I have all you have left is to try to make your next weld better looking than the last one.
Beautiful
Holy shit
Curious about the tacks up top on the L joints. I'm guessing those will be removed? What are they for?
Better than me
lol I‚Äôm doing aluminum is school rn and god I‚Äôm so bad
Nice
Save some üòº for the rest of us
at that point, its really all for the love of the game
Dammit. You again
as a hobbyist, it's nice to see that even the pros are drooling.   you have found your calling in life!
Such beauty! Rembrandt was an amateur.
Sublime üëå
Robot weld?
Can you share wps
Did you preheat? Im thinking my current welder isnt putting out the correct amp its older and i know the duty cycle is not as good but, i use zirconium tungsten 1/8 to 5/16 run at 210 amps on anything over 1/2 plate and it just dont want to wet out and keep the puddle consistent.
Stellar
Could you make it more shit so that i dont get fired by comparison?
I just nutted wtf man
You‚Äôre too good to weld for NASA
The money shot..
Well done sir! Pornographic! üé©
Magnificent
I am hot and moist‚Ä¶
Erm clean up on aisle my pants ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone‚Ä¶.
For daisy dukes?
For a second I thought it was about the sequel to GTA V... "GTA W"
And also the combined states known as New England
I used to weld/repair a lot of alloy hulls that had corrosion from salt water. It‚Äôs like you forget what new material is like or working at a bench, inside!
In Vancouver, Canada?
If hes unemployed, I've got a job for him üòÖ
Haha! Too OCD to have a girl lmao
Yeah, zip the angle off and grind the scabs. It‚Äôs the only way to retain the inside dimension
There‚Äôs plug welds underneath that I do first to get the heat into the part.
Miller Dynasty 350. 300 amps on the panel with a wireless pedal. 125 hz, 75% balance on the cleaning side since 5086 is heavily oxidized. 1/8 1.5% lanthanated electrode (gold) with #5 torch cup and 3/32 5356 rod
Just pieces of angle to retain the inside dimension during welding. I‚Äôll remove them after the part has cooled down and grind off the scabs
My gut tells me that they're just for fixturing the parts in position to prevent them moving while being welded.
Everyone starts out like that. If it makes you feel better, I‚Äôve been welding for 30 years. Practice, practice, and more practice üçª
Lmao ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Of course
It‚Äôs plug welded from the bottom side via tab and slot. I do the plug welds first to heat the work up, then do the inside wraps. This has heated the work up enough to get a decent weld on the outside. What‚Äôs your machine? Your bench also sucks heat out from your work. Gonna sound stupid, but minimal contact with your bench helps a lot with an underpowered machine on thicker material.
Throw a scarlet letter on those damned welds lest they seduce the landed gentry
What do you do to clean salt infested shit like that?
best I can do is Michigan for 6 months
Lmao me too üíÄ
Lmao
I am not a welder, I find welding fascinating, especially when I see stuff like this, the question I ask is in good faith.

I see that this welder is around 9k and the inputs you've set are very specific.

Knowing what you know, what is the lowest level machine you believe you could replicate results like this? And by that, I guess I'm not taking about the cost, but what are the features YOU would need as a welder to replicate it? E.g Is it the amperage? The frequency? Both? Or other factors altogether.
That does make me feel betterüòÇüòÇ I just need to put in my 10,000 hours and hopefully I‚Äôll be as smooth as u man. God ur weld looks great
Not gonna though.
Pick you best looking circumference, clean off all the antifoul and primer, barnacles and seaweed, weld, grind, weld, until you have built a line of new aluminium or you move your circumference out until you have a useable area, repeat until you‚Äôre able to weld the patch in. All upside down, frequently lying on your back or awkward half crouch.
All of the above. I prefer Miller as far as a machine goes. There‚Äôs a lot going on that is on you, and not the machine though. I‚Äôm supplied with a quality welder, and clean material to do my job. I can‚Äôt take all the credit for my work
Kinda sounds like cast a little bit. I had a trailer I welded that was underwater, thought I ground and cleaned it up enough but ended up cracking. üòî
so, you could replicate this weld on any machine could provide these settings?

Not at all dismissing your personal skills btw, what I'm trying to get at is, could someone with your skills achieve the same result with cheaper equipment?
I'm 15 and I made a rocket stove today.

Good stuff my guy! Also, where‚Äôd you get that Mr. Frog sticker, I‚Äôve got to get that for a friend of mine.
Hew ye, does it work? Been wanting to make one too.
Good job. Now find some other projects you can do and keep welding!
NICE JOB!!!
nice!!!
Btd5 bloon chipper, love it
Good job!
Nice project. I may have my students try that!
A rocket what?! Never heard of that. 

Neat though.
Well-done buddy! Keep it up
Sweet! Nice work dude, great quick stove for camping or a fishing spot. And fun project to build.  
Might want to test out a baffle plate to create a air gap under your wood fuel to create a nice draft and cleaner burning
Welding is a great skill to learn. Good job on the stove.
Very well done!
Schiittt yeah boi
Ok, kid. I know a bong when I see one.
Nice man! Always protect your eyes, hands, and lungs. And don‚Äôt hurt your back. I can‚Äôt weld anymore because of a bad accidents always be alert of your surroundings! Have fun!
Rock on dude ü§ò
Very safe
Well done kid! Love to see the young guns getting into the trades! Even better when they use their brains creatively!!
Nice work, looks great !
Nicely done you will do well in life.
Hell yeah, brother!
Your comment section on some of your videos is interesting
I made it. I make pretty much every sticker except for my holographic channel logo stickers.
Works good. [I made some lima beans with it.](https://youtube.com/shorts/AEtDWfeof9A?si=mjgEr5VXM-hlTaDf)
BTD5 reference on a different subreddit goes wild
Thank you very much!
Damn it. Don't tell my parents... ü§£
Yeah. I don't want to do welding as a career. I want to do linework for 10 years and move to Finland, buy a house, and start a forestry or possibly excavation business.
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Doooope
Damn. Well sounds like you got it figured out!! Finland aint cheap though. Lol
Yeah. Homes and land are more affordable though.
Also, it kind of depends on where you are.
Well thats not hard to believe lol
On todays episode of weird shit I‚Äôve found in cars‚Ä¶

Pest repellent. Must be a country vehicle. Field mice suck
It‚Äôs done to deter rodents.
Well known fact that Irish Spring is repellant to rodents and also women.
Attracts leprechauns to come work on your car while you're sleeping.
Not weird keeps mice away from the wires, and it doesn‚Äôt kill your cats like moth balls
Surprisingly the smell might work. I used to get a lot of mice in a shed. About 6 years ago I started putting dryer sheets in it (a couple in each corner). Haven‚Äôt seen a mouse in there since but still see them in the yard. 

I assume it‚Äôs the strong scent they done like.
Attempt at rodent deterrent
Keeps rodents away or if they do come, they eat it instead of your wires and it probably kills them too. I have it in mine and my moms car. I see it a lot in Subarus.
(Irish accent) "Manly, yes, but I like it too!"
The Irish Spring is mouse repellent.  I use it in my Snap-On toolbox to keep the mice out of it that slip in the shop in the fall.  35 years of wrenching on Generous Motors products I‚Äôve found: pistols, ammo, homemade whip, dildos, wigs, pills, weed, weed grinders, bowls, bongs, used condoms, lube, dirty thongs, ww2 medal, more petrified food then imaginable , some asshole wanted his power window fixed that had puke in the door panel map pocket, dead mice ( I don‚Äôt know how the dude drove his Geo Prism it stunk so bad), a nest of live baby squirrels in a blower cage (they went to the animal rehab as one had an amputation, if they say the blower motor makes a weird noise I gotta turn it on and try it) and the worst was the dude living in his car that I refused to repair the rodent damaged wiring until the wash bay cleaned the interior (removed the center console trim and found the problem and a crap ton of giant rat shit everywhere).  Once had a Cavalier with a real bad water leak and the guy had grass growing out of the floor mats in the rear from spilled seed.  Oh and some old dudes intrigue that hacked up his phlegm everywhere inside the car on the windshield, steering wheel, dash etc.  and rotten apples moldering under his seat.  I‚Äôd get a repair order with his name and I‚Äôd glove up and put floor mats everywhere.  Some people are just gross.
stick soap or dry deodorant on the serpentine belt while engine in running to stop it from squeaking
Irish Springs Soap repels insects and flys, and other rodents as well.  The scent that's in it repels them.
Trying to send the mechanic a message....
Yup, I've heard of this being done to deter mice.   I don't know if it actually works or not though.
It's to keep away pests! üêÅüêÄüêø I have done this since I live out in the country it works! So does peppermint oil. Damn pest will eat wires but not food. Lol
Soap being used as rodent repellant. Be happy they didn't use cat piss
Soap! Mice!
That is a clean install.
Keeps rodents and light beer away.
Supposed to keep rodents out of machinery so they don't eat the wiring harnesses.  Some imports use wires with biooil based insulation and mice love to eat it.
Irish spring soap to keep mice out. By the way, it doesn‚Äôt work. They just chew on it till it‚Äôs gone.
It keeps mice out. Works really well actually. Irish spring works the best for some reason
We use Irish spring to keep ants out of HVAC controls.  It works.
Works on mice. Wonder if it works on spiders. ü§∑üèª
when you cat is underneath the car you gotta put something in the engine bay for the mice.
It is supposed to work on mice but I've found it doesn't work very well.
Def for rats
Mice and rodents hate Irish Spring. Cheap pest repellent if a car sits a long time.
Irish Spring soap is said to repel mice.
Back in the day, used to put soap on the serpentine belt from keeping it from slipping.
I was walking to get lunch this afternoon and saw a Snake fall out near the exhaust of someones vehicle, and then climb back in...
To keep red squirrels and the likes from chewing wires, doubt it works
Not weird - cheap and effective way to keep rodents out of your shit.

Especially on these newer vehicles that used a soy-based wire shielding.
There‚Äôs already plenty of comments but i was already gonna say

Mice repellent

My truck was full of them and I had to gut and pressure wash the whole interior
Thought to repel rats. I‚Äôve found bars of Irish Spring half eaten by rats though. Still keeps a strong man fresh but does not repel rodents. 

Ditch the soap; get a cat.
Irish spring can repel bugs and rodents. Kind of odd that they are just randomly tossed in there but I've seen this before
They think that Irish spring will repel mice. I have a bar somewhere that was half eaten by mice.
Funny, when I was going through opiate withdrawal, someone told me to put a bar of Irish spring in the bed to sleep at night! And guess what!‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt do anything ü§£.
Back in the day I used that same brand soap to quiet a squeaky belt on a 92 F250. Just sat there under the hood til it was needed.   Ghetto, yeah.. But it worked!  Just another possibility.
Keeps away rodents and vermin.  Found a nest in engine bay of one of my cars; was recommended I got peppermint sashes - they sell them at home depot.
The soap is supposed to stop the rodents
People do that here in Arizona to prevent pack rat damage.
Honestly not terrible some people park vehicles for awhile and rodents like to nest in the. That soaps keeping them out of the vehicle, I‚Äôve also seen about 6000 mothballs inside the engine bay. Soaps safer option
Clean build
There is a customer who misunderstood you are supposed to put Paprika in a sock or bag in the engine bay to keep mice away, she covered the whole engine in it and it‚Äôs fully baked on.
Irish spring is specifically good repellant for small rodents and bugs at the same time

Use some when you‚Äôre camping and you won‚Äôt need to spray the ‚ÄúOff‚Äù so thick on your skin
So funny on YT there‚Äôs mice playing with the soap. Even the sonic, frequency plug ins don‚Äôt work.
Mice. Tell them to buy a can of Aqua Net hairspray, the cheap, ozone eating shit from the 80s, in a pink can preferably, and spray all the wire harnesses and hoses with it. Once every six months should do. Farm community technician trick. Works well, as the residue that makes your hair ‚Äústay‚Äù also stays on everything it touches, and tastes like poison. Works great as a cheap deterrent for rodents of all sizes.
Keeps the mice away.
Don‚Äôt remove the soap. Poor bastard is trying to keep mice out of his brand new car. See the chew marks on some of those bars?
It's common in rural areas to keep rodents away. I keep Irish Spring in my camper, and my storage buildings.
Smells better than coyote piss
This is for mice. I do the same thing in the fall lol
It's an old wives tale that Irish spring keeps away mice. As well as other pests. They likley have either had the wires on this car, or another chewed on in the past and are now paranoid.
Ahh someone‚Äôs trying to keep mice away
Pest Deterrent and smells good on a hot summer day
Keeps the  mice out
Probable mice munching, squirrels trapped , or a snake died inside the engine compartment. That‚Äôs the only thing I can think of as to why they have Irish Spring in there.
Rodents hate the smell of Irish spring!
Keeps the mice out.
It's irish spring - Mint soap. Mint keeps mice away.
It‚Äôs not weird‚Ä¶you just haven‚Äôt encountered it before. It is well known with car enthusiasts that Irish Spring soap and Bounce dryer sheets ward off rodents.
Moth balls work good ,ok the doors open .
The engine deserves clean air too!
A whole thousand miles and she's soaped up this hard!? Yeah, I had no idea either. this was really entertaining though thx lol
He must have a rodent problem or a squeaky belt. I‚Äôve seen people doing this for both problems
Rodents and other pests dont like the smell of mint. My mom used to put pieces of these in closets and drawers at our vacation home to keep moths and pests away
Its done for aesthetics and to make the engine smell zest fully clean
mint, irish spring soap, and mothballs commonly used where I am from to keep parked vehicles safer from rodents
Doesn't everyone want their intake air to smell Irish fresh?
I see this often at my shop and the rodents just seem to eat it rather than be repelled üòÇ
Dont want to catch you riding dlrty.
Moth balls work as well.
Normal for a Nissan
Also keeps cats and other animals away... I put in garden, keeps the feral cats from using my gardens as a toilet. Wish I lived in ohio... wouldn't have to worry anymore
The soap is placed as an alternative chew source for rodents. Basically, the soap isn't a good food source or even one that tastes good. It just tastes better than the vinyl they coat electrical wires with. I put a bar under the hoods of my tractors and lawnmowers each winter. It works to some degree, but a rodent will eventually chew them up.
Could be his fan belt soap... for squeaky belts.
There‚Äôs no reason field mice can‚Äôt also smell Irish spring fresh.
Rodents don't like that, probable was there to keep them away from making nests in the engine
pests.... they really like the soy tasting insulation or something.
That's how you keep a clean engine bay
That's so he can smell like a leprechaun and drive over the rainbow bridge
The funny part is some rodents are attracted to irish spring
For mice
Yea saop to keep away rats
To quiet a noisy belt
Clean and Fresh ride
Smart!
Keep it clean üßº
Possibly left it under hood after using it for belt squeaking ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs gotta be Irish spring lmao. I take cheese cloth and put what‚Äôs left of my Irish spring bars in it and leave it in places where rodents are. Scares them off and keeps my stuff safe
The wife probably watched that tic-tok about shaving Irish Spring around the house.
It's fresssssssssh!
I shaved some Irish Spring around my outdoor AC unit wiring.  Mice repellent
Tastes like Cilantro.
How does it not melt?
Hey you use CDK too! As others have stated, mouse deterrent.
Yeah...had a mouse chew a hole in the top when we put the top down. Went for a drive...came home, put the top up to find a hole below the rear window....ugh!!!
It‚Äôs someone still in denial they need several slightly underfed cats.
I've used moth balls before.
During winter storage, I do this with my car except I use dryer sheets. I also put on in glove box, and each quadrant of floorboard.

Stuff exhausts with plastic bags that have red duct tape tail as well.
I think he's trying to give his ripe mechanic a hint
What‚Äôs weird here?
I use toilet blocks the chemical things you hang on the edge of your toilet bowl to deter mice
Lol are you new here..?

Pest deterrent. The soap smells tastier than the rest of the engine bay...

But it tastes like chemical shit...

Lure the furry little bastards to a sacrificial chunk of soap that gives zero nutrition and wait a week for them to realise the thing they want to eat ain't worth it and they will fuck off by themselves...

Less fun than the BB gun method but just as effective.
When you live in the country and don't have access to used cat litter
And for belt squeal
Well at least it has a clean title
**Rodent Deterrent:** Sometimes, people use soap or other substances as a deterrent to keep rodents away from the engine bay. The smell or texture might be intended to make the area less attractive to animals that might chew on wires or insulation.
Someone actually believe social media actually believed a social media video and applied it
I bought a used car and went to replace the air filter and found garlic bread inside, no joke
The best rodent bait and killer I‚Äôve ever used is called One-Bite. That‚Äôs all it takes. Put a chunk wherever you see activity and bam, they‚Äôre gone. Make your animals you love can‚Äôt get it though.
Well as everyone said it can keep rodents away but it can also be used to stop a squeaky belt for awhile. Maybe either one?
Irish spring bar soap keeps the mice away
If I had to guess, and I obviously don't know you or if its the truth. I feel your coworkers are trying to tell you to shower. I have never heard of soap used to repel critters. I'm not saying it doesn't work, or won't work, just never heard of it
Coworkers giving you a hint.
It doesn‚Äôt work it‚Äôs literally got mouse chew marks on it
Finally that elusive Irish car!!!
Keeps mice away so if you park it for long periods you shouldn‚Äôt need to rewire or refurbish your interior due to mice
Dryer sheets work well too
Is this in NH, I've seen  that same bar of Irish spring in someone's spare tire area before. It's kinda rural and it keeps rodents like field mice out of the carü§î
Customer states CAR SMELLS LIKE IRELAND
I heard lots of soy and plant based products mixed in to todays wire casings, I assume it‚Äôs something the rodents like
I found a full cob of corn under a Nissan today
Used to deter mice. I put Irish spring in my cars when I store them for winter. No mice yet
I transported the Ecto-1 for a job I had.  There were 6 bars of Irish Spring under the hood. 

Rats loved it. It was honestly the worst POS vehicle I've ever had the pleasure of starting and driving 20 feet.

The magic was ruined for me.
Keeps those mice away. Had an older clean car with wiring issues, turned out mice got into the car and started eating the harness, certain shielding tastes good to themüôÑ
They also rub soap on the serpentine belt to reduce noise
As others have said, it‚Äôs to deter rodents. I have been meaning to put some in my truck. I tried EVERYTHING in my house to repel them. Anything store bought and they kept showing back up and avoiding my traps. I put Irish spring soap in a few places and never saw another mouse or mouse dropping. It‚Äôs been about 18 months.
Please say you wrote ‚Äú Irish you a happy day ‚Äú on the invoice
Never seen it used as pest repellent but I've seen rats stash soap like this in Australia in boats and cars.. they must have a taste for it
My dad has issues with mice chewing up the wiring on his van. They told him to put soap or cotton balls under the hood. True story from the dealer.
Clean horsepower
Doesn‚Äôt work. Literal photo of it being eaten by a rodent.

The soap keeps mice out. This is a common practice with travel trailers and RVs while they are in storage.
Soap is a good deodorizer.  It's actually very strong
Must be nice to live somewhere without rodents.
Pack rats
Leprechaun bait
Does this work to keep mice away? 
I'll be trying this in a few of my cars!
It‚Äôs for the belt. To quiet it down
Noisy belt
That's Nissan's new self cleaning motor.
üíØ mouse repellent I bet the car gets stored part of the year
Trying to get rid of mice. But it looks like the mice or rats are eating it anyway.
For chipmunks too. My grandfathers car got them twice before he installed some soap in his F-150. It‚Äôd be easier if my grandmother didn‚Äôt feed them üôÉ
My dad used bar soap on the belt of a noisy alternator.ü´§
Because it was so loud and noisy
Bro forgot the soap delete
The mice around here would probably eat the soap.
Keep the varmits out
I tried this trick after replacing three sets of plug wires on my old Subaru. Didn't work. The fuckers ate all the soap bars *and* my plug wires.
not that weird lol, pretty common for people who have had rats chewing wires
Fresh cab works
Anti-Marten device ...
You just gave me an idea! But not for cars, for printer copiers actually.

I service them and have a few sites where I regularly find these mfs inside the machines, munching on belts and parts in the worst places ever. I hate them.
Ahhh makes sense. Yeah I‚Äôve seen rats and other rodents fuck up an engine bay
Yup, living in the midwest sucks for vehicles. Irish spring also does not work. Ive seen rodents eat it. We also had this special rodent repelling tape for harnesses. The vehicle that had it installed came back with the parts wrapped in the tape chewed through. Like it attracted, not repelled.
I read that peeing on your outside plants is a great deterrent to deer and they won‚Äôt eat them.    I peed on my engine bay and have yet to find a single deer under the hood, so it must work!
I use dryer sheets...work wonders...
Looks like they have some nibbles along the edges
These bars look chewed on already
[deleted]
exactly what I came to say
First thing I thought too. I usually have the Irish spring inside the cabin. And the shavings in the glove box. I also spray Lysol in the vents too. That‚Äôs seems to be very effective.
[https://nhoilundercoating.com/product/mouse-out/](https://nhoilundercoating.com/product/mouse-out/) 

Stop rust AND mice.
The more you know! I‚Äôve never heard of people doing this before but where I go on back roads and in fields i should give this a try myself
Fuck city rats too.
Supposed to help keep deer out of your garden too, I had luck with it...but that could have been a false positive.
Mice, is for mice
I keep a small pouch of moth balls under my bicycle seat to repel mice.
Soap can also be applied to a squeaky belt to quiet it down a lil
I just wish it worked ‚òπÔ∏è had mice in the garage, put Irish Spring bars all over and...still had mice.
Yep, pest love the smell of sweets or even food left in cars. I've heard dryer sheets, soap, anything that will throw off the sensory that there is a place to stay or eat. 

Damn squirrels ate my ignition wire one year. Luckily it was a arm length away to solder back together in the engine bay.
It‚Äôs this.  When I got my motorhome it was full of soap too because it lived on average.
Not sure how soap will help, they just eat it.
This is 100% the answer. When I worked camp shop for an oilfield company, we all left bars of Irish spring soap in the vehicles.  Mice, squirrels and chipmunks hate it.
Yup supposedly mice hate Irish Spring. Have heard that from many different people. Never actually saw it in action though.
Yup, Irish spring works best...or cotton balls soaked in peppermint extract.  It's the best.
Yeah everyone knows: bitches hate Irish Spring.

![gif](giphy|sMeTtjI9MFMwuC7Cfy|downsized)
Definitely!

We used borax as  rodent repellent. It worked üíØ of the time.  I assume Irish spring will also be effective.
Is it actually a good rodent deterrent? I‚Äôve never heard of that before
I‚Äôm tired of those damn women messing around in my engine bay.
I used to hate staying at my friends having to shower and the only soap is irish spring. When i get out the shower and rub my skin its like max friction.
It‚Äôs me I‚Äôm the leprechaun and he is infant correct
Definitely doesnt work for rats. At least the ones near my old place. They just ate it!
How often do you change them out? I'm going to try this. Thanks!
Can confirm mice love subis. Especially the gas tanks.
Newer vehicles use a soy based wire coating that rodents like to eat.
Where did you see spiders!
I've seen where the mice have chewed the Irish spring bars. üòÇ
Try dryer sheets. I've had better luck with them.
I have it from a position with great authority that Ohio has rodents and cats. Sorry.
Winner winner chicken dinner. This is the correct answer
If you leave the hood up it will take the "shelter" feeling away and they won't  bed or try to make bedding from your engine bay. I'm lucky to be parked in a garage though.
It works. I worked for the lottery and had the same problem and solution. Steel wool and original Irish spring bar soap
they have mint packages that also work, and are designed for this job.

I used to put them inside the hot tub base every winter.
I work in a rural area and everyone uses dryer sheets tied with a bit of vinyl tape.  Haven‚Äôt had rodent poop on my block since getting on the snuggle train.
Pc load letter?!
Does mint oil and other strong smells not keep them out?
But then you‚Äôd be cutting down on your business lol
Outside generator!  Every month I check it, and in the winter months, I always smell mouse piss and see turds around it.
I use Irish Spring bars at my work. Bonus, it adds a pleasant aroma on top of keeping rodents away
Peppermint oil? Perhaps diluted in a spray bottle for cleaning the printer's chassis?

We use Irish spring (that brand is the only one that works) in rvs to keep mice out.
Slice the bars into slivers.  Goes a lot farther. Works great. Moth balls and dryer sheets seem to work also
I've heard dryer sheets get the same result as soap without the possibility of a mess.
I live in an area with lots of rodents outside, and coincidentally, am currently chasing a power draw in my car. Battery had the starting of a rats nest above it when I first checked. 

There‚Äôs nothing I hate more than working on cars with rodent damage. I hate finding the wires, dealing with the rust and filth, finding their bodies, dead or alive.. I just hate em
If you zoom in, you can see where rodents have nibbled the soap.
Had a 99 dodge ram that mostly sat, except to haul trash to the recycle center/dump.  I believe that mice had gotten in and chewed up some lines. Short version, fuel leak caused it to catch on fire, while I was driving it, and burn completely to the ground.
Yeah but it doesn't work. They'll just stay away from that specific spot. Seen dryer sheets used as well. Then found a mouse nest made with them
Damn, I've had Honda Rodent Tape in my amazon cart for a few weeks now, was wondering about pulling the trigger.
It‚Äôs supposed to be infused with capsaicin that is incredibly potent spice to make their teeth and mouth burn. 

Apparently your roll on that vehicle missed the QC during production. I‚Äôve used it in the past and it works great!
What region doesn't suck?
Was this done while parked or on the highway?
Because Deer are in the headlights...duhhhh
Used Original Bounty for years in my 65 mustang. Never had a mouse problem in it.
Didn‚Äôt say it worked, just why it was there
I'd guess it would work in an engine bay. I know it'll keep tree rats (squirrels) out of flower beds and gardens.
No, it‚Äôs terrible. I see them being eaten all the time.
I've heard it's ONLY Irish Spring that deters rodents and mosquitos.
I use Irish spring and moth balls. I can't guarantee that it works but it wasn't my idea and I've never had an issue with rodents/bugs/etc
Based on how they are eating it, I'd say NO.
Gonna say it‚Äôs not by the little chew marks on them
I've tried it in my garden a few times. It kept the birds away. However, the squirrel and the bunnies couldn't have given less of a shit about it.

Plus, I chose a terrible spot and got soap in my garden bed...
I'm guessing not since there are teeth marks in the pictures where they were being eaten.
Apparently mice hate the smell of it
It smells like people and animals tend to stay away from smells like people is generally the idea.
Rodents hate the smell of mint, so if you grow mint as the natural smell they produce is much stronger than soap you can cut it every so often and put them around where you keep your vehicle and over time they become very brittle but easy to sweep away and replace with new mint. If you have a mice problem that Is.
Not at all.  Complete myth.  the ONLY thing that works is 1) introduce snakes or 2) leave your hood open.  Mice hate stuff that's open to the elements.
People use it storing their RV‚Äôs but I recently saw a video that said the rodents actually like it and will eat it. The soap in the pictures looks chewed so I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs not a good deterrent.
Common in overwintering boats.
We do that in our farm vehicles that we use once a year.. but now the mice eat the soap. Haha
Mint is supposed to be a good repellent. Mothballs, too. Never seen soap before, but it isn't a bad idea at all.
They love to chew on wires.
There you are, you little fucker. I‚Äôve been trying to find you since I was like 8 years old. Hand the gold over real smooth and we won‚Äôt have any problems.
Roughly 3 times a year. Once in the fall (mid October or so) once in early spring and once in the summer. I use two per corner (it‚Äôs a small shed) and that‚Äôs enough to notice the smell when I open the door. 

I hope it works  for you!!
They‚Äôre getting in your gas tank??
lol I meant like around the house
Yes has happened to us many times. Dryer sheets work to some degree if you replace them often.
They work ok but need to replace them often which wasn't possible since the car was over a hour away from me.

We tried various natural oils on sheets too and they helped a bit.
Yeah this was when I lived in an apartment and had to park in a big lot
What‚Äôs steel wool for?
We tried Irish spring in our equipment at work, the mice clawed half the bar away and built their nest on top of it. It doesn't work at allüòÇ
Connection between working with the lottery and rodents eating things?
I put irish spring in my garage after seeing signs of mice. The mice ate the soap, not all of it but the tooth marks were unmistakable. so I don‚Äôt think it works. That said i have no experience with steel wool. Sounds like mice wouldn‚Äôt chew through it but not a general repellent either.
That will work well enough to keep them out of the entire engine bay, and not just away from the soap?
I‚Äôve never heard of Irish spring I‚Äôve used bounce sheets and mothballs I‚Äôll have to add this to my arsenal
Those things are strong as hell. If you drive the car at all it can be rough.  I had a little mouse incident and got paranoid and put 3 of those things under the hood.  My eyes were watering
Dang, you got my hopes up‚Ä¶

Not really. We lease them, and get payed for the number of pages printed. Less interventions means cutting down costs of maintenance.
ü§î is it repelling them, or attracting them, if there eating it
So i guess they're not that put off by it
One year I filled my dirt bike air box with moth balls to keep mice out. They made a nest in it.
We have tried a few different types.  But that is the shitty part. We only see the times it fails, you will never know when it works. For me, i just see it as expensive snake oil at this point. Cannot wrap a while harness with it, so its only for patchwork. Survivorship bias, basically.
That's the same selling point that they use on bird cakes - the capsaicin keeps squirrels from eating it. Paradoxically the birds don't seem to care for it either, clearly they have better things to chow on around here, like cakes without pepper oil.
For cars? The southwest.
I think you have to do it at work. A weird trick that every field mouse hates.
We always used it to keep deer out of our gardens. I guess this would keep the deer out of the engine too.
I've seen comments that say it worked, and comments that said the rats stayed and ate the soap they left out
Tree rat is spot on. Squirrels are nothin‚Äô but rats with better PR
what scent of soap ?
And leave little shits everywhere
Thank you for replying so quickly. That is a lot less frequent than I thought. I've tried a lot of the store bought mouse repellents with little success. I'm hopeful this will help!
Not mine, specifically. I work at a shop and we've replaced a few somewhat recently that mice have chewed through.
Whooops. Its been one of those *weeks*
Steel sweaters
Steel wool is hard to chew through and isn‚Äôt easily digested. Use a coarse grade of steel wool. It will last longer than a finer grade.

Peppermint oil is a good repellent for rodents. A tiny drop on a cotton ball will keep them away for a month or more.
To fill gaps , they won‚Äôt eat it
Cheaper than buying it
Steel wool gets wrapped around their teeth and can cut their gums so it‚Äôs just an easy way to stop them gnawing on bits - something in the rubber can attract them, typically I find Japanese cars more common than others.
Been doing pest control for 7 years now and only ever been called out to jobs like this for field mice, usually starts with the warmth, they then become intrigued in the rubber üê≠
Its to fill the holes that the mice come through. They wont chew through the steel wool
Plug up holes that mice use to get into and out of things. They can't chew through steel wool.
They can't chew through it
To plug up holes they could enter places through. They won't/can't chew through it, it even works for smaller pests like insects if a fine enough wool and packed tightly enough
They can't chew through the wool apparently. If you pack it in places where they enter they will stop.
When I tried it, they ate it.
But I am sure they smell great now!
I was wondering the same lol. Only thing I can think of is the rodents eating the paper used to make the tickets?
Mice eat soap as they like paraffin. They‚Äôre also attracted to scented candles ü§£ wire wool does work but it has to pack out the entrance tightly and be secured with silicone or another adhesive - but not expandafoam as this holds moisture and deteriorates over time.
yes they are!  made the hot tub smell great.  I started planting mint around too, that worked pretty well.  Guessing in a car it was insanely potent.
What works for one, won‚Äôt work for many. And vice versa. 
With these kinds of passive deterrents it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the rodent outsmarts it. To rid the issue you need to identify the root cause of the rodent problem.
But now they are mad theyve been tricked, gotta go somewhere else to get the taste of soap out of their mouth!
All I heard you say was "I filled my dirt box with mice."
If you're going fast enough you can get the deer in the engine with or without soap.
wait... does this work? our neighborhood herd are like really inconvenient laser-guided weedwhackers and are getting close to figuring out how to tip the roofed chain link box over our herb garden over
Maybe there are some screwball ones out there. They mostly leave the habanero bird seed alone, but there's at least one who's happy to sit there and eat it.
Irish Spring. No substitutes, at least according to grandma.
Regular Irish Spring like the pics; shredded with a grater.
They pee on everything too.
Basically as long as you can pick up the scent seems to work. Doesn‚Äôt need to be overpowering just noticeable as far as I‚Äôve seen. I think it‚Äôs the scent itself. It‚Äôs strong enough or perhaps strange enough that the mice don‚Äôt like it. 

But ultimately they are so cheap you could swap them every month and not break the bank. 

Cheers.
Now I've pictured mice in chainmail... TIHI

10/10.
Ah, yes. But, did you hear about the wooden horse?

[removed]
I thought the same thing about steel wool but mice can chew through the steel. They won't with the wool though because it irritates their gums. I learned you can also use the expanding foam with steel wool mixed in to close gaps that move are entering through.
Steel wool rusts and that can lead to stains. Copper is better.
Peppermint oil works for a little while as it is strong and disorientates the mice from their typical pheromones, but it does not get rid of them. It will just move them to another location until they get used to the scent. 
No scents are deterrents for rodents. They‚Äôre like children, they need to know what everything is. 
Best way is to rid the issue, identify the root cause of the pest infestation and fix that to completely rid the issue. Rather than just pacify it for the meantime as they breed like wildfire üò¨
You know what else works great (and is fun for my mechanic to find)?  Tampons!  They're like more absorbant cotton balls with these handy strings to attach them with!
I actually have a photo somewhere of an eaten bar of Irish spring. They love anything they can get. Nothing but poison and traps repel them.
Any tips for keeping mice out of engine bays? All my cars, tractors etc end up with chipmunks or mice nests in them
Keep an eye out for cats, they love mint leaves
üèÖ
It worked in the beginning, but I think like all things, the deer adapt. We have a rotation of soap, then liquid fence, and my dog pees around there.
Something has been eating that shit.  It's clearly not working.

Hardcore mice.
also, it's not flammable.
You‚Äôll be back‚Ä¶.
Yes. Or morar. Mix it right in. Expanding foam has a drawback sometimes.  If any of the materials involved are flexible, such as vinyl siding, the foam will expand and push the flexible material.  Then when the  foam degrades and falls out (depending on the location and exposure to UV light but 18 months is a good rule of thumb outdoors)  you end up with a larger gap.
Not true. If mice can gnaw through steel, why can‚Äôt they gnaw expandable foam?ü§î 
They don‚Äôt eat what they gnaw. They just use their teeth to gain passage and dig out the debris to create tunnels. Like mud, you‚Äôll always have a nice pile of mud around any rodent burrow. 
Do not use expandable foam. Pack any hole with wire wool of any kind and adhesive silicone to hold it in place. 
If this isn‚Äôt an option, flat steel. It has to be flat as their teeth will be unable to get purchase on the steel so they can‚Äôt gnaw. Would just slide straight off when they try.
I was talking about the steel wool lol. But I do not doubt that they eat Irish spring. They are true survivors they will eat anything
My honest advice would be to build suitable habitats for them and encourage them into it with grains and protein rich foods. 
Can get squirrel mouses and mouse houses, would relocate to a more suitable area as they‚Äôre only looking for harbourage and warmth 
If they aren‚Äôt interested within a week to 10 days then move the nests closer, get the scent of the mice onto it and relocate a short distance away, eventually taking it further and further to naturally relocate them as they‚Äôre sensory dominant animals üôèüèº
no problem, they also love mice!
I was saying that we use a grater to shred it around plants, not just put a bar of soap down.
And now they have a tummy ache. That'll teach em.
Supposed to be a secret‚Ä¶
Almost perfect but he's missing his little sword
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.
lol and expandafoam?üòÇ worried about the wire but flame retardant foam is ¬£¬£¬£ 
Best off using silicone adhesive as it‚Äôs cleaner, fire resistant and doesn‚Äôt hold moisture too. 
Been doing pest control for 7 years now and always see expandafoam being using for pest proofing üôà it‚Äôs not pest proof, and can actually be the cause for other insect issues alongside damp depending where it‚Äôs been placed üëäüèª
Squirrel houses and mouse houses*
LOL.   I'm sure they appreciate it as much as I do getting shredded cheddar instead of just a block sometime.   They're probably sprinkling it on their garbage.....er dinner.
Well how about this "when you mix fuel, metal oxide and metal powder in just the right way, it burns at 2000 degrees Celsius. Hot enough to cut through nearly any barrier known to man. Throw some C4 into the mix, and you've got one hell of a combination." -Thermite

Interesting idea. I'm a little perplexed because it seems like there's plenty of places for them to live (rock wall, under my shed, in the wood pile, brush piles, and so on).
What a country!
It‚Äôs a joke at this point
Yeah if you use it regularly the residual heat from the metals would be very big attractants to them, they enjoy wool and insulation as nesting materials, could make a wooden box at the wood pile and pack it with wool and seeds, peanuts and peanut butter and they‚Äôd be on that like a homeless person on some fries üçü

I have at least two neighbors in the Islands who fly theirs proudly, along with a Marine flag, if you can believe that. As an actual Southerner transplant up here, it‚Äôs disgusting for me too. Who in their right mind is proud of a war they lost? It will never make sense to me.

White supremacy attitude on bold display is very sad, and ugly.¬†
Its embarassing for all of us because we allow it. Yall should look into the Paradox of Tolerance for regerence, popularized by Karl Popper during WWII. The only thing that *actually* stops hate is an absolute intolerance of its intolerance. Love only enables, and does jack shit to stop any sort of hate.
I‚Äôve never understood why anyone would want to fly those flags. Announce to the world that you‚Äôre a pos?
Oh I saw that exact truck on my way to the grocery store. I yelled at them to take their loser flag down and they definitely didn‚Äôt hear me but it made me feel a little better.
They drive past cemeteries full of dead union soldiers, too. How disgraceful.
Unfortunately, these people are going to feel even more empowered now.
Better get used to it. Only going to get worse from here.

Aww their participation ribbon. Such sad little snowflakes.
We are plagued with a large population of people who never fully matured and are acting out. The least common denominator is reactionary behavior and beliefs driven by the sense they are routinely reminded of being on the wrong side when it comes to values like decency and respect for all people. The pattern is clear, from obnoxious tailgating to sociopathic statements and tendencies. The need for attention is pretty pathetic.

I remember driving through Bennington in 2016 and being shocked to see a confederate flag. Being originally from a confederate state, I'd hoped to have left that behind.
They're emboldened by the election. They've been loud, incredibly rude, and honestly even angrier than before the election. I think a lot of them are disappointed they didn't get their chance to hunt liberals, totally normal healthy people.
Well because the Civil War did not end in an official peace treaty, it's still going on, and therefore it might be arguably legal to kill Confederates as enemy combatants. (This is flippant bad advice no one should actually take but it's funny to this embittered old Unionist currently living in the Deep South.)
They get embarrassed that easily ü§™
NY license plate?
You think embarrassment is something they can still feel?
Nice photo.  Like a Norman Rockwell, Collins.   Makes me think of Levon Helm singing with The Band in centeal Mass, 1976.

I was just 12. 

"The Night they Drove Old Dixie Down," ELECTRIC reeking of Vermont grown, and at the same time, so sad and melancholy yet necessary, the slaughter required to kil America's and capitalism's unteathered Frankenstein monster: slavery, starting with John Brown, a misguided zealot is how Abe called him, a NY boy from the Finger Lakes as I recall. 

That flag means a lot of things to just a few people.  To most people it's just idiocracy, and Nixon's southern strategy. Gen Lee buried it for good but the Free speech means the canary still sings lies.
What does it mean to them?
I am seeing too much of this crap around. Hate it.
It's nice that they let us know who they are right up front.
Just tell folks with Confederate Flags to,  ‚ÄúGo back to their own country.‚Äù They don‚Äôt seem to like it for some reason though. I just don‚Äôt know why. Go figure.
I just tell them that flag was in one war and lost it lol
I think it‚Äôs trashy too, but like really, are you suggesting they stop? People like you and I may think it‚Äôs vile, but it‚Äôs freedom of speech and expression, and you can‚Äôt suggest taking that from people. It‚Äôs all about understanding that everyone has their own perspective, no matter how terrible or stupid it may seem to us.
I never understand living in a northern state flying a confederate flag. If it‚Äôs about history, you live in a state that fought the confederates?
Lack of geographical awareness lol
Some of my ancestors from VT died during the civil war.  Killed by Confederates.  Any Vermonter who flies the Confederate flag can fuck right off..
Ew
Show them the way south
Traitor
Am I the only one seeing the NY plate? So a guy (presumably) with Confederate flags on his truck drove through North Bennington. Things like this happen in the world.
Give them a break. Their swastika flag is in the wash.
It's Bennington...
I don‚Äôt get the idea of ‚Äúconfederacy‚Äù, these are the same people that lost the war and continues to fly their flags. Can you imagine the Nazi‚Äôs doing this in America. Those people that fought for freedom would turn over their graves.. oh, wait.
https://benningtonmuseum.org/library/walloomsack/volume-11/bennington-in-the-civil-war.pdf
I can‚Äôt make out the plate.   Isn‚Äôt vt green plates?
NY Lic Plates‚Ä¶ not that we don‚Äôt have our fair share of this type. This one just isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm in Keene but get the sub recommended to me. A man was walking around downtown with a confederate civil war era hat on today.
I thought they kept this kinda stuff on the other side of the river
In our states defense even if not entirely warranted that truck and idiot are from NY. 

Edit maybe not NY. Doesn‚Äôt look like VT plate though. Assumed Bennington being on the border.
I am visiting Bennington this weekend. I swear I have seen the same guy in the confederate flag hat the past two times I have visited. He's mean.
Bennington resident here. Not surprised to see this, one of my neighbors hangs one on their fence. Although as others pointed out this ignorant dickhead is from across the border
As a Vermonter I‚Äôm embarrassed. As someone married to a man born and raised in the Deep South who would never, I have to forward it for a laugh.
trust me, that isn‚Äôt the most embarrassing one i‚Äôve seen.
Not from Vermont (check the license plate).
Not surprised .  The trailer parks have spoken on November 6th and will continue to be obnoxious
Sad. Poor and stupid is no way to go through life. That‚Äôs a crime in many countries and should be here.
People are nuts with downvotes these days lol
Looks like Sherman tore up the tracks on him
Not VT plates
Typical Bennington imo
Must‚Äôve moved the mason dixon line recently
Is this all you guys do on every New England state subreddit? You‚Äôve got nothing better to do?
Flying the flag of the country they want in the country that beat it

They ought to get a real flag
I wonder if they have ever even visited Dixie land?
I see them all over when I visit home in upstate NY.  Just a quick word, they HATE" yankees down here.  Your rebel flag won't make them like you any more.  How do I know?  I've lived in Texas 50 years and I'm still.....and gotdamned yankee.
What state does the plate say?
Bennington, the county that re-elected Mary Morrissey, republican house rep who repeatedly poured water into her legislative colleague's bag during session. Politics aside, the ethical and mental health boundaries crossed over and over again, have been rewarded. Says a lot about Bennington.
Being a rebel with a 10 mpg shit box. Lol
May Generals Grant and Stannard haunt his sorry ass.
There's a giant one on the interstate on the GA/SC border. Rebel flags are just participation trophies for racists who lost. Change my mind... Hate not heritage amirite.
it's embarrassing for us all.
Should be illegal, museums only
The Confederacy lasted THREE YEARS. The only reason to fly that flag is to say HEY, IM A RACIST TRAITOR TO THE CONSTITUTION
You never know when you‚Äôll need toilet paper or surrender.
lol take a drive on 30 through Jamaica
Do they know VT boarders Canada?
Yes all conservatives are low IQ
There's nothing illegal about burning a Confederate flag...
Burn itt
If you go looking for bad things... you are gonna find bad things. They have always existed. Why not relax. Enjoy life a little. For fucks sake.
Free speech.  Just as it is within your right to fly a Nazi flag or burn the US Flag.  The US Supreme Court ruled it ok.  So what‚Äôs the big deal?
Find out who they are - take their pictures- send to employers- publicly treat them as lepers.
those are new york plates on the truck
The Bottle Rockets- Wave that Flag

Where is the plate from?
If only they could hear what most rural southerners think of yankees that fly that flag
They are just duke's of hazard fans.
Someone should tell them that the south lost the war‚Ä¶
trashy
This thread is priceless. I love you all üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ
I brought my confederate flag up here with me in Maine. In my heart. üòò
typical
Nice
Be careful about approaching people like this. Their DNA matches everyone in their family and there are no dental records so they can actually get away with murder...
With a NY plate, probably from HookerFalls
Go kill them... nobody will mind
I saw a redneck looking guy with a Confederate flag hat yesterday in Colchester. I wanted to embarrass him in front of the crowd, but I bit my tongue instead.
I like it
We visited from NYS this weekend and I was shocked at how much racist stuff we saw. Was hoping for a respite from the upstate bigots but I guess it‚Äôs just the whole country.
Gross
I‚Äôve never seen that exact truck but I‚Äôve seen a similar looking Bubba Truck with the huge Confederate flag mounted the same way driving in Western Maine. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§Æ
Maybe his family fought for the south lol
[removed]
Honestly, would the country be any different than it is today if the North had lost the Civil War?  I don‚Äôt think so. Lincoln made the biggest mistake of all time not cutting the Slave States loose.  He made the correct decision in that moment, but look at us now
Im sure they support the traitor. So not really embarrassing for them. Just truthful.
Dipshit

Harris is the best the democrat party could put up against Trump? How embarrassing for them.
Proud racist right there
Why are the people on the left nowadays so anti-freedom of speech/expression? If you want to show off a confederate flag, cool, if you want to show off a lgbtq flag that‚Äôs cool too, you can even have a flag of Pat Mahomes with a schlong in his mouth. You can disagree with the messaging but at the end of the day we live in a democratic republic not a socialist or facist controlled state. You can express however you want Cmon now ü•Ö
Always on a truck in need of some rust removal and a paint job. America first with their made in China flags!
Confederate flag. Trump flag.  Whats the difference?
I heard ol‚Äô Neil put her down‚Ä¶
Well Vermont is full blue state. They All believe the confederate standards
Nice
I think it might be an older New York license plate.
Or not because who gives a shit
And parked like a idiot that‚Äôs on brand
And parked like a idiot that‚Äôs on brand

Love the Stars and Bars!
Doesn't he know VT fought for the yanks not johnny Reb?
I don‚Äôt see how burning a US flag and flying a Confederate flag are really any different.
Why is this embarrassing? I don‚Äôt care what they do as long as they aren‚Äôt harming anyone
So many men from Vermont lost their lives in the Civil War. Yet it is mostly men whose families sent their men to fight the rebellion who do this.
Gotta love freedom
Typical Trumper
Pockets of Vermont really show their lack of education and common sense!
that's Bennington for you üôÑ
Modern Confederates are the world's sorest losers.
Not a confederate flag.
They‚Äôre dumb af but they just won. I‚Äôd say how embarrassing for us that we let a bunch of idiot rednecks ruin our country again. Like yeah, they suck and ate stupid and evil, but at least they can find a candidate who fucking tries or appeals to the masses at all? At least their voters go out. The fact that Trump destroyed on the popular vote this time means we lost across the board. It‚Äôs a shameful time to be a liberal and not because of any of our values. We are pathetic, non confrontational, divisive, idiots ourselves. At least those racists band together. All we do is infight and lose. 

We let the brainwashed people take the country. We let it fucking happen. And a bunch of it is because of liberals who secretly hate trans and gay and black people and voted for Trump but claim to be blue.
Depends on why they fly it. Depends on if you understand why the civil war was fought. If your answer is, "Because of slavery"... You should study your history and think for yourself. Civil war wasn't fought over slavery, and Lincoln didn't free a single slave. If you understood the English language when you read the Emancipation Proclamation you'd know this.
Confederate Flag equals rebellion. Used now to show you to be an outsider and non conformist. Same as bikers with SS tattoos.
No. That's historic pride.
Ah, glad to see you have at least one educated person in Vermont.
Feel free to tear down any confederate flags flying in New England. They are an insult to the brave men who fought and died  to preserve the union and to whom many a monument stands in nearly every town.
confederate in the northern states? not even bros ancestors agree with that shit
It‚Äôs history?
Why do people care so much about how others live their lives? Is he physically harming you or your family? Did you die from seeing a piece of fabric? Who really gives a shit. The world would be so much better if people just minded their own business and chilled the fuck out
Not as embarrassing as a Harris flag!
I love the south and that big beautiful flag ‚ô•Ô∏è
That‚Äôs not a VT plate. It looks Texan but don‚Äôt quote me on that, it‚Äôs a 7 character black and white plate and the image is blurry. I have many doubts that that is a Vermonter.
Get used to it. It will only get worse.
Trump scum
Bennington is trash.
Get a fucking life holy shit lmao.
I mean, it is a Democrat flag, seems right at home to me.
His intent worked. He got a rise out of you. 

Instead of insulting someone that thinks differently than you, try asking ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù.

* Why does he display that flag?
* What does that flag mean to him?

Conservative culture today is a backlash to generations of insults and being told their opinions are backward and therefore don‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs why conservatives view liberals as elitist. 

He‚Äôs not embarrassed to fly that flag, he‚Äôs proud. To him, it probably represents the culture he‚Äôs been raised in. Insulting his IQ only perpetuates that backlash mindset and breeds more division in this country.

If we want to move towards unity, we need to do better than this.
It's more about what the flag has come to represent, rather than what it once represented
I don't know...seems low IQ and petty to take a picture and post it on social media.
Not a big deal. You‚Äôll live bro
Definitely a flatlander
I honestly have to guess that it's more embarrassing to you than it is to them. 

I don't understand the whole aspect of trying to publicly shame someone that we disagree with though.

If I don't really know a person, I can't conclude if they are a good person or a bad person. Just because they may look at things differently than me doesn't make them a bad person. Just my humble opinion.
It‚Äôs not embarrassing for them and if you don‚Äôt understand that then that‚Äôs on you.
It's not people have different reasons for flying the flag
Yeah democrats need to accept the loss. I don‚Äôt know why democrats still fly their confederate flags, especially right after they just lost an election
You didn't get the memo. White trash is everywhere
On Veterans Day no less
Who cares. Mind your business ü§°
They are still representing the democrat party! Good for them
Would you say the same thing if you saw a pride flag?  

Remember people.. these are just someone else's opinions in a nation of Free speech and inclusion.  If you stand for one you stand for all.. not just the speech you agree with..

I'd say the same thing if I saw a car rolling around with a pride flag, however, being that in the current climate it's not acceptable for me to have that opinion, you will all get angry and call me names.. how is that any different from what was always done towards LGBTQ?  

So if you are unwilling to be accepting towards everyone and allow them their Freedoms without hating them.. then please... Be silent and hate internally, we don't want to hear it..
That flag is less racist than the Democratic Party.
The South will rise again ü§£
Embarrassing that your posting someone's license plate. Move on with your day.
The thing is not everybody has sat through college courses and have been indoctrinated to understanding why or how this is racist. I agree that it is racist, but shaming these people and mocking them is only making the problem worse.
Freedom of speech..I love it
You should go confront him face-to-face. 

Aww.
[deleted]
Yeah they should bury this old symbol of the democratic party.
Apparently you missed it. It's cool to be racist again... Bring back the 19th century, yah üòú
[deleted]
I find it pathetic people form their opinions based on what msnbc and cnn tell them to think instead of actually educating themselves.
They don't seem embarrassed. I'd be embarrassed to be so uptight over a flag ... bet you love the rainbow one though ... right?

Manipulated sheep!
Oooo.  Scary free speech!
nowadays the flag has no hate behind it which is the reason they fly it even though the confederacy lost the war. the flag has a bad history but it's more of a southern pride flag now

edit: people are basically trying to change the meaning of the flag to mean your heritage and stuff, not hate, most of the guys flying the flags probably aren't racist and just are from the south and appreciate the south, a good example of this is dimebag darrell
No different than BLM or The alphabet mafia flag (trans)
Buzzballs are the new trash trend on my hill.
Hey, I make good money off these idiot‚Äôs cans. I probably get like $10 a week redeeming twisted tea cans alone.
You‚Äôre so spot on with this
The way I just legit laughed out loud omgg
I‚Äôve got someone who apparently lives in my neighborhood and tosses empty Bud Light cans right in front of my house before they go home. I‚Äôm planning to put up a sign at their usual tossing spot shaming them, and hopefully whoever they live with that they‚Äôre hiding it from figures it out.

Yea well, on another note‚Ä¶ I feel like this was planned somehow but my brain is melting trying to sort out how‚Ä¶
Making fun of them is pointless. They don‚Äôt read Reddit and don‚Äôt care. If you want to make a difference, make there be consequences for THEM.
And at least they are happy to identify  their dumb asses.
The only comment that matters ^^^^^

Should've asked what exactly she was rebelling against.
Should have responded "Without a clue?"
Oohh like Johnny Rebel?
Was she working at a gas station? I think I might know the girl you are talking about.
I used to work with a dishwasher from VT that had "the south will rise again" overlaid on a confederate flag tattooed down his arm.
The confederate flag stuff is pretty common in Vermont
I don‚Äôt know why this caused me to remember, but our local Pop Warner football team was called the Rebels and had a Confederate flag as a team emblem. This was in New Jersey in the 70s. At that time, as a kid, it didn‚Äôt mean anything to me (especially because I wasn‚Äôt a sports kid). 

I would even go as far to say that it didn‚Äôt signify what it does today to the majority of people continuing to wield it as a symbol; it just meant ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù in our overwhelmingly white area. I had completely forgotten about this until now.
Because nothing says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a rebel‚Äù like owning other people as property.
I always say their family tree is more of a wreath than a tree.
From a prev UVM Endo nurse, there‚Äôs something in the Adirondack (polluted) water or inbreeding or both- more cases of puberty issues from that region than any over here in VT‚Ä¶ sad really
Bro some of yall are literally so low iq considering how highly educated you proclaim to be. The population on Earth legitimately at one point was down to around 20,000 total after the dormant super volcanoes had erupted millennia ago. To call one group of people today the clan of incest when we all come from those 20,000 people and are likely all the product of multiple incest birth chains is in my humble opinion‚Ä¶ a little redundant to say the least üåã
Family tree of traitors. Unless of course since this is a Vermont subreddit his ancestors fought for the Union. They would be disgraced
Yes. The Whitehall area is full of these failures.
Unfortunately lots of people in NY who are from the sticks are wannabe confederate rebels.

They usually live in a half-collapsed house. Likely held up by some beams to keep their porch from collapsing in. Tyvek wrapping at least one of the sides of their home. At least 3 different half-broke-down pickup trucks leaking oil into their front yard. Multiple "posted" signs, probably a "warning: attack dog sign" and at least one sign alluding to the fact they will be happy to shoot you and hide your body if you so much as sneeze over the property line. Nobody in the household over 20 has all their teeth.

Source - grew up there unfortunately lol
A Confederate flag?  
At this time of year?  
At this time of day?    
Located entirely within a state that was never a part of the confederacy?  
Yes.  
May I see it?  
YES. NOT ONLY AM I VERY STUPID, BUT ALSO INCREDIBLY LOUD ABOUT MY DUMB ASS OPINIONS.
Alongside a Marine flag? I can definitely believe that!
I bet he was a navy seal in the Marine Core, enlisted into West Point at 16, graduated top of his class and got commissioned as a master chief in the air force.
Once traitors, and will always will a traitor to the country
VERMONTSTER AAAAAA
True but if you go up to the NEK plenty of people are flying that flag outside their houses and whatnot
Some parts of CNY host reich parties
I expect to see a "Keep Vermont White" bumper sticker someday soon.
I've been considering moving to Vermont recently.   Seeing someone reference Poppers work like this and then seeing it up voted is helping seal the deal for me
So pop off already cupcake.
I‚Äôll take things that didn‚Äôt happen for 1000 Alex
That definitely didn't happen.
Disgusting
Those cemeteries are so pretty. One of my favorite aspects of rustic New England.
Drove from Albany to Mt Washington and back this weekend. You'd never know they are all blue states by driving through the back roads.
I can‚Äôt shake the same feeling. We saw all this shit get bolder the last time *he* was in office and I can‚Äôt imagine restraint coming back this second time.

EDIT: I would have left it as ‚Äúher‚Äù if the grammar wasn‚Äôt burning a hole in my side.
I refuse to.  The media will continue trying to sane-wash him and the dark, dangerous place he's taking our country to, and they'll try to depict his supporters as decent, hard-working folks who are just sick with worry about the direction our country was headed.  I refuse to go along with any of it.  I will never, ever consider things like Confederate flags displayed on New England soil even remotely "normal".
God bess pesident Tump!!! Let feridom rang! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
 Can we start saying heil hitler like they used let‚Äôs go Brandon?
üòÇüòÇ
Fact
You don‚Äôt even need to go to NEK. I‚Äôve turned down the wrong road in Brandon (literally) and a lot of people feel comfortable flying the confederate flag there.
franklin county says hello
Nope, and could care less too - it‚Äôs all red up by the border (uneducated and poor) but cheap old houses falling apart - check them out on realtor.com
Not since 2021
There was no peace treaty because there was no declaration of war. It was a civil war, an internal conflict. The US can‚Äôt declare war on its own states so there is no treaty signed as well. The conflict ends when the fighting ends. It‚Äôs over. There are no Confederates to kill legally or otherwise.

Anyone who flies that flag is an idiot at best. I‚Äôm sorry you have to live among them down there.
They do desperately need attention 
  don‚Äôt they
That it‚Äôs ok to enslave and murder people you don‚Äôt like / are different / etc‚Ä¶
Using!
There's a big difference between "that's a bad thing to do and you shouldn't do it", and "the State should compell people to curtail their speech". Free speech doesn't insulate you from the consequences of your speech, such as people thinking you're vile.
How many people are vermonters today? Most of the state is 1st or 2nd gen.  All transplants from CT NYC NJ and Eastern Mass.  They have ruined the state with their far left ideals.  State voted blue once from 1791-1992.  Fairly positive in this chat most are not real vermonters.
Yup! Nazis commies and racist poor folk being turned on the ‚Äòother‚Äô ; those others can‚Äôt have as much as us‚Ä¶
There's an orchard in Isle La Motte proudly flying one next to their farm stand. North to south, we're not free of racists by any stretch of the imagination.
After World War II we went to great lengths to stamp out any lingering pro-Nazi sentiment as a condition of rebuilding the country and allowing it to reenter into normal international relations.  But with our own civil war, we half-assed Reconstruction, ended it prematurely, and have let these sick freaks nurse their grievances for 160 years, still to this day thinking their cause was just and their defeat a tragedy.  They've been like a millstone around the neck of our country ever since.
Sad. Surprise, I‚Äôm your neighborhood racist just out to show that I‚Äôm a big man
Take that green house emissions and oil / general inflation!
Where specifically? I live here and haven't seen confederate flags. Genuinely curious not saying you're wrong
Ya, that‚Äôs where the militias are standing by; tons of guns from white southerners go there; they have hard core bike gangs (criminal) / it can get almost as bad there - up in Quebec the ‚Äòothers‚Äô are the anglophones (non French speaking originally from England)
Unlikely.
Not all. Some are just evil.
People who fly a Southern rebel flag in a state that fought against them are dumb, yes. If you equate that with all conservatives that's on you

edit: that being said, that looks like a white plate. NH?
Only the poor uneducated ones; there are actually gay conservatives but we shun them because they are self loathing AND usually rich
[deleted]
I deeply enjoy my life even when bad things find me
Because it's moral and ethical to fight bad things?

There /is/ bad in the world. They didn't go looking for someone to be flying a symbol representing the tratior's cause in defense of slavery. They didn't mount that flag to that truck.

But when you see bad shit, it's completely right and good to say, "hey! that's unacceptable shit!"
No, now is the time to resist. Not going back and not ignoring the hate EITHER ‚Ä¶
  RESIST THE RIGHT
Plenty of things are legal that people should be shamed for
Because ‚Ä¶ it's still bad?

Like, the government should not step in and prevent it, sure, but ‚Ä¶ I'm not the government, and fuck that guy.

It's a big deal because allowing these people to fly divisive signals of hatred has a cost to lots of people, and myself. I don't want racists to be comfortable flying flags like this, and I don't want other people to see them flying flags like this and realize they won't get any pushback.
It‚Äôs hate speech to those who escaped slavery! Next you‚Äôll be saying it was a fight over states rights lol - just plain ignorance
Hey, whatEVER works - fight hate with intolerance of hate ; shame on their ignorance they should be educated
They‚Äôre feeling safe enough to come out of the woodwork
Oh!  And I was driving my little honda!!!
‚ÄúHe made the correct decision in that moment, but look at us now‚Äù‚Ä¶? Up until that last sentence I thought you might have been sarcastic. What?
Very unrelated but you‚Äôre not wrong lol
BahhahahahüòÇ
You are not wrong. They have every right. It‚Äôs better than F you N‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I suppose or similar examples of other derogatory hate speech towards minorities or immigrants. I mean to have it for heritage in the south is one thing and a partial excuse (that‚Äôs where I live now currently and am from), but to be rocking it in the north out in public is a direct statement of where they might have stood back in the civil war‚Ä¶
When you think abt the bigger picture, and have a broader scope of the relevance of the confederate symbol, what it means, and it‚Äôs history, it‚Äôs resurgence in the 80s with a revamp of far right communist ideology, you‚Äôd understand how this is harmful to someone‚Äôs psyche when they see it. Signed someone from the south
The piece of fabric indicates they most likely wish harm on a certain group of people. Like idgaf about trumpies. but we really need to start stamping this confederate and nazi shit out.
No! We won‚Äôt go back and we won‚Äôt shut our pie holes - in fact we may make you a very special pie a chocolate one with an added ingredient
It's bad ‚Äì actually ‚Äì to let people promote hated and division without making some noise about it.

This isn't, like, "I want to smoke some pot" where people should mind their own business because it doesn't really affect them. Or "if you think you see someone shoplifting, no you didn't".

This is someone /intentionally/ flying a symbol of hated and traitorous rebellion in the service of the perpetuation of chattel slavery.
Finally, someone with some common sense. üíØ
The flag that represents states that fought a war, which killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, is somehow better to you.. than an inept, shitty politician *that lost*? 

Get a grip.  

(Not a Harris or Trump supporter)
Are you from the south? I do love the south. And do not love how the far right neo-nazi punk f*cks have revamped its fascist racist as symbolism in recent years.
It‚Äôs NY, 5 min from NB
Nope / not going back
  We will resist
Wow, a lot of emotion it stirs‚Ä¶ 
  Makes you feel , hurt that people are FIGHTING HATE?!  
  We need to resist this nonsense and let them know it‚Äôs not ok here
It's not a "Democrat" flag, you numpty.
 No. There's no benefit of the doubt.
That is the North. 
The North won against their inbred traitor neighbors. 
The inbred Southerners killed many thousands of our ancestors, protected slavery, and then practiced Jim Crow for decades.
That symbol doesn't belong in the North. It probably doesn't belong in the South.
I love Skynyrd and the Allmans. In fact, their music feels more appropriate in Vermont. But fuck the Confederacy and anyone who reps the flag for whatever reason. It is ignorance exemplar.
Hey the IQ comment was uncalled for, fair, and it did piss me off when I saw it but IMO being pissed off at a confederate flag is warranted. It‚Äôs a symbol of racism and hate, and if he doesn‚Äôt know that, that‚Äôs on him.
I refuse to unify with the rebel scum.

Nah; it‚Äôs racist and in your face
  Wonder what they‚Äôll do when rump turns on them too - they are just useful tools (mob bullies) for him

It‚Äôs racist, period.

  Silence IS NOT OK
Plenty of townies fly that shit rag.
Nah, it's more common than you might think, and it's not just people from elsewhere. Many of our racists are homegrown.
It represents the exclusion of non-white people and pro-slavery. I reckon that should tell you enough about someone being a good person or not.
Being publicly pro-slavery is embarrassing. For them.
Sure, they‚Äôre so-called Christian hypocrites or bigots - no defense either way
Democrats aren't flying the Confederate flag, what?
üòò
Good thing plenty of us do care! ‚ÄúThe south will not rise again!‚Äù Screw racism, screw misogamy, screw xenophobia. It‚Äôs going to take millions of us not minding our business to make sure a broad minded, kind, rational, and democratic future are ahead of us.
GOIBC (get over it butter cup) this crap needs to be called out NOW EVEN MORE
Now I have thanks to you
This is true - thankfully at the flag of ye olde wealthy slave owner Democratic Party. The switchover happened decades ago, so while the people and sentiment are the same vile sh1t, the party has swapped so it‚Äôs been Republican for a long time.

But you knew that.
My right to free speech includes making this post, just like yours includes commenting your comment. We‚Äôre all so free! and embarrassed!
Educate me. What does the confederate flag stand for?

Though it‚Äôs less loud and not straight up using racist terminology, it still represents and symbolizes hate. Check out the history of the confederate flags resurgence alongside the revamp of communist ideology of nationalism of the far right in 80s, or maybe you already are aware, I honestly have no idea.
> but it's more of a southern pride flag now 

I know people /want/ this to be true, but it's really hard to separate it from its history.

It's like putting up a bunch of Nazi swastika flags and claiming they're really about east-asian religion. That simply is not a reasonable argument.
This may be the dumbest comment I've read in this sub all year.   But then again, -50 karma says it all
Let's see‚Ä¶

- The Confederacy was predicated on rejecting the Union to uphold the institution of slavery.

- BLM is asking for less extrajudicial murder and police action against Black people, which /regularly/ happens at higher rates.

- LGBTQIA+ folks are asking for basic social respect and the freedom to live their lives.


One of these things is not like the other. :P

Put a basketball hoop and say AIM BETTER with a barrel below catching the cans
A lot of them have a very set routine because I've noticed the same thing. I did roadside clean up once in my town and it blew my mind. I didn't realize how much people littered, but when we got to the less populated area with backroads where the rednecks primarily lived it was worse. And almost all shitty beer cans. We could tell some areas it was from one person because they were almost in a pile. Set up a game camera and you can probably catch them.
Sign should say ‚Äútoss a can to support the DNC‚Äù
[removed]
Put out a trash can with a bullseye board above it. Might as well make it a game and when they get good, you'll have less to pick up.
Way better than making a sign they probably can't read anyway
Bud Light is passe- Fox News says so. Your perp has a problem or is employed with a no beer cans in the truck policy. Game camera for 4-5 o-clock should do it.
Yeah‚Ä¶until you realize how weird it is that the non-dead Vermonters only want to post on Reddit about it and not say anything in real time üòÇ an in-person comment would truly be the only comment that mattered. Right,?

Don't forget the "We don't call 911 here" sign.
Yep, my girlfriend is from Upstate and moved back after college.  We both mentioned that we'd noticed this phenomenon when discussing which one of us should move one day (surprise surprise, she'll be coming home to New England).  Like it's not like we're totally bereft of shitty people and crumbling houses on this side of Lake Champlain, but there's a certain limit to what we tolerate in terms of overt racism and visible social decay.  Upstate New York does not have any such limit.  There are of course similarities to Vermont, especially near the border, but everything west of us just feels more...American, and I absolutely mean that as an insult.
Omg as someone who was house shopping in the Deep South with a very small budget this sounds pretty authentic to some of the rural areas we looked that had rebel flags as/in front of their front doors. The New Yorkers are recreating their dream of rural poverty in a state that won‚Äôt actually let them starve or go without medical care. How brave.
I non sarcastically want a ‚ÄúWarning: Attack dog sign‚Äù
Haha you described it perfectly; I too grew up in Washington County.

Yup and you are low counting the junk cars in their yards; they‚Äôve just been covered up with brush trash and signs/flags; a lot sell baked goods or eggs (yuk) out of roadside sheds as they are all out of work and on assistance

I mean, it did. Don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard to believe that someone wouldn‚Äôt yell at a loser with a confederate flag. But if I was making up a story, wouldn‚Äôt it be more cathartic to say that they did hear me?
There's really no blue states and red states. Sure they may typically vote one way or another but really big cities are blue and rural areas are red. Rural cali is literally the birthplace of American fascism
Did you just misgender Trump? How dare you! Everyone knows his pronouns are grift / scam.
Don't be obtuse. I just don't want to see this pleasant sub flooded with punch buggy confederate flag posts. Low effort.
you are correct!
all of that confederate crap is still there.  Also cartoon cutouts on fences with similar ideas.  You have to go beyond Lyndon for the most part.
I mean it‚Äôs really not that big a deal. People fly the flag sometimes, get laughed at by most other people, that‚Äôs sort of the end of it
Well I hope that is not their intentions.
I absolutely agree. But I do think that it‚Äôs odd to take pictures of someone and post it online, hoping to get approval from the internet that this is in fact vile. What ever happened to letting people do their thing and not making their life part of yours unprompted
Legal residents are real Vermonters
I guess you didn‚Äôt realize that the parties were switched way back, so you are probably wrong. Go move south and stay away if you don‚Äôt like it
What were ‚Äúreal Vermonters‚Äù in the preceding few hundred years prior to the Revolution?

Right. Native American, French, English, and a smattering of others. State Line Identity always cracks me up. We are so many different things in the USA - and the one consistent aspect is we‚Äôre all from somewhere else. Except aforementioned first peoples.
Vermonters like to think they are not racist, until the scary ‚Äòother‚Äô moves next door‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs only like 1% black population (although thankfully it‚Äôs increasing) so hopefully we welcome them and send the racists south
Yup, it needs to be rooted out

Assuming Republican = Conservative: Conservatives have widely opposed the removal and relocation of Confederate monuments in the south. [This article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/why-conservatives-love-defending-the-confederate-flag.html) is a few years old, but Conservatives haven‚Äôt changed their stance much since then, aside from digging their heels in a bit deeper.
Haha that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait‚Äù thing people do online is so fucking stupid. And it looks like someone answered you pretty quickly, so you didn‚Äôt have to wait long! lol
Well it doesn‚Äôt work that way.  Free speech  is for everyone.  Sometimes it is offensive to some but not to others.  Why do we want the government to step in?  We are not a communist country nor is this Nazi Germany.  The government is powerless based on the Supreme Courts decision, and it certainly isn‚Äôt the police‚Äôs role either.

Best advice:  suck it up and move along, it‚Äôs not worth your time or energy.
Or, you quit worrying so much about stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter. That flag isn‚Äôt hurting you, your ideas are hurting you.  

- another feller from the south
Blacks in the south also waive the flag. It‚Äôs  been taught as a symbol of hate as a symbol , but that‚Äôs not its purpose .
You‚Äôre still assuming what the flag means to him, projecting your beliefs about it onto him. For better or worse, a good portion of this country no longer connects that flag to slavery and racism.
I'm glad you enjoy being part of the problem. I, on the other hand, would prefer to work towards a solution.
It's a Democrat flag, republicans took it down and put up the US Flag.  You're just a useful idiot.
Storytime: i made and sold hot sauce in New England festivals, fairs and expos from 2013 to 2018. Any time I was put next to one of those big merch tents that sell shirts, hats, buckles, rugs and flags, I asked what their best seller is.

And every single one told me the same thing: the confederate flag.

People from CT, MA and Rhode Island? Yep. Buying teeshirts, vanity plates, flags, rugs, bedsheets, posters of Confederate flags. It runs out first. In a 4 day state fair, they would sell those out before the end of day 2.

And for whatever reason usually white teenage girls and white men in their 20s buying them.

One proprietor speculated that the girls were buying it to be rebellious, and the boys were buying it for image of being tough. Another vendor said they don‚Äôt call it a confederate flag; they market it as a ‚ÄúRebel Flag‚Äù
That's too bad, I never saw much overt racism like this in some of the rural areas I grew up in but that was a long time ago and just one area.
Not faulting you on your thoughts or opinions. Just stating your making a conclusion based mostly on conjecture with your response to my post. 
The reality is that every flag in the world has different meaning to different people. 
I don't personally believe in lumping people into categories or groups unless they verbally proclaim an association to or with said category or group.
Only an idiot would think everyone who flys a Rebel Battle Flag is pro slavery. That's not to say these people aren't, but that's def not the case.
It‚Äôs literally their flag‚Ä¶?
The most racist people I know are all Democrats. Seems nothing has changed.
I think they're under the impression that we're all going to be forced to stop laughing at them now that their rapist-messiah has been reelected.
I do not support that flag nor do i support the BLM flag or the alphabet mafia flag.  All have the right to fly. Funny thing about the left they do not believe in the 1st amendment unless it supports their narrative.  I think the United States spoke about this last Tuesday. 

Question:  do you think BLM & Alphabet Mafia should be flown in schools?

This post personifies the liberal esoteric nonsense that the right sees

Actually there's one right across from the Lyndon Center post office.
no. it should be offensive.
sure, 'everybody is too offended today...'
not enough Northerners are offended. Our spooky old New England cemeteries are filled with Union soldiers whose courage and sacrifice saved the Union.
Viewing the flag with indifference shows a problem that is separate from racism: a lack of pride in our country and a failure to appreciate any virtue in our past.
Because letting people get away with shit like this without voicing opprobium is how other people come to understand that /they/ won't get any pushback either, and [will keep pushing the boundaries into very bad territory.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/us/michigan-nazi-flags-anne-frank-theater/index.html) cf. also Charlottesville Unite the Right "tiki-torch" rally.

So I'm not sure what you're responding to.

> Well it doesn‚Äôt work that way. Free speech is for everyone.

It does work this way. People can fly their stupid-as-fuck flags. And I don't think they government should compel them to not do so. But it is entirely appropriate, and in fact ethically required, for /other/ people to tell them they're absolute pieces of shit for doing it, and we won't allow such things.
Conservative culture should not be associated with pre-civil war racism. It is ridiculous and asinine to presume everyone that is conservative is racist. This type of thinking is what alienates over 70+ million people in this country.  There are a lot of conservative people in the northeast who are not racist and tying them to this bullshit propaganda that has been spread has pissed them off so much, that they voted unanimously for someone who may not be perfect for the job.
Look at you whitesplaining the Confederate flag! Everyone gets their own meaning, and for this guy it might just be a fashion statement! He's an artist!
Look for standard trumpers and conservatives I agree. Yes we need to unify. 

For people displaying symbols of white supremacy? No. No we do not.
Fuck every single person who bought that merch.
all of those yogi's flying a swastika flag must surely be nazi's.
The singular important cause and driver for the Civil War is not represented by the primary symbol of the traitor's cause?

We've 180 years to figure this out. People who fly this flag are flying it in support of racism and slavery. That is what the cause represented, and thus what the flag represents.

Someone got shot in one of those towns for simply turning around in a driveway a few years back. I drive through it kinda frequently.
You joke, but the reality is they probably won't, because even in an emergency usually takes 45 min to an hour for the cops and stuff to show up anyway. 

More likely to try to speed race their best-condition jalopy at 95 mph on the main roads towards the nearest hospital tbh. 

I've seen it before lol will never know if they're all in an emergency but I've seen em cruising pretty good always assumed they were either headed to the hospital or out of beer. One of the two.
The part about it that‚Äôs extra insane to me is that if you are in an actual self defense situation but you have signs all over saying how eager you are to kill someone, a prosecutor is a lot more likely to go after you than if you‚Äôre just a normal person who had to defend themselves.

Exactly. This is a repeat of 2016. Insulting conservatives and blaming them for Trump‚Äôs election instead of self-reflection of why the liberal message didn‚Äôt resonate with those voters. 

Literally, the other side is screaming why the messaging isn‚Äôt resonating and the left, despite having far more popular opinions and policies, keeps losing. üôÑ
Sure, ‚Äúwhitesplaining‚Äù. Personally, I don‚Äôt think it should be displayed in any manner, public or private.

As someone exposed to a large number of family members that choose to display it, I‚Äôm merely stating that attacking people that display it is counterproductive to any form of dialog and only creates more division.

Forgive me for asking people to take a step back and stop making things worse.
I will reiterate the theme from my original comment: You are projecting your belief of what that symbol represents onto someone else without allowing for dialog, perpetuating the division.

I remember that, and I was not surprised in the slightest.  People of a certain political inclination seem to spend most of their leisure time fantasising about scenarios where they could shoot someone and get away with it, generally for sticking a toe over the line of their precious "private property".  As if everyone is desperate to go steal their Carhartt overalls and collection of vintage Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues.
Did they feel threatened that someone was turning around in their driveway? That's absolutely ridiculous
I think that was in Schuylerville?? And Schuylerville is like Manhattan compared to places like Hebron and Whitehall

The system has been in place too long the way it is. Please for the love of god let there be a new champion for the people soon. I hope we can all get behind that person.
That symbol literally is a relic from the confederacy. Its modern use was created and perpetuated by white supremacy groups and the kkk under the guise of "rebel culture". 

Look into the history of post civil war reconstruction. Anyone who thinks it's an innocuous symbol either bought a big lie, or is just playing dumb.

Where do you draw the line? Of he had kkk symbols or a black sun on his truck would you still want to create dialog?
You might want to read that again; I don't think it's quite the defense you think it is.

The thesis is here:

> In the postwar era, they note, the South transformed itself from a backward region to an engine of the national economy, giving rise to a sizable new wealthy suburban class. This class, not surprisingly, began to vote for the party that best represented its economic interests: the G.O.P. Working-class whites, however -- and here's the surprise -- even those in areas with large black populations, stayed loyal to the Democrats. (This was true until the 90s, when the nation as a whole turned rightward in Congressional voting.)

So ‚Ä¶ the argument is that the land-owning aristocrats in the south moved from D to R. Which is exacatly what that says. And the white working class and black population stayed with the Democratic party. Which is exactly what is supported by the southern strategy.

The bulk of the previously-Dem population moved to the Republicans because of their focus on "State's rights" (and (sometimes-not-even-)crypto-racism). And the working class population did not.

In any case: fundamentally the nature of the parties changed.

Who are you to boast about what‚Äôs good for anyone but yourself? Every American should have the choice to choose whether they want to use a vehicle that is powered by gas, electricity or unicorn farts.  Just like everyone had a choice whether they wanted to get an experimental Covid vaccine or not. I think you should work more hours in a day and not take any benefits from the government, but that‚Äôs my opinion and you can do as you please.
correct and so horrible.
Personally, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to get there as one country. 

We‚Äôve created division to the point that no one listens to each other anymore. Facts and opinions are no longer discernibly distinct from one another. Assumptions are made based on looks before even trying to understand. 

Case in point, getting downvoted for even suggesting that the guy in the picture may have a sliver of credibility or humanity.
I am neither uneducated on the history of that flag nor do I believe it should be displayed in any manner, public or private. I am merely stating, as someone with extensive exposure to people who choose to display that flag, that their understanding of it does not match yours. Labeling them as fools who "bought a big lie" or disingenuous in their beliefs discounts part of their identity and only strengthens their resolve.
Your source was a Wikipedia article 

Look, you clearly don‚Äôt know history and that‚Äôs okay.

This is simply nonsense.

The entire developed world banned leaded fuel because it was literaling killing people and making them more violent. We told companies to stop polluting due to rivers literally on fire and acid raid. We banned CFCs because it was tearing a hole in the ozone layer. We're phasing out incandescent and CFC lights because they're wicked inefficient. We mandate all sorts of safety devices on cars because they reduces the rates of death. We have consumer-protection agencies to help identify and mandate solutions to problems that individual consumers can not. We have a Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration to do the same in their domains, so ‚Äì like ‚Äì only dozens of people die of listeria, not thousands.

We live in a society, and we do certain things through our elected representatives because they are problems of collective ‚Äì not individual ‚Äì action.

You're arguing some extreme form of libertarian individualism that's fundamentally wrong; grow up.
Yeah, it‚Äôs very disheartening, I agree.
Lol, sure thing buddy.

The wikipedia article is well-sourced.

The Democrats of today aren't the Democrats of the KKK.

But keep spreading that lie; people certainly think you're super smart when you do that.
You can‚Äôt  just phase out oil comrade. That‚Äôs not how the world works
I'm no "comrade". :P

We are phasing out oil, though. And we can, and must continue to.

And a way to do it is to quantify the cost of the externalities it creates via taxes.

But my point was more so: we do in fact make changes to the world via the collective action of democratic representation when it's necessary, and this is so necessary.
Thank you to who said 99%‚â†100%
Thank you to the redditor who posted recently about totality. You explained that 99% ‚â† 100% and I‚Äôm really glad I saw your post. I thought 99% was the same as 100% and planned to stay home today. I saw your post and realized how lucky I am to live so close to the totality.

She had a great day playing in the mud and we got to witness the eclipse together.  

Without your post I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered to drive up. You gave me a core memory with my daughter today and I am so grateful. 
I was one of a few people who posted here saying that 100% was incomparably better.  I'm glad that some redditors followed our advice. I actually think this eclipse was even better than the 2017 one, which I saw in Tennessee.  The tiny bit of clouds we got here made for a better effect at totality.  Here's the relevant xkcd, in case you need to convince anyone to go for 100% the next time an eclipse comes around. 

https://xkcd.com/2914/
I'm so happy for you!
I am so happy for you and your kid!! 

I heard the same thing in 2017, and I still didn‚Äôt understand the hype, but I drove to totality anyway‚Äî not knowing what to expect. It made me an eclipse chaser of sorts. can‚Äôt wait for 2045 in my hometown in Florida!

it‚Äôs frustrating to try to explain to people why it‚Äôs so cool (hoping that they‚Äôll go to totality), but I guess that‚Äôs the beauty of it, too‚Äî you need to see it to believe it.
I got this exact same advice from a friend a few days ago. Originally I planned on watching from work. WOW do I understand now. Totally worth the 6.5 hour drive from Westmore back to the Brattleboro area.
It‚Äôs pretty amazing how fast the transition is from totality back to a blazing ball in the sky.
Zero comparison between 99% and 100%. 

It took me 12 hours to get home from Stowe, a drive that normally takes less than 3.

Absolutely worth it.
My thanks to all of you who encouraged 100%, also. I've seen partial eclipses and total *annular* eclipses, but never a total full eclipse. My wife and I drove up to a wildlife management area near Addison, and I can't describe how glad I am that we did.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I visited Vermont for the first time in my life because of this. It was amazing. 


Vermont is a beautiful state.
Could have been any number of us; glad you made the effort to see the real deal!!!
It truly is apples to oranges. I believed everyone saying that they are completely different experiences, but you really can‚Äôt imagine how different it is unless you experience it. So glad I made the trek to VT from MA and want to thank you guys for putting up with all of us for the weekend
Yes it's not worth driving to it unless you drive to totality. We skipped totality this year because my kids are too young and didn't want to torture them in traffic.¬†


Did 96% or whatever it was here, it's OK but not quite an experience
There really is no comparison! We headed up to Burlington from WRJ and I wouldn't have missed it for the world. We were in the path of the totality in Indiana in 2017, but my FIL had a stroke and we spent the entire eclipse in the emergency department at the hospital. Wasn't going to miss it again, and it was a truly magical experience.
I got to see a toddler witness totality AND enjoy celery for the first time. Big day.
Fortunately I found a map that would show what the max eclipse would be based on location.  What my location said was ‚Äú99.8% drive 30 miles north‚Äù and I am so thankful for that.  usually \~45 minutes along 22A took 3 hours but along the way there were people cheering on the traffic!
I was one of the people making that argument here and I‚Äôm so glad so many people got to see it and understand it now! There‚Äôs no way to understand until you see it. It‚Äôs beyond photos and descriptions, eh? I saw it in 2017 in Oregon and was still blown away way as if I had never seen totality‚Ä¶. I just started laughing hysterically. 

What a weird, beautiful world we live in!
Agree. Before yesterday, I didn't get the hype. I get it now.
As someone living in CT ... everyone thought I was nuts saying I was going to drive to northern VT for the eclipse. They're all like, '"We're getting like 97% here."

Turned out this week is my wife's (teacher) and son's (student) vacation week, so I convinced them to drive up with me. They both said sure, but thought it really was going out of the way for a sliver more.

I had explained to them (for years ... I'd been planning on this since 2014) that the difference between 99.9% and 100% is as great as the difference between 0% and 99.9%.

Once they saw it, they got it. 

Still, others are saying it's a waste of time just to be a bit darker. They don't get it.
It's definitely a way bigger difference than 1% suggests but 99% is still very cool. Anything less is pretty underwhelming.
That‚Äôs wonderful. I missed totality in 2017 and totally regretted it. So I made a point not to miss it this time
This is so wholesome! Who‚Äôs cutting onions?!?!
This is why I love Reddit. Some serious wholesomeness
Really cool that you got to see this with your little one and what an amazing memory for you. It was an amazing experience to say the least
Yep, my dad was in the "it'll be 99% here, we could just stay" camp. But I had driven 1200 miles so he was willing to drive a bit to get into the path of totality.

I think it set in for him that 100% really mattered when it was a few minutes before totality and it was still pretty much normal daylight outside.
yes i also read these threads which convinced me to make a last minute plan to drive up to totality in VT.   it was one of the most amazing things ive ever seen and wouldnt have compared to watching through eclipse glasses.  

my wife watching through glasses at 25%:  oh neat it looks like pacman haha üôÉ

my wife during totality: **speechless and tearful**
OMG I was thinking exactly the same, I drove over 8 hrs in one day to see it but it was worth every minute of it. Such a beautiful moment. Though my kids didn‚Äôt think the same I‚Äôm hopeful one day they will remember our experience.
It's like the speed of light. For an object with mass, the difference between 99% and 100% is unfathomable
When does 99 percent EVER equal 100? Never. Lol.
You‚Äôre welcome!
[removed]
üíØ!!!
Great memories for your family.  Heartwarming!
Funny, we made the trip to TN in 2017 and then just enjoyed this one too. We were further East yesterday so had no clouds. However my opinion differs in that no clouds is vastly better (we had partial  clouds during the 1999 eclipse).
How are u saying ur a eclipse chaser now and gonna wait till 2045?? A true chaser is gonna go for 2026 2027 etc
Also from the Bratt area and agree, 5 and a half hours to get home from Barton (usually a two and a half hour drive) and my fiancee and I still had high spirits. Anyone who says 99% is good enough just won‚Äôt get it until they see 100% totality.¬†
Yeah... When it was fully obscured I had no problem looking directly at it even through binoculars. As soon as the first 0.01% sliver came back it was blinding again.

Honestly I'm glad I made the trip up from Jersey. 

Your state is astonishingly beautiful and even being stuck in gridlock traffic on a two lane country road was pleasant since we were stuck during golden hour and had great views of the mountains and Lake Champlain.

Here I am at work only 5 hours after finally getting home and not regretting a single second.
Yes! I will travel to the next one because now I know what to expect. Dark to light blew me away, after already looking around in awe for the 3 min of totality. The light that stayed all around us on the horizon like a sunrise‚Ä¶.I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this amazing experience.

And the stars that came out and the coolness and the people all around also not knowing what to say. Awestruck!

Beautiful Vermont, we had no traffic on back roads and beautiful scenery‚Ä¶.and I saw a marshmallow farm! Lucky!

Addison was the perfect place to see it, in my opinion! The weather was incredible
And you came during the (technically) ugliest time of year and still have that opinion ‚ò∫Ô∏è VT truly is one of the most beautiful states in the country.¬†
Dude, y'all were really pleasant and courteous. The experience was well worth the traffic and the crowds. We aren't used to that kind of volume up here, but it was pretty controlled. Went about as smoothly as one could hope for given the circumstances. It took 1.5 hours to get to my site. 7.5 hours to get home. But it was so worth it. People were driving in almost stand-still traffic with their windows down talking with each other about how epic it all was. Super endearing.

Where did you go in VT?
Same! I went into it thinking, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be cool, but it was way more than I could have imagined. My daughter‚Äôs first reaction was ‚Äúoh! The cow jumped over the moon!‚Äù Which was so cute and innocent I‚Äôll never forget it. 

Every visitor I encountered was very pleasant and my drive home was about 45 minutes longer than it typically would have been but even the traffic wasn‚Äôt too bad on 22a, for me at least.
Yes! I live in Rutland county and my town was listed as 99% and change and I honestly thought that was close enough. Addison is less than an hour on a normal day. Took me about 2ish hours to get home on 22 which honestly wasn‚Äôt as bad as I expected.
Totally! I went into thinking it would be cool but I couldn‚Äôt have imagined just how awestruck I was going to be. I wish my daughter is old enough to remember (she‚Äôs 2) but it was a great day overall. Her initial reaction to totality was ‚Äúoh! The cow jumped over the moon!‚Äù
Me too :) my favorite of all the social medias!
I‚Äôm sure they will one day! I have a lot of fond memories and experiences with my parents that I know I groaned about in the moment
Totally makes sense when you say it like that! In my head I was like, yea 99% is close enough, but these are massive celestial objects and it makes complete sense that the 1% difference is monumental
2nd row seats at a concert
"You get to keep 99% of your lottery winnings"

Or are we being math pedants?
99% of a home run is a nice fly ball, but you're still out.
Meant it more as I thought 99% was close enough to 100% that it would be nearly the same. I‚Äôm glad they posted that it isn‚Äôt because i would have missed out on a truly spectacular day
McCuen Slang!
I am also going to Egypt in 2027. 

don‚Äôt you have better things to do than interrogate people on a lighthearted sub?
Also brat area. I guess I got unlucky.  7 hours for me from Lake Willoughby
Wow, how long did it take you to get back to NJ?

  
I'm a transplant from Sussex County NJ myself.  I do miss the food.  Next time bring bagels ;-)
That first sparkle of the second diamond ring is a sharp reminder to put the filters back on!
That‚Äôs where we store the cows until winter is over.
We thought so, too! Not only that, but we didn't even know that WMA existed‚Äîand we're birders. Definitely going back again and taking our binoculars this time.
I hear ya. I was thinking to myself how much more picturesque it probably is in the warmer seasons. Thanks for having us. Truly a magical experience and time we had.
Driving home to Massachusetts from Derby Line yesterday, I was thinking thank god (for Vermonters' sake) that this eclipse wasnt in any other season to keep tourism down.
I‚Äôm glad you had a good experience! We went to Waterbury Center State Park. Took us about 2.5 hours to get there (no traffic on the way up) and a little over 6 hours to get back home
I was talking with people at work who thought it would be good enough at 99%.  And now they are sad.
Ah envious! We left our 2 year old in daycare ü´§ (We were afraid the drive back to southern VT could take 5 hours) oh well, maybe she‚Äôll see one in 20 years
Oof, that‚Äôs rough. We truly believe if we didn‚Äôt ditch the highway at exit 24 (Lyndon) after crawling 20 miles in an hour, we would have been in a similar situation. We ended up going through some backroads in Danville and Peacham, then down 25 through Corinth and hopped back on 91 in Fairlee where things were at least moving at 40-50 mph. Then ditched the highway again in Rockingham. It was definitely a wild night.¬†
Hello former neighbor! I lived in Sussex county for 13 years up until moving in with my partner in Passaic county last year!

As for my trip back, we left the parking garage in Burlington around 6pm last night. Even without any service, Google Maps told us to avoid rt 7 and interstate 87 at all costs until pretty much Albany, so it took us and thousands of others down these 2 lane country roads right out of Burlington, where we crawled at walking speed for two hours.. not terrible since it was golden hour and beautiful out.

After that, it took us down roads less traveled through NYS paralleling 87 until finally rejoining it near Albany.

We finally got home at 2: 15AM and I looked into work 5 hours later haha.

But no regrets at all. Last night's inconveniences become today's cherished memories.
Oh that hurts my heart for them. I wish it was easier to explain the difference
Well at least you had the right attitude about the drive! 

  
I grew up in Sparta and after college worked in Riverdale and lived in Lincoln Park.  If you bring Pizza next time you come back we'll all thank you.
When some of the people who crowded the highways in VT got to Massachusetts, they were met with the State Police as people were flowing in like swarms. Took me 8.5 hours to get home. Started at 530. And that included backroads.
they understand now!
No way! I was over in Franklin and hang out in Riverdale and Lincoln Park almost every week.

I'll be sure to try to bring some decent pie and perhaps a Taylor Ham Egg and Cheese on a bagel up next time!

I have no idea about the quality of Vermont's pizza/ bagels though, I assume they're working with similar water and other ingredients as NJ, and likely have tons of transplants so I can't imagine it would be terrible like 4/5ths of the rest of the country
Strangely, on my Odyssey from Burlington through NY back to Jersey, the only police I saw were the ones directing traffic in Burlington itself.
Wow! That could have gone pretty badly. I‚Äôm glad you are safe and sound.
Started coaching my little sister in the park. She‚Äôs 9
Ignore the fall on the FS360 she‚Äôs still trying to get consistent on those.
Damn, your sis is a ripper!!
Switch is the most impressive part of this
I‚Äôm convinced Kids don‚Äôt take fall damage
9?!!! Holy crap! I‚Äôm gonna compliment both and say it‚Äôs a blend of natural talent and a good coach.
The approach had me sure she was gonna die then pops the cleanest 180 ever. Wild.
I‚Äôve been snowboarding twice as long as she has been alive and she is better than I am for sure.
Judging from the responses on my post she‚Äôs better than 90% of this sub!
Such crimes.. lil juviee is crushing it
Ah yes, small children making me want to just hang it up and call it a day.   
Idk what they started putting in the cereal lately but it's definitely working.
Rippin! Great stuff
This kid is steezy for sure!
Well done sir.
She is everything I wanted to be at that age ü•≤

She shreds!!
So rad! Also MLSM represent!
You‚Äôre doing gods work! Coach me next?
Adorable juvenile delinquent
Damn, so close to 360 at the end!
Certified shredder for sure!
Dope
Jesus Christ she‚Äôs a beast.
Damn she rips! I'd be 200 yards back towards to top getting a good cry in
Someone should tag the user recently asking if he was an intermediate rider going super slow and barely popping of jumps. He need classes with OP
She rips!!!! Any time you guys need a place to ride big pow by Wolf Creek let us know. She needs a lot of work with her arms. Proper placement and such. But she definitely a great rider at her age.
damn dude can you coach me
Hero status there bodie.
Been riding for 20+ years and she‚Äôs better than me!
Great job coach!
Excellent!!!
She‚Äôs way out shredding me wish I learned at her age
yo wtf she‚Äôs goated üò≠
Yesssss! Love how fast she‚Äôs going , gotta learn with the speed. Good for her
Criminal level: Incorrigible
This girl is AMAZING
Riding switch like that already? Going to be a monster
Nice work nice work!
Steezy!
That‚Äôs awesome!
I think you need to coach me
What a sick lil ripper!!!
She outrides me, ffs
9 & already rides better than me in switch lmao, keep it up!
Rad!!! ü§òüèΩ
Tell her she‚Äôs a certified ripper
Nice, well done!
Oh god, Are you just trying to get every stupid "how do i rotate better on my second day" questions

LMAO off I hope you do, tell them to take an example from a 9yr old child.
Wanna be my coach? I‚Äôm 8
She‚Äôs a beast
Nice she's killing it
What a beast, goes harder than half the Jerry‚Äôs in this thread.
Can you coach me in the park?
Looks like Louie.. how's it looking there think will still have snow there next week ?
Take your sister to the hospital, she‚Äôs sick af!!
Nice
What a little ripper. My son is 3 hopefully he will be this good in 6 years

Also, does anyone else just love the under glow that comes from a bright bottom sheet?  Fuckin rad man
The Duchess of Shredshire
Jesus, how can I learn to ride goofy like her?
I learned to board at 9, and watching this is absolutely mind blowing. Kids get so good so quickly!
God i suck
She‚Äôs gonna be better than me in 2 years tops. Kids these days man‚Ä¶
Goofy-foot Girl rockin it!
Sick!!!
That first hit tho! so smooth
Hell ya! Mini shreds!!
She rips better than me
She can already do more than I ever could
Better than me ! Lol
Fuck she‚Äôs good! Coach me next please üòÇ
Damn, she could be a pro one day, if thats what she does at age 9
I can't believe she is so good switch. Fantastic.
GET IT GIRL
An actual cool kid boarding video, awesome.  Most MFs here post "watch my kid ShReDz it up!" and its some 9 year old side slipping down the bunny slope doing nothing.  And I'm a dad with kids.. but my little fuckers prefer skiing.
Shredder!!! This is awesome
I was waiting for the skiier to come out of nowhere and absolutely truck her.
She's great I couldn't have went 20 ft without hurting myself
Future big air jumper
Dang future Olympic Slopestyle champ!
LOVE THIS
We‚Äôve been hit by, we‚Äôve been struck by‚Ä¶.. a SMOOOOOOTH criminal üòé
That‚Äôs great she‚Äôs flying already
That is really impressive.
Are you Shaun white? That‚Äôs amazing for a 9 year old.  She‚Äôs hitting those with speed too.
Dude she is hauling. She is way better than me it ain‚Äôt close
On that first jump I was afraid she was gonna land and catch a toe edge
Little rockstar! Rock on ü§ò
Sad to see the youth turn to a life of crime so earlyüò¢
This is awesome, you‚Äôre both awesome. Carry on.
Rides switch better than 90% of this sub
‚ÄòTis just as the prophecy foretold
That switch 1 was steazy. Keep it up fellow criminals
This is amazing. Started my kids going in hopes they will be like this at this age, I just don‚Äôt have the option to get them out but really once a year for am anywhere from a day to 3
Better than most of us
SHEEEESH way to go girl!!!
She is doing way better than me
Sorry for being creepy but can I marry her in like 10 years
Unreal! This seems like a good way for siblings to spend time together. 

Hopefully she's going to keep it going!
Gotta love that white ribbon of death
Holy steeeez!!!
Nahhhhh, she‚Äôs a beast
I wish I was 9 and didn‚Äôt fear pain or breaking something.
Great now I‚Äôm pissed. I suck.
ur sister shreds harder than eddie van halen, fucking sick!
Wow is she regular or goofy foot. I can‚Äôt tell
so much steeze
Safe to say she‚Äôs better than me
Im way better then her and im only 35 üòé
This is r/praisethecameraman stuff right here.
Moly holy! She‚Äôs a rocket! Jumpihg switch? Cmon that shows how little fear kids have and why it‚Äôs important to teach them comfidence in extreme sports early!! Well done future Anna Gasser!
I have to ask myself some serious questions because I realised I can be jealous of a 9 year old girl
Nice
Unreal !!!
She has a cool style, really glides over the snow instead of carving hard
Sick!
Fuck yah tell your sister her style is sloppy but aggressive and I'm literally all about itü§òü§ò she's gonna be an insane rider as I'm sure anyone who watched that can tell. Good job older sibling, love how hyped she looks while doin it too
Awesome. I was worried about the first landing - it looked like it was going to be sideways.
Dude no way that‚Äôs fucking amazing
ICON
Insane
‚ÄúIgnore the fall on the FS360‚Ä¶‚Äù

Bruh she‚Äôs 9 and rips better than half this subreddit, I don‚Äôt think anyone here is in a position to judge her.üòÇ keep it up!
X-games, here she comes ü§òüèª
Sister has bars
Shmobbin lil sis she be doin 1080s tomorrow

Props
That‚Äôs good shit
Yaaa lil ripper all gas no breaks!
Damn that the fact this vid made me wanna get married and have a kidüòÇ

My 9yo this morning love the girl grind!
She's clearly ignoring that slow sign
She is badass
This is so sick omg. She needs to coach _me_ and I'm almost thrice her age! üòÜ
Everyone follow her instagram if possible @kate_sendy11
She walks among us!
Dude she‚Äôs a killer charging jumps like a champ!!
Shes absolutely sick!!


But 3/4 of this sub is absolutely steaming at wanting to critique her because they're fat nerds with Step Ons and ass pads that can barely wake up in the morning let alone deal with air and a spin¬†


¬†I'll get my popcorn ready now,
Definitely been doing lots of switch runs so that her cab 180‚Äôs and regular 180s are easier.
Right!? I was like, "oh no! She doesn't look super comfy!" But then she did the 180 and I was like "damn :'( another child better than me"
being shorter, they dont fall as far to the ground as us adults
I'm convinced that most adults only get hurt because they don't stretch and weigh considerably more. 

If you stay in shape and flexy, you should be fine into your 30s and 40s
They DON'T! I was a nanny in my 20s and was in charge of a 3 (skis) and 5 year old (snowboard) at keystone. The 3 yo would just take off down blacks. He would fall, but he was so small he'd just bounce back upright and keep going! I thought for sure one of both of them were going to die.
Hahahah, thank you. Yes she definitely has some natural talent and has been snowboarding for a bit now. I think some of it comes from watching me in the park so it gives her confidence.
I used to joke that there are people who are younger than my board who are better snowboarders than me... Now I think there are people who are younger than my board, who have kids who are better than me...
100% would get wrecked trying to keep up with her
Certainly better than me at 26 üòÇ
I could replicate everything she just did, but I‚Äôm genuinely not sure if it would be as clean‚Ä¶
The secret ingredient is practice...
Maybe, my client list so far is just my two sisters and my dad lmao.
Thanks! Will do never been to the states for snowboarding but would be good fun.
Could, I actually have my coaching license but you‚Äôre probably not located near me.
Including me
All comes with confidence, she definitely still gets scared of trying new things but with a strong foundation it gets easier.
Amongusüò≥ sus
I've got step ons but still think she's amazing
What is the difference between a cab 180 and a regular 180?
She rides sw better than 95% of the hill ü§ô
The 180 was tight
Teaching her well!
Learned this lesson in college when we did a slip n slide at 20, turns out being 6‚Äô5‚Äù and 230 makes me hit the ground alot harder than when I was a kid. 

We all woke up the next day feeling like we just got hit by a truck.
They also don‚Äôt weigh nearly as much. Bailing at 40lbs vs bailing at 150+ lbs is way different.
Not true, am very short.  Still take fall damage.  They just bounce.
That and they are way more flexible. Meaning its super hard for them to tear a muscle or something. Which is often the most ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù thing. Sure your leg being deep purple for a month sucks but you can fix that shit with cooling, keeping the blood flowing and some other stuff.

Tored muscles are just fucked. They need rest.
shape/flexy don't matter when your cartilage is gone lol.

I have osteoarthritis in my knee from hitting fat jumps my entire 20s. I can still ride at 39 but I have a knee brace and a lot of stiffness the next morning.

I still rock climb 2-3 times a week + hockey twice a week, so it's not like I'm dying or anything...stretching might help prevent a muscle pull/tear but when it comes to high impact sports, the only thing to save you from a crash, is to not crash in the first place.
> I'm convinced that most adults only get hurt because they don't stretch and weigh considerably more. 

Strength/weight ratio flips completely in your late teens, which is coincidentally when most people stopped regularly exercising.
It helps but kids are always more flexible. Its litteraly their body makeup. Its not that you became fragile the second you turn 67, its a slow build up. I have seen videos of myself when i was 6 bending my hand a full 180 degrees when i fell and i stopped crying the second somebody gave me a kiss on it. These day anything past 120 degrees will send my to the hospital instantly.
my 5 y/o straight pointed it and went FLYING down the slope the other day (still working on board control/stops) and I had visions of him crashing into the lift line at the bottom‚Ä¶ instead, he decided to throw himself to the ground at speed, tumbling in a way that would put any adult out for the day, and gathering a few ‚Äúoohhhhh‚Äùs from the chairs above. He just got right up and said ‚Äúthat was awesome, did you see that?‚Äù

Kids, man.
There is vast, vast alchemical power in "Big Brother can do it and he said I could do it." in the mind of a little kid.
I can‚Äôt ride switch
Definitely  


just amazes me how good kids are at stuff these days
Well hopefully the 3 of you can enjoy the last few weeks of our season. ü§û for a big snow dump on Sunday.
Anytime. HMU. Always great to make new friends world wide.
Cab you start switch and do a frontside 180, Regular just means starting the way you normally ride then land switch. Cab is usually easier to learn cause your body wants to go back to the normal way you ride it‚Äôs just weird to go off jumps switch.
cab would be a switch frontside spin.
a cab 180 is specifically a switch frontside 180
Nor can I -- only some switch heel but switch toe is a no for me dawg
Steve Caballero approves this message
*Erh hem.* ü§≠ There is no such thing as cab on a snowboard. /s (kinda, Steve Caballero literally said you can't do a half cab on a snowboard.) Let the semantic trick argument begin...lol
Is she regular or goofy? Can't really tell since she's handling both
I was going to say age looked more comfortable the second part and thought she was riding switch at first. Is she goofy and what are her bindings at (duck, posi etc)?
I think if we‚Äôre being picky that it‚Äôs also technically off the nose.
I can get like 150 degrees in either direction, but going straight/swapping edges is not going to happen.
Well he recently said that a cab means a 360, and a half cab is a 180, so he might not fully approve, but I don‚Äôt care just saying
Doesn‚Äôt a cab start from a nollie too?
>Let the semantic trick argument begin...lol

No such thing as a cab 180 either.
Agreed!
She rides goofy naturally.
Agree. And it's kinda hard not to pressure the switch nose more.
Nah, a cab is a fakie 3.
Haha. Cab 180 = 540? Half cab, full cab, add 180 to full cab it's 540? On a skateboard. Has anyone done that actually? Like a fakie 540? Cause they'd get to name it.
Happy cake day G
I‚Äôve always gone with this definition https://snowboardaddiction.com/blogs/buttering/how-to-do-caballerial-snowboard-trick
Yup definitely seen it done and from what I remember they just called it a cab 540 instead of a new name.
Burnquist did a fakie 900 on his mega ramp.

What the actual f is happening in the US
Hello, I have taken this screenshot from an instagram account (travels.jw) and I was absolutely shocked at the price of ski passes in the US compared to those in any other country in Europe. I'm from Italy and I already thought it was incredibly expensive to buy a skipass for the price of ‚Ç¨60, whereas in the US it's normal to buy one for basically half the price of a whole board??? I was so naive thinking that I could afford a snowboarding holiday in the US, turns out I am way better off in my home country. 

How do you guys even afford it? What's the point of snowboarding in the US? It is assumed that snowboarding/skiing is an expensive sport, but US snowboarders are you okay? What's your secret to affording these insane passes?
It's what happens when just 2 companies who want you buying their season passes own basically every big mountain in the entire country
North American resorts want their customers to be buying season passes, not just day tickets.
I use to teach snowboarding at Afton Alps in highschool. Around 2000. For those of you talking about mountains, AA is in minnesota. It barely qualifies as a large hill. $100 is fucking insanity.
Shut up peasant 

\- Vail Management
2 monopolies bought all the ski mountains in the United States and the government division responsible for stopping monopolies and protecting consumers from price gouging isn't doing fuck all to stop them.
Yeah but $MTN üìà
I live in Jackson, WY and stopped even buying a ski pass. Backcountry has become my preferred outlet!  (Which I know is not the same as enjoying a resort!)
It‚Äôs like Ticketmaster, but it‚Äôs called Epic or Ikon. Assholes.
2 companies are monopolizing and buying up all the resorts & then jacking up all the day pass prices so they can get you to just bite the bullet & buy their season passes which are good for all the resorts they own. Ikon & Epic would be the two passes, Vail owns Epic not sure who Ikon is because it's not on my side of the country, but yeah, that's whats going on. Private resorts might just be raising prices because the industry itself is not inflated. The way it works over here now though is basically 1000 usd for a season pass or 180 a day for a day pass.
[deleted]
Oh my god.. these prices ... USD 299.. that is 70-75% of the prices of 10 days of snowboarding including return bus trip, apartment and ski pass, in Europe.
There‚Äôs still affordable lift tickets at smaller resorts in the US, but can‚Äôt beat Europe in terms of value since major resorts are still quite cheap.
Japan is even more affordable than Europe and the best pow!
Ski lifts in the US need to pull 3x the weight compared to those in Europe.
Monopolization
Since everyone in this thread is trying to make comments for upvotes and not actually answering your question, I‚Äôll try to do it:

Over the last 5ish years, the majority of American ski resorts have been getting bought up by just two conglomerates (Vail Resorts and Alterra Mountain Company). Before that, most of these resorts and mountains were independently owned, relatively cheap prices, but fighting to stay afloat. Since Vail and Alterra came in, all of the premier started selling what I‚Äôll call ‚Äòglobal‚Äô season passes. So now instead of buying a season pass to one mountain, you can buy a ‚Äòglobal‚Äô pass for 3x the price and get access to a ton of these other resorts. 

What this did was force the locals used to buying 3,4,$500 passes into buying $1000 passes, and then Vail/Alterra could focus on catering to the richest of the rich by charging the prices you shared in your screenshot.
Everyone has Epic & Ikon passes.
People still show up in the tens of thousands, there‚Äôs no reason for them not to increase prices
I wonder what a season pass comparison would look like.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the free market bro! Welcome to freedom!‚Äù /s
wait till you see Australia prices lmao
It‚Äôs driving people to get an epic or ikon pass and then be loyal to their pass for the season. So that would encourage an ikon pass holder to only ride ikon mountains, and that would attempt to hurt the epic mountain companies, and vice versa. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ski at our competitors‚Äù ticket.
A lot of those resorts are owned by public companies and now they have constant shareholder pressure to make more money every quarter than the last quarter
EPIC and IKON . Enuf said
Snowboarding is weird- if you only go a few times, it‚Äôs the most expensive sport out there. If you go often, it‚Äôs the cheapest.  I only have 12 days on epic mtns this year but that means my pass is down to like $50/day already.
Alpe d‚ÄôHuez is almost as ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù as Chamonix. But in the U.S. most people use season passes to spread the cost.

Mammoth Mountain is 220 for one day (off peak period) and that is online price.
We all buy season passes. These are for the tourists
You have Fail Resorts to thank for that.
Vail, Alterra/Ikon, and Boyne.

They want you to buy a (mega) season pass, and hyper inflating day tickets is the easiest way to do it.
That‚Äôs the thing. They don‚Äôt want you buying day passes in the US. Vail, Park City, and Heavenly are owned by Vail Resorts. You can buy a season pass for all their resorts for under $799. So clearly they don‚Äôt want you buying day passes, as their pricing demonstrates.
Us cheap ski bums spend all our money on an IKON or EPIC season pass which offers unlimited trips to certain mountains, about $1000+/- depending on what level. The pass is paid for after less than a handful of ski trips then boom, free skiing the rest of the season!
Vail right? They're to blame? 

Everyone talking about a monopoly but no one is shaming them. Would be super easy for the snowboard community to shame vails parent company
[removed]
Seasons pass at Cham is $1800 btw
Damn. My local hill in BC is damn near this expensive... for a seasons passüòÇ
That‚Äôs why my husband and I are going to zermatt next month. We did the math and the difference between traveling to Utah and shredding in the Swiss Alps/Italy wasn‚Äôt much (Switzerland is an expensive country and we didn‚Äôt go cheap on our hotel but from what we‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs going to be worth it!!)
it sucks most for people who don't have the time / proximity to go much. If you live near a mountain, $1000 for the whole winter isn't that bad of a deal. You're going all the time, so it's maybe an ok value. If you only get to do a few days a year, you really just get fucked. The mountains get constantly packed with Ikon / Epic people, since it's "unlimited," so "casuals" just have a shittier time.
Afton Alps is a Vail Property and has a 300' hill at best. 50 minutes from me and I will not go there.
Steamboat is basically $225 the rest of the year.
With so many great prices on season passes and multi resort passes the only people paying these prices are the wealthy. Brighton has made a bunch of modern upgrades over the years but I remember paying $18 for a day pass in the early 90‚Äôs. It should also be pointed out that Epic and Ikon passes are owned by property companies and that resorts don‚Äôt make a lot of money on the day pass, they actually make their money on lodging. Most slope side resorts offer free passes for all guests and every day they stay, but hey it might make you feel better when your paying >$300/night to get a free ‚Äú$300‚Äù pass. It‚Äôs a marketing scam and of course they don‚Äôt care if there are people that stay off slope and pay the ticket window price. So if you are going to stay somewhere cheap and want to ride the big hills on ski vacation in the U.S. (and a few international spots) check out the Ikon pass or Epic pass. On the flip side there are a lot of fun smaller resorts that still have decent price. Last year my wife and I were rv‚Äôers in Blue River Oregon for ski season and I rode Hoodoo. It was a fun little resort and they offered a decent 5 day pass deal that were fully transferable and could be used on the same day. Bonus: they had rv parking, but we have a travel trailer and would have been best with a C class.
Here in the catalan pyrinees most of the ski stations are publicly owned, except for 2 or 3, and the season pass for all of them is 600‚Ç¨, while the daily pass it‚Äôs at most 49‚Ç¨ (prices depend on age)

As for snowfall, that‚Äôs an issue
They want you to buy the seasons pass which is a better deal. It sucks when it‚Äôs impossible to go a lot though and single lift ticket prices are ridiculous. Normal people can‚Äôt afford it
In my home resort (Eastern Europe) the day pass is 40‚Ç¨. You only have 24km of piste, 2 cable-cars, 1 gondola, and 2 chair-lifts but it‚Äôs a sick place to ride.

This isn‚Äôt just happening with snowboarding either. Amusement parks, concerts, museums, and so many other things are just crazy expensive. Apparently people aren‚Äôt having any issue paying these prices‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt understand how.
Fuck ikon, fuck epic. Fuck everyone of you who facilitated this shitstorm of an industry now. It‚Äôs pathetic you sheep bend over to happily get fucked by corporate America so you can make your few wiggles down 3 mountains this year and call it an Epic year. 

Go support a local mountain and fuck vail
Capitalism blows
Yeah you guys are retarded with the prices, and the reason is, you guys did oet it happen. Here in europe we are not tolerating prices any more. 65‚Ç¨ for daily skipass is just absurd. Period.
the US is a capitalist garbage pile that's what
Private equity ruins everything?
Publicly traded ski monoliths means that you will NEVER see affordable daily passes again. Impossible. Not as long as quarterly reports are required. Sorry
Gap between the classes is widening
Hey, French occasional snowboarder here. Just dropping to say those French stations (Chamonix, St. Moritz and Tignes) are considered really expensive by French standards. Pyr√©n√©es for life. ‚úåÔ∏è
Capitalism.
Almost as if, if you let companies gouge people and create monopolies they will
My season ticket for my local amazingly large snowpark "Sugadaira" here in Japan costs less than half of a three day ticket stateside.

Japan is the place to be y'all. Just don't clog up my lifts.
End stage capitalism it is happening in literally almost every sector. The middle class is being squeezed into underclass and upper-class and the upper-class makes enough to eat the cost.

It's simple just don't be poor.
there's a lot of mountains in the southwest at least who offer great prices especially if you buy in advance. the mountains on this list are like the most boujee mountains in the US
European ski vacation looking pretty good.
Lived and worked in Vail for 12 years. I just left because the pricing to live there is just mind-blowing. I worked my ass off, and at times, had 3 jobs. I was a GM of a starbucks in vail and got paid $35k/year. That legit only paid for my rent, nothing else. I also averaged 55 hour weeks, so made below minimum wage. I saw the downfall of VR and their greed - I know a lot of their uppers on a first name basis, and if any of them were on fire, I'd piss on the ground next to them.
In addition to season passes (which I paid $500 for north east), US salaries are generally double of the ones in EU. At least I know for engineering.
Just left Powder Mountain in Utah, day pass is $250.
Ikon or epic pass.  Problem solved
Its interesting because all the big western Canadian resorts all charge around $100-120USD as well.(except vail owned whistler)
Presumably these cost more per customer to operate then the big busy American resorts as well.

Its an America problem. Thats what a monopoly gets you.
As soon as you can rationalize an EPIC or ICON pass to ski out west (east coaster here) the price of flights, checked luggage, a rental car, food, and lodging for a family means you are looking at $12-$15k to go on a week long trip‚Ä¶where you will actually ski like 4 of those days.
Consolidation. 

Though, we are passholders on the "Power Pass" in the southwest USA. 

We spend about $1500 for two adults' season passes, but kids ride free until they turn 13 and we get to access 8 or 10 mountains. 

Ultimately,  gas, equipment, lodging and food burn through a lot more money than our passes. If we were anywhere else in the US, we'd have an IKON or Epic pass.
Sticking to Canada Alberta BC, that conversion rate and skiable acres doesn‚Äôt sit right. I would like to try vail tho
That‚Äôs per day? Things have changed since I last went out west!!
The same thing that always happens over here - monopolization.
Dude if you think that's expensive, wait til you get a hospital bill for getting injured while snowboarding in the US.

Three major boarding injuries for me:

Concussion (wearing helmet)

Nearly broken left ankle (superbly strained ligaments)

Partial mesicus or mcl tear(self diagnosed)
EAS. Everything's A Scam.
Greed. It's called "greed"
to answer your question, yes skiing/snowboarding is a sport that is generally reserved for only the wealthy
The greed will be the death of these companies. Their market structure ensures there will be a smaller TAM if they keep this up.
Mid eighties, 10 dollar Tuesday at Steven‚Äôs pass wa.
Nobody I know pays the one day price. We commit to purchase the Epic Local pass in late spring with a US$49 deposit and pay off the $650 balance in September.  Get out 10 times and it is about $70 per day. And also get 10 buddy passes for a friend to use at $69 per ticket. Skip the US Holidays - it‚Äôs too crowded to be enjoyable anyway. Don‚Äôt have 10 days in your holiday? Commit early and purchase a 5-day pass for about the same per-day price.
Lol I have how afton alps is kinda thrown in there and if you haven‚Äôt been there ur kinda like huh that‚Äôs weird; but for those who grew up in the twin cities it‚Äôs by far the most outrageous price on that list. Was 25$ for a lift ticket when I was a kid in like ~2007. I‚Äôd say that was about worth it.
All the millenials that moved west a few years ago are hitting their 30s and have dual income with no kids. I feel like so many popular hobbies for that age group have seen prices skyrocket recently. People pay it, so the price hikes continue.
Unpopular answer: there are lots and lots of high earners in the US that will pay those prices.

Italy GDP per capita: $35,600 (2021)

USA GDP per capita: $70,250 (2021)
Well US salaries are double/triple European salaries typically
We live in a business not a country.
Y‚Äôall are starting to annoy me. These mountains are for pass holders. If you‚Äôre just there for a week a year bring your checkbook. If you‚Äôre traveling across the country to slide on snow it‚Äôs gonna be pricey bucko. 

I have two passes, oh the horror. It costs me 3,000 a year. I watch everyone else spend their money on the most sad pathetic shit. If you don‚Äôt like the prices maybe you‚Äôre spending too much on other shit or are not as big into skiing as you thought. 

The value is there, the amount of skiing I get and the quality skiing I get compared to the other ‚Äú cheaper‚Äù resorts is laughable. 

I would never waste a winter at some slow lift, small terrain, cheap mountain. I‚Äôd pay 6,000 a year on passes if they gave me double the terrain and faster lifts. The people that pay these prices WANT TO SKI. The people that bitch about them have other priories. 

By the way I‚Äôm a tile installer in the northwest so not exactly rich‚Ä¶ lol
I don‚Äôt ski anymore because I can‚Äôt afford a $5k+ ski trip. Lift tickets are just the beginning, add on overpriced food and lodging too.
I just got back from Aruba last night.  The pricing in the US is fucking HORRIFIC
Capitalism.  We got to keep the poors off the mountain.
I‚Äôm a Michigander and I‚Äôm alway at crystal mountain I get a season pass for 195$ or it‚Äôs like 30 for a all day lift ticket.
They are killing a whole new generation of ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù skiers. That‚Äôs what they are doing.
Keeps the poors off their mountain
America is quite literally the embodiment of everything it was created to avoid.
Come to Taos
Those 80s movies about the big corporation taking over the mountain and turning into a yuppie resort were on the nose lol. It‚Äôs fucking insane. I haven‚Äôt been snowboarding since before covid.
Hello from r/all!

I live a few hours from the nearest ski resort and when I was in HS I would take day/weekend trips with my dad to ski 2-3 times per year. Those are cherished memories. 

Now I‚Äôm in my 30s and I won‚Äôt be able to afford that experience for my future children. They probably just won‚Äôt ever ski or snowboard and I may never either.
capitalism.  ripping off dumb rich people...and dumb poor people.  pretty much ripping anyone off it can.
About ten years ago I could go snowboard 30 min away from my house for $50. Now the same resort cost $150-$200 depending on the day and you have to order your tickets online. Haven‚Äôt been in 5 years because of this
There are cheaper options. A small mountain near me is like $100.
Season passes vs day tickets
Oh my god, I remember thinking that Big Sky was expensive when I was growing up in Bozeman, but that was when tickets were $80 for a day. 

This is obscene!
Yep, we‚Äôre getting gouged on everything.
Afton Alps is not worth $99. It was $33 before Vail bought it.
Do you have any idea how many more people are in the US? And it seems like In the last 10 years every single fucking one picked up skiing. Ski resorts want you buying season passes, and, believe it or not, they want to keep people off the slopes, obviously profit is a factor but I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve been skiing on a holiday weekend in the last few years but it‚Äôs an absolute nightmare compared to how it was maybe a decade ago. It‚Äôs 300$ for a lift ticket but 1500 for a season pass, I go 5 times and I got my moneys worth, I go 7 times it‚Äôs suddenly cheaper, I go 12 times and it was a good deal, and that high ticket price keeps John/Jane doe and their brood of 6 off the slopes. Sure it‚Äôs about profit as well but snow sports got so popular  and those slopes are only so big‚Ä¶..
Indypass baby. Fuck the majors
It's called a monopoly or near-monopolies

They can set the price to whatever they want because you have no other options left.

Welcome to late stage capitalism
Aren‚Äôt monopoly‚Äôs illegal? Dude fuck this shit we all need to stand against this shit.  They only own the lifts. Start hiking that shit y‚Äôall. Fuck the BS
I'm a Midwesterner who likes going out west to ski and snowboard. I've been to Colorado maybe 15 times or so. We used to do this deal where we would buy a coupon on eBay for like $10 and then be able to get lift tickets at Winter Park, Copper Mountain, Breckenridge, and sometimes Keystone for stupid low prices. We did it every year for a while and we all caravaned out there it was a blast. 

I went to Winter Park two years ago and two days was like $600, I think actually more than that, I remember being blown away and shocked by how much tax and fees made it even more more than it seemed it would be even with the enormous price increase. I remember going down the mountain thinking to myself, this is fun but not worth it. Snowboarding and skiing in Colorado is a terrible value. I don't have much desire to go when I see how much it will cost, I'd rather do other things for that amount of money at this point. 

Also, if it always snowed in Colorado it would still be a terrible value. But now, Colorado is not even close to being reliable from a snow standpoint. You can't do any pre-planning if you're going to travel to go snowboarding in Colorado, otherwise you might be out $2-4k with a 30in base and snowboarding over rocks and dirt. Its happened to me multiple times, and now I've soured on the whole thing.
Only wealthy people enjoy winter sports
Nobody has restricted profit taking of corporations and the consolidation of companies into monopolies. 

In the US we have Vail resorts literally sucking the money out of ski towns and resulting in residents being driven to lower cost areas commuting to work over icy mountain roads because wages don‚Äôt allow employees to live in the towns they work.
Honestly you just need to buy a pass and go 6ish times over a year and the prices come down significantly. People are being disingenuous about the day passes here. Yes those are a bad deal, but every mountain is packed already and if they made it cheaper it would be even worse. 

It‚Äôs only my second year, but I bought a limited Ikon pass for $800 and I‚Äôll get to go skiing 10 times at mountains close to me and possibly more if I travel a bit. 

They even let you pay over time without interest for the tickets.
In the US skiing is a rich person sport and priced accordingly.
The fact that Afton alps kids on a list with big sky, steamboat and Vail is blowing my mind. Like‚Ä¶ do people not from Minnesota know afton ?
We keep asking our leaders the same question and they keep telling us everything is great.
I mean it‚Äôs murica. I‚Äôm above the average median of income and I can barely afford to eat and afford a 1 bedroom apartment!
I sold a kidney in Mexico. Turns out, our Fed tracks inflation data on blood tissue organs and I could get a great deal on my body parts.
monopolistic capitalisms. 

You should see our utility bills lol
Alpine stuff is seen as a wealthy person's endeavor in the US.
Greed
For my fellow Minnesotan‚Äôs, Afton is on here because it owned by the same company as the mountains. Also, we travel for snow quite a bit and Afton is the entry drug to selling us that season pass. It‚Äôs all about the season passes. $$$$$
I was just in Zermatt and a local was telling me Zermatt was expensive... He was flabbergasted what I told him about Park City, Steamboat, etc. Between rentals and passes, Europe is CHEAP.
Private equity cunts are the worst. They are slowly trying to do this to places in Japan. Fuck them so much.
gotta keep the poors out. The divide in our country continues to grow. As the gap between the have and have nots continues to grow, hobbies such as this will become unattainable for working class citizens.
And that‚Äôs the more expensive places in Europe! Had a blast last year. All the Europeans asked me why o was skiing over there and I said because it‚Äôs cheaper for me to fly here and ski for a week+ than 3 days without accommodation in the states
Capitalism‚Ä¶ why are there still people who question the state of affairs today. We‚Äôre doomed unless‚Ä¶ you know
we cannot afford it. prices have absolutely exploded in the past 8 years and it‚Äôs heartbreaking. i can no longer afford to ride the mountains i grew up enjoying
There are still small independent mountains around and when people start to fight back and support the little guys it MAY help
Same thing that happens to every awesome thing in the USA. Some old white dude with deep pockets decides that they need to grow their net worth from 500 Million to 1 Billion, and price gouge the shit out of the average person to make that happen.
If you‚Äôre planning to go to the ‚Äúmain‚Äù places, you gotta get that epic or ikon passes early.   I don‚Äôt mean to be promoting those companies and their passes, but if you show up to one of these places and want to purchase a lift ticket at the window that day, they will do ya dirty in the wallet
I can barely afford it.  It‚Äôs why I usually only ski 2 days a year.   OR i go to a mom & pop mountain.  Much cheaper, no crowds, and the skiing is just as good.  There just aren‚Äôt as many runs & they‚Äôre harder to get to.
What's even more depressing with the price differences is that you can get Europe lift ticket prices get even cheaper 

For [Arlberg](https://www.skiarlberg.at/en/Ski-Arlberg/Ski-tickets/Skipass-prices):

*  a 7-day pass goes down to  ‚Ç¨64/day, 14-day pass is  ‚Ç¨51/day
* you can get half-day tickets (after 12) for ‚Ç¨57, and afternoon tickets for ‚Ç¨34.
* You can get these tickets at anytime. No need to book ahead.

For [Vail](https://www.vail.com/plan-your-trip/lift-access/tickets.aspx)

* 7-day pass is a low low price of $279/day
* No 8+ day passes. 
* No half-day tickets
* You can get an Epic pass, but need to lock that in earlier in the season.
It‚Äôs basically a season pass monopoly owned by two companies that control all the major mountains in the US. Last winter, we were able to fly out to Geneva and travel to Chamonix from the east coast and ski there for four days and it was cheaper than going out west to ski.
We live in the greediest nation fr
This is why I'm selling my house in Aspen, the tickets are too high and I don't want the assholes at Ikon jerking off to my photo in their cushy office.
The plague that is infecting all ends of the earth at our expense
just become a lifty like me, get paid to snowboard and free passes/demos all season
There's two types of skiers/snowboarders. The rich and the ones selling their overpriced apreais ski drinks for tips, maybe pocketing a little extra and possibly selling ski enhancing herbs to fellow ski peasants. ( this worked for free passes for all of montana and Wyoming, including Jackson's Hole which by now I imagine is exclusively trillionares and powerful influencers)
They‚Äôve started creeping into Canada now too and it fucking sucks
And when they have shareholders to increase profit for yearly aka vail resorts
This is a massive part of it.

An uncomfortable truth is that simple supply/demand plays a huge role too.  If $200 lift tickets to Breck (a few years ago, ie) still does not prevent 25+ minute lift lines at base, then all the incentive in the world goes to price increase.
Ironically, snowboarding is SUPER affordable when you‚Äôre going 50 days a year. On a normal ikon pass at $830 it comes out to $17 a day. If you only go 20 days it‚Äôs $41 a day.

Most people that say it‚Äôs expensive treat skiing or snowboarding like an experience, not a hobby. So yes, to go skiing two days with a family of four is expensive af relative to those two days. 

To ski / ride for a season as an individual is relatively less expensive compared to Europe, if you‚Äôre going 20+ days.
There's a slope in SoCal that is supposed to be some of the best skiing in the west. It's run but the California Forestry department so it's rather cheap as well. The issue is that it's on the south face of the mountain range and it rarely gets enough snow to open/operate.
^^^
To begin, I hate Vale. But if a mountain is owned by one company and they have a bad season, they‚Äôre completely fucked. To make this actually profitable in the long run you have to buy out mountains in different areas so the ones with good snowfall will negate the ones with poor snowfall. This will (hopefully) allow improvements and more funding into making mountains better aka more fast lifts, assuming they don‚Äôt pocket everything.
Yup epic owns Wilmont. A small ass bill in northern Illinois/Wisconsin it was 80 for a day pass.  It‚Äôs a place I used to pay $30 for. Absolutely insane
Ahh, that's this "free market" where competition between companies keeps prices low for customers, right?
So ticketmaster.com?
For people like me who only live within 2 hours of several mountains and go every weekend, a season pass pays for itself within a few weeks. 

But my mom and gf want to try out skiing and it‚Äôll be over $600 for each of them ($300 lift ticket, $100 board and boots rental, $200+ gear) just to try it out for a day. That‚Äôs steep.
Which sucks when you‚Äôre a two day drive from any resort worth a season ticket
Yeppers. So you‚Äôre sure to come by more often, buy lunch in their chalet, sunscreen and chapstick from their gift shop, etc, etc.
Yeah, and then they charge $20 a day to park anyway, pass or no.
And now they‚Äôre moving to making you buy packages, not unlimited season passes. They need to increase profit year over year forever to satisfy shareholders. It‚Äôs the American way.
How much are season passes?
So do resorts in Europe. But even switzerland (my home) wouldn‚Äôt dare charge so much for day passes. It just prevents lower/middle income families and children from enjoying the mountains and sport.
they want to make as much money off the weather while it‚Äôs still cold. It‚Äôs a race against climate change to make money
Literally this. They can‚Äôt rely on day sales because every year has been so unpredictable for the past decade or so. Because of this, they need their money up front before the seasons starts, especially if it‚Äôs a bad snow year
Alpine Valley in Wisconsin is $90 for a full day pass. They provide us the best mountain biking in the area for dirt cheap prices, and maybe that is why. But those lift tickets price me out of wanting to snowboard there.
I actually wondered if was the same Afton Alps. Because who pays $99 to ski a three story hill right?
I came here to also comment this is just a big hill. I will just go to Wild or Troll instead.
Yeah it should legit be $40
Bruh I rode afton alps when i was a kid, you probably instructed me at one point.
Hello fellow Afton instructor! I was a blue coat in 2010. Although I essentially did it for the free season pass. That being said, I wouldn't even consider AA a hill. It's a valley. Lift tickets were 28 dollars for a full day pass and we thought THAT was expensive back then
Holy shit I saw Afton on this list and thought it couldn't possibly be the same one I remember... Used to live in AV so I would get a season pass for under $200 I think and just kept my board in the car and would go every day after school. It was awesome. It was nice to have so close, but yeah, it was just a big hill. Runs take like 30 seconds. No way Id pay $100 for a pass today.
Growing up I went there all the time. I remember when they raised their prices to $34.99. That was a big deal.  $99 is stupid.
It‚Äôs a big ditch you ski into
I said the same thing. Place is horrible skiing.
Was literally going to post the exact same thing (except the teaching part) - It‚Äôs fun for the region but $100???
Afton is so different now, it‚Äôs so much snobbier and $99 to go down a hill in 10 seconds isn‚Äôt worth it. We just take our kids to troll now
Like 10 years ago afton was like 45-55 for a day pass. Then vail resorts showed up and the price immediately went to 85 and you also have to pay extra if it‚Äôs your first time for their little scanny scan fucky fuck card so they can barcode you at every lift. Stopped going after that. Lift lines got longer too. Fuck that shit
Showshoe's about the best you'll find on the east coast, and their passes range from $90 to $200 depending on the day.
I had to Google to make sure there wasn't another Afton Alps somewhere...

That price is nuts. 

It's definitely just a large hill.
and hyland is still like $40 for a full day pass
Lol. Powder Ridge in Kimball would like a word.
I hate that I work for vail. Such a bitch of a company. And their HR is absolutely atrocious. I have zero good things to say about vail HR.
But nobody blames the owners of the mountains who sold out to be on Ikon or Epic
This is the right answer.

Over 14 million households in the US have an household income of over $200k.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/183807/number-of-households-by-household-income-2009/

I spent a few minutes googling to see what the number in Europe would be and failed to find anything, but I'm sure it's much, much less than that.
Seriously. You ever been to Vail? I went, once, and it was filled with a exotic cars, spoiled children, rude customers, and the highest amount of 20-30 something smoke show women married to guys in their 50-60‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever seen. 

Best part? When one of the women waited for her husband to hit the pisser, then asked what I was doing after he went to bed. 

Crazy place.
"If you can't afford a hotel room for 1,000 a night you don't deserve Vail" - Vail management probably
And it's not JUST the mountains,  either! Afton Alps is my home hill (Minnesota) and I had no idea it was even on the radar or why it was of any interest to Epic. Seeing it on this list is just bizarre to me,  given it's about 400 ft tall and not even the tallest ski hill we have in the state.  Its park is what maybe differentiates it from other midwest ski areas, but it's otherwise unremarkable when compared to other hills. 

I'm sure it was a great investment but Holy hell would this poor European be pissed if he made the trip here by mistake lmao.
That would be a duopoly
Hard to call it price gouging when the resorts are packed.¬†
>the government division responsible for stopping monopolies and protecting consumers from price gouging isn't doing fuck all to stop them.

In fact, the government division responsible for stopping monopolies is doing everything they can to pave the way for the monopoly, like they have done with so many other industries.
That's like pluralizing the Lone Ranger.
Squaw valley, jackson hole, park city, in the mid 2000s was like $1,800/yr for a season pass. ¬†Full Ikon with no blackouts is $1,100. ¬†Its more affordable at a shit load of resorts and its not even close. ¬†
This is the correct answer.
It's not price gouging if the ski areas continue selling lots of tickets, it's proper market pricing
Don't worry, I'm sure the free market economy will correct itself and there will be loads of competition that will drive the prices down! I'm sure they can just make new mountains.
this is an issue in the US in general rn.
I feel like conservative judges would block any attempt to reign in these companies.
[deleted]
I think this is a bigger contributor than we're giving it credit for. Profits must keep rising as Altera and Vail are both publicly traded.
Missing the epic pass deadline last season got me into splitboardingü§ôüèº

Isn‚Äôt Jackson like the most expensive place to live in the US
If you live in Jackson that makes perfect sense. If you live in Kansas City not so much
Shit situation but a potential hack is to look at the Australian Epic pass A$1000 (US$670), which provides access to all Vail resorts with varying degrees of restrictions.

It could be a way to find a happy medium between the two.
Oh yeah & don't forget the 30USD for parking that you surely won't know about until you get there because no where on any of their websites does it tell you that. It's an amusement park money trap now basically.
What I don‚Äôt understand is why/how it‚Äôs still so crowded though. Are there just that many pass holders or people willing to pay so much for a day pass? If so there‚Äôs clearly a supply and demand problem here. It kind of reminds me of concert tickets or camping prices: they‚Äôve been kept artificially low for decades and now there are so many people trying to buy them the market is completely skewed.¬†
Ah but the tow rope has seen their neighbors charging $300 and that $15 has gone to $120
Bohemia season pass is $99 and gets you partner resort benefits all over!
Worse still, you‚Äôd think an employee 50% off a full day comp would be 100% off a half day. Nope. 

Like, guys, the money isn‚Äôt in the lifts; it‚Äôs in the hotels and gear stores and on mountain F&B. Y‚Äôall should be giving away lift tickets to charge for nachos and beer.
The local Michigan towrope at bittersweet or boynes is $70, goodluck
Our dinky east coast mountain costs like $80 for a 4 hour pass. You get maybe 2 minutes of riding from top to bottom before you're back on the lift. No longer worth the hour drive. Used to be like $35
Where do you get a ‚Ç¨400 ski trip for 10 days including bus, apartment & ski pass? That has to be eastern Europe, right?


Edit: People can stop commenting with busless trips, trips of ‚Ç¨600 or over or 6 skiing days - that's not the kind of trip I am commenting on...
I mean maybe 5 days... but that is still extremely expensive
Thumbs up to the smaller resorts. I usually go up to Brian Head Resort in Utah. It's like 50-70 for a lift ticket with 25 night skiing on Fridays and Saturdays.
Yeah 299$ wil get you a full week pass in most European resorts
^ this.  Drive an hour south of Colorado border into Northern New Mexico and you‚Äôll find the same conditions, similar slopes and resorts for a fraction of the price.  An entire weekend at Ski Santa Fe is $105 for an adult.  

The cost of skiing in Colorado is stupid.  Go to New Mexico instead.  Weed is legal here, too.
I would love to come there! It's just the ‚Ç¨600 flight that is preventing that...

Honestly it looks beautiful, if you're used to snowboarding there how much do you pay for a daily ski pass?
Spent 6500 yen, ~40USD at Zao yesterday for some the best powder and miles of slopes.
But alas, none of the apres
They say the cable grease alone claims the lives of 200 sperm whales a day.
You can still buy relatively affordable passes to individual mountains, especially if you buy in the spring for the following year. The prices steadily increase as the season gets closer, and people who don‚Äôt plan end up paying more.

Ans there are tons of cheaper options at smaller resorts that aren‚Äôt affiliate with the two bit conglomerates.
Annnnnnddd that‚Äôs why mountains suck now
I don‚Äôt. ¬†Some of us just have cheaper passes to one local resort
More and more people are buying epic so they are gonna offset it by charging the tourists even more.
Like $900-$1400 for Ikon or Epic
Season passes in Austria are ostly either for a specific resort or a skiing region.
For example the Superski Card costs 960‚Ç¨ pre season and covers 87 mountains all over Austria and Bavaria and due to glaciers there is always snow guaranteed to be somewhere.
Mt Bachelor $1,545
As much as I hate the whole Epic/Ikon duopoly situation, I still can't get over the amount of people who STILL show up and ski/ride for the prices. I am the asshole who loves to talk to/meet people on lift rides and it feels like at least half of them are day pass holders, rented at the resort, and will eat/stay there. So unfortunately it is the free market, and the free market is broken as fuck.
Late stage capitalism bout to kick everyone in the nuts over the next couple decades
I‚Äôve never understood this argument in this context, free markets apply for goods and services provided you produce, but does it count for tourism? Tourism didn‚Äôt exist in Adam Smith‚Äôs day to the extent that it exists now and I think it‚Äôs insane that locals have to pay anywhere close to people from out of town. Absolutely insane. 

Singapore does this well: you pay almost 10x for everything if you‚Äôre a tourist. Not food, but tourist things.
In this case I'd argue it's actually so expensive because the free market isn't being allowed to work: it's almost impossible to build new ski resorts, or to expand existing ski resorts, due to most of our mountains being on public land with heavy restrictions on development.


Of course, our mountains being on protected land has a bunch of advantages, in that they're not over-developed like Europe's, but it does restrict the free market from keeping prices competitive.
Exactly! And the mountains are so shit in comparison lol
Cheapest? There are plenty of sports that are completely free, so not sure about that. Surfing for example, once you get your board.
[deleted]
Lol no it won't. But I'll have your back because vail can go fuck itself. 

And since I didn't specifically, the town royally sucks ass as well. Killer mountain tho.
>Everyone talking about a monopoly but no one is shaming them. Would be super easy for the snowboard community to shame vails parent company

Lmfao you do realize that the only way to "shame" Vail is to literally stop snowboarding at their (and Ikon's) resorts, right?

You must be out of your mind if you think that's something people have enough self-control to do.
$900 for the epic pass.¬†
Zermatt is awesome and imo worth every penny. It's not like skiing at a US or Canadian resort. The lifts go into a village. By lifts I mean a train, a funicular and a gondola that all take you up to the trailers.  Not a master planned village entirely owned by the resort. Like a real village. The ski shops you can rent from all seem to be independently owned and operated. Same with all the restaurants and hotels, in the village and slope side. It's a whole different world. Also it's massive.

FYI if you plan to ski to the Italian side make sure you check on the requirements. We had to pay a $10 upgrade to our passes and were told to bring our passports. And if you are going to do it get on the gondola to the top EARLY. It is the longest gondola ride I've ever done (5 stops total. Bottom, 3 in the middle and one at the top) then a tram ride to the peak. Then a long ski down.
This is going to hurt the Utah economy in the long run because locals already live here and they will be the only ones riding.
Most people would rather pay for all the nice infrastructure and cozy interiors and gimmicks at places like vail, than the concrete minimalist cafeterias and commons areas of local ski hills. It‚Äôs just the truth, and this is coming from someone that almost exclusively vacations at smaller independents.¬†
Those are also among the most expensive resorts in the Alps.
Damn. 8 years ago that was $60 online for the day
If you can call a duopoly ‚Äúproblem solved‚Äù then sure‚Ä¶
yup. to be fair, this is largely the most expensive hobby/recreation out there. Also, yeah, we‚Äôve let just about every industry and sector of the coming basically get monopolized. Not sustainable
Yeah Zermatt is a high class resort in Europe
RIP Whistler
Oh man that explains it. mannnn Canada is way too close the States. We should move
There's a t bar hill not far from where I live that charged 60. It's 180m of elevation
$166 Red Resort
But capitalism makes everything best for everyone or something. Are you telling me this isn't unquestionably true?
That's the crazy thing about Vail Corp they've basically been a monopoly for years if not decades but no one can be fucked to look into it because it's not that "important" of an industry. If skiing and snowboarding were as vital to everyday life as internet browsers Vail would've been broken up ages ago. 

That said, I have looked at Vail Corp financials and snow sports industry as a whole is really dependent on weather. Short winters mean bad news for not just resorts, but all your favorite brands and services that go hand-in-hand. As winter seasons grow shorter each year, these companies often see massive losses because operating costs for a ski resort are VERY high. This is largely the driver for price increases.
Fuck vail and their greed. I'm only hitting non conglomerate mountains this year.
This is my biggest concern. Prices are astronomical but lift lines are packed all the time. Prices will continue to creep and the sport will slowly become less and less accessible unfortunately. I grew up on the slopes as a fun weekend family outing, and now as a married man with two young boys we cannot really afford 4x lift tickets + park pass + fuel to get to to the resorts and that‚Äôs even if you pack lunch.
[deleted]
This is, unfortunately, the result of income inequality, and it increasingly affects everything.

If 30 million people in the US can easily afford to pay $300, then it makes no sense to price it at $100. You will always have your capacity bought at the higher price.

If you want to start a business, you will be told by all the experts that you shouldn't compete on price -- compete on quality. ¬†It's repeated so often it's just "the truth" now. ¬†The reason is you'll sell everything you can produce to rich people who are price insensitive. ¬†No businesses are being started to bring goods or services to the poor or middle class. ¬†No competitor is coming in to drive prices down.

As long as there is essentially infinite money in the top 10% and much less in the bottom 90%, everyone acting in their own best interests will continue to make this worse.

I don't see this improving without government massively incentivizing low prices somehow.
So I've snowboarded all over Europe and America, and I gotta say the European mountain experience clobbered the American experience.

Park City has ***nothing*** on the Italian Dolomites.  At a peak of Park City you can spend like 28$ and get a decent lunch and a beer.  In the Dolomites you get a gourmet meal and the dankest beer ever and it's probably 20$.  Same holds for France but even better.

In America you pay luxury prices for reasonable accommodations and access.  In Europe you pay reasonable prices for luxury accommodations and access.
Cries in Australian.
Who the hell has time to board a fifty day year?????
Problem is not everyone lives near a mountain so it‚Äôs made it really hard for those who only ski / board a week or two a year.
For context in the european comparison, the tirol snowcard which is the season pass for basically most of austrias ski areas is 1050 euros this season. Thats the only really large multi-resort pass in europe that exists i believe (unless the italians have one too), but it also gives glacier access from october until may
I mean $830 isnt super affordable for most people plus having the amount of time/days to get the cost per day super low
I can't tell if you're saying this as a way to claim that people are complaining for no reason and should just ski 50 times a year. Cause yeah, what you said makes sense, but you have to know that like 95% of people can't make a schedule like that work, whether it be because they live too far from a mountain to go out every day, they don't have $800 upfront, they have family to deal with, or just because they're beginners, and signing up for an $800 commitment for a brand new hobby is insane.

I used to ski when I was younger and I am looking to get back into it, but between rentals, lift tickets, and potentially having to take PTO, it's pretty unfeasible to try and fit in more than one or two trips a year
How can it be some of the best skiing in the west if it doesn't get snow?
Mt Baldy. If you get it after a huge storm, while it's still cold, it is incredible. Those conditions occur for maybe 1-2 days every 5 years. I've been there twice. The first time was insane, 3+ feet of fresh powder, clear skies, and nobody there because it was a Tuesday. The second time I tried, I missed it by a day. It was already too warm and it was all slush and ice.
lol I was researching this resort last year! I can‚Äôt remember its name. But it didn‚Äôt even open last year with record snow :(. A small family owned mountain. I don‚Äôt think it has operated in like 5+ years.
Lol no they just do dumb shit with their money like here in the Midwest running high speed chairs for no fucking reason when using a fixed lift would be 2x faster and cost half the money to install...

Mother nature is a bitch and making snow is expensive (permits, water rights) ECT..

Unless your buying a pass and going 20+ days it's just a rich person sport. Hell you can pay 1200 for a season pass to a single mountain (hill) in the Midwest. 200 doesn't sound bad for a mountain in the Rockies...

Fuck Vail though worked out by Breckenridge years ago on a construction crew and all the locals fucking hate Vail all the old timers said back in the day all the small mountains where the shit until Vail came.
These resorts are going to have a terrible time in 10-20yrs when they have half the people riding because at this point they are driving newcomers away with these prices
Yea this is where it really sucks. As a dude who never grew up doing these things and really wants to encourage my friends and family, all of whom don‚Äôt know shit about skiing or snowboarding, these day pass shenanigans make it really difficult. 

Even the Epic ‚ÄúSki with a Buddy‚Äù passes hardly put a dent in it at all. I think you can save $30 off of a $230 pass. Like wtf

More people on the mountain really sucks, but I fell in love with this sport and it‚Äôs damn near impossible to share it with the one or two people who I‚Äôd know would enjoy it, and would make it 1,000 better for me to enjoy. Going alone is fun, going with my gf and my brother would truly be epic
It's 100$ for one day board rental? That's insane! That's 3 times what you pay for one day in the Alps...
If they‚Äôre just trying it out there‚Äôs no reason to bring them to somewhere like Vail.
They also want to make you think your pass pays for itself in just a few weeks‚Ä¶or days. And they get you in that mindset with $300 day tickets.
A few weeks? Its like 400 dollars a day at whistler. You cover the cost of a season pass in three days.
And you really don‚Äôt start enjoying it until your 5th or 6th trip. That‚Äôs when you finally start getting the hang of it
It‚Äôs not a perfect solution but epic day passes are literally $65 a day.
Some resorts have deals on lesson packages that make it much cheaper
Damn, could bring everyone skydiving for that much.
how are people still getting into this hobby at these prices. I'd try almost nothing if it cost me 600$ and I'm not even sure I'd like it.
I haven't done stuff like this since I was a kid, but you better believe I'd be finding a way to counterfeit a pass/sneak in/etc etc etc.  Those prices are downright criminal.
It's why I don't even bother to learn - it's such an expensive hobby and I honestly would rather save my money.  

Which sucks b/c it looks so fun.
Or im packing lunch and not buying anything from their giftshop.
My personally I make sure to specifically go out of my way to not give them a single dime on their ridiculously priced food & stuff in there shops, unless it's an emergency or some type of dire need. I already gave you guys my money for my pass, I'm packing snacks and bringing my own water. We're having lunch in town.
$900 for epic pass
That's such a rip, Alpine should be half that.
Alpine valley blows. Only reason to go there over something like devils head or Tyrol was the price. At 100 I‚Äôd rather go to cascade.
You have the most Wisconsin user name
Buck hill is $59 on the weekend
Even Welch Village went nuts this year - $85 for a day
I love the atmosphere of troll, way more fun than Afton
It‚Äôs part of the Alps, bro.  Look at the name.

I hope so! I absolutely loved teaching it. My favorite student was a 65 year old retired guy who just wanted to try it out. He showed up in full hockey gear.
For the cost of 8 passes, I got my entire family season passes at troll, and it's so much better. Friendly, accessible, and every lift runs when it's busy.
And it‚Äôs rare you see all the lifts running on any given day due to staffing. $100 a day for a lift ticket and they barely pay minimum wage to work there. I have a friend that works at another MN ski hill and they used to like it because it came with a pass to use on your off day, but lately they‚Äôve been so short staffed that he rarely gets an off day.
I haven't heard anyone say anything good about vail ever lol.
Be careful posting this, your boss can identify you by your Reddit user name
The Sacklers did nothing wrong!
they sold out before the real price hikes in my opinion. once i saw that Alterra(ikon) was being run by the guy who used to run ticketmaster, it all made perfect sense. the mentality seems to be- price gauge the people. they will bitch, but they will pay. they are addicted and have no other option, take their fucking money.
Anti-trust. If it‚Äôs good enough for Microsoft it‚Äôs good enough for Epic/Ikon. Oh wait, that‚Äôs communism.
Afton was bought by the same monopoly that owns Vail a few years ago, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs on the list
MN crew here. Was also very confused by a list of legitimate mountains in the Rockies, and then the inclusion of a small hill a thousand miles away from the rest, that wouldn't pass for a foothill in the Rockies. Don't get me wrong, I love ripping those 1-2 minute runs over and over, but it's a big bunny hill, and it's hilarious it's on this list.¬†
It‚Äôs a smart business play on Vail‚Äôs part. There is lots of money in the Twin Cities, and lots of people who travel to ski and snowboard. Having a local watering hole included in the pass makes it more tolerable to buy the pass. You can use the pass at home and while traveling.

Still a shitty monopoly, but I can understand the business decision to buy Afton.
Yup. My childhood hill ‚Äî not even a proper mountain ‚Äî was Seven Springs in southwest Pennsylvania. That whole area is now operated by Epic/Vail.
Right. But same effect for consumers and should not be allowed. 2 companies price fixing.... Fucking sucks!!!
Right? That's the problem. They raise prices and there's still a 20 min lift lines. Of course they raise the prices when that happens.

It‚Äôs definitely up there. 

You see a lot of vans. People that work at the shops and hotels are so many levels below the people that have a vacation home there. 

I remember visiting one year as a kid, the homes then were 2-3 million. Which idk 6-10 million now? It is unreal.
Rich people love rustic cosplay.
Yes, and it has only gotten higher and crazy, It's not uncommon to have roommates and lots of people who work in Jackson have to live in close by towns, even across the Teton path which is a challenge in winter when there is heavy snow.
Yup it‚Äôs a struggle for working class people like me. I‚Äôm not one of the rich ones üôÉ the mountains here are just highly addictive.
Jackson puts a Hole in that pocket and account.
If you really wanna learn about Teton County, give Billionaire Wilderness a read. Pretty wild. I live in WY, but rarely get over to that part of the state. It's expensive enough where I am at lol.
Luckily I already get mine discounted so it makes it worth it for me personally, but yeah that's a good thing to know about the Aussie one. I wonder if it would be possible to buy that version while being US based still? I'd imagine there's gotta be a way if it's the same company.
[deleted]
Well you need the $109 pass for Saturdays and then fees put it over $160.  It's still a bargain but  I think we can retire the "$99 season pass" wording.
>Like, guys, the money isn‚Äôt in the lifts; it‚Äôs in the hotels and gear stores and on mountain F&B. Y‚Äôall should be giving away lift tickets to charge for nachos and beer.

Why not both?
The problem with east coast is that it is pretty expensive to make all the snow because are winters are basically no existent now too. I agree it‚Äôs not worth it but I don‚Äôt know what the answer is either.
Showshoe is as low as $90, depending on the day, and you get more than 2 minutes.
Val Cenis France, you can book early bird ski pass
My appartment + skipass was less than 600 euros during X mas this year. Ok, I had to buy my own food and we had to take the car to France, which is kinda expensive as well (14 hour drive)
I think he meant that for about $4000 you could pay for a full trip including all costs except maybe airfare or just 10 - 1 day lift tickets at $299 each, but no one would do that because they can either buy an Ikon or Epic pass for $1000-$1400
[deleted]
I never made it to Brian Head.  Maybe next year I'll take a trip.  My dad used to talk about how it was his fav. place to ski back in the day (other than Big Bear on Thanksgiving and Xmas Day).

I did snowboard at Brighton a couple of times in the early 2000's and absolutely loved it every time.
70 usd is not that far from some of the best resorts in the Euro alpsüò¨
Luckily ikon has two resorts on the pass. Niseko and lotte arai.

But local resorts are way less crowded and you can get lift tickets for like $40-$70 daily. Amazing variety of authentic delicious Japanese meals for $10 on mountain. Beer for $5. Whiskey soda in a can for $3. America is like $15 for a beer and $20 for chicken tenders and fries. 

Ya flight to Japan can be expensive, but many Americans will pay similar prices to fly to Colorado. I truly believe it is cheaper to fly to Europe or Japan to ski than it is to fly to aspen or vail (when all costs are included). You pay more for flight to go to Europe or Japan but everything else once you're there is much cheaper. 

Plus the lift lines in America are insane which tells u how many ppl actually buy season passes. When im in Japan i never wait more than 5 mins in a line lol and usually it's 0 mins. And fresh pow tracks the entire day and it snows every day for two months (but their season is short).

Only good thing is I live in California and mammoth has the longest season like 9 months last year which was sick.
Where are you finding a flight to Japan for that cheap? Europeans have it the best man. A flight to Japan from anywhere in the US these days is at least $1200
That‚Äôs just ridiculously untrue. Everyone knows the industry switched from whale oil to beef tallow in the 70‚Äôs.
Weird thing is, ikon is cheaper than my local resorts (Utah)
I spent around ‚Ç¨900 for a season pass here in Europe.
my ikon base pass was like 550 with the student discount. i got 33 days in last year so it definitely pays for itself if you go a lot
Already starting to...
Still, not enough
[removed]
Local is like $675 but has a few limitations like no holidays and like 10 days max at each "major" mtn. Before end of April it includes buddy passes too. In the summer you can pre-buy day passes for $100 each too.
Both of you are spot-on and I love what both of you guys said too.
Unless you really really want whistler village just do sunpeaks or big white at this point. 120 Canadian seems pretty close to shown European prices.
EPIC pass is cheaper than a standard Whistler Blackcomb season pass, and you get access to numerous resorts across US and Canada. This is one specific instance where this kind of thing is actually a positive change.
it was a lot better when monopolies were illegal
private business capturing regulatory agencies and not enforcing antitrust and monopoly laws is not capitalism. 

We are dealing with an oligarchy, where the same group of 'share holders' now control the majority of companies in every aspect of life.
Do you even stonks bruh!? Gotta get those quarterly gains. 
 
 
Econ 101: quarterly gains means either cutting quality and or raising prices. If it happens from actual growth then the the gains will eventually come from cutting quality and or raising prices when there‚Äôs no more room to grow. Absolutely unsustainable. A living breathing ouroboros  (snake eating its tail)
But don‚Äôt you understand the free market will drive competition and give the lowest prices possibly! So clearly the tickets just cannot be cheaper or someone would open their own vail!
I believe this pushes the season pass model more. Vail barley care about these ‚Äúticket prices‚Äù because nobody is actually paying them. Everyone buys a pass and they hedge their money
It's almost like, *looks at notes*, smaller mountains that are independently owned cannot possibly exist...

Oh, wait. There is A-basin, which is still doing great. Don't get me wrong, the price of their pass HAS gone up...

I really doubt Vail Resorts is being efficient with their money. Maybe if they didn't gobble up the entire town trying to get every penny their operating costs wouldn't be astronomical... It's almost like running a ski area, and owning the whole town outside of it causes a ton of overhead...
But Europe also has to deal with the weather, that would not explain the price difference.

&#x200B;

Maybe Europe handles it differently, and not spending a ton of money to keep everything open. But thats just a guess, never been to any wintersport.
Going to miss all the great mountains doing that. Vail and Alterra own pretty much all of them.
Buy an epic pass and you‚Äôll save money.  It‚Äôs not to hard to understand
Ugh. I‚Äôd love to do that. I live in Utah and pretty much all of our resorts are either epic or alterra. I buy a snowbird pass rather than the ikon and don‚Äôt get the ikon add on as a way of pretending like I‚Äôm making a statement but it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Make the small mountains great again! But really, i just went to opening day at a smallish local mountain today, 1/5 the price of a Vail resort and I didn‚Äôt have to wait a second for a chair the whole day
The monetization of parking makes me so angry.
Nah fuck that. The western US has an incredible amount of preserved nature, and it should stay that way. Cutting down entire mountains worth of trees so rich fucks can have another groomed place to ski? You can already ski on a ton of forest service land in CO if you have the balls to skin up/hike in and are decent at skiing.
I thought a big part of it is regulations no? It's not easy opening up a new ski resort and getting approved to cut down 10s of thousands of trees in typically protected forests.

The thing is, Americans have to pay astronomical prices to *get* to Europe.  A domestic plane ticket to SLC is far cheaper than one to Rome.  So even though it‚Äôs more expensive to actually ski/snowboard in the US, it comes out cheaper in total expenditures to fly/drive to Utah, book rooms at the resort, and snowboard than it is to fly to Rome, book a resort, and ski.
The mountain experience includes the terrain and snow quality which you haven‚Äôt touched on and we both know why.
Ok but I don't go to ski resorts for the food and drinks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Vail has fucked Australian skiing. Sure, the season pass is cheaper but everything else from day passes to accommodation is through the roof everywhere.

That said, the locally owned Thredbo is no better. A "premium" product that has had one significant infrastructure spend (Merritts Gondola) in almost 30 years. What a joke.

I've all but given up. I can handle shit seasons because, Australia, but the shit sandwiches served up by the resorts here I can do without.

I bought a small studio apartment in Japan for the cost of a two week house rental at Thredbo.
Cries in Perth.
I just go to Japan or NZ now.  AU ski resorts are not worth it.
I work 4 10s and snowboard 3 days a week. 60+ days a season now, been averaging about 50/season since the late 90s. I've always lived near mountains on purpose though, I could get a 50% pay increase by moving to Ohio or Texas, but hell no.
That‚Äôs the irony of the comment. Boarding 50 times are year means you‚Äôre incredibly fortunate or you‚Äôre a dirtbag sleeping in a Corolla to get first chair.
Haha me.   

I have a professional job and my daily cost to ski whistler is about $18.
Live in a mountain town. Have a pass. Go ski for a couple hours a day when the snow is good. First tracks on a pow day, follow the sun from 10-1 or so in the springtime‚Ä¶days add up fast when you don‚Äôt need to commit to 9-4
Me. Work at a hotel near the mountain in the PM and can ride everyday. I don't get up daily but I could. If you want it you can have it, just depends on what you make a priority in life. Having the comfort of a stable 9-5 office job means giving up opportunities to do things during the day.
People who are committed enough to live close to the mountains and build their lifestyles around it. I haven‚Äôt ridden less than 50 days for over 15 years¬†
Tell that to the people filling parking lots every weekday by 8am :(
I got about 90 my last few seasons. Bartending job that started at either 4 or 6pm 3-4 days a week. Season pass was 250‚Ç¨‚Ä¶ so 2.77‚Ç¨ per day was my cost of lift access. 
Eat food at work for free for lunch and dinner. Get pissed for very cheap at work making myself really strong drinks at the end of my shift before a night club night out
I would assume they mean best skiing when it does get snow.
last year got to go up to baldy the day after the big storm ended and it was a once in a lifetime experience. never seen that much power before in my life!
You‚Äôre not even telling them how hidden and close by it is; that‚Äôs the best part
>Mt Baldy

I should call her
mt baldy wants $800 for a season pass lmao
I hit baldy last year after the 4ft dump and that first run was one of the best of my life. Utah grade blower pow. Steep terrain - first 40 riders 

Unfortunately it took them so long to open the mtn (small crew no complaints - we had a great time hanging in line) the sun cooked the snow by our second run and it became a lot less fun
Mt waterman didn‚Äôt open last year because the road washed out and cal trans was too busy trying to dig big bear out. It‚Äôs a fun hill but it‚Äôs only 1000 feet of vertical with very little parking, however if you can get there on a powder day it‚Äôs pretty amazing. Mt baldy the other hill that you may be talking about actually did open and i rode it with no less than 5 feet of powder. It took them half a day to open up but it was amazing. It was a once in a generation type of year for SoCal.

The lift comment is hilarious. I genuinely have no idea what you are trying to say. There is no world in which a fixed double is as fast much less faster than a detachable quad. I have a season pass at a local hill that only has fixed doubles and is like pulling teeth riding those lifts. It‚Äôs so much faster and a more pleasant experience on the detachable quads when I ride an Ikon resort.
I‚Äôm with you on everything except that detachable high speed chairs are absolutely worth it unless you want to spend most of your day sitting on the lift.
Empty mountains? Don‚Äôt threaten me with a good time.
They do make it super cheap and easy for kids. My three kids had free season passes and $80 a year for gear.

But if you're an adult and want to give it a try it's basically not possible.
There‚Äôs always going to be tons of people who will keep skiing/boarding, current prices are barely deterring people. Just check how insane lift lines are at the popular resorts. It‚Äôs only gotten more and more popular overtime. Global warming is the main threat to the sport
>These resorts are going to have a terrible time in 10-20yrs when ~~they have half the people riding because at this point they are driving newcomers away with these prices~~ there‚Äôs no snow anymore due to climate change

FTFY
Bold to assume they'll have snow in 10-20 years
This person is probably renting equipment from the resort directly instead of the store next door where it's $40-60 depending on the quality of the equipment. Also, $200 for equipment is probably buying a coat? Not sure what other equipment they'd need
Welcome to steamboat springs
Obviously it‚Äôs different everywhere but in Salt Lake City, you can get rentals for $25/day.
Vail owns the 3 closest mountains to me in the Mid-Atlantic. When I started snowboarding ~15 years ago, you could buy a 4 hour ticket for $40-50. Catch first chair, no lift lines until the lazy folks showed up at lunch, and have a good day. Perfect for learning.

Now? $90/day, no half day tix, & an objectively worse experience by every metric. We'd buy season passes if the experience were any better at all.
Local smoll place is 60$ for 4 hour lift tickets and 50$ for all gear. *Maybe* 90$ for the lift tickets at peak times.¬†


Still has more than enough to keep you busy for a while without it getting too dull.¬†
Right. That‚Äôs the point.  Inflated day rates makes the math of a 1,200 season pass come out to break even in 3 days.  If the day rate was 150 people would look at a season pass and go I need to ski 8 days to break even. Someone who is only going to ski three weekends then wouldn‚Äôt buy a season pass and the mountain would be out the 300 difference.
That‚Äôs the other thing people are forgetting. Even at its cheapest, you‚Äôre still spending over $200 for your first time with all factors considered at a small/affordable mountain. And you‚Äôre falling most of the day. Sometimes it hurts too and then you‚Äôre sore for a few days.

So the high cost and learning curve really make it hard for many people to try out.
That must not be the same at all of their resorts because this is the appalling price for tomorrow.

Tailgating in the parking lot is the way to go. Covid time we did this with a butane burner and Korean bbq meat and made everyone jealous
Fried bologna sandwiches.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know your local mountain(s), but mine in southern Colorado will ask you to leave and have signs up forbidding ‚Äúoutside food or drinks‚Äù üò£
Yep, and the big brain move is to look up the menu of their mountain lodge's and bringing beers that they sell. Pack Montucky pounders to Beaver Creek to avoid paying $18 for them at the Ritz :)
That‚Äôs the smart thing to do, 100%! The hot chocolate gets me (and of course, it‚Äôs the one thing that doesn‚Äôt travel well).
Something like $600 and change if you do the local pass. It‚Äôs worth it if you don‚Äôt ski Vail more than 10 days a year and can deal with holiday blackouts at a few other resorts. I think that one is a great deal.
I agree, but in their defense, they get the Chicago people up there that DGAF and will pay whatever they ask for.
Or a show! Top 3 amphitheater in the US
Still too much for what you get but they're able to get it because of their location.
Ugh, it was around $20 when I was in high school (late 90s)
The fuck? Glad it didn‚Äôt snow at all and glad I didn‚Äôt go. Even with a buddy pass that would be $70 or so. Stupid price for 30 second runs
Shhh, troll sucks, tell your friends!
Hell yeah dude that's awesome. Thanks to you and the other instructors i ended up riding for about 13 years before i gave it up due to how expensive it was getting
Exactly!! See ya there!
I haven't heard anyone say anything good about HR ever either, literally any HR, they are just company snitches.
The shareholders
That monopoly is actually named Vail Resorts, Inc.
Their price fixing at their mountains doesn't even just stop there.  When the mountains around you are $150 a day, it lets the independent competition raise their prices just below that threshold.

In a way good for the independently owned mountains, but damn a small place with old and slow lifts near me is still $90 a day.  Prices are out of control, and Vail is doing nothing for the people.  I want to chase powder and not stand in lines out the wazoo.
That's what you call a cartel
Thanks. Getting a splitboard setup (even a shitty one) and avy gear was not cheap, and Vail still got my money this season so I think the capitalists got their way
Ho-ly Fuck.
Had a 2ft day at Boho a few years ago. With the right storm cycle it rivals out west riding with amazing cliff drops and tree runs. Without good conditions it‚Äôs pretty rough, but thankfully its location is usually very consistent with snowfall. This has been one of the worst seasons in Michigan in recent memory however‚Ä¶
I just bought the two year pass, with Saturdays. My card was billed $216.... I get what you're saying, but it's still so obnoxiously cheap.
Yeah, my local mountain had to buy snow machines that can make snow above freezing temperatures just to stay open.
Yeah I wasn't just ready to call bullshit right away considering I've never been east, but I seriously doubt what hes saying.
Yes to Brian Head.

Brighton parking is fucked this year. You basically have to take the bus, which isn‚Äôt the worst, but it‚Äôs definitely not as convenient as it used to be.
True, true. When McDonald‚Äôs switched to vegetable oil, we had a big surplus of bovine slippery bits¬†
Lmao right! I was just near Reno and mount rose was like 1200$ for an unlimited pass. That‚Äôs the same price as ikon, and more expensive if you don‚Äôt have any discounts
Yeah I know its sig cheaper if you get it at the end of the season for the following year and student discounts help!
Single passes are usually much cheaper when purchased before the season starts.

Resorts want the majority of their ticket revenue upfront, not bit by bit as the season goes on.
From a purely terrain and pow chaser perspective I personally feel like the top resorts in the US are actually independents. I don‚Äôt even want to say them here. The big companies aren‚Äôt interested in real skiers/boarders, and thats fine with me.
Edit: this is not the mountain you‚Äôre looking for.

![gif](giphy|l2JJKs3I69qfaQleE)
Sunpeaks or big white don‚Äôt come close to offering what whis does from a terrain/ snow perspective though. Granted for most vacationers Whistlers extreme terrain isn‚Äôt really necessary. I ski Whistler but it‚Äôs definitely not for the village, all the local expert level skiers have an epic pass anyway though.
Big White was $195/day Christmas pricing. Disgusting.
Shhhhh. Delete this. People don't need to know that other options exist.
I enjoy my ikon pass as I‚Äôm a 30+ days of riding with my son the big problem I have is trying to convince my kids friends and their family to come learn to ride since it‚Äôs $200 a day with rentals and passes to learn. I can‚Äôt bring new people in with these prices
It's a positive change for people who ski 10+ days per year, but a negative for those who ski 3. At these prices the Epic/Ikon pays for itself in 5 days or so, but if Epic/Ikon didn't exist, these window prices would probably be half what they are today. Epic/Ikon are a way to influence customers to buy only "in bulk".
Got the Military epic pass at $170 in November! Unfortunately The only way I can justify a ski trip.
It‚Äôs just people have grown attached to the idea that they could be that rich guy someday while working at subway. so they refuse any legislation on corporations or fixing the tax code and republicans biggest thing is ‚Äúbig government shouldn‚Äôt be around‚Äù. It‚Äôs a terrible mindset to have and it shows with how expensive shit is here.
Monopolies are illegal. They don‚Äôt own every resort out there. They just own many of the big desirable ones.
I miss music concerts.
Monopolies were never illegal. Just FYI. Only the anti-competitive practices are illegal. It‚Äôs a bit like this: it‚Äôs not that being found in a house full of dead bodies while being covered in blood is illegal, it‚Äôs the murders. The state of being the only one left alive is not the illegal part.
>it was a lot better when monopolies were illegal 

They still are, it's just not enforced.
It absolutely is capitalism, one of the very first things Marx called out was capitalism‚Äôs tendency to move toward monopolies, it‚Äôs the rule, not the exception
Lack of regulatory agencies isn't just extreme capitalism? Please explain how.¬†


Also, no, not an oligarchy. New top guy got elected last year who was hated by the last top guy. That right there pretty much disproves that this is a full oligarchy, rather than a collection of monopolies.
How is this not capitalism? Monopolies and oligarchies are the natural end result of capitalism.
They basically own the entire economy for whole ski towns.  They have become the sole employer for the vast majority of people who have lived there for decades and they pay garbage rates.
Small mountains are great, but when the snow is inconsistent, they‚Äôre the first to close. Our small hill just closed for the year yesterday because the most recent storm didn‚Äôt bring enough snow, and even if they‚Äôd gotten enough this weekend, they‚Äôd still struggle because they lost all their seasonal employees due to not being open for the last 6-8 weeks. We usually get 200-300 annual inches here.
I go to a small mountain resort too, it's so worth it. And if I go on weekday mornings, there's no crowd. I pull up right when they open, park right at the front of the parking lot, pay $50 bucks and ride. The lift line is approximately a 0 second wait.
Opening day is MLK?! Sounds awful.
[deleted]
100%. Park city is hell on earth compared to the other side of the mountain
Haha let them ski shit and enjoy it. That way it‚Äôll keep the rest of the Utah goods to the locals. Utah skiing was ruined by the ikon and epic passes and the hordes who moved to Utah during the pandemic.
This is only half true. While flying to Rome at times will definitely be expensive, there‚Äôs plenty of places to fly to in Europe that are actually considerably cheaper than going somewhere here in the US, especially when you get to lodging.  And park city is kinda mid anyways
Eh? The Rockies from NY is $200-300, Europe from NY is $350-500. Plan it out with some minimal effort and a long weekend is easily even money.
Yeah what a strange comment. I usually pack a lunch when I go skiing.
Sent you a DM if that‚Äôs ok.
As an employee of the company that runs both Thredbo and my work, even staff discounts will run more than $1k for a 3/4 day trip per person. Australian skiing is cooked, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd prefer to spend a few hundred more to go to overseas and spend a full week on the slopes and still have money/time to go around the country.
When going to a boutique resort in Japan for two weeks ends up cheaper than flying to east coast, hiring a car for a week.
Yeah I alternate Japan and Canada. Haven‚Äôt actually made it to NZ yet, hoping for this year.
Bruh. Ohio????
Or you just hit half days before/after work if you have really early/late shifts.

¬†(And sleep in your Kia on the weekends).
You can make your own fortune. The year I got closest to 50 days I had a pass that I got pretty cheap really early with some blackout days, and I was living in Tahoe 20 min. from my door to the slopes, and was self employed doing carpentry work & in general, no one shows up in the morning on a snow day & things are flexible as long as your work is getting done. Once the per day cost is really low it feels fine to just go get a few good runs in and bail.
i gotta disagree tbh, 'normal' people who live in ski towns can get 50+ days a year no problem... That's why we move here! It's not gonna happen with a 9-5 in a non-skiing town that's far from a resort though. 

I live near Heavenly in Tahoe and most people here that want to ride a lot set up their winter schedules for skiing. I'm a small biz owner so I can get out whenever, but also know guys in construction, nurses, hospitality workers, realtors, white collar workers etc that have set up their lives to get riding in. Lots of people grind super hard all summer (i.e. wildfire firefighters trying to get as much overtime as possible), just to save enough money to ride all winter. Lots of normal middle-class folks get part time jobs at the mountain just to be up there often and be part of the community. The lifestyle is there for those who want it IMO
Attorney, and I picked a job in a city that‚Äôs an hour from three small resorts and 5 hours from a world class one
But like, snow is the whole point
If the mountain is constantly empty then the resort most likely closes
Maybe anecdotal, but I have an incredibly hard time convincing newbie friends to try the sport and the cost/accessibility is the issue. You and I will probably ride until we are too old to do it anymore, but who‚Äôs going to be left once the current community outgrows it?

Global warming obviously a threat as well but I have to imagine the already high barrier to entry only getting higher doesn‚Äôt bode well in the long term
How many people in those lift lines bought day passes though?  Even people from warm states buy season passes because it pays for itself in a few days.  There's incentive to go as often as possible once you have that pass.  That's why I think the resorts are packed.  Someone who wants to try it for the first time is going to be deterred by the single day price.  The business model is force everyone to buy a season pass.
Phuck liberty and the Jerries.  Used to there for evening night sessions.  Even back in 2017, still expensive.
This\^\^ we need more smaller ski resorts that better support local communities.
$100 for a whitetail tag. Wow. We drove up there from VA often in the 90s. No way I could afford that as a 17 year old kid.
The supermarket by me had baby kegs of Christmas ale for sale. 

I bought one and took it to Copper hahaha.
Yeah I've seen those. They can call cops on me because sure as hell I'm not paying $8 for a slice of frozen cheese pizza.
No one talks to me in central CO, I just make my sandwich and chill on my tailgate.
No way. In the parking lot???
Yup.  I bought the 2 year pass this year as well.  With all the fees it's just more economical.
Exactly. It protects them against external factors that may impact their revenue, especially snowfall (or lack of snowfall, to be more precise).
I knew I forgot one


Edit: and Banff
ü§´ü§´ü§´
Shhhhhh!
Only way I can justify staying in the military.

You‚Äôre close but the poor schmuck at subway can‚Äôt vote since his state doesn‚Äôt allow mail in voting and the voting centers are miles away and he can‚Äôt spend the money or time to get there. But the system is NOT rigged.
I've only been to Sundance a couple of times...I traded in the skis for fly fishing gear because I'm old and fat.  But I did think the snow was good and the instructors were patient and cool. How does that place compare to Park City in the experienced eye.
The Ohio meme never made sense to me. Used to be Florida and THAT made sense.
This is the way.
that tracks. i'll just pick a city and set my schedule so i can have 50 mountain days per year lol
They‚Äôll just change their pricing strategy if needed.
Yes x I have experienced the same thing, friends want to try it but between travel lodging lifts lessons and gear, they are pricing new people out of the sport.
Been bellow -30¬∞C all week though it‚Äôs horrible
You and me both
The guy working at Subway doesn't think he'll ever be a billionaire, we gotta cut that thought out. The guy at Subway votes for the billionaires because the billionaires tell them that the Dems are going to take his guns, electrify his truck, and make him start using pronouns. 

The billionaire class doesn't go shooting on the weekends, they don't own lifted trucks, and they don't care if you're LGBTQ+. But they know how to fleece people who do.

This is all just one big game that we play pretending to have an impact. One side collects votes on simple wedge issues, and the other throws out candy to the crowd to secure votes on rainbow flags and lukewarm legislation. At the end of the day, it's a class war, not a culture war, and when the wealthy class can pay off every legislator to shut down serious bills and keep us fighting for scraps, there will never be a way out.
Sundance is on the low end of Utah ski resorts. When they say the "other side of the mountain" they mean Snowbird, Alta, Solitude, Brighton. Sundance is waaay down south
I think it's bc Ohio is the Florida of the Midwest
Just plan your entire life around it
Proves the point, snowboarding is now for attorneys and Drs. And teachers and other service sector employees are priced out
Thats the point, it will be too late. Skiing/snowboarding is most often learned at a young age through parents imo. With 250$/day tickets the families get outpriced and wont bother teaching the kids. In 20 years nobody will even have the will to pass the sport on because they never did it in the first place.
don‚Äôt forget to include race baiting.   They are driving a wedge between different races and reaping the shitty benefits of a divided socioeconomic class
[deleted]
Mate there ain't gonna be any snow in 20 years.
This is the trend of most hobbies and recreational activities. They all go through peaks and valleys, but pricing out newcomers as you stated starts the death spiral.
True, and modern progressives for some reason support billionaires in that endeavor.
Not to mention corporate greed. Inflation went up 8% and companies used it as an excuse to raise consumer prices like 35%
We need not eat the rich, taxing them would suffice. 
If a quarter of all minimum wage incomes goes straight to Uncle Sam, I don't see why it should change when 0s are added to the end of one's income. 
Or why corporations should get a free pass due to how many minimum wage slaves they consume.
Gotta squeeze every dollar out that they can before then
Sounds like what they said 20 years ago.
Stick Season 
Decided to add another season to the collage. 
Gotta get one with snow now.
FR 71?
Not gonna lie this is a beautiful set of pics.

Now hit us with the snow pic, then sell it to silly leaf peepers who come up. 

They'd eat that shit right up.
The big grey
I love all the seasons even mud season can be fun if ya got the right vehicle. Honestly, I‚Äôm just happy to have seasons again because Colorado we had three seasons, summer, winter and fire. And every year it seem like fire season was slowly becoming a threat all year long. 
I‚Äôll take mud season over fire season any day .
Beautiful!!
Deerfield?
Almost there. Snow shot by mid Nov!
Sticks are on the ground, limbs are in the trees. Fuckin stick seasons is the dumbest non Vermont term I‚Äôve ever heard!
I can smell the top picture and now I‚Äôm sad. I‚Äôm ready for summer, can we just skip over winter?!
Good Noah Kahan song
Ugh going up to Von Trapp Resort in a week, did we already miss the foliage? Is it sticks in that area already?
Sorry, these do not depict stick season. When the trees are bare, AKA sticks, and then it is stick season.
Please post again with snow. I love this
Yup
It is easy to forget how limited a picture is in representing the beauty.
Fuck your downvotes you are 100% right
You're a month too late
Ugh was afraid of that, ok maybe can hope for snow at least. Or are we too early?
Maybe on the peaks, but we're having a heat-wave at the moment.
These nuts can't be unscrewed with wrench because they are to close to this metal surface. I am wondering how they manged to screw them in first place?
Since this part is broken i just removed metal surface with grinder so that my french can actually get around these nuts. Issue was that i couldn't wrap my wrench around nuts propertly, It would slip and potentially damage nuts. Some of them were positioned in such way that i could unscrew them with wrench.

Did you try the other end?
Thin wall socket
Grab your cheapest open-ended wrench and grind the "mouth" to be thinner on the outside.
id slip a flat screwdriver that fits between the crevice of the hex and the metal surface, then open it from the other side. screwdriver should hold the hex nut while the shaft turn.
Is there a bolt head on other end? Just clamp the nut and unscrew from under side of the bolt if you can
Yeah, thin walled socket job if ever I saw one
picture of the other end please.
Place flat blade screw driver in the 90¬∞ corner and hold it from spinning the nut around. Then, hit it from the other side with an impact driver. If it's an allen key head, just make sure u have the exact one needed, else u will just round it out. If it's a regular hex head, get the right 6 point socket with said impact driver. The screw driver should work as a lock to prevent the nut from spinning with the bolt. Also, might be worth ur time, tack welding the nut on the 3 accessible sides, depending, of course, on the material.
I assume the other end of those long screws there is another nut that's probably more accessible?
"These nuts can't be unscrewed with a wrench."

*proceeds to show 2 unscrewed nuts.*
Turn the bolt not the nut

Put a flat surface between the nut and the casting to stop the nut turning and then loosen the bolt from the other end
put a screwdriver on the inside of the nut right next to the side that you can‚Äôt get to, then spin the bolt from the other side
Maybe if you turn it from the other end the nuts will stay in place and the bracket will loosen?
Dude I bought a pair of knpex front grip pliers specifically for jobs like this
Id bet there are Allen head on the other side.
Yep, post pic of other side. If that long bolt is hex or allen, then it will be easy to hold that nut with a flat head screw driver
Stick a flathead on the nut side and wedge the nut. Use bolt end to unscrew.
Loosen the other end of the rod and pull them out.
Stick a flat head screwdriver in there and turn the other end?
What's the other side look like? Maybe the nuts are not designed to be turned. Can you turn the bolt?
Thin walled socket or a cheap socket with the walls shaved down
*Processing img v2zg19lsgsnd1...*

Can we see what‚Äôs on the other side?
[deleted]
What does the other end look like?
Thin wall socket is what you need
Use a thin wall socket.  It will work.
Just cut off the two bolts that you‚Äôre struggling with and replace with hex socket/allen headed bolts.
Thin walled socket
Probably from the bottom.
You just don‚Äôt have the right tools. A thin walled socket would do it just fine
C''mon Man
Stick a screw driver to lock the nut in place and loosen the other end. If that doesn't work try vise grips on tje shift with the nut locked.
"Unscrewed with a wrench". Nah I'm abandoning you on this one. I took offense.
You shouldve put washers under the bolt
Open ended spanner?
"so that my french can actually get around these nuts." <- Wrong type of subreddit...
I have ground many sockets to get on oversized hex nuts.  


The fix.  Tall nuts with a washer.

Or very expensive 6 or 12 point nuts.   But most aircraft nuts are fine thread.

Allen nuts would cure the issue but stick out a little farther.   Google Allen nuts.
Flat head between nut and housing
Looks like you should probably have taller nuts. Use a screwdriver to pin the nut on this side, remove nut on other side, pull out tie rod.
[removed]
Just start turning the bolt and the nut will loose by its self (friction between the plate and the nut)
Small pipe wrench on the bolt, flat head to hold the nut. Same for the other side of the bolt if it spins.
A quarter turn at a time XD
My guess is a wrench holds onto the nuts on that side while a different wrench turns the bolt from the other side
Snap-on is gonna be so hype for this demonstration
Stick a flat bladed screwdriver on the flat side of the nut in one of those corners to keep the nut from rotating and loosen the bolt from the other side of whatever you are holding
Jam a flat head screwdriver between the nut and the housing
Socket wrench
Insert metal strips on the side then try opening it with a screwdriver
Looking like a small air cylinder. We use this in out trimmer saw boxes at work.  Thin walled socket should work.
Is that a pneumatic cylinder.  Is the other end identical or does the threaded rod have an Alan key head on the other end
needle nose, very tedious stuff. 

or you could try twisting it by the threads
I would say shave the bolt down with something
Just use a open end wrench to grab the edge and spin it enough to be loose. Then you should be able to spin it off by hand. However, I think the answer lies on the other side of the piece pictured.
Open ended spanner or even a flat blade screwdriver between one of the flats on the nut and the housing and undo them by turning the bolt... üôÑ
Air hammer time
Probably a pain in the ass regardless, but it's definitely possible with an open end wrench to grab onto the upper part of the nuts as well as to use them vertically.
What do you mean they can't be unscrewed? You unscrewed two of the same nuts in the pic!!. Get a different wrench and use the open ended side
Whoever put it together tapped it and said "that ain't going nowhere". Sorry, but their power level is higher than your's.
Grab the rod with plyers and turn the rod out of the nut
Very thin walled socket or just an open end wrench. They could've had a special tool. Harbor freight is good for making special tools.
Worst case scenario gring down a thin 12 point socket to fit.
Can you get something to wedge the nuts and spin the rods with your hand?
ZZZ
Needle nose pliers and patience
Try to rotate the shaft the nut is threaded on.
Time to use a hammer and chisel if all other suggestions failed. Get new nuts
Screw driver and hammer to break the nut then you can hand thread it off
Did you try a thin wall socket?
Get out the fire wrench, it can't be tight if it's a liquid...
I assume you can turn the bolt head.  You can take a flat head screwdriver and wedge between the nut and the body of the part, that will keep it from spinning when turning the bolt.
This really looks like the nut is not meant to be turned and instead you are supposed to turn the rod that goes all the way through to the other side. What does the other end of this thing look like?
Wedge something in the corner and use the other side of the bolt
Get the correct socket that you don't care about. Hit it with a grinder till wall is thin enough to slip over nut. Save for future use.
You can cut the bolt where it‚Äôs exposed to remove it.  Then replaxe it with allen/hex head cap hardware.
What‚Äôs on the other end???
Pipe wrenches on the shaft of the stud. Jam a flat screwdriver into the nut to prevent it from turning
Holes look a bit oversized, is there enough slop to get a thin walled socket on there (maybe a 12 point)?
You could spot weld another nut on top of those and unscrew them instead..?
Thin walled sockets
a thin-walled socket wrench will get those out. Impact is too thick perhaps, but thin-walled or even standard socket could probably get in there.
Tried using a small punch and hammer or flat head screwdriver and hammer? Gently tapping it should work.
Does the Thread rotate? you could hold the nut, and spin the screw.
From the other end.
What does the other end of the screw look like?  Turn it there?
If got it turned it just a little bit clockwise you could get a crescent wrench on there and turn from the other side. I‚Äôd bet that‚Äôs how they did it
Can't be stuck if it's a liquid ü§∑
Looks like a tie rod hydraulic/pneumatic cylinder with a broken rear clevis. Clamp the square head to a table and attach Vice grips to the tie rod on the tube side to prevent it from turning and proceed to unscrew the nut.
I think an open end wrench will grab it. But the manufacturer probably has a modified thin wall socket.
You could try and either use a punch on the edge of the nut to get it spinning or if they‚Äôre torqued to a very low value, you could get a cheap socket and grind the wall down super thin
use 12 point nuts
Screwdriver and a hammer. Use the screwdriver to knock the bold around. Dont do this.
It‚Äôs giving that ikea tool or lego hand shaped tool
Chisel/screwdriver and a hammer/screwdriver.
Needle nosed vice grips.
Narrow wall socket
This looks like a cylinder, the idea here is to start the nut on the side in the picture, then slide the rod through the holes and tighten the bolts on the other side
With a spanner
Socket
Self sealing stem bolts
With a socket.
I'm wondering if those are the correct nuts
Crescent Hammer? Thin walled box hammer? Wouldn't think even a thin walled socket for a ratcheting socket hammer would fit the gap here.
Use a small chisel and hammer to back the nut off enough to get a wrench on and buy a new nut.
Small wrench
I‚Äôd try to break it loose with a small pair of needle nose vice grips
Sacrifice a socket with a lathe.
Nut driver ‚Ä¶. Adjustable wrench and just fuck it hahah
You better be careful opening that thing up man. You could be holding alot of pressure
Use the right sized socket.
It looks like you could just rotate the bolts with a pipe wrench and then hold the nuts still
Open end wrench....
[deleted]
Long nose pliers
Ummm.  Cut the bolt with a cut off wheel.
Grind down the wall of a socket so it‚Äôs thin enough to fit in there
Back the bolt up until its threads are flush with the part. Place the nut on that flat surface. Hold the nut with a needle nose vise grip.( or whatever works best)  Thread the bolt up through while holding the nut in place.   Step 3: profit!
Mole grips on the nut and undo it from the other end if it‚Äôs a normal bolt? Or buy some thin walled sockets as also suggested here. That would prob be the best and easiest way. 

Edit- Or actually you need those special open ended spanner‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen before, might be called a crows foot. It has more of an opening than your normal open ended spanner. I‚Äôll try find a link

Edit 2- I‚Äôm totally wrong lol, just grind down a spanner like everyone else suggests. Or try my first suggestion üòÇ

Edit 3- worst case, go ham on it with a chisel. Or buy one of those nut buster tools üòÇ

Edit 4- dremel it off with a carbide burr
Best thing about this type of work, many different ways to skin a cat. Good luck it getting it sorted and hopefully  it doesn‚Äôt take you all day üëçüèª
I can't stand wrenches most of the time. Nothing beats a good rachet and socket set.
File your wrench down on the sides so it's pretty thin. You won't get much torque but it'll work. We have to do that for ABB motors at my job.
[deleted]
Use the right sized socket.
[removed]
My favorite tool, single use wrench.
Name?
This
I did, idk how you call that since english is not my first language. It doesn't fit at all, i tried rotating my wrench, i tried to do it with pliers and I tried with tool that makes satisfying noise (in my country we simply call it "gedore" by brand name, actual name is widely unknown)
Exactly what I thought too
Yes 12 pt might fit
That was what I was thinking, too.
Used to work for a major dealership, thats what we did for a certain model of car we would see come in for the same fix, every mechanic thinned out their 13mm wrench by half to fit it for that specific repaire on that specific car model....
Does it says so in the manual?
Or a socket. A few rotations around a bench grinder until it's thin enough
There are another 4 hex nuts just under this surface shown on picture, i dont think that it would be possible to separate holder from the piston unless all nuts are unscrewed.
This is the answer
"some of them were positioned in such a way that I could unscrew them"

I know it's a mechanic sub, but reading isn't that hard. :P
Knipex pliers wrench FTW.
that's what i was thinking as well
Worried that whatever this part, is this thing under pressure and not meant to come apart, hence the zero clearance?
I had to double check but you are correct ! Thanks for the laugh
My thoughts. Some equipment has built in place holding to ensure the nut doesn't spin. I'd check the other side to see if that end is designed for actual removal.
I wrote "french" at the end and corrected it, i guess first time it slipped through lol
Also should probably specify, socket on other end
https://preview.redd.it/c8kv267mbund1.jpeg?width=2600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19e8105919025d9a912a3e0ffc5a5d026216eff0
Nah it's just pneumatic piston, and this part is just holder of the piston.
I had that idea but i never actually done it so i wasn't confident that it would work, i just picked grinder and removed surface that blocked my wrench, since that part was already broken anyways (you can see it on the picture)
Why did you comment this three times?
I explained it under picture. Is because they were positioned in the way that i could turn them a bit just enough to make them loose. I had 3 of these parts, so 12 nuts to unscrew, and 2 is most i managed to do with just wrench and not damaging this absurd surface.

That‚Äôs just a cheap spark plug wrench.
[removed]
Mechanic here, satisfying noise = ratchet
They have sockets with very thin walls for these types of nuts. It may not be worth buying a set for just this, but where I live (lots of heavy industry) you can find bargain bins with lots of tools, sockets and bits for $1.
Did you try a box wrench to hold it. It would fit on 2 sides
The tool you‚Äôre referring to is a ratchet but I prefer ‚Äútool that makes satisfying noise‚Äù so much more. 

I love this description, it‚Äôs making me smile ear to ear lol
Is it possible that the rod/bolt itself was rotated to tighten them into place?

Perhaps if you loosened it by rotating the rod/bolt, it would give you enough slack to use a wrench the rest of the way
Your English is just fine, friend 

Cheers and best wishes from the mountains of Tennessee
Zove se raƒçna, raƒçva ili ponekad ƒçak i ƒçegrtaljka. Socket je nasadni kljuƒç
When in doubt, dug dug it out

Use an impact gun.
(also a little heat, if you can, before you start wrenching. Sometimes they use loctite red for some reason. Heat breaks it down)
Also replace the nut with a flanged nut to prevent the same issue in the future... or grind it flat.
‚ÄúSatisfying noise‚Äù is the perfect way of describing ‚Äúratchet‚Äù
Tell me you're Balkan without telling me you're Balkan, bre üòÇ
if it was 10mm I'd guess the ac blower for a dodge magnum
Japanese or German. 13mm bolts/nuts have to be the most common size
Had to do that for some anti roll bar bushes on my LR3, bought a wrench (nice one too) from a second hand seller at a tractor show for ¬£3 and ground it down. Turned an evil job easy.
It's hard to picture what you mean by this. Could you add some pics from other angles? 
It seems like those bolts go all the way to the opposite end of that while device you've got, but you're saying there's something covering the other end?
Have you tried the old fashioned automotive ignition wrenches?
They are tiny and thin and made to work in really tight spaces but are plenty strong.
Use a chisel and keep hitting from the sides to for the nut to spin, takes a while but works
The position of the rings around the other two suggest similar spacing with possible different nut angle. These don‚Äôt look like they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù be unscrewed at all. Just need an adjustment or ignition wrench.
No clue. I clicked it once. So whatever happened between clicking it once and it being posted.

I better not see three tits like total recall. That would be wild!
Alright, alright, that's enough playing around. Get back to fixing cars. You're on the clock.
We need a mod to flair OP with that. It's 10/10 and I'm gonna start using it to ask people for my ratchet.
This goes in my bucket with the time my daughter called a cucumber a vegetable hot dog.
It's "gedorable"!
That‚Äôs fucking gold. ¬†
Cricket ü§£
That is now what I will be calling the ratchets from now on
Yes!  Well that and any air tools.  I LOVE that air tool sound.
Gee.... never heard called that name.  Glad you were to be able to figure that out.
have you tried the small ratchet that wera sells in the tool plus kit? the sound is ü•µü§å
I was thinking he meant the ugga-dugga, but ratchets are pretty great too
That‚Äôs why we wind up with so many, right? Including multiple copies of our preferred size. Right? Got to have all the satisfying noises!
I took a cheap socket and ground it down to make my own thin wall socket.  Didn‚Äôt take much so I did that
Konstant..ine
>Zove se raƒçna, raƒçva ili ponekad ƒçak i ƒçegrtaljka

Sad mi je jasno zasto je niko tako je zove 

Hvala :)
Japanese cars don't use 13mm bolts, German and American do
lol, well played.
It IS oddly satisfying now that I think about it
if you think about it RATCHET is the the exact noise it makes.
The Klein ratchet is among the most satisfying in case you‚Äôd like to go on a self discovery journey of finding the most satisfying
My Portuguese friend was telling me how she accidentally kicked a table leg and hurt her "foot finger"
My son once hurt his foot wrist
I love it. My username is what my niece calls grass
Can never go wrong with an ugga-dugga. 1200 ftlbs of torque can solve marital problems if you wanted it to
moze i krckalica
But they like 8, which is a lucky number.
Honda exhaust manifold studs used 13mm locking nuts exclusively in the 90s/2000s. I always used them for my Audi custom exhaust manifolds because they seemed to have better retention and didn‚Äôt loosen as easily as the OEM.
Nissan has been using them on the body parts on the front end. Very frustrating because they also still use 12mm.
Are you talking thread size or bolt head size?
Is it satisfying because it means the job is getting done? There has to be some subconscious reason we all love it.
Raaaaa-tchit.

Damn. You're right.
Oh damn, isn‚Äôt that an onomatopoeia?
Clicky wrench makes more sense.  I think you associate clicking with the word ratchet, not the other way around.  We even say "ratcheting sound" in reference to the sound the tool makes, but the tool wasn't named after the sound ratchet, we named the sound after the tool.
That is actually what it's called in Portuguese. It does also have a medical term but 99% will call it a "dedo do p√©" which translated like for like is finger of foot.
A kid I worked with kept pointing to my circular saw and asking if he could borrow my hand-table saw.
This thread has been far more humorous than I expected it to be.
I know very limited Spanish, my Latino coworkers had a blast when I lost my gloves and started asking if anyone had seen my manos pantalones, or hand pants.
Ha!  Ha!  I have heard the foot finger description before, from an Asian chap!  Caused a few giggles.
This is the second thread I‚Äôve seen about this, I learned from the first one that most languages call toes foot fingersüòÇ
In many countries the word for toe and finger is the same.
I suppose a woman with a cheating husband might be tempted to tighten his nuts with an "ugga dugga" tool...
And if not, it's already busted so grab the sledge
Yes but can also create problems too
TBF the ugga-dugga is a tool with satisfying noise and *ATTITUDE*
Had a machine that had god damn 5.5mm(I think that was the weird size)
That is completely untrue, Honda through the 90s used those odd little nuts with the tiny crown on them, 12mm in size, I literally still drive a 90s Honda and work on 2000s regularly, just because you use the wrong sized socket doesn't make them that size.
If you hold it by the socket it becomes a noise maker.
I think people just love clean crisp clicks to fidget with.
I think that's more common for languages of the world than not. The fingers and toes are referred to with the same word.
Same as in Spanish ‚Äúdedo del pie‚Äù as in foot finger
Ironically, in English, the medical term for both fingers and toes is philanges.
To be fair, I own 2 old skil circular saw I saved from being dumpster food, and I still struggle Every. Single. Time. I try to remember what it‚Äôs called. I usually finally end up at buzz saw.
I wish I didn't read this.  Owwie
I've come across this in a GM
5.5mm is a common size socket on larger socket sets I find, I have a few rolling around my shop.
100% I drive a 2003 Honda and there's not a single odd numbered nut or bolt on the whole thing. All 8, 10 or 12 as far as I've found. If you have to use an odd numbered socket on a Honda I would guess the part isnt a Honda part or something has gone wrong to alter the size of the head on a bolt
Phalanges is the plural of phalanx which is a small bone making up the finger or toe. It's not a term for the whole finger or toe.
skil saw
Hey you started it ... üòÇ
I drive Hondas too and I know of a few 17mm and 19mm nuts and bolts underneath mostly chassis
Interesting.

Most of the bolts on our '03 Protege5 are 8, 10, 12, 14, but anything larger than that I've come across has been 17MM bolt. They are used for the engine mounts and what not.
Haha ok I may be misremembering this. The Audi‚Äôs are 13mm and the Hondas were 12mm.
Yeah once you get into the big sizes Japanese fasteners go odd. 17, 19, 21

But never 13 or 15. It makes me irrationally annoyed when aftermarket replacement parts for Japanese cars use them.
I now understand...
...why people flocked in to see this. Such an incredible day. Drive safely everyone, to wherever you may be going. 
The biggest shock was how dark and cold it got. A humbling experience
I knew it would be cool, but I had no idea just how amazing.
This picture captured the little red thing in the lower left! Was that a solar filament?
Absolutely breathtaking from MRG. I get the hype now, but glad I just had to go down the hill to be home. Special day.
Pretty cool right? Brings tears to these dry eyes
I can't stop thinking about it. It was amazing.
I feel bad for the people who don't understand why this was amazing
I've been looking forward to this for seven years now idk what to do with myself hahaha

I don't know how someone can go through the totality and not be changed on the other side. It's probably the most significant celestial event you can experience and one of the only events where so many people are experiencing it together at the same time. Millions of people simultaneously experiencing the feeling of awe. Just in our small group that experienced it together spent the rest of the day trying to wrap our heads around it.
Spectacular event! I made it to the Burlington waterfront. I know there was a lot of people, but it didn't feel that way. Totality is really an amazing once in a life time experience!
TOOK US 12 HOURS TO GET HOME. Traffic was so bad bro
I don't get it. I live where it was 98% and chose to drive away from the circus for the week. We were able to see it at 80% and continued on with our day. Very happy with our decision!
Glad you had such a profound life changing moment with such unimportant nonsense
The mass exodus on route 89 last night needs to be studied by science.
What an experience!
Vermont is beautiful. 
Thanks for having us. I was scared bc it's not very diverse but everyone was so nice. 
Will be back for cider donuts and falling leaves.
It felt like the sun was dying.

Really put into perspective how much we rely on the sun.
The cold really got me. Felt so lucky to just hang on the deck.
I got goosebumps about a minute before totality.   


Not because of the gravity of the event. Shit got cold.
Add to that the silence after an initial cheering. 

You could feel the awe that enveloped the area. It was wild to experience.
I was sitting on a patio next to a thermometer and could see the needle visibly move - the temperature dropped literally 15 degrees in 15 minutes as totality approached
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt realize just how weird it would be, in the best way possible
I missed it. Can you explain? Ppl seem to be thrilled by this
It‚Äôs a Filament when seen against the solar disk, but a prominence when it projects beyond the disk and seen against dark space.
This article describes what they were (prominences): https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/red-dots-around-total-solar-eclipse-explained/

> A solar prominence is a massive loop of the sun‚Äôs plasma that hangs attached to the visible surface of the sun
>‚Ä¶
> Prominences often appear reddish because their plasma can originate deeper in the sun‚Äôs atmosphere, in a layer called the chromosphere, which is characterized by hydrogen at high temperatures that emits red light.
I need an answer to this question! We were all wondering what that was.
Same. People pooping on my parade like it's ok if you're not into it like let me enjoy my astrological phenomena go pout somewhere else.
I contemplated not doing anything.  Then looked it up and realized the next total eclipse is ~2045.  I might be dead by then.  Decided it was worth the effort.  Was not disappointed
lady at shaws the other day was telling me to just watch it on youtube and how she was refusing to look up because it is all some stupid attraction for flatlanders blah blah blah. just hope she got to see it and changed her mind
Explain it to us. It was kinda interesting but after I fall asleep tonight I‚Äôm probably never going to think about it again.
Iceland in ‚Äò26 and then Northern Africa / Mediterranean / Red Sea in ‚Äò27.
Your cried? Lmao
Anyone want to switch seats?
From where to where? Must feel so good to be home tho after that! I live near 89 and watched traffic at 11pm just crawling. I felt so awful for those people.
You don‚Äôt get it because even at 98% it‚Äôs a completely different experience than 100%. It‚Äôs not just the way the moon and sun look but the entirety of the world and sky changes completely. 98% feels like the sun is still out on a normal day, maybe a bit dim ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Look at any of these pictures here or of any total eclipse during totality. If yours didn‚Äôt look like that, then you didn‚Äôt have the same experience.¬†
Less than 100% totality and you can‚Äôt take off the protective glasses. 100% totality makes it safe to do so; and seeing the last sliver of sun disappear and then the darkness all around and the corona ejections around the black disc that is the moon; it‚Äôs an awe inspiring sight that transcends anything I‚Äôve seen or experienced before. A partial eclipse, even 98%, is like going to the sound and thinking you‚Äôve experienced the ocean. A partial eclipse is just not a very significant event. Whereas a total eclipse is one of the most significant events a person can experience. People don‚Äôt travel hundreds and thousands of miles to see the sun shrink through special glasses. They come to see the moon block out the sun with their naked eyes (or telescopes) and all the little, incredible details that are associated with that show. 98% totality is the preview to the main attraction. It is *not* tantamount to tuning an analog radio dial from 98% clear signal to 100% clear signal. Rather, it‚Äôs more like flipping a light switch. I hope that helps.

My friend kept saying "I really hope it comes back!!"
Right?? I felt like I was in a dooms day event.
Yeah. I can see how people banged pots and made noise to scare away the thing eating the sun! Absolutely the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Where I was it was silent until the sun started coming back and then everyone cheered.
The eclipse was one of the most beautiful and most eerie experiences of my life. We were on a secluded hilltop, forest all around, bright sun reflecting off the snow‚Ä¶ when it got dark, everything fell silent, the birds stopped chirping, the wind even seemed to settle. A 360 degree sunset all around and a black sky above with this fiery ring. I got chills.
It was weird.. like, as it got darker it didn't seem like normal dusk. It felt almost like you were wearing sunglasses. And then when it hit totality it was very suddenly dark, but looking out over the lake it looked like dusk. And the temp cooled very quickly. Then the second totality ended it was bright again, not quite full daylight but definitely bright, almost like nothing had happened. 

It was surreal, kind of difficult to explain. I was in the 90+% zone for the 2017 eclipse, and thought that was cool, but this was definitely different. My husband and I both couldn't believe how far some people traveled for this, but now we get it. I don't know how far I'd be willing to travel for one in the future, but we both agreed we'd consider it if the timing worked out. 

That said, some people don't really get excited by this kind of thing, so I imagine some were pretty underwhelmed. No big deal if it isn't someone's thing, so long as they don't shit on others for enjoying it.
It was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced. There are no words or pictures that can do it justice. Just mind blowing
It was like seeing something alien in the sky. When I saw it I let out a primal scream. Can‚Äôt be explained. You have to experience it.
It super hard to explain. I think different people like different things about the experience but watching the sky on lead in like a minute or two before alone is worth the price of admission. To me it looked like a giant storm was brewing but it was a perfect cloudless day.
It appears the answer is yes! Someone got a really high-definition shot showing the filament in detail: https://i.redd.it/dzlj2jrzmbtc1.jpeg
Hate to be that person but it‚Äôs astronomical, not astrological
There's one in Spain on August 12, 2026.  That eclipse will happen just before sunset, with the sun setting while still partially eclipsed.  Granted, Spain isn't a short trip from Vermont, but it could be attainable with a cheap flight and some serious advanced planning.
Genuinely feel bad for people like this. As if depriving themselves of the experience somehow sticks it to the "flatlanders".
Did you experience totality? Because if you only saw 99% or something I totally understand your reaction.
Cuz I can totally afford to travel lol
From Lawrence‚Äôs Massachusetts to Newport Vermont and back. We left at 3:30 and got home at 4:14am broüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ my foot never left the breaks
No use in even trying to explain it to people with that kind of mindset lol. Let them continue on with their dreary lives
The 360 sunset blew my mind!! I didn‚Äôt remember this would happen. Also I was on a hill top, no trees, I saw the WHOLE RING and then deep purple above.

This was pretty much my experience! Hard to put into words aside from describing, but that's exactly what it felt like....
That‚Äôs fucking cool thanks for sharing
Wow! They're all along the left side. I thought the shadow bands were awesome as well. The whole thing was just ... metal.
Thank you, I am not actually into astrology except for funsies. Neat to know it's both!
It's actually both- it's incredibly significant in astrology whether others believe in it or not.
6 hour flight. You can get to Spain faster than you can get to Texas. Honestly, it's worth going just for the food!
Yeap!..
Like 98% to 100% is a completely diff experience !!!!!
lol, no I didn‚Äôt participate in the shit show.

Have you seen both? What‚Äôs the difference?
I can‚Äôt really either, but if there is a will, there‚Äôs a way! I figure it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to save up in three years.
This is understated. I will never forget that image of a circular sunset on all horizons.
Surprisingly accurate
The difference between 99% and 100% is significant. 99% you will hardly tell there was even an eclipse. 100% becomes a visual phenomenon. Unless you are in the 100%, you have basically nothing to look at. 

With that said, the people saying this changed their life or they can‚Äôt stop thinking about it are freakin‚Äô nut jobs. Someone said they cried and vowed to better their life. Give me a break. 

It was a cool sight. Sunset all around you. Eye of Sauron staring down at you. I can see why our great ancestors thought god was angry or whatever. But it was a cool visual for a few minutes. Nothing that significant. Life moves on.
Yes I‚Äôve seen both. And even if one hasn‚Äôt seen both a little research goes a long way. Partial from 1%-99% you can only safely view through the filter of the glasses, and yes it‚Äôs cool to see the shape of the moon eclipsing the sun into a sliver, but at 100% you literally watch the shadow from the horizon engulf you and you are shrouded in darkness and everything looks like it‚Äôs in a blue/grey filter. You can remove your glasses & view the eclipse with the naked eye. You can safely view it through binoculars and telescope without filter too. That 100% makes a world of difference and it‚Äôs visually far more striking than any partial eclipse. It was one of the most surreal and amazing 2 minutes ever and I wish I could experience it again. It went by so fast.
My will to live has basically been non existent. And my confidence in myself is shot. I doubt I'll make it in three years haha
I got as close to the center line of totality as I could and, man, that was the fastest 3 1/2 minutes of my life. I honestly can‚Äôt account for where those minutes went. Felt like 30 seconds. So amazing.
Cool, I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed yourself.
Suspicious about recent brake work
My Mitsubishi Lancer needed new brake pads. I went to Jiffy Lube and they replaced all 4 pads and did a "brake flush". They said I didn't need new rotors. After the replacement, the brakes didn't feel any better than my old worn out pads and they squeak a lot when the tires spin (not when I apply the brakes) and I noticed this part was rubbing against metal where the noise was coming from. How many issues could there be going on here with the squeaking and brakes not working any better? They work fine but I was expecting a huge difference in stopping power with new brake pads.

It's upside down....
This makes me irrationally angry that you paid for a service and they did that to you. Let alone a place that should not be doing brakes at all. 

That's 10 levels of incompetentcy from the CEO who decided jiffy lube should do brakes, down to the poor tech that was either not trained or shouldn't be doing the job in the first place. 

I'd make them tow the car to an actual shop and make them pay do the work properly.
Aaaand this is why I do my own vehicle work üòé
> I went to Jiffy Lube  
  
There's your first mistake.  
  
> They said I didn't need new rotors  
  
You do now.
Fuck me don't drive your vehicle wrong pads or they put them on back to front.... Ffs

That whole thing is upsidedown face..
Is this real?
You are right to be suspicious!
Your mistake was going to jiffy lube for anything.
Update: The guy that did it had given me his number yesterday. I told him what happened and he came back to the Jiffy Lube and opened it up (they're closed Sundays) to fix the issue. He got it fixed. I took some extra photos of what the brake looked like before and then two with the wheel off to show the ring that was worn from the metal rubbing on metal. I plan to take my car to a more reputable shop on Monday or Tuesday to look at it and see what they think. 

https://imgur.com/a/FCMLH40

As for Jiffy Lube, I don't know about cars so I wouldn't know whether it's a bad idea to take my car to them or not. People were under the assumption that I was kidding or this is a troll post, but it isn't.
Never let one of the oil change franchises do mechanical work on your vehicle. Don't let them change your oil either.
Go demand your money back, and never take it to a jiffy lube for brakes.
![gif](giphy|vPk9gCdlEYPa0IQUbn)
Looks like they messed something up, wrong pad, upside down or wrong side. Bet they didnt lube the glide pins either. Dont go to jiffy lube theyre amateurs posing as car mechanics
This is a joke right. Even my toddler with basic shapes would have the logic to have the orientation of the way a brake pad goes. You guys are freaking out over a troll post from r/askshittymechanics
It‚Äôs horrifying that you need a license to fish but not work on cars (ps I know the funds from fishing license go to good things)
Send that pic to Jiffy Lube corporate with a request for full refund.

If they don't, resend it on a lawyer's letterhead and tell them it's your pregnant wife's car.
That takes some real talent to put a brake pad on upside down and get it back together!
Yeah that‚Äôs upside down.
Your first mistake was going to jiffy lube, don't fix it yourself. Take it back to jiffy lube and talk to the manager and show them the photos. Tell them the problem, have them fix the problem and demand a refund in full. If they don't, go to another shop pay out of pocket have them take photos and videos and have them fix it. They're probably going to have to replace your brake pads and rotors because your brake pads being on backwards probably destroyed them. If jiffy lube refuses to cooperate you've got everything set up for a small claim against them.
It's way harder to put brakes on like this than it is to put them on correctly. I have no idea how this happens.
What a fucking embarrassment the "tech" is. Barely an easier job one could attempt on a car... Where Mr. George?
I changed my brakes in high school, before YouTube, with zero experience, and didn‚Äôt make this mistake.
what the fuck
This is a joke, right? No way any tech is this stupid.
Don't ever take that to that person again . Brakes are nothing to play with or get wrong
Uhh... wow.
https://preview.redd.it/htmm9kmopu2d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=114f4e2d2a99e57706c537f27945510772093349

This was after a strut change. They forgot to install the brake caliper guide pin bolts. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI got my money back.
I could see this becoming a meme for ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a mate that can do it cheaper‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt even know you could put them that way and still have any functionality at all lmao!
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ this is the very definition of Negligence
A jiffy lube did an oil change on my wife‚Äôs car when we were in our early 20s and never tightened the oil plug which came out and drained the oil over a 3-4 mile stretch on highway before the engine seized.
This tracks for jiffy lubeüò¨
Just when you think Jiffy Lube can‚Äôt get any worse‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this is gross negligence
Whoever did this should never be allowed to work on cars again... WOW
Well, you definitely need new rotors now.
lol bro those pads are upside down you kidding me
They did in in a jiffy
That looks like break work
From a man who knows exactly nothing about cars, that pad is upside down...
Of all the things that never thought I'd never see how the hell did they get them upside down like they don't even fit that way usually
omg
Yes sir.  Another ticket why yo don't go to jiffy lube.  40 years of fail.
They‚Äôre on backwards.
This is why I cringe when people say "brake jobs are so easy..."

I've had customers get their cars towed to me after trying to do brake work. Brake work for most is not the hardest thing but it still takes knowledge and skill to do it right.
Jiffy lube should have been run out of town decades ago. In high school (before I knew better), they lost my oil plug and forced a standard thread plug they had laying around into my metric thread oil pan. 

This was after they told me I needed a new air filter because mine was torn... I watched through the big ass windows while the tech took it out and then intentionally ripped it...

I spoke with the manager and told him I was going to walk across the street to advance to buy a new filter, and they were going to pay for it. 

Then they pulled my car out of the shop, and the plug fell out, aling with the threads from my oil pan and the oil they just put in... 

The epitome of amateur hour.

Fuck jiffy lube.
This is rage bait. It has to be. No one this stupid would be allowed to touch the car. 

I want to see the receipt OP. How much did you pay?
Whose gonna tell him?
It‚Äôs Bakards 

Edit autocorrect on misspelled word purposely
Bro, it‚Äôs upside down
I didn't even know it would fit upside down. That's impressive
It's upside down.... how!??
"oops I wrecked because of your brake job you owe me a car because of gross negligence, jiffy lube" /s
My buddy did break pads for the first time a couple months ago and he did much better than this. Did they get a 8 year old to do the service?
https://i.imgur.com/Repq1xL.jpeg

This is a better picture that people were asking for.
I'm honestly surprised they managed to get it back together like that
Say what? I thought this was. Ask a shitty mechanic... 
Hopefully you're joking but oh my God it's like upside down and backwards and totally wrong whoever did it is pretty incompetent
![gif](giphy|xT5LMzIK1AdZJ4cYW4)
OMG, I just can't believe an idiot did that. But you know, from what I have seen lately coming out of our schools, I'm not surprised.
Well I have seen it all now. Actually unbelievable‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
It's impressive they were able to reassemble it like this
They messed up your brakes in a jiffy...
Pads upside down.
Hope you learned your lesson‚Ä¶
This can't actually be real...
Do you have any other damage to your car? This seems like the perfect excuse to get into an accident and sue the hell out of jiffy lube.
holy shit. If jiffy lube really did this you could probably sue them. whoever did this literally doesn‚Äôt know the first thing about it.
Who in their right mind goes to damn Jiffy lube for a brake job?!?! üòûüòûüòû
Mistakes were made.
TF?! The person that did this was high, drunk, and called himself an expert after watching Scotty on Toutube.
It's upside down, on the wrong side, and lacking brake paste üòÖ
Shade tree mechanic! Do you know how to tell if you have a shade tree mechanic? Leaves in his tool box!
Feels like a rage bait post.
This can‚Äôt be real
That's facing the wrong way
Stop going to these places for ur maintenance üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è. If it‚Äôs a simple oil change, sure. But even then, these places are very fast paced workplaces (Meaning they‚Äôll try to get it done as fast as possible) which also means, they mess up. (Rush jobs are not always done right). Do the basic maintenance such as oil changes, but if u need brakes or literally anything else, take it to a certified shop. Or even better, learn to do simple maintenance such as an oil change or air filters yourself. It‚Äôs not hard at all, all it takes is an open mind and not caring to get ur hands dirty.
Ha!
Haha! Whoever did this is dumber than a doorknob
It‚Äôs less work to do that correctly
Brake pads in upside down, I was about to go off in op for not changing rotors although they look minty, warped ones can cause a slight squeal but damn how do you even get that caliper back on with the pad upside down hahahaha
Go get them done correctly at another shop, and then get your money back.
Can‚Äôt place it but yes it looks off.  lol
How much did you pay ? lol
Gotta be kidding me
Your fault for going to jiffy lube
I mean, c'mon, this is a troll post, right? The caliper is rounded to match the wheel for a reason. There's a lot wrong here. Don't drive the car like that.
Looks like They forgot to grease the pad, too.
All that I can tell went wrong by what I see: wrong pads or upside down, no backplate lubrication, rotors should at least been turned. Just get your money back so you can put it towards an honest job. Sorry you experienced this.
Ai yi yi
Kinda looks like the inner pad is in the outside and up side down. Inner pads usually have that metal clip so it clips inside the brake caliper piston
Missing your clips that hold the pads the pads are upside down and definitely they should reimburse you for new rotors their fuck up. But hey pay for what you get never go places like that or Walmart
How did they manage to put the pads in upside-down??
Fail
r/justrolledintotheshop
Dear lord, they have notches so the fit properly.
Why go to Jiffy Lube for this service?
lol amazing
Unbelievable, And dude thought he did a good job, in record time.
YO IM CRYING ü§£ü§£ü§£ first comment ‚Äúit‚Äôs upside down‚Ä¶.‚Äù I don‚Äôt why that‚Äôs so funny to me. Maybe because it‚Äôs quite obvious that‚Äôs it‚Äôs upside down. Or maybe because I didn‚Äôt think someone so stupid would try working on cars for a living. I have actual tears rolling down my face.
That picture made me think this was r/askashittymechanic lol
Holy shit this whole comment thread üíÄ thanks guys I really needed this. And thank you op. This is gold.
Jesus fuckin murphy.
This level of incompetence is scary!!   

It‚Äôs a brake job!!   I can‚Äôt believe those guys are allowed to do mechanical repairs.  

Call them,  ask them to set up a tow truck and set up an appointment at their expense at a well trusted independent automotive repair shop.  

Ideally you, go meet the tow truck at the shop at time of drop off and talk to the owner/ technician at this shop and explain what happened.     
Have them document everything that‚Äôs done incorrectly. 
Get the required repairs done,  make sure they road tested the vehicle and confirm repairs.  

Have jiffylube pay the bill and never ever return to any of their establishments.
Do they not even vette employees? "Can you hold a spanner?" "Yep" Jobs yours!
Yikes.  I‚Äôd take it to a real mechanic and have them pay the bill. There is so much wrong in this photo. 

Please don‚Äôt let these quick lube places do more than an oil change.
BRO‚Ä¶.lol 

It‚Äôs expensive being cheap!
they are upside down... wow
Op did these brakes himself and didn‚Äôt want to get roasted because he couldn‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs wrong.
Omg I'm sorry that happened to you.  On the other hand that's fucking hilarious.  Whoever did this no matter what level of training the are at the should find a new career. Aside from that the fact that this got to the customer means that if it was someone in training their supervisor is also at fault for letting it go out like this.
Fucking people have to stop going to jiffy lubes biggest fuckwits I have ever seen. When we are hiring for new techs, if they use to be jiffy lube techs, it's an automatic no
Lmao never take anything to jiffy lube.
I've seen friction surface facing out, I've seen inboard pad switched to outboard, I've seen loose bracket bolts, but I've NEVER seen upside down flipped hotdog style. 

That's some wack shit
Average jiffy lube service job
Plz do not take your car to jiffy lube. This is par for the course.
Holy shit
Nothing suspicious about that: it's plain wrong and that's all there is too it.
I'm just curious to know how much they will charge to fix your problem. :D
That's actually impressive!
ass-backwards, and back-asswards.
Bro how??
WHAT THE FUCK?! In all seriousness the pads are on backwards at the very least, could also be the wrong pads.
Bro ü§£
That pad is both on the wrong side of the rotor and upside down, the only thing they did right was put the friction material to the rotor. Im impressed someone was dumb enough to manage that
Yeah when I worked at jiffy lube like 18 years ago we had very little idea what we were doing - largely improvising or asking the old heads for advice. Even back then, I wouldve seen a problem here. This was somebody's first and hopefully last brake job. I have no idea how they managed to even do this. A lot of pictures, and contact corporate before the store. Store will try and sweep it under the rug. Record the conversation with corporate.
It's upside down
Upside down pad and on wrong side of rotor.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èhow is this even possible?üòÜüòπ
The extra grind gives it more stopping power.
I desperately want this sub to be responsible for shutting down Jiffy Lube
That pad is on upside down
*checks subreddit to make sure it's not r/askashittymechanic*

Oh.. you're serious
Is this a joke? r/funny is for that stuff.
I'm not a mechanic and I knew it was upside down, wtf goes on at jiffy lube
They‚Äôre upside down and back to front. I don‚Äôt even know how they got the pads to stay in place like that. You should tow the car to them and get them to fix it properly. Ideally bring someone with you who knows enough about cars to supervise their work. Otherwise I would demand a refund (for labour charges at least) - they‚Äôre obviously incompetent.
Fuck jiffy lube! They forgot to put oil in my friends truck before and fucked the engine. They basically said prove it in court
Please never take your car to a quick lube type place ever again. They can literally cost you your life, the amount of insane mistakes and lazy shit I see from other people going there is mind boggling
Be me. Open post. "That doesn't look bad, I don't see wh...oh. Oh? OH!"
Your first mistake was going to jiffy lube.
[deleted]
I wouldn‚Äôt go to Jiffy Lube for a oil change let alone a brake pad change. Letting anyone who isn‚Äôt ASE certified touch your brakes is a massive mistake.
Yup! They put the rotor in upside-down, seen it right off...  üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ
heh... tooning
Lol it probably took so much time to shoehorn it in kime that.
![gif](giphy|3o7btTZu7wIBWHrHDa)
That takes dedication to guck it up that badly. I wouldn‚Äôt think it would be able to be put back together
I didn't realize brakes could be installed wrong at a mechanic shop.  How do they have a license?
This is fake. Has to be....
    V
bro some crackhead prob did Ur brakes or a 16 year old lol don‚Äôt take Ur shit to jiffy lube, U have a lancer, watch a youtube video how to do it, it‚Äôs super ez pz to do brakes and rotors
r/thanksihateit but seriously yeah those are upside down.... The dead give away to the guy who did it should have been the shape of the pad but also how it's touching the part of the rotor it's not supposed to be touching (the hub I think it would be called) wtf happened üò∂
Who did that?
So jiffy lube don't carry those brake pads, you sure you didn't dyi?
If this was done by Jiffy Lube (which I don't even know why people go there), I can almost guarantee that the brake flush was not done or done properly.
At least it wasn‚Äôt completely flipped so the metal backing was being used as the brake..lol
What an idiot the nubs go against the rotor but other than that all good üòä
Not only that it's back to front look at the metal clip that's meant to go into the caliper pisto
Installed the AUDM pads.
Naw. Just flip the car over!
Definitely, that‚Äôs worse than what someone who has no knowledge might do
The tech is legitimately fucking stupid. This is literally just matching shapes up. They teach you this shit in preschool. I could maybe see fucking up the brake bleeding or not tightening a bolt enough but this? A elementary school student could at least get this part right. How do you even mange to hire someone this fucking dumb? I wouldn't trust this person to do any sort of job. They would even manage to fuck up mopping.

Even OP who doesn't have any sort mechanic background could tell something is wrong here.
From everything I've heard about them, it sounds like Jiffy Lube not only shouldn't be allowed to do brakes, but shouldn't be allowed to do oil either, or, anything at all.
> This makes me irrationally angry

I don't think it's irrational.
Well yeah, jiffy lube doesn‚Äôt pay enough for quality work. I cost $45 an hour. They pay $15
Back in 2015-2016 when I worked at a Jiffy Lube fresh out of high school, it was our District Managers rule not to do brake jobs, as we were constantly going through employees and something like this could‚Äôve happened.
In trying to figure out how this even accidentally happens. I mean it‚Äôs so fucking easy to just put it in right it is truly mind boggling that this is possible without malicious intent
Plus parts.
For me it's that and also I legitimately enjoy doing the basic maintenance myself. I'm assured of the quality and correctness of parts/ lubricants and I don't need to drop off and pick up the vehicle from the shop. 

I also have young boys that love to help and I enjoyed teaching them how to maintain a vehicle, I think it's crucial information to at least know.
Same.
[removed]
Can you grab more pictures
Or for anything
It's honestly worse than amateures. I'm an amateur and would never do something like this lol. It's people that genuinely don't give a fuck about the cars they're working on.
That's kinda how I feel about all the 10 min oil change places. Don't trust them at all
$200 for the brake flush/installation. I had to buy the brake pads myself because Jiffy Lube didn't carry them. Advance Auto Parts asked me my car year make and model and so I assume they'd be the correct ones. Jiffy Lube's system was down so I had to pay cash and they didn't give me a receipt.
lol. I cannot. üòÖüòÖ
Don't blame this on weed. I do my brakes stoned every time and never fucked up this bad.
Your remaining faith in humanity is inspiring
How is this even possible? Your brake bracket won't allow you to force the brake pad into that position comfortably. It's like this asshole, used a fucking hammer to force the pad into the slot.
The radius should be accepting the rotor. Someone goofed here for sure
Right, inside to outside. What a boner
This is possibly the case, but there also exists pads which have the metal clips on inside and outside.
Brake pad goes into the square hole
Bruh, a lot of these places take anyone willing to work for at or almost minimum wage and just throw them in the shop. Training is a joke, assuming they even pretend to train them. My roommate worked at one for 6 months and during that time three cars got totaled due to someone not putting oil back into it, along with various other less serious idiocy. Maybe they're not all like that but, I'll never find out.
Yeah I've changed my own break pads and I didn't even need to watch a video it was so straight forward LMFAO.
You know what is a fun game to play? Go on Google maps and see how many Jiffy Lubes in your area have a trail of oil around their store.
Iffy Lube
I‚Äôve done about 6 brake jobs in my life and I even know that those are put on upside down by the pic. Don‚Äôt drive that car!
This is some round peg in a square hole type shit.
On my very first ever brake job when I was 19, I put the pad on backwards. In my defense, It was in my dad's driveway at night.¬†
I've never tried to do that before but I always thought that would be impossible
Sure what do you want to see?
Amateurs at least watch a YouTube video first lol
They owe you new pads and new rotors if that's done on all 4 sides. This is unacceptable. Contact management and corporate if you need to. Do not spend another cent with these idiots.
Depends on the caliper
What about the rotor? What hole does the rotor go in? That's right, it goes into the square hole.
Whoa that's wild cause you can't even spell brake pads correctly! Good for  you buddy!!
Just checked... all of them
Wow that's an eye opener lol.
Never done any brake jobs in my life and the first instant I saw it I knew it was upside down lol. It‚Äôs blatantly obvious.
19, first brake job, night in a driveway I can kind of forgive as we all make mistakes learning but upside down is a whole other level.¬†¬†
Different angles of that like same wheel but a little bit further right more interested in the metal clip you can see
You can see the curvature of the brake pad and the back of the brake pad rubbing into the rotor edging. That's how you know it's backwards. This was 100% put on backwards. You've also now got a flat edge being grinded into the brake pad itself by friction which destroys not only the pad but likely the rotor.
Or the hammer
Up next, we have the caliper. Do you see a hole the caliper goes into? You guessed it, it goes into the square hole. 
 
I love that video. Did you know they did a follow up? Google square hole 2
Do you work for jiffy lube or something?
Send me a few examples?
https://preview.redd.it/n998xeb58t2d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac6920814ccf4c26b4bf2c01e5891b4eee298e11

Hope these help
That clip should be in the piston on the other side of the rotor I believe....
No mate I know the pads is fitted incorrectly I mean it depends on the caliper wether it would let you put it in this way.
No way, i wish. Walmart oil change.
Here's one with a few trails out into the street and one that drove around the building and right back in https://maps.app.goo.gl/g3LrDa79vKrShsmK6
Maybe you didn't need new rotors before, but you sure do now.

OP, don't go to Jiffy Lube for anything ever.  This is the type of workmanship you can expect from the lowest bidder who doesn't invest in training their employees.

If you don't know anything about a particular topic, you need to find an expert and pay them what they are worth, the "I know a guy who can do it cheaper" businesses aren't the place for an uninformed consumer to be shopping at.
Sorry mate I mean where the brake pad is on the pic you have taken shows the left side could you show us the other side of that brake pad
Yeah I justed wanted a better pic to keep and share to people about how fucked some mechanics are
I've never run into a calliper that allows you to do this without using a hammer.
You'll get there one day. Remember to take your brakes.
I second; never go to jiffy lube for anything ever. I personally know a girl that went to jiffy lube for an oil change. They drained out her old oil and forgot to add the new oil. They returned the vehicle to her with no motor oil. She made it about a mile down the road before her motor blew.

*
Sorry only one pic showed
Iv seen this numerous times when it's the wrong brake pads used
It could also not be the right pad for the car
Similar thing happened to a friend of mine but Jiffy Lube actually siezed the engine during a "flush".

The Jiffy Lube techs drained the oil then upsold him on an engine flush procedure where they added a quart of something and then revved the engine for 20 minutes straight.  They only had a quart of the flush additive and no oil in the crank case and the engine seized after a few minutes.  The car only had about 20k miles on it.

Jiffy Lube tried to send him to another shop they had an arrangement of some kind with and when that shop owner laughed at hearing the story and said that this happened semi-regularly my buddy had the vehicle towed to the dealership and got Jiffy Lube to buy him a new engine.
In all honesty it's fucked, take it to a different garage to have it fixed and take the bill to them with pics or take it back to them and tell them to fix it with a refund.
I think it's fair to say there were multiple fuckups here.
I wouldn‚Äôt do that. Typically, these quick lube places will specify who they want to fix their mistakes. It‚Äôs often times in their contract. You can‚Äôt just go to another shop and have them fix the quick lube‚Äôs mistakes and then take it back to the quick lube for reimbursement
Would you bet your life and the lives of whoever is in your car that someone who did *that* pad swap, is able to do a brake job correctly?

That is so fucking wrong that the entire organization should be abandoned.  Not only is the tech a danger to every customer whose car they touch, but what organization trained this tech and isn't doing even the most basic quality checks after their work?

Best case is OP gets a full refund and is able take that money to a real shop to get the brakes done correctly.
> will specify who they want to fix their mistakes

Silencer Family Photo
This was from February of last year.

I‚Äôve slowed down a bit but a buddy asked if I could post my collection.
I can't even afford to look at this picture.
The ATF built a branch off these tax stamps alone
This some Genghis Khan levels of children
Bro just looked at the entire silencer shop website and said ‚Äúyeah, I‚Äôll take one.‚Äù
Hi, it‚Äôs me. Your long lost son.
Seems like common use to me.
That‚Äôs like $1 million
What‚Äôs that weird looking green guy in 2nd row?
What!? No oil filter can?

The pillow adapter is awesome though.
If I counted correctly there's over $23,000 in silencer tax stamps in this photo.
Jesus what's the one that's like 3ft long?
Name checks out. Impressive!
I'm too retarded can someone do the rough math for me
Do you have an OnlyCans I can subscribe to?

What's the worst one and why?
I was trying to remember your username awhile ago to show someone the wizard staff. Definitely the best one in the collection.
Wow..... just wow
I mean I hit the $5000+ in stamps mark but you win ü•áüèÜüèÖ
Thank you sir for being the majority financier of the ATF. 

I feel poor just looking at that picture =(
Favorite brand?
I want that black powder ‚Äúnot a silencer‚Äù silencer
No country for old men lookin ahhhh on the bottom right lol
Stop it, my penis can only get so hard
I can't believe no one has said it yet....

*Your username checks out*
That‚Äôs a salary of suppression.
‚ÄúGot all these approved in just 2 days‚Äù
Why is it that when guys (like yourself) that have these very large and extensive collections there is either just 1 or none of the flow-through style suppressors? People that post that have a few overall typically have at least 1 or more flow style cans. Are flow-style cans regarded as heresy and non-purist by true NFA champions with 20+ cans like yourself?
Be honest - how many times have you dual-wielded the maxims?
Second row, third from the right, what is that guy?
Shhhhhhhhhhhit
Do you have a host for each suppressor as well?
What's the crazy long one running between three rows? Integrally suppressed barrel?
Potato
Well, I am *poor*
Two LaRues? Seems excessive. 

&#x200B;

J/k this is awesome.
No oil filter?  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Do you currently have a favorite/go to for 556 and or 300blk?
Oh my God I‚Äôm jealous!  Please end my misery and tell me what can I should get for my 11.5 sr-15.  Sound suppression is top priority.
‚ÄúWho is your daddy and what does he do‚Äù

*arnold voice*
Well, shit.
Is the Maxim 9 full config quieter than a regular 9mm handgun host with a dead air wolfman or similarly performing suppressor attached?
Very impressive, how long has it taken to acquire everything?
Damn!! I thought I had a lot ü§£

Favorite 9mm sub gun can?

Favorite rimfire?

Favorite 5.56?

Favorite mounting system?

I was going to break my phone if the caption said "haha, batch approval, 6 days".
Even though it didn't, I'm still considering breaking my phone because all it does is make me realize I'm failing.
Is the pillow an NFA registered silencer? :)
The fuck is wrong with you‚Ä¶.

We should hang out some time
The ATFs final boss
Just buy a machine gun already. Jesus
Looks like yermom‚Äôs toy collection üòù
$24,400 in tax stamps. Flex harder dude‚Ä¶.damn.
I cant math well. But thats a big number of maths
You and pewscience should meet up and add to the data.
What y‚Äôall gettin on a maxim?
What's going on with the suppressors on the Beretta barrels? Looks like an interesting attachment system
OMG!!! There is a heaven :) That is awesome
Hey I got my rc2 thru Capitol, are u the owner?
Assuming they‚Äôre all suppressors, $25,000 in stamps alone
I really need to get a second job‚Ä¶
ATF was able to pay some clerks salary just off this guys tax stamps
Fuck you, sir.
What‚Äôs the ones in the middle to the right? The beluga whale looking one?
What is that one going from the bottom row streching the two above rows?

I gotta ask, how's the Jesse James can?
I love my maxin 9.
Sir we need to check your cancer levels from all that gas brrrr
I can‚Äôt afford one of those
Hi its me, your wife.
Holy shit dude
This man said, ‚ÄúI wanna pay more taxes than Elon‚Äù
Dude how **dare** you have a JJFU and not sound test it publicly?
I mean this literally- what suppressors do you not have that you want?
Holy frijoles. I just want to hold them in my hands
Damn bro. Bravo üëè
Do they still make/sell the Maxim 9mm pistols? It‚Äôs a dream
Gun for me
I was just down there a couple weeks ago to get a muzzle brake and adapter for my YHM R9.
Not married and zero children
Nice. Where the Hux?
Are you looking for people to adopt? Dude that‚Äôs one hell of a freaking collection.
Approximate calculation sits at $24,000 just for the stamps!!! Well done my friend
My LGS has about a 1/10th of this for sale
Damn boy. I thought I had a lot. üôá

Wooden floor, 7,200 dollars

Sand bags for more accurate shooting, 29 dollars

Casually posting almost $25k in suppressors. Priceless.
‚ÄúNo guys, seriously. FUCK MUZZLE BLAST!‚Äù
freaking impressive sir. 

equally impressed that you dont have a cgs helios qd or the ti version. not saying you need one , but curious as to why you dont have one. you obviously have 30 other cans that do the same thing, so if thats the only reason i get that. 


and whats that jesse james football actually sound like?
I count about 130 silencers.  That‚Äôs $26,000 in tax stamps alone.
This is what 800 years worth of waiting on Form 4‚Äôs looks like.
Thats gotta be at least 3
I spy a Jesse James football!
Well damn. How much have you used the osprey‚Äôs? I really want to get a 2.0, is there much performance difference between the 45 and 9 when shooting 9mm?
For those wondering that‚Äôs about $26000 in tax stamps ü§Ø
Bro let me have one
What is that enormously long suppressor on the left taking up 3 rows lol.¬†
Jesus Christ
$24,800 in tax stamps‚Ä¶
Damnnnn ‚Ä¶. If I‚Äôm counting right that‚Äôs around $26,000.00 in JUST tax stamps!!! WOW
Nice, you have a maxim 50. Those are not common.
No otter creek?
So many questions. Which one is your favorite, which one‚Äôs performance surprises you both good and bad, which one is the quietest given the caliber. Etc etc etc
What is the suppressor 2nd row, 3rd from right?
What‚Äôs the can to the left of the omega 300?
If those are his cans I‚Äôm highly curious to see his gun collection.
Christ and I thought I was obsessed
Awesome collection. What is the can circled here (the fatboy)?

How many have you not shot?
What... no integrellay suppressed Sub2000? Fail
Holy shit Dad is that You?

Rare photo of Chuck Norris‚Äô china cabinet.
Ok.. now that‚Äôs a flex that I approve
I can't decide if the stamp for a pillow or the XM177 Moderator is more absurd from a legal standpoint
Who makes the one that looks like it was crimped with vice grips? 

I see at least one person bought into Jesse James suppressor technology. I remember when that one was made. It was all over the gun magazines.
Did you sell a kac qdss nt4 to fund all of these?
if I counted correctly, 24k in stamps alone lmao
I want to know how they get stored?
The second row to the top and third one in, what caliber is that for?? 


Also love the collection, I just picked up my third and felt like I had too many ü•¥
I‚Äôve never been more convinced that famous billionaires use Reddit than this photo right here
Money aside that's a lot of time waiting. So question.. Is there a max stamp per year?
Didn't know the NFL made suppressors
The pillow does it for me.
You must really hate having money

When did you get your maxims? I bought 3 the first day my dealer was able to get ahold of them and man they are trash. The trigger is so bad that even with all the aftermarket parts, I still can‚Äôt enjoy them.

Wondering if they have made any improvements since.
I like the direct thread pillow silencer
Even makes us self conscious.
Why?
Wtf why??
Honestly, why? The government thanks you for all those unused tax stamps.
Sorry but fuck.u
Why
More money than sense. LOL. I'm still (somewhat) jealous. But my logical side just can't get over the useless overlap in utility, all while "donating" all that tax money to the government.  Ugh. That other part of my brain, however...is smiling.
Neither can i
Yeah same here!! I see he has multiple SilencerCo hybrid 46s & Omega 36Ms/46Ms. Which is the only 2 Cans I have lol. Must be nice. I see decades worth of ATF wait times between the lot. & also (most likely) a big number of ‚Äúbatch approvals I would assume lol. This is so badass though. I‚Äôm curious to see his gun room now, even though I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be just as sick(or jelly, lol). Am I blind or does he not have any Surefire cans? If I had this many I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd have atleast 2 RC2‚Äôs (a 556 & a 30 cal) as well as a mini 566K. He looks to be well invested in SilencerCos ASR‚Äôs which is what I use as well & like pretty well. Dope Collection!!

Meaningful flow through is relatively new tech which is probably part of it.
Partially because they're newer and also partially because they don't generally perform as well in sound reduction as non-flowthrough designs. Flow through is a trade-off just like anything in physics. The longer you spread out the release of pressure the lower the peak volume. Flow through trades some sound suppression for more consistent performance in gas operated systems and less gas back to the shooter.
Flow through is VERY recent technology comparatively.

It‚Äôs also a trade-off in and of itself. Low back pressure means it‚Äôs quieter with supersonic, but not as quiet with subsonic.

I‚Äôd rather have movie quiet subsonics than have Hux quiet supersonics.
Someone who appreciates the benefit of reduced backpressure would never buy 100 traditional cans
When have I not lol!

Salvo because it fucks
SilencerCo Wizard Staff
It‚Äôs quiet
I buy what I want
Yessir
I like the Dead Air Wolverine
Jesse James Aerosonic
I have a Surefire M4FA
That's $25,200 in tax stamps alone (x$200)
Salvo. Sounds great & removes so much recoil
Oh, there‚Äôs plenty out there ü§òüèº
Mine are from the 1st run. We had them before everyone. Sure the trigger wasn‚Äôt the best but it was a suppressed handgun. We‚Äôve even had Maxim 9 parties. If the trigger ruins it for you then sell them. People are getting 2-3k for them
Why have guns? Why is an anti 2A question 

I suppress all my guns
If you were going to suppress a 20 inch .30-06, which one would you pick? Hunting rifle so weight is a consideration.
I was going to judge because of the JJ one (that you posted separately), but I really can't after seeing this lol.
Probably close to $100k in cans and stamps.
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm a Labrador
holy shit, i didnt think anyone actually bought one of those.
That would be hilarious.
is it the quietest can you have?
I thought the wizard staff was just marketing- kudos for SilencerCo making one and it‚Äôs hilariously awesome you actually got one.  I‚Äôm low key jelly.
[deleted]
Thank you I cant count that high. Beautiful collection man
Actually fun w 22lr
Yessir
Impressive Bro!
That makes the most sense. Collections like these don‚Äôt form overnight.
I can see that its because they are new and large collections typically take many years to amass. The fact of them being a tradeoff should seem to make them more appealing in terms of connoisseur appeal. I am sure all these have tradeoffs of all varieties. Seems that one would want a few flow cans to truly represent everything that is out there (unless there is something ‚Äúmore‚Äù to it like I was attempting to infer)
I agree there is a tradeoff and with all that you say but why not have both if you can? OP surely has the ability, so is there is some reason that I don‚Äôt see that OP does? I figure he is the one to ask since someone with this level of commitment probably has forgotten more about cans than what I know.
Thanks brother thats cool as hell
Thanks for the info. I want the quietist John Wick setup possible. Right now I‚Äôm leaning towards P226 with Wolfman and a booster if necessary.
That's awesome
Wow‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all.
Jk, much respect for your stamp collection üòá
I‚Äôm just a tiny bit jealous.
I should have snatched one on sale for 799.00 but now the parts are also obsolete I‚Äôm guessing.
Holy! What‚Äôs the total for the value of the cans?üëÄ
You mean it wasn‚Äôt 76dB or whatever he claimed? üòÇ
Well if u ever wanna offload it since ya got 2 of em‚Ä¶üòÖ
Tisk tisk. I love mine.
How long did this take friend?
üòÇ  not according to this photo.  I didn‚Äôt even need to look at what cans were there, knew you were a G within seconds.   And It‚Äôs not every day I see someone that makes my stuff look like chump change.   Gd, I‚Äôm truly impressed.  

If you‚Äôre ever in NC hit me up.
User name checks out. Carry on. You‚Äôre doing God‚Äôs work.
Completely agree.  Super nice collection.

I just wish there was a way to effectively suppressor revolvers as that's the majority of my meager collection.
Thanks for the input, i was leaning 45 so i can throw it on more stuff, but didn‚Äôt know if there was audible difference!
My wallet is scared of me
Noice, I run a gun store, and we picked one of these up when they were initially released, and held onto it all the way until last year when we sold it on funbroker. It was really cool to send it directly to the customers door.
Salvo 12, one that many people are disappointed by or say isn‚Äôt worth it, interesting! Which was the most expensive?
Very neat, I‚Äôve never seen anything like it, suppresses well or not really?
ü§î that green can don‚Äôt look anything like the chimera I have lol
Oh nevermind, the muzzle break on that other can fooled me into thinking it was an omega 300. But what is that green can?
I read up on it some, damn that is (or was?) expensive. How's the performance compared to your other 5.56 cans? Does it live up to the hype?
Yessir!!!
Nice
Is that before or after it was brought back?
Tell me about it. I passed on a $1,100 one back in 2017. Just saw a used one on GunBroker at $2300. Crazy how certain items go up in price.
It could be one of those little roadside attraction museums. Like in a fancy remodeled camper/rv. Suppressor aficionados from far and wide could visit to proclaim ‚ÄúHoly fuck!‚Äù
üòÇ good save them bastards some gas money‚Ä¶ I just got an approval back‚Ä¶ submitted last year July 13 ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I need one of those as a joke for NRL marches now.
Still looks like a potato.
Username checks out.
Oh okay I'll take a look
I see a hunting rifle without a threaded barrel.
That's not the question.

Why spend the money/tax to have several dozen suppressors when a fraction of them can function across multiple calibers or platforms with the same caliber/connection?
Look for a modern can in the 6-7‚Äù length range. Thicccness for the richness
Sico scythe ti
TBAC ultra 7 or go ahead and get the Magnus if you don‚Äôt mind the extra length.
Quietest can? AB suppressors Raptor 10 with the 5" reflex
Thunder beast ultra 7 or Magnus K for weight and performance.
Lux Titanium comes in at just under 10oz and has a good balance between weight and noise suppression.       

The Peak 30 comes in under 12oz and a little cheaper than the Lux.     

I love my VOX S and VOX K2, haven't tried out either of the ones I've suggested but have seen videos. Both seem like great options.
Lol! ü§òüèº
Almost $27k in stamps. I‚Äôve gotten some deals along the way but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs over 100k
Fucking liar. You business bears are always trying to pass yourselves off as other, more respectable critters...
Yeah, I have never seen one in person or even someone post it, but this man has one of everything lol
I think my KAC XM9 is
It sounds great too
Should be $0 üòî

Wait that pillow has a tax stamp?
25k worth of stamps here?
I guess the potato silencer started sprouting lil mini silencers so thats why its missing

Most expensive was my Jesse James Aerosonic
Suppresses extremely well
Crushed TBAC 338 BA can from a recall that we welded an end cap & bravo adapter too
3k & quieter than most of the 556 cans out there
First crushed & then brought back. As far as Jesse‚Äôs can, it performs extremely well.
Damn, cheapest I‚Äôve seen is 1400

Probably one of the integrally suppressed ones
Same reason that all my firearms have sights & or optics & magazines. They are all set up. 

That is fine when starting out or you have to allocate your funds differently but that‚Äôs not my situation.

When I started out, I did have to share my can across hosts & it got old fast. 

Some are also collectible
What about a 17.3 fal?
AB Raptor for me. One of the best 30cal cans I've heard when you factor weight in. Almost unbeatable IMO. I have a Scythe on the way too. BTW, badass pick with a shorty ought6.
Or Dominus if you don't want to pay the extra for the Magnus.
You.... Have more than half of my house's value in cans. That's enough reddit for today
I don't know bud. You'd have to be pretty dang close if you aren't. $27K in stamps is 135 NFA items. Assuming they are $500 a piece, you're looking at $67,500+$27,000 = $94,500

Yeah, thats the only thing I can think of that makes this phenomenon make sense.
You‚Äôre clearly the expert, so I‚Äôll look into it.

I guess it ought to be considering it dwarfs the nearby Tranquilo.
I‚Äôm jealous as fuck by the way.
The JJ can just looks odd. I figured the shape would be good for gas expansion and cooling, but it just looks kinda goofy. Speaking of old cans, my lgs has an old 5.56 red jacket firearms suppressor that they've had since it was released.
Recently?
We all love potatoes, that's why we celebrate March 17th.

Been looking at a siete but thinking about doing another custom short action in 6creed as a sister gun to my 300prc that I just finished. What are your thoughts on it?
JFC, where do you live? That's like 6 months rent in LA.
Yes but it's also a pretty small place

Dude said he would be surprised if he was over 100k. I was being EXTREMELY generous with the $500 assumption. He said in a different comment he has 134 NFA items. I don‚Äôt know about you but my purchases average $700 before the stamp and I have a 22 LR can to bring my 4 can average down lol.

I would not live in LA if you gave me a house for FREE.  California is for vacation! Fuck that place

I wouldn't even take a free vacation to CA. With so many options, I'll stick to states with constitutional carry
Personally I like Louisiana.

I agree.  
I live in Indiana, 
1. Constitutional Carry, no asking permission 
2. no magazine capacity limits

4. Low taxes
I took that as LA-Los Angeles, CA
But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I also politely decline a free home in Louisiana too!   Quite happy here in the quiet Midwest

Just purchased a car on Saturday and the check engine light came on on Sunday ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Check engine on day after I purchased the truck ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hello, I‚Äôve just purchased a 2018 F-150 XLT V8 on Saturday and the check engine light came on Sunday. 

I took it to a pre-purchase inspection and the mechanic told me that everything was good except it needed a new battery. 

Before I was able to replace the battery the check engine light came on and spit out these codes, I just replaced the battery but the check engine light is still on.

I am hoping that all these codes are related to a bad battery and that all that is necessary is a check engine light reset, any help would be appreciated!

no, what happened was the codes were cleared and I'm guessing the inspector didn't scan the truck and see what monitors have run and passed.
Cylinder 1 and 6 fire on the same crankshaft position on these. There's a chance this is a due to a crank position sensor or a misfire monitor. There are procedures in Forscan to reset/relearn/recalibrate the misfire monitor.
Clear the codes and drive it. See if the codes come back.

modern cars can be extremely sensitive to voltage changes or low battery.
Looks  like a truck with +100k and needs a tuneup.
This is basic maintenance. Dealer may have hidden it from you, but it's not hard to fix.
Change the plugs, if it repeats, change the coil packs. This is a "2 beer" job.
It could very well be the battery as newer cars are becoming increasingly reliant on batteries with all its systems. Mechanics likely right‚Ä¶
I had a mile long list of codes on a new to me car this last year, and it had the same battery code at the end. Changing the battery fixed it. Ymmv, but with the many electronic systems cars have nowadays, a bad battery makes the computers act fucky.
Replace the battery first.  Computers in modern vehicles are very sensitive to voltage. If they're not getting enough of it they can give all sorts of crazy readings.
Put a new battery in. Bad batteries can cause weird issues
I don't exactly about this truck, but I know low voltage can trigger certain things in some cars that are more sensitive to voltage drops.

If you took it in for a pre-inspection did the report show they scanned for codes and readiness tests? Because if you didn't say you got it inspected I'd just assume the owner cleared the codes, let you drive it away, then when the codes/issues were ready they popped back up like you saw happen within a day.
I don‚Äôt know how many miles are on it, but Ford coils start dying around 100-130k miles. Swap some coils with other cylinders and see if the misfire moves. Crappy that the seller did this to you, but may not be that bad of an issue.
Next time you get a pre-purchase inspection done on a car, make sure you have a mechanic clearly state they will do a visual inspection AND check the vehicle diagnostic system to see if codes are active or have been recently cleared. People often sell cars where they know about issues but don‚Äôt disclose them, so the onus is on you the buyer to make sure you aren‚Äôt buying someone else‚Äôs problems. 

I‚Äôve always owned 10+ year old cars and do most of my own maintenance on them.
I had that truck, cam phasers were bad and replaced under recall if that helps at all.
How many miles since codes were cleared? Should show on the reader.
Check spark plugs and coils.
Take that thing back! Call the lender cancel the loan
Replace battery, take pics of code and clear codes. Drive for some time. Re scan and following diagnostics from this point
Looks like they sold it just in time
Does it still run like shit even though new battery was replaced?
Put some repairs into this truck and love it! Great buy is my guess once you get this straightened out. It will be worth the time and money. Plugs, wires, bad fuel,
Easy fix, Ctrl + Z a few times until you've unpurchased the vehicle and go buy another one, if same problem continues just redo step 1
Pretty sure a dying battery can make all the sensors go haywire and throw codes like this.

Best case is these are sensor errors not mechncial issues.
"Needs a new battery" is where my hackles get raised on a car purchase, especially when it comes to dirty code clearing which is what they did. You're selling a $20k vehicle but you can't put a $100 battery in it before putting it up for sale?
Based on what I see I would wager you just have an old shitty battery that‚Äôs causing all the other codes. Load test the battery if you can, or just go ahead and change it out.
Guessing spark plugs. But check the east stuff first. Get battery load tested. Because of what happened in the 99-01‚Äôs blowing plugs out through the hood and the 05‚Äôs 5.4‚Äôs plugs getting stuck in head by carbon build up many are scared of changing plugs. Also could be a botched plug change that didn‚Äôt use the conductor kits. A huge plug gap can cause low voltage
Could just need new spark plugs, usually when you get a misfire code on all cylinders it because the spark plugs need to be replaced, try that .
Spark plugs will do that to my 2012 screw with the eco boost. Plugs only last 50-70 k miles in mine. I‚Äôm on the 8 th set I believe
If it was a dealership, have the fucking sales man make sure it‚Äôs fixed NOW!! You a have a return window.. not sure how long in your state.
Change coils and spark plugs??
Clearing that Check Engine light is how you got fucked!
Typical of used cars. Someone will flash the ECU and then sell it so the problems aren‚Äôt seen until you drive it around 200 miles.
Yikes. It's built Ford tough tho
I think you have to reprogram the battery on those f150‚Äôs. Otherwise have a compressional test done on those two cylinders.
Always test drive.. takes a mile or so for light to come back on after you clear the codes
check the grounds on it.
Bad fuse?
States have what‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe Lemon Law‚Äù u can definitely get all your money back
new spark plugs, wires, and if that doesn't work then ignition coils, this repair always makes a car kick again, I actually envy your repairs
Dude, every single one of those codes involve a loss of electrical power, or a undervoltage condition. All of which could be due to a weak battery or one with a dead cell. Like seriously. Just replace the battery, request the seller to replace the battery. Or return the damn thing. If they don't wanna take it back take them to small claims court.  Like I'm not sure this is a legit question or someone trolling
If u purchase from a dealer lemon law
I bought a car back in 2018 with 180,000 and was told that it just needed an oxygen sensor hence why the engine check light was on. I trusted this person (seller) as it WAS a close individual. Turns out it was an EVAP code, first red flag.

I did all the maintenance with a local mechanic. Also a close individual and car ran fine for a while. I bought a scanner to check out the codes and stuff. After a couple drives the computer finally figured out there was a misfire in cylinder 3 (after cleared these misfires need some drive cycles to show up, hence why only the EVAP showed up at first).

My EX-mechanic at the time just told me to ignore it. (He knew something bad was happening and didn't want to do work, the guy just wanted to do easy jobs). Second red flag.

The car lasted 2 years until the engine got a misfire in all the cylinders and would no longer stay on, went to another more reputable mechanic, rebuild needed. Turns out there was no compression in Cylinder 3 and driving like this for over a year made things worse.

One has to choose better the people you trust.
im so sorry for your loss
Typical Ford vehicle reaction. Coil packs. I had a brand new F-150 ecoboost that needed 3 done at 167 miles.
They certainly can be. A dead battery won't have the spark to fire the engine properly. However, once the engine is running the alternator should take over. One easy test you can do with a $5 harbor freight voltmeter is to check the voltage with the car off. Then start the truck. See if the voltage comes up. If the voltage does not come up or especially if it drops you have a bad alternator. It's unusual for an alternator to be bad on such a new vehicle but it happens. 

If it were me, what I would do, get the new battery, install that, pick up your voltmeter if you don't already have one. Check the voltage before you start the truck. Make note of it. Start the truck, recheck the voltage and make sure the voltage is going up from your previous reading
I would return that truck honestly,

Those engines are bad for torque convertor / transmission issues,

As well as a major issue with the Cam Phasers going bad.

Both usually leading to catastrophic failure of a major component

My dad just traded his 2017 in due to these issues after a year of ownership and getting a 15k repair bill
Change all your spark plugs and ignition coils. Should fix the problem
Ford moment
What‚Äôs sadder than him scamming you is that you tried to buy a ford
Those are really, really bad fucking codes.
Google states 

"If P0301 is the only code, then investigate the most common causes. Assess the spark plugs for cylinder #1 for damage or dirt. Many times, replacing a spark plug will remedy the problem. In the case that all the spark plugs are fine, look for any coil pack wires or coil packs that need replacing."

Swapping out spark plugs are an easy fix. Hopefully its something small like that
Get new plugs distributor cap and rotor wires for like 200 bucks and it should fix the p0300 codes
First problem is you bought a ford
Ford trash lol
Buy from a dealer or a personal sale ? Either way I believe the sale was recent enough to look into lemon laws. Worth a shot op
Lemon law
Yay!! An engine rebuild ‚ù§Ô∏è
Blown head gasket most likely
Get the bludriver hookup on amazon
Private seller?
Do they share a coil pack?
Misfires are typically spark plugs and/or coil packs going bad. Not the worst thing in the world
You need new spark plugs.
Throw some plugs in and you're golden.
[Seems like you‚Äôre in the Hoosier state. Here‚Äôs a rundown of your legal options, the sooner you act the better.](https://www.yourlemonlawrights.com/faq/indiana)
They cleared the light before you bought it. But you should of been able to tell it was running weird with sll those misfires
Nothing to do with the battery, and checking should be like this:
-Spark plug condition.
-air leaks but i d doubt it (fuel trims to be checked)
-camshaft position sensor.
-compression and leak down text. 

These are what i think should be checked from the top of my head. 
But i wouldn‚Äôt be discouraged could still be a good buy my friend, good luck and update us please.
Any inspection not done with a two way scanner that can operate modules is not an inspection.
Probably coil packs just swap each with a known good and see if the issue stays or moves , if it moves it‚Äôs the packs, if not it‚Äôs likely the plugs, if it‚Äôs not that fuel to cylinders or compression .. doubt it‚Äôll go that far.
Looks to me like a bad battery. Or at least that is where I would go first.
COMM (u-code) error and battery error codes were hard stored and likely related. They should be cleared with a scan tool. The two misfires are either a faulty plug or faulty COP (coil-over-plug)! Swap COPs to non-erroring cylinders and see if the code chases the cylinder, if so, its a bad COP, if not its a bad spark plug! One of these two is the ‚Äúlikely‚Äù cause but not the only thing that can cause it! Have it professionally diagnosed!
Did you reset the battery management system?

The previous owner be like
Man, I hate that for you. Hopefully you can get it looked at and it's something minor.
Coil packs and plugs. Seems like an inexpensive maintenance issue.
r/askcarsales
Cam phasers?
So if he ra. The vehicle up to operating temp drove it and all that and those just popped up with the low bat voltage. Check battery connections.

Did the guy have a license of any sort? Who does an inspection even basic without bringing a scan tool.
Take it back if you can.
probably coil packs...ez to change and cheap
lemon law take it back
check your states lemon laws
My F150 did the same as in codes. I changed the coils and spark plugs and that fixed it
For everyone saying ‚Äúlemon law‚Äù, you should learn what the hell lemon laws are first.

They don‚Äôt cover used cars (with few exceptions) and even new cars it doesn‚Äôt mean the dealer will take it back for a problem.
Looks like it's time for a regular tuneup
I mean you can start with plugs and coils on cylinder 1 and 6. At least plugs are maintenance item
My first tought was battery. Yes possible codes were cleared happens all the time but pre purchase inpection usually plugs in to Obd port and would let know know of cleared and pending codes. Change battery since you know it needs it speacially if your truck has been sitting in really cold climate. Then clear codes go from there.
Code readers are pretty cheap nowadays and even if you want something professional you can buy Launch scan tools right on amazon.
If you don‚Äôt already know what to check, there‚Äôs no reason to try, take it to a mechanic. If you try it yourself, it may coast ya a lot more money.
Change the battery... Ive had bad ones do weird shit to me before
Plugs and coils would be standard first things to check although 1-6 missing could indicate other sensor issues
Congrats üéâüéâüéâ
Misfires could be anything from trivial stuff like spark plugs/wires/coils to a failing head gasket or other major engine problem.
If you got it from a dealership, I‚Äôd talk to the salesperson you purchased it from and let them know what‚Äôs going on. Any good dealership would rectify this. I had a similar issue with a Volvo I purchased. Took it back the next day and they ended up replacing a cat. Worse they can say is no and if they do, you can leave a review of your experience.
Anytime I get a laundry list of codes getting thrown at the same time, it's almost always an electrical issue. A bad battery is a good place to start. Also, sometimes the engine light can stay on for a few engine cycles.
Don‚Äôt feel bad, my wife and I bought a Nissan rogue with 75k miles on it. Everything looked good until 77k miles a piece of metal just fell off of the rear wheel hub. Looked closer and it‚Äôs all rusted to utter shit. It‚Äôll be an easy rig up job to make it safe enough to sell but now I know next time to do a detailed look underneath the vehicle. We made a mistake trusting a dealership that my family has been going to for 20 plus years. If anyone is in NE NC don‚Äôt go to a place that rhymes with ‚ÄúBall Lord of EC‚Äù
Did you buy itvas-is or with warranty? How is the car running at the moment? Clear the codes and drive it some more, you already know what codes it has now. If the battery died or is weak it could've caused these codes to trigger since the car didn't/ doesn't have enough power to run everything the way it was intended.
Might be lucky enough that new plugs and/or coils might fix them.
Not a big deal. New plugs, new coils.
How many miles on this 2018 F-150?
It could be bad COPs over the 1 and 6 pistons.
Has the timing chain been checked. Depending on the mileage and the fact that 1 and 6 are in the same position could mean that the timing is off or the chain is stretched.
Delete the codes and see what happens. If the misfire codes pop back up, you have an issue. You can also just do reset when you unplug the battery. If you don‚Äôt want to bring it to someone.
Well, you didn't do anything wrong nor did you make a mistake.  You bought a truck that for all intents and purposes had solid maintenance history.  How many miles on the truck? Perhaps the plugs are just due to be changed.... as for the dead battery... it's entirely possible that the dead battery reset the codes, and it wasn't driven enough for the codes to manifest before getting your pre Inspection. If you aren't noticing the misfiring while driving and you just got codes to come up... chances are it's a relatively easy fix to replace the plugs, or wire/ coil on plug ( not sure what ignition system is on those).  Still money you shouldn't have to spend... however seeing comments saying that you should have done this or that... well that ain't right.  You did your due diligence.  Whoever you bought it from should be responsible for replacing the battery although that's difficult to go back and get from a private seller; as it's assumed used vehicle purchases are "as is".  It would be a different scenario if say you brought it to your inspection technician and they overlooked a bad transmission or blown head gasket.
Good news, your new four cylinder is working great!
You buy a sketchy Ford, you get a sketchy Ford.
Just looking at the picture and nothing else... I knew this was fucking Ford.  Henry rolled over in his grave long ago.
Anytime someone says rebuilt and all kinds of new parts i become cautious. I'm not doing all that work or paying someone for all that just to give my ride away.
Some codes will go away, some codes won‚Äôt.      Chances are that those codes came on due to the battery being bad, but didn‚Äôt clear themselves after replacing the battery.     Delete the codes with a code reader and see if they come back again after successful deletion.    If not, then worry about the issues at hand.       Weak batteries tend to do strange things to vehicles.    Throw up every code in the book, none of which seemingly lead to a weak battery.
Is the truck actually misfiring?
Does it run like shit or is it fine? Sensing via analog DC voltage is prone to weird issues when the system is under voltage so battery is a possibility.
What's the mileage? When were the Spark plugs replaced?
Those misfires may be something simple and easy to fix
Update: I took it to a different shop, they reset the light and said there are no more misfires.

They also found some sand on some engine components‚Ä¶.
It's all related to low voltage a new batteries where you should start and get the codes cleared missfire can also be cause by bad fuel but shouldn't since you just brought it.
Looks like you need to change plugs and wires.
For the love of god please return it. Coming from someone that had just ‚Äúa simple fix‚Äù turn into a new engine amongst other things, it most likely will only get worse. $13,000 later, I paid more fixing the car than I paid for the car itself. Once I realized I bit off more than I could chew, I had to just keep sinking money into it just to get it to a point where I could sell it. It‚Äôs not old or rare, just go find a different one without issues.
Find out if your state has a cancellation period for vehicle purchases. Many will let you cancel a car purchase for 1 to 3 days after buying it.
Battery most likely
If you just purchased it. Bring it back and make them fix it. Lemon laws are there for a reason. Hopefully you're in a place that has lemon laws.
So replace the battery and see what happens
I would take it back if you could; or get a REAL assessment of the condition of the engine if you really like the truck, before going back to the dealer.

It might be just the battery or spark plugs,  that is very possible and hopefully the only problem;  but it could just as easily be a head gasket, or rings that will require a complete engine rebuild or replacement!

Considering the problem is a misfire, I recommend finding a mechanic that can look into the engine with an endoscope:  they will be able to look inside each cylinder and see the condition of each cylinder / wall / valves (from the inside), etc;  or at least get a compression test done on each cylinder (any engineer mechanic skills be able to do that, and it should have been done as part off the ppi)

If there's loss of compression it's going to cost more than spark plugs to repair, and will likely be at least a partial rebuild (possibly valves, head gasket, such injector, or rings!)

I recently bought a 10yr old used Honda that is supposed to last 200-300k miles; mine had 67k miles when I bought it; one previous owner, all the records, etc... sold at a new car dealership that probably sold them a new car. Less than 10k miles later I had to dump 2k into a new head gasket! oil was dripping into a cylinder from what appeared to be scratches on the head that looked like they came that way from the factory(?) My mechanic buffed out the scratches and replaced the head gasket, all has been well for a few thousand miles so far...

The problem manifested as a cylinder misfire. (It also all of a sudden drank up all the oil a few days before the code came up and put the car into limp mode).
The scumbag dealership cleared codes and scammed you.
Sparkalaters?
So the battery voltage being low makes me wonder. I wouldn't necessarily chase coils, spark plugs, and injectors
Timing chain
Where do you live? I know VA has a 7 day grace period. If you bought it from a dealer take that shit back and have em fix it or refund it!
So it has misfire codes. Is the engine making any loud ticking? First I would call the dealer and have them update the engine PCM to the latest software as there is a tsb out for misfires. I also recommend clearing the keep alive memory and doing a misfire neutralization. Dive it and see if faults come back. Do you have records of spark plug change? I've been doing a lot of camshafts and rocker arm replacements along with timing chains and cam phases lately
All those codes can definitely result from needing a new battery. Replace the battery.
It's a spark plug or coil. Don't listen to these needs. Relax and replace them
Hmmm. Was it a Ford? All Ford jokes aside, I've seen this in numerous Ford's old and new and ended up needing the computer fixed

Edit: posted a comment before actually reading the post. It is a Ford..... I'm sorry but I now firmly believe the jokes.
Run the engine and unplug the ignition coils one at a time for cylinder 1 and 6. If the engine vibrates or sounds different then they work, if not then your ignition coils are fucked
If they didnt take out a spark plug‚Ä¶. How would they know the condition of them‚Ä¶. Im betting there brand new and oil soaked
Sell it and buy a Toyota. Problem solved. For a long, long time.
Battery
Look up your local lemon laws if applicable.
Thats annoying. Looks like a cheap fix though. Vacum leak or camposition sensor most likely. Good luck
Did you buy it from a dealer? Most dealers, even the shittiest of shitty will have a mechanical warranty for the first 30 days ish.
My 05 maxima has a random cylinder misfire code but no misfire lol car was great too 0-60 6.2 secs with a $30 tcu tune sometimes it‚Äôs a error I guess if truck doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs actually missing
These ones have a known issue of going through camshaft position sensors, then if it doesn‚Äôt take, then replacing the VVT actuators. There‚Äôs a TSB on it too. Considering you mentioned it only has 60k miles, I‚Äôd check with a Ford dealer to see if there‚Äôs any open field service actions (such as a software update for the ECM). If i remember correctly, the software update completed before a certain mileage/time will enable you to claim extended coverage for one or more of those components should the issue arise again. But I could be wrong.

A Ford tech would have some good insight.

The former is a decently big job on these, the latter is an even bigger job which requires camshaft removal. 

Can‚Äôt do much diagnosis on here, but get it into a trusted shop OP. Hope for the best but prepare fore the worst
Looks like a low voltage problem. Start with the battery.
Engine gone, how many miles?
Spark plug and ignition coils need to be changed happened when I bought my car awhile back same thing. If your car has over 100k miles. they need to be changed.
this had happened to my mother-in-law this week. in her case it was a catalytic converter that in our state needs to be fixed to pass an emissions test. she took it to her local dealer to get a printout of what is wrong. The salesman at the third party dealership did not want to fix it and I quote the car was great when he got it. he did not want it fixed nor have her go to any dealerships. he threatened to keep the car and keep what she paid which was a partial payment. she then got a hold of an attorney and now the mechanic guy is getting the car fixed.
You‚Äôll know it if you really have a mis-fire. Could well be battery. Change it out, drive it. Let the codes clear.
Hopefully you either have an explicit warranty or bought in a location that has an implicit warranty‚Ä¶
 A low/bad battery can trigger random codes. Get a good battery, and see if the codes come back.
Multiple cylinder misfire.. Def change out the plugs and wires.
Spark plugs,.and clear the code. Hopefully that.will be it
.if its the 5.0 V8 those things chew through spark plugs like crazy. They should get changed about every 50k which is a little fucked. But that's just ford engineering. The Ecoboost motors are just as bad about killing plugs.
Just got rid of a 2016 Ford edge for something similar. Cylinder 2 misfire non stop. Replaced spark plugs and then ignition. Coil packs. Still got cylinder 2 error. Long story short found out on a cold day with no heat and the car going into low power mode. Those Ford's have an engine issue where the engine eats coolant and the only fix is new car or new engine.  $8k for new engine.  Ford knows about the issue but won't issue a recall. It's well documented.  Just my issue but definitely start with spark plugs and work up from there
Plugs and coils
I would start with plugs and boots first.
Could just be spark plugs
Pre purchase inspection was down the road from the dealer I bet
üò¨ fuck. hopefully an easy fix
Check that everything is grounded. Not just the battery, look at the computer
You got $8 K worth of repairs. Those codes aren‚Äôt easy to fix.
The codes were pending and they kick on . The coils are known to go bad and cause the misfire. I replace the plugs and the coils . Just to save you and more problems but I asked the dealership to fix it and have them show you the parts
How much you buy it for?
The need for a battery doesn't mean it wasn't taken care of. Every one of those codes can be the result of a battery in need of replacement. Automotive electrical systems are very sensitive to even the slightest fluctuation. You've replaced the battery, now allow for relearn and see what you got. The seemingly slightest change can produce dramatic end results in the newer cars/trucks.
Make sure you don't have a oil consumption issue as well. I had a 2018 f150 3.5 with issues but the 2018 5.0 would burn oil as well.
You have a misfire on two cylinders,it‚Äôs a used vehicle very likely it could just be bad luck.
Yeesh. Rough go ham.
Take it back under lemon law.
Look up your states lemon laws.
Maybe if you‚Äôre lucky and it does just need a new battery it could correct these a lot of modern engines have codes come up if the voltage isn‚Äôt at a certain point while it‚Äôs running. Which means It could also be an alternator issue assuming all the engine internals and everything is OK.
Drive it through their front door and park it there, they know what they have done
I want to know the outcome, tell us when its fixed
I hate to be this guy, but if it's the 5.4 triton v8 expect to keep having these problems. The 5.4 v8 is the worst engine to ever come from Ford. 

Side note - personally idk if Ford still uses the 5.4 in its newer f150, you may have a 5.0. Of that's the case the 5.0 is supposed to be a pretty decent engine.
I believe the rules are dependent on state, price you paid etc, but if you bought this from a dealer you may be entitled to warranty. I paid 30k for a car and got 3 months as law in the act.
What you have here is not a camshaft no camshaft found no rockers no rollers nothing
Just FYI, the ABS U code (lost communication w/ instrument cluster) is likely a result of the bad battery or lost voltage. The misfire code though, is not. The reason it appears multiple times is likely a set code, a pending code, and a history code.  
Reading that you bought it from a used car dealer, they likely just cleared the codes and sent it. I‚Äôd be taking it back to them and fighting with them to fix it. OR‚Ä¶ if you want to push the issue, you could just return it and wipe your hands clean.
This actually happened to me. My check engine light came on and it turned out I needed to replace my catalytic converter. The dealership obviously cleared the codes because the light came on MINUTES after I drove away. I ended up replacing the cat myself but it was still a big chunk of money and kind of bs. The dealership refused to do anything about it since I signed an as is. I now know to bring an OBD with me when looking at used cars. 

It would suggest looking into Lemon Law and see if it's applicable in your state. It wasn't applicable in the state that I bought my car in but it's worth looking into for your situation.
this is why you should always take a obd scanner with you when shopping for vehicles
I would get a new battery and do a plugs and coils, that will most likely fix the issue
Despite all of the armchair experts jumping to a big bill ahead of you, the first test would in fact be the battery/alternator. Though the misfires are concerning it could all stem to the u0155 which is the elephant in the room. That *could* be caused by low voltage. That could be bad grounds, failed cells in the battery (vs slowing dying weak battery), failed voltage regulator or alternator (they are usually integral which each other now). 

The reason this is a concern is because it means your computer isn't able to talk to various sensors for some reason.  That could cause the misfires to be falsely reported as well. The first step is to diagnose why your PCM isn't happy, then go from there.
Plugs . wires . Fuel injectors..  these are the things that you check first
Fords.
Unfortunately people find their ways to have the engine light come off to sell it :(.
Simply needs a tune up change the plugs and wires if needed and check the battery. Op probably just needs to hook a battery charger to it for a few hrs. Although it never hurts to check the output of the alternator
It may be a lemon or a diamond in the ruff. These vehicles are super sensitive to voltage drop, replaced the battery and reset everything and drive for a few days and see what happens. I also suspect that the spark plugs need changing all of them, but on and six are really bad. P.S buy a used vehicle with a grain of salt. I know some people who would only change each spark plug as they failed rather then a complete over haul.

My steps when I purchased a used vehicle regardless of proof is to establish my own point of reference.

1. Change all fluids in the car
2. Change rotors and pads, check calipers if they need changing, change them as well.
3. New tires my life depends on it 
4. Oil and filter change
5. Cabin filter change especially if you suspect they had pets in the vehicle, fresh air is good for the lungs.
6. Take it to a lube place to get all hinges and stuff lube.
7. Alignment 
8. A good wash inside and outside and waxed and polished outside.
9. Qualified mechanic to do a thorough check may take a few hours to do.

The list is NOT in chronological order 

Note to self buy yourself a code reader one that will read codes even if they were previously erased, so you can check before purchasing.
It is a Ford, what did you expect?
The last two are a result of the battery . The po301 , 306 are probably a result of this voltage being low . The fact that it shows misfire detected on cylinder 1 and 6 multiple times , leads me to believe it‚Äôs the scan results before and after voltage crash . New battery , codes should be cleared . Drive cycle and scan it again . I bet it all goes away . If not , swap coil packs on I and 2 and see if misfire follows . If not. Check CRANKSHAFT  position sensor.
They definitely cucked you bro. They cleared it, no way those codes come up randomly after 1 day of buying it lol. Check the sparkplugs, sparkplug boots, see if theres oil down there in the holes. Had this happen to my car with multiple cylinder missfires, opened it up and did an inspection and ended up being the valve cover gaskets had a leak and oil had seeped through and destroyed the boots and spark plugs. Was an easy fix.
So I sold a car a few years ago. It was a good car and the guy liked it during the test drive bought it. 2 days later, he phoned me, ripping me that I was dishonest as tons of lights came. We took it to a mechanic and we determined that it was because I shampooed the engine and water got into parts that caused the errors. He charged me $200, blew compressed air everywhere and reset the car. None of the lights came back and the buyer was happy
This looks pretty simple. either a bad battery/alternator, or a bad ground. There more than 90% chance of that being the case here.

If the car was in the lot for sometime, it could be Botha the battery, and some ground in need of cleaning. 

This wuld not worry me too much until I had those 3 things fixed and cleaned up.
Congrats on your 6 cylinder disguised as an 8 cylinder
Since getting a new battery, check the codes again and see if the voltage relates ones disappear. If they do try doing a tune up and replace spark plugs, wires and coil packs. My truck had similar codes and that's what fixed it
Try new battery.
Pull the plugs.  If they look good It might be as simple as a couple of coils.  I say this particularly because they set a code.  I replaced my coils once and got the same error code.   It turned out they were the wrong coils.  I put the old ones back on, which were fine, and the codes went away.
Replace battery first.  
If its something like an inline 6 with a wasted spark setup, it may have a faulty coilpack
Whelp. You already bought so time for the money put. First things first, it‚Äôs a ford so start with spark plugs and ignition coils. Really easy since they‚Äôre all right on top. 
Clear codes and see if they come back, if they do it‚Äôs more than likely injectors.
First thing I would do is replace that battery‚Ä¶ A failing battery can cause errors. If you‚Äôre lucky you can clear up those misfires with a tune up plugs etc‚Ä¶
Check your grounds and a thorough visual inspection of wires/harnesses/connections won't hurt according to symptoms.
Which engine? 3.3,3.5, 3.5 HO,  or 5.0?
You think that‚Äôs bad, I had a check engine light come on during a test drive once. Did not buy that car
It is very possible the plugs or coils need replacing. Swap the coils on the misfiring cylinders to ones that are good and see if the code follows
Id take it right back
Have you checked your states Lemon Law? If your car keeps having this problem, you can make a claim and they give you the same type of car and reimburse you with money for the first payment I think (varies for state). This happen to my cousin that got a CTS leases and was given a different one and I think the covered the payment for the first month
üòÖüòÖüòÖ
Did it come from H & H Kia in Omaha, Nebraska? Sold me a car with bad clutch and shitty transmission
Without reading the post or comments just based on the picture  üòÇ my first thought was dang he has 3 cylinder 1‚Äôs and 2 cylinder 6‚Äôs‚Ä¶. My truck only has one of each. Second was gonna be check voltage at the battery with key off then check voltage at alternator output while running. More than likely bad battery on that part tho. Sorry some used car dealers are perfect scam artists. But this shouldn‚Äôt be hard to diagnose
Not sure what state you live in but in pa you can't pass inspection with a trouble code and two missfireing cylinders would make it run like crap or a ford...... oh sorry!
Oof communication codes suck
it came on Friday too! They just cleared it
If this came from a dealership, return it.  Lemon. üçãüçã
I took a scan tool to look at a used Jeep Cherokee.  They're are seven codes.. one for the ABS which was not illuminated on the cluster.  MIL was not lit although my scan tool said that it should have been.
Depending on the state you may be protected up to 500miles/30 days after the used car Purchase.
Even if you bought private this may be soon enough you take em to court. Some states have laws against selling vehicles with known issues and you try to hide them. If you bought from a dealer this is a suit all day long even if they conned you into what you think is an "as is" sale
replace plugs and wires, see it the codes go away.
Battery
‚ÄúHow it feels to drive a Ford F-150‚Äù
So you paid for a pre-purchase inspection, and they failed to inspect one of the most important parts of the car?!

I‚Äôm sorry, but you got hosed on this one. Hopefully it‚Äôs nothing expensive, but here‚Äôs your lesson for future purchases. Take it to a reputable shop that can perform a FULL PPI!
Looks like lots of people where don't know newer cars.   Modern cars do all kinds of funky things with a bad battery.. also depending on how the battery craps out can create different symptoms.  But in simple terms, a dead cell can drag the voltage down on the entire electrical system and suddenly a sensor that was designed to operate at around 12-14v is now trying to operate at 8v... And with how sensitive and precise modern sensors are you can maybe see why that wouldn't go very well.   Seeing  such a wide array of error codes points to exactly that sort of problem.
From my experience, every time I‚Äôve had cylinder misfires, I‚Äôve only been able to chase the problem. Could be caused by a lot of things. A spark plug, a coil, a wire, etc. Either I‚Äôm just really unlucky, or it‚Äôs something we‚Äôre not told as consumers, but it‚Äôs always come down to timing problems. Depending on your mileage, I‚Äôd suggest having the timing chain replaced, and all that goes with it. It ain‚Äôt cheap. Considering you just bought it, there are protection laws in most states. Almost all states have a ‚Äúbuyers remorse‚Äù clause or a 3 day clause of some kind. That should be on the dealership to fix. So many places are predatory like that, it‚Äôs disgusting. If it was person to person then you‚Äôre probably hosed. You‚Äôll spend more money on attorneys than if you just fixed it.
Agreeing with everything everyone else said. Just because the dealer says it‚Äôs inspected doesn‚Äôt always mean that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the truck. Went up with some friends to look at an f-150, dealership had just inspected, and safetied it. Still in the garage bay when we took it for a test drive. Right off the bat something was off. Drove weird in the parking lot, so we thought maybe since it was cold that it just needed to warm up (crazy since it was indoors). 100 meters from the dealership we had to pull over. There was a puddle of transmission fluid pooling underneath. Traced it back the whole way to the garage bay. Happened the second we turned the truck on. Vehicles are a big gamble. Odds are you‚Äôre getting a good one, but never 100%
I bought a scan tool 15 years ago. I own two clapped out fords now ( my daughters beaters) both 2006. I‚Äôve had wiring problems with both. The codes only pointed at the problems. I had to buy the electrical manuals to troubleshoot. A scan tool alone won‚Äôt tell you the actual problem at times. 

Good luck.
Take it back on Monday!
Welp. Sorry buddy
I‚Äôm probably gonna get lit up for this but did ya change the battery? A low battery will cause many issues
Replace the battery.  I was a dealership technician for many years and I have had this type of issue with a bad battery.  Get a good quality battery. Like an Interstate or an Optima.
If you‚Äôre in the US there is such a thing as a lemon law and you my friend have a lemon law
Always bring a little device to plug into the car that can see erased codes cause theses used car dealers love erasing codes
Have them do a tune-up (plugs and coils) and give you a new battery.
I had a series of codes like that with a bad battery. Change the battery but that wasn't my full issue I had to change the starter too and then clear the codes and never came back up.
Lemon law? Most state have one if you're in the USA
I'm not familiar with this vehicle, but I will chime in to add that low battery/bad battery conditions can and will cause exactly these type of codes.

Replace the battery, clear the codes, drive and see if they come back. A 2018 with full maint. history should not be having spark issues.
What a pain dude. Had the same thing happen to me with a mustang, thankfully it was just a simple hose. Hopefully it's a simple fix for your f150
Might have a valve cover leak, check your spark plugs to see if they have oil on them. He might have cleaned it out to sell it
Tbh these aren't that devastating. All older vehicles will throw codes if in need of maintenance i.e sparkplug, wire replacement etc.

I agree that the seller just cleared codes and they take less than a day to return once the vehicle is operated and the cars ecm is given the misfire codes again
What car is it?
Try changing the spark plugs before you do anything sometimes they were either not installed correctly wiggled loose or they've fouled up... I like to go the cheaper route before throwing it up on a lift and such
Hopefully just plugs or injectors. If it passes a compression test, I think you‚Äôre in the clear for any huge bills.
clear the codes drive the car if they come back start with coils and plugs
Just needs a tune up. I‚Äôm betting you have coil packs. Those last a long time but will eventually fail and misfire. Easy way to check, switch the 1 and 6 coil packs to different cylinder and see if the problems follows. If the problems doesn‚Äôt follow you possibly have stuck injectors.
Smells german to me
Your battery being low will cause a whirlwind of issues. Throw in a new battery.

Pretty straight forward
With the low voltage warning and ABS light, I would say it‚Äôs charging system.  ABS requires 9v to operate, intentionally lower than most systems, and it‚Äôs a good canary to a critically low power.  The low power is causing everything else to be weird.  I would fix that first before any other troubleshooting could take place.
Did you buy it from a dealer or private 3rd party? Typically you have a 3 day right of recission where within 3 days you can say "nah i don't want this" and give it back. In my state at least there is also a lemon law where you can return a vehicle (purchased from a dealer) within 1 year if you had to service the vehicle 4 or more times for the same defect, maybe you have one of these options?
Replace all the coils
A bad battery could cause all of this, change it and see what will happend
Cam
Phasers
It would only be worse if it was an EV.
Had the exact same thing, cylinder 1&6 misfire endup being a ground strap on the engine was loose. Cleaned and tightened problem went away. Good luck
I see a battery voltage code thrown, try changing the battery. I have a C7 corvette and when my battery stopped recharging efficiently the voltage would slightly drop and send half the sensors into a downward spiral. The last time I lost stabilitrack, had multiple misfires, crank position sensor misread and it went into limp mode. New battery resolved it.
First, erase the codes and see if they come back.

If they come back, here is useful info for those codes:  


\*\*P0301\*\*

\- [https://www.obd-codes.com/p0301](https://www.obd-codes.com/p0301)  
\- P0306 is cylinder 6

\*\*U0155\*\* 

\- [https://www.obd-codes.com/u0155](https://www.obd-codes.com/u0155)

\*\*U0155-68\*\*

\- The following site [https://www.f150forum.com/f118/forscan-software-enable-disable-features-your-truck-348987/index2030/](https://www.f150forum.com/f118/forscan-software-enable-disable-features-your-truck-348987/index2030/) breaks that code down down as follows:

\-  ABS DTC U0155:68-48 // Module: Antilock braking system 

\- U0155 - Lost Communication With Instrument Panel Cluster (IPC) Control Module 

\- This code was pulled up from Forscan, software designed to diagnose Ford,  Mazda, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles ([https://forscan.org/home.html](https://forscan.org/home.html))

\*\*U3003-16\*\*

\-  [https://www.dtcdecode.com/Ford/U3003-16](https://www.dtcdecode.com/Ford/U3003-16)
Wow
If you're mechanically inclined 2 original Ford coils and all the plugs would not be bad maintenance / parts cannon. Ford coil over plugs like to short internally under load. *Note this is not a replacement for actual diagnostics this is a weirdo on the Internet guessing on the very little information I have been given *
You don‚Äôt usually see misfires for a dead battery. I‚Äôd take it right back where you bought and have them look at it.
I would clear the code and see if they come back because that cylinder one and six misfire it could be from sitting a little while condensation in the fuel but it has to miss least six times for the Ford computer to set a light.
The cluster data code can be from low battery voltage
Some states have a warranty period by law if it's from a dealer. My state is 14 days. I would take it back and have them fix.
Did you buy from a dealer? Check out the lemon rule in you state.
Bought a used ford already put about 1000 into it. Can‚Äôt wait to unload this thing
I‚Äôm always suspicious when you‚Äôre doing a transaction for thousands of dollars but the seller won‚Äôt replace a 100 dollar battery first.
Even if he your inspector had a inexpensive code reader , if the used car dealer just reset the check engine light ( which most of the devices can do ) you wouldn‚Äôt get a code if you plugged into it with another inexpensive code reader , they would need state inspection grade computer readers to see that it just been reset
Ask the dealer to perform TSB 17-2272
It's a PCM calibration update that helps with the stutter/misfire on the 5.0, and also address's the Misfire DTC's.
Likely coil pack/s. I‚Äôve seen weak fuel pump cause this as well though. Good luck chasing that gremlin but honestly it shouldn‚Äôt be anything too bad.
18-20 had the oil consumption. Caused all kinds of misfires in my 20. May be sure it's not an already known issue with it
You have time to return it usually it‚Äôs 7 days and 300 miles
I had a feeling this happned as well, the inspector didint have any equipment to read the codes with and I took a shot anyway
> he inspector didn't scan the truck and see what monitors have run and passed.

I feel like that is LITERALLY the first step to a pre-purchase inspection. I mean, I bring my Bluetooth OBD scanner to any car I m looking at.
Exactly.... Man I feel bad for OP
Exactly, monitors incomplete is the biggest red flag when buying used cars, codes too but monitors tell the tale if shady stuff is afoot
That‚Äôs why I show up with my trusty Bluetooth OBD2 scanner before purchase!  If the ECU was just reset before I showed up our business relationship just ended.
Exactly!!
Does that mean there‚Äôs something that needs to be replaced?
Ladies love the forscan
I‚Äôm wondering about that battery code and what his voltage is?  I recently had a bad alternator that caused my voltage to drop too low and it resulted in all kinds of random codes. Scared the hell out of me. After a new alternator and battery recharge everything went back to normal.
I don‚Äôt know why this comment is so low. Everyone thinks there‚Äôs something big going on here. All of these codes are likely due to under 9v voltage.
60k miles, thanks and that‚Äôs good to know
If going down this route, it's worth swapping with other cylinders first to see if you're indeed chasing the right demon. In this case, take coil pack on cylinder 1 and swap with 2. At the same time, swap spark plug on cylinder 1 with 3. See if misfire moves to 2 or 3. If not, you've likely ruled those out.  Same with the coil/plug on 6.
At 100k may as well sign up to replace the coil packs.  Nothing more expensive than cheaping out on buying parts and then having to do the service twice.
If it was basic maintenance, then why didn't the seller just do it rather than try to hide the problem and sell it?


I had a similar issue.¬† A couple weeks after buying a vehicle, similar codes appeared and I needed a new intake manifold and camshaft, a $4k+ repair.


It was priced well enough compared to other vehicles on the market that I don't feel too bad about it, but I'd probably assume the worst until proven otherwise.¬† At least then there's a chance of being pleasantly surprised that it's something simple/cheap.
Depends on the beer. This could be a ‚Äú2 IPA‚Äù job or a ‚Äú4 Coors Light‚Äù job. Personally I‚Äôd split the middle and call it a ‚Äú3 Coors Banquet‚Äù job.
Changing spark plugs can be almost impossible for the average Joe to do . They are frequently stuck in there so good you may break them off or strip out the cylinder heads. And transverse engine spark plugs can be a bear to get too (firewall side)
3 for first-timers, I've found
I agree, unless you have a record of at least the spark plugs beings replaced, it is a great starting point and likely to fix your issue. A tune up is relatively cheap and a solid investment.
This drives me insane. On my 2015 focus se, when the battery gets low, it'll fire a TCM code and put the car in limp mode.
These are all low voltage issues. The battery needs to be swapped, would almost certainly clear these up. Sensors are getting less voltage than expected, and running poorly because of it.
Could this be a sign the alternator is going out? I remember reading about V8 Mustangs throwing mad codes due to a bad alternator but I'm not sure if this extends to the trucks.
Yup. My neighbor's dashboard was lit up, and I pulled 22 codes after a scan.  A couple were "lost communication with xxx" and one was "battery voltage low."

Turns out they'd been running on a nearly dead battery and jumping it for a bit before replacing the battery a few weeks prior.  Cleared all the codes, they drove it for a day, and only 2 codes came back - the only thing truly wrong with the car.
Thanks you, this was my thought as well, and all the codes came on at the same time, 

Did you have to reset the check engine light, or did it go away on its own?
I did and the light is still on, I am hoping a reset is all that is needed
This is exactly what I was thinking. OP should check that battery first
In what state.
Used cars are typically, you own both halves when you hit the pavement.
Usually with used cars you have to sign an as-is form which prevents you from returning the car if anything is wrong.
Yep. Happened to me on my last 3 vehicles. Used car dealerships are all scum
I replaced the battery and a mechanic cleared the codes said he‚Äôs not seeing any misfires and to come back if there‚Äôs a problem, he did also say he doesn‚Äôt think it was due to a bad battery
I disagree, the cam phasers are bad in the v6 turbo engines which is why I bought the v8, their transmissions are a little funky
You mean the best feeling car in America?
What do you drive a Prius?
No lemon laws on used cars
Not how that works
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that intense, thank you though. It probably needs a hard reset it spark plugs or something.
manufacturer within 18 months or 18,000 miles of the vehicle‚Äôs original purchase date, whichever comes first.

he is at 60k? I dont think it applies
I did yeah
Lol thanks me too, $27k and a check engine light üíÄ
At least in the US, "Lemon" laws vary greatly State to State.
*Change the battery...*

*Ive had bad ones do weird*

*Shit to me before*

Yeah I had a cylinder 1 misfire I couldnt locate the problem of on my 97 CRV. Did everything I could after buying it to fix issues. Replaced every part that had sensor obd2 errors and got rid of a slew of codes. Come to find out after rebuilding the distributor over 25 times to make the ignition perfect and replacing plugs, wires, caps and all I was chasing a bigger issue. 

Come to find out I bought a compression tester and found out that clyinder one exhuast valve was bent and ruined prior to testing. 25 Psi in the 1st cylinder, and about 135 or so on the others. It was a big lesson to me that even if your scanning codes and have a watchful eye on what all the auto pranskters like to scam and rig you can still be had on a vehicle purchase because you didnt preform a simplistic compression test on the engine before you bought it. Needless to say I removed the cylinder head and had it machined and the shop replaced the valve and valve seals since I dont have valve replacement tools. 

But lesson learned like my grandfather told me to do first was the compression test! >_< 
But yeah the year of OP's vehicle seems a bit too new for it to be something any more serious than an Ignition tune up or cam sensors. Maybe a new battery. May be worth keeping said vehicle. But the year of it is too new tbh for any major issues as long as people werent doggin the transmission and slappin the gas driftin.
Whoops, just saw your inspection tech didn't have a scan tool.... that changes things.  I'd try get my $40 back if I could in this scenario.
Derek!!
Thanks, replaced battery and reset code, hasn‚Äôt come back in 30 miles ü§û
Walmart sells obd 2 scanners for as low as 10 bucks. Anyone can buy one and reset the codes. OP shouldve bought one and done his own check to see if all sensors are up and running.
I‚Äôve only been a tech for almost a year now. But if I had to guess since you‚Äôre throwing codes for misfires. And there‚Äôs a loss of communication to the panel cluster, and you‚Äôve already changed the batteries, there‚Äôs a issue in the harness from the chassis to the cluster, the ecm is communicating misfires to the cluster, since it‚Äôs cold the truck should be adjusting for the colder temps which leads me to thinking that there‚Äôs a problem from the fuel injector control module, could be the communication wires from there and you‚Äôd need a new harness or you could need a new ficm, just swing at the issue here
It depends on the state and most states don‚Äôt have a used car lemon law. Those states with a used car lemon law:

CT, CA, HI, MA, NM, NJ, NM, NY, RI

Outside of those, no recourse unless the OP bought a warranty or the paperwork didn‚Äôt include ‚ÄúAS-IS‚Äù clause/paperwork. 

Of course, the OP can contact the car seller and see if they are willing to help with this situation.
I'm hoping you didn't pay for this inspection.
JFC what ‚Äòinspector‚Äô doesn‚Äôt have a code reader. I got one for $35
Code readers are fairly cheap. Take this as a lesson. Get your own code reader, bring it with you to seller and plug it in. If the readiness checks aren‚Äôt complete, cancel the pre purchase inspection, and walk away.
>didint have any equipment to read the codes

that's NOT a mechanic. that's some idiot with access to a lift.
How could the inspector possibly not have a code reader? They‚Äôre insanely cheap.
if you ever take your vehicle to someone who "doesn't have equipment to read the codes," you're not at a mechanic. you're at a con artist. an obd reader is like 10-20 dollars.
an obdII scanner is dirt cheap - i don't understand how they could not have one
That‚Äôs why you bring it to a dealership you idiot.
How is it running?
Wait, someone did a PPI without even having a basic code reader? Wtf
You can buy a scan tool for 30 bucks, it will allow you to see if it is still throwing codes.
What inspector doesn‚Äôt have a code reader?
Annnnnnnnnnnnd, now it's YOUR problem.
Code readers are dirt cheap these days.  I would not trust any mechanic that can't pull codes.  It should literally be the first thing you do on an inspection.  

The biggest trick is clearing the codes, which will set a "Not ready for test" flag you can see with a reader.  It lets you know there was an issue, which may or may not have been solved.
The ‚Äúequipment‚Äù to read codes is a $20 obd2 scanner from Amazon lol. If the mechanic said he didn‚Äôt have the equipment to do a scan he was either lying or is not a mechanic
A $40 scan tool can read those codes if that shop didn‚Äôt have one then you probably should return
Oh snap. OBD II?
If you're lucky, no. Engines detect misfires through various mechanisms, but the primary method is continuous monitoring of the position of the crankshaft. I.e., "I expected the crank to be at this position at exactly this time, but it is a little behind, that last cylinder must have misfired and failed to accelerate the crankshaft properly". Every cylinder firing accelerates the crankshaft until the next one does the same, it just happens thousands of times a minute, and you generally can't physically detect it except by very precise measurements. As engines get older and wear down, numerous factors can contribute to small, imperceptible differences in how much crankshaft acceleration each cylinder provides. But the vehicle may be struggling to understand that that's normal, and incorrectly concluding there's a misfire. That's what the aforementioned procedure does: tells the car, "Hey, FYI this slight variance is normal". 

I only say all of this BECAUSE it's 1 and 6, which fire in the same crank position on your engine. 2-8, 3-5, and 4-7 are other suspect combos. Of course, you might very well be actually misfiring, but common factors always warrant some investigation into other possible explanations. 

Edit: All of this said, start with the battery. A bad battery can manifest as all kinds of strange phantom problems.
My Tacoma hits a misfire code when I let it sit too long. Usually need to clear it or check plugs. Once I had to actually change spark plug wires to fix it.
I love a lady with a loose diagnostics port.
Changing the plugs is smart, but coil packs are expensive. Don‚Äôt just change all the coil packs. You should go to autozone or oreillys and have them do a free scan, and clear the codes for you. Then you need to take the coil pack from cylinder 1, and switch it with coil pack from cylinder 2. Then you need to drive the vehicle for a few minutes until the check engine light comes back on. At which time you should return to autozone, or whoever scanned the codes for you, and ask them to scan the codes again. 

What you are looking for, is for your misfire to now appear on Cylinder 2. This would indicate the misfire on cylinder 1 was caused by a bad coil pack (now on cylinder 2).  

Repeat the procedure for the coil pack on Cylinder 6, switching it with cylinder 5. 

If the codes still indicate misfires on Cylinders 1 and 6, after switching, then you will need to take it to a trustworthy shop, because you have a problem that will require a wider array of testing equipment, and knowledge that is going to be too difficult to diagnose over the internet. 


Best of luck to you!
You see that U0155-68 code?  That pops up when the odometer has been replaced.  Yeah, certain other things can cause it too, but it's enough to make me interested in reading the ECU mileage counter and comparing it to the dash.

Could just be caused by the battery, but then again, might not be.
Swap the coils around and see if the misfire happens on different cylinders.  That's the easiest way to find a bad coil.  

Also, I'm not a mechanic, so take that for what it's worth.
Can agree on that. Made a mistake on a project car before, also a Ford, where I changed plugs and coil packs but the same issue didn‚Äôt go away‚Ä¶ waste of money.
Yes, exactly this.

New battery, first.  Clear the code, start it, and see what comes back.   A weak battery can cause misfires.  A weak battery AND a weak alternator will cause misfires even more often.

A weak battery and 100k mile crust coil packs, that will also cause misfires.

Go ahead and do the spark plugs when you do the coil packs.  That way you can inspect what the spark plug looks like and get info on whether it is running too rich, too lean, or burning oil.
Agreed. Always go OEM as it has always failed to use anything of less quality for me at least. Some things you can cheap out on but make those decisions as you have to. It happens to me sometimes when you need a part immediately. But nothing Advance auto sells is worth while. I worked there for 4 years and anything carquest brand is basically chinese reproductions that have a tendency to fail often.
How do i know what the seller was thinking? Maybe hes cheap?.. I'm not saying OP doesn't have a thrown rod and spun bearing and the head gaskets on backward with 6 flat tires from a vacuum leak. I'm saying where the simple method of diagnosis starts based on the readings provided. Anything else is an assumption, and inconsequential until you start the process of diagnosis. "This happened to me once, and I had hepatits..."
My old Corolla would beep the horn as a low voltage warning, and completely drain the battery‚Ä¶..
Low voltage is low voltage.  A bad battery will cause a drop but a bad alternator will never raise it high enough.  Pointless  to figure out before replacing the battery unless it isn't due for replacement.
For me it's the last code before the battery that makes me think it's the battery. Look up how to clear the codes on your vehicle and once it's replaced, drive it around a bit and see if they come back on or not. Don't go too far in case there are other issues, and stop if it feels like something isn't right or sounds like shit.
Most vehicles the check engine light will go away on its own if you start the car enough times without the fault(s) reoccurring.  


But as I commented already--replace your batter. Before you do anything else just install a new battery. I'd bet twenty bucks all those codes go away after you do that (if not automatically, then you once you clear them they won't return).
Usually you want to reset it yourself as it may take a couple of hours of driving for it to go away by itself. Get a reader, reset it, keep it around for the next time you get the check engine light turning on.
If you're ever working on your own car in any capacity do yourself a favor and order an obd2 reader from Amazon or something. Mine was $40, I can read and clear codes and have some live data as well. Granted I bought that like 6 years ago.

Edit: if I wouldn't already have one, I would buy this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0887WYZVH/ref=sspa_mw_detail_0?ie=UTF8&psc=1&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9waG9uZV9kZXRhaWwp13NParams
If I'd have money, I'd explore the more expensive versions of this manufacturer.
You replaced battery. Issue should be solved for now. To clear code use odb plug or google online on model. Orally might be able to clear code if you don‚Äôt have the tool.
Yeah usually after battery replacement you‚Äôll need to clear codes / program the battery to ecu (idk i work on euro mostly). Low voltage batteries i‚Äôve seen cause a flurry of codes on many euro vehicles, hopefully the same for american
[deleted]
A misfire code assuming you didn't get flashing/red CEL will eventually clear itself after some driving, if the cause is resolved of course.
Most , unless specified in the contract. I work at a dealership as a tech and point out all the shit I should be fixing, then the general manager says no ‚Ä¶ then the vehicle comes back 2 days later and I am told to drop what I am doing and fix XYZ asap üò°ü§¨
Dealerships are all scum right now.

Sticker MSRP says 43k so why am I‚Äôm having to pay 67k?
Well I do. And so far it looks like I'm right and he's not.
V6s and V8s are both plagued by it around me, the phasers have been an issue since early 2000s F150 V8s and V6s

While the V6s are notorious for them, the V8s still have them go bad regularly.
Best feeling? I'm no ford hater like the other guy but I don't have a clue what that's supposed to mean.
Feeling, not running. I have one (paid for by my company). Mechanic for 10 years. How many miles are on your truck
Ha typical compensator comment
If you're UK based, you can reject a car sale within 30 days IIRC
Depends on state. A few, including the giant markets of California and the Tri-State area, have lemon law protections for used cars as well.
I‚Äôve always heard about there being a return policy within 30 days. Could be wrong, but if I‚Äôm not then this is the time to find out lol
In my area there is, they have to make sure the car will pass emissions prior to selling it. This will not pass as it has engine codes, and if you just clear them they can get fined for tricking their customers.
It is how it works, they have to sell you something that will pass inspection
you put too much trust in a shady dealership.
Reddit did not show all the other comments by people with more expertise than mine until after I posted my comment. I hope you can get your rig fixed.
This is true (NY covers used for example) however I don‚Äôt know of any lemon law that is just a blanket ‚Äòtake it back‚Äô

They are all written around giving the manufacturer or dealer ample opportunity to fix a problem.

And I don‚Äôt think any of them cover private sales.
He might‚Äôve had a tool, he just said he didint have much electrical equipment, I assumed he didn‚Äôt, but it sounds like it‚Äôs a $20 tool, I bet he had one, it was a decent sized shop with good reviews, the mechanic (different) reset the check engine light and hasn‚Äôt seen any misfires, I suspect that‚Äôs the only problem. 

I got $200 off for a new battery, I think it‚Äôs as simple as a battery. I also bought the biggest warranty avaialble as there is a full refund if cancelled within 30 day, I figure if it‚Äôs a lemon and the tranny falls out I can replace it and if not I can cancel the warranty.
Haha I was wondering if anyone would catch this reference.   That show is addictive
$40, they put it on a lift, did a visual inspection, drove it, the car had owner, who had detailed records of meticulous maintained, no accidents, I felt comfortable based on thst
Ooh you even shelled out for a nice one
Have to agree. I keep a cheap on in my wife‚Äôs car so if needed she can check to be sure it‚Äôs ok to drive. It‚Äôs a 2020 so I don‚Äôt expect trouble but they are so cheap I can‚Äôt see not leaving one in each car. 
Unless you as would rather not have to fix anything yourself which I also get but it could save you money at least having an idea of what the mechanic is going to say.
You can even borrow one from Autozone and other stores for free.
That‚Äôs good to know thanks
Or at the VERY least tell them you won't reconsider until they complete a drive cycle and THEN you'll take it for inspection after its finished all the drive cycle sensor checks
Maybe he did, he said he didint have any electrical equipment I just assumed a code reader was part of that
With hydraulic motor mounts these days, an engine could be making margaritas before youd even feel it!
It‚Äôs like op pulled up on a stranger on the side of the road and asked if he‚Äôd like to come inspect a car for him on his way to buy it
Ohh, thank you for that detailed response, hopefully the monitor/code just needs to be reset, appreciate the help
Holy fuck, I learned more about misfires and crank shaft sensors in your one single comment than I‚Äôve ever learned on my own.  I feel like if I could compile all of your teaching comments, I could make a great bathroom reader
Hell my bad battery on my F150 resulted in a intermittent non working gauge cluster and sometimes just making the gauges flutter but would still start. Then after driving for 5 minutes it would start to sputter. Chased it for 2 weeks until it finally wouldn't start at all unless it was jumped.
I can attest to that. Low voltage can really freak out these electronics in the newer stuff. - a current ford mechanic
We can also see the battery isn‚Äôt great at the bottom of paper OP needs to start with battery as you‚Äôve stated.
Coils at Autozone.. maybe 300$ for 8x.. duralasts.. fuck it.. new plugs n coils.. change coolant.. new oil... brake pads.. maybe O2 sensors.. pcv.. you bought a used truck.. get ready for all sorts of things to reach the end of their designed lifespan.. maybe a special savings account.. clockspring.. lead frame.. waterpump.. head gaskets.. We have fun here.
My God...  finally some good advice in this thread.  Truck sitting in a lot for god.knows how long, I'm betting it's a bad battery.    If it's winter where op is - it just doubles this likelihood.    That truck ran at trade-in or the auction house.  Cylinder misfires?  Cluster low voltage?  This screams bad battery to me.   And anybody who says "Bad batteries don't matter once the vehicle is running" just haven't seen it yet.
Well ok but why did they clear the codes right before the test drive / showing then?


No matter what they're thinking, it's ingenuine.
My Ford Edge does this, I left it parked for about 2 years undriven, forgot I didn't disconnect the battery, battery died, it's giving me issues with my reverse sensors, and the panic doesn't shut off with the button on the keyfob. You have to put the key in the ignition to get it to shut off.................... Put a new battery in and didn't risk even jump-starting it. Thinking I need an ECU flash or something. I've tried everything I can do at home without fancy tools to plug into the scan port. Drives and runs fine, just gave me issues after the battery being toast for so long. Luckily there was no damage to the terminals, and hardly any crust at all.
[deleted]
Thank you very much
Do NOT do this, OP. This guy is a dummy.
In Texas and Florida, I know you own both halves of a whole. There is not return period
Thats a reputable dealer who wants happy customers that come back. It‚Äôs not required.
I see you have a mini
wrong. Washington State doesn't even have inspections dude.
They have to have a chance to fix it first. You can't just claim lemon law when something breaks.
They‚Äôre very highly rated ‚ÄúIndy Auto Man‚Äù google them
I‚Äôm a big fan. I especially love his disclosure at the startü§£
You should asked for comprehensive inspection, put on the lift and visual inspection is not a comprehensive inspection.  Never believe what the owner says and records keeping is alright, only a comprehensive pre purchase inspection by a mechanic YOU trust is worth it.  Doesn't mean you will not have any issues down the road but you are covering the bases.
They had a lift but no scanner? What kind of cookie cutter operation is this?
Who has a lift but not a code scanner?
For a pre purchase inspection to not run the codes and check if modules had been cleared is wild.
I think my Bluetooth one was $18. I can keep my laptop on the passenger seat and get all my "DANGER TO MANIFOLD" messages.
Something like [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Tough-HT100-Code-Reader-1996-Newer-OBD2-Vehicles-Free-Fix-Part-Recommendations/139897823?fulfillmentIntent=In-store&athbdg=L1102) would be good enough.

See the lights in the middle? What people here are guessing is that the yellow one would have been lit had you or the mechanic scanned it at the inspection. This means they cleared the codes and are trying to hide something long enough for you to complete the purchase.
He‚Äôs a mechanic without a code reader?what does he do to service vehicles put his ear on the hood?
 Is the check engine light flashing while driving?
This guy's previous comment is definitely in the right direction. Cylinders 1 and 6 are running mates, which means they move up and down at the same time. His was the only comment I saw mentioning it
Same that was awesome haha
Thank you! I didn't expect to get so many upvotes. I've gone and edited for some added clarity. :)
I read it and didn‚Äôt think twice, but also up late after bartending. But this comment made me rescroll up and actually read read it. You are a 100% right. So accessible and informative to any level.
The underside of having everything in your car be operated by way of electronics. Once your electrical power source starts to crap out, EVERYTHING starts to crap out along with it. Kind of like having your brain run on low oxygen and blood sugar - nothing works the way it should. Which is why it's not at all uncommon for cars to start throwing all kinds of error codes when the battery goes bad. Also why you shouldn't try to diagnose a modern car without first checking that the battery is good.
Yeah, I should have led with that instead of making it the afterthought. Got a little excited with the armchair diagnostics. :)
All the newer jeeps in particular seem to be very sensitive to weak batteries. Any time I had one come in that was doing weird shit, like randomly operating the wiper blades, I'd check the battery and it was almost always the problem. Some brands handle it better than others.
Not on all cars.
Don't know where you're getting that idea. On many cars removing the battery actually *causes* it to throw a code (to notify that the battery was disconnected).
Not immediately. It usually takes a few minutes before the ECU clears, longer than a normal battery swap.
Depends on how long the battery is disconnected. After disconnect the capacitors keep a charge for a while. This is why mechanics tell you to disconnect the battery, then depress the brake pedal a few times to force discharge the computer.
While you should get a professional to clear the ECU.  Unhook the battery for 30 min. Let all the energy dissipate. Then drive it for a while and see if they go away.
Thanks for the tip ! Never buy from those states!ü§ó
What the fuck does this "both halves" thing mean? It's not like you buy just the front of your car in other states.
Better
I do not live in Washington I live in NJ.
Lemon law doesn't even apply to used cars.
They probably cleared the codes prior to selling so OP wouldn‚Äôt see a light
It maybe but I can easily buy and manipulate google reviews, amazon reviews, yelp reviews.  etc.  

I mean you've had the car for 24 hours and it's misfiring already, what else are you going to find? Not sure why you're defending them.  I'd be pissed in 24 hours if the car misfired, could be a few hundred and lots of thousands.  Just the time and headache is a bummer besides the money
Good to know, thanks
>only a comprehensive pre purchase inspection by a mechanic YOU trust is worth it

Ehh, if your trust is misplaced then it's still not worth it.
And if you don't mind it being slow and slightly buggy about which apps work china has them for $5-10
It's all about the "busta"  I miss that dude, hasnt been the same since hes gone
That 1 star review from a wife saying her husband made her return it because auto part stores will read codes free. Oooofff. Toilet paper is free to use at my local stores bathroom but I ain't going out of my way when I need to poop.
Voodoo doctor
Nope
I tried un hooking the battery for 5 minutes, that didn‚Äôt do anything, is there an exact time that the battery needs to be unhooked for?
CA used car dealers always have a framed notice that says ‚ÄúCalifornia does not have a cooling off period‚Äù. In other words all sales final.
If leave the property owned by the dealer, the car can break in half and you own both halves now.
Not according to my wife üòÇ
Right. You live in NJ to the top of Mount Olympus. The way things are done in your state aren't necessarily the way things are done everywhere else.  


Are you starting to connect the dots yet?
Not pissed yet, if it was because of a bad battery and the sensors are getting confused that would be fine, if it‚Äôs a big deal me and the dealer are gonna have beeeef
Not trying to beat up on you. We all make mistakes and sometimes the only way to learn is to make those mistakes. Next time get a comprehensive inspection. 

One thing to think about. You say the owner had meticulous records of maintenance and service yet you found it needed a battery. Those two things kind of contradict each other.  

I hope everything works out for ya and you enjoy and get a lot of good service out of this vehicle. 

As several have said here replace the battery have the codes rescanned and if applicable have the monitors and all that run and relearn. See where you're at.
And they usually cost around $100. Well worth it!
Tried watching FFX last night, got about 10 minutes in and turned it off.
I feel like most of the negative reviews are from people who have no clue what they're doing and would just be wasting 20 bucks with it anyway.
That would let you know a misfire is currently happening, so that‚Äôs a good thing in your case.
> Unhook the battery for 30 min
Even 30 mins is sometimes not enough to fully drain capacitors holding residual charge. The common trick is to touch the two battery terminal clamps together AFTER DISCONNECTING BOTH from the battery. 30 seconds of this WILL clear every module in the car that isn't writing errors to non-volatile memory.

Do this at your own risk. Your car may be relying on various modules to maintain a tiny bit of capacitor charge to retain important settings.
You must have me confused with someone else.  I don't date farm animals
>You say the owner had meticulous records of maintenance and service yet you found it needed a battery. 

nah, modern cars/batteries can up and die on you outa the blue. my old truck, factory battery 8 years old, started fine, drove to work, parked. went to leave that evening and battery flat dead. Its not like old carburator days on a cold start you can hear it slow down and start chuggin  as its cranking as a warning hey your battery is about dead. modern cars start in like .5-1 sec so you dont notice the slow cranking.
I got it from a used car dealer, the owner didint sell it to me
Also OP, if you got the car from a previous owner, they have every reason to over exaggerate the condition of the car so you‚Äôll buy it. I‚Äôve found through past experiences that buying from owners is never a good idea, even if you know the person and think they‚Äôre trustworthy. There are obviously exceptions to this. But for the most part I try and stay away from it and advise others to do the same. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this though. It fucking sucks
If it‚Äôs flashing it means it can cause converter damage, you can have a misfire without the flashing.
Thanks for answering it üôÇ
Yeah I miss the old days when you had a couple of days warning when the battery was about to die!
Yup.  The notion that a dying battery contradicts good maintenance is just wild.
Agree with this sentiment.  I maintain my car very well. Probably a bit too often on some things. Last year on a Sunday I drove the car 400 miles. Came home and parked. Wife went to use it on Tuesday and it just gave the sad clicks. No indication on the prior drive, never had to jump it off. It may have tested alright, but the battery was 5 years old at this point. So I went ahead and replaced it.
That was exactly how it happened to me on my 4 year old semi truck, no heads up at all. Went to start it up and nothing, totally dead battery bank.
You can still get that with the TBI's as well (how I knew I needed a new one)
So they exaggerated the quality of the maintenance history.  ‚ÄúLook at all the oil changes on the Carfax, this one‚Äôs a keeper!‚Äù  Meanwhile literally nothing else was done.  Multiple misfires could be overdue spark plugs among other things.

That or the battery died because it sat on their lot for a month or two in the dead of winter, and batteries hate that.
If you bought this car a week ago from a used car dealer, I'd take it back and get my money back. I'm not completely sure but, I think a car dealer has to take it back if within a certain time frame. Not to mention that the issues were being masked from you  (intentionally or unintentionally) by them not having a good battery in the vehicle.
You should be able to take it back for them to fix
Just get back in there and make a scene, not sure what ur state regs are over there, but up in commy canada, the dealer could get in some srs shit with the governing body for selling that thing without disclosing
if you financed the vehicle, call the bank and tell them about the vehicle, tell them that you JUST purchased the car and it has car issues. Maybe they won't fund the loan.
Hopefully they had a warranty. Every used car dealership I've purchased from had a 30 day, 3000 mile warranty.
No A Flashing MIL means something very bad is happing, at that point you shut the engine as soon as its safe to do so.   


I had a lady drive here Mazda Portege from OK City, OK to Corpus Christi, Tx with the MIL flashing. I had to put a knew engine in it because she blow a whole in the 3 cylinder from a bad coil pack.   


The MIL was flushing because the miss was so sever that the ECU was throwing codes like a Crip and Blood meet up.
yea ive had that happen too. drive 200 miles no issues multiple stops and starts, park it and one trip to work and back and it died. charged it and still tested bad
kept the good history, threw out the bad!! Any inspection includes a scan for those hard codes, that dealer is in the fraud busines first and trying to sell cars second!!!
>Multiple misfires could be overdue spark plugs among other things.

Its from the low voltage, same with the lost communication one. Dudes alternator probably bit the dust suddenly, likely just bad luck. Not saying don't check the plugs, but you need voltage first.
I recently learned something about batteries. Or at least i THINK i learned something bc idk 100% if this is true, or if im explaining it right. As batts discharge, the electrolyte is more water than acid. Then, freezing Temps and boom, your batts dead. A questionable battery will often do fine in normal Temps but expose it to freezing Temps and kaput. There's some science-y stuff going on inside the batt with the electrolyte. I've had it explained to me a few times, but I never retain it lol. Something to do with electrons or something being exchanged from the plates back to the water(electrolyte) in the batt. Idk a lot of it is a tad over my head.
Unless it was specifically stated in writing Used cars are almost always as is.

Editing to state that if it is a decent dealer (which it sounds like this one is not) they might work with you in getting it fixed if something is actually wrong
Assuming this dealer does not do the honorable thing.  Review if your state has lemon laws.
Unfortunately alot of dealerships will not take a used car back unless you can lemon law it and even then the dealership is going to fight you at every turn
Why in the world would anyone think you could just take a used car back. Unless it‚Äôs certified preowned you never get a warranty or 30 days or anything with a used car.
Not sure what country you live in... but that doesn't happen in the US.  Most everytime you buy a used car they as is where is and you also have no lemon law coverage.  Used cars are a crap shoot.
Yes something bad is happening but it‚Äôs flashing because it can cause converter damage. Check engine light is mainly there for emission related problems. As a mechanic yeah if it‚Äôs flashing it‚Äôs no bueno but it‚Äôs so you don‚Äôt damage your converter.
The flashing means your converter is currently being fuckered. Yes, it also means some very bad things are probably happening. The check engine light itself is primarily an emissions thing, it just so happens it's also pretty helpful for finding out what the problem is.

Someones gotta go back into town and get a shitload of dimes!
I wanna run my fingers along those boxes so badly
God damn.
How long did this take you?
Keep practicing. You‚Äôll get there one day. JK obviously. Beautiful
No notes.
Please keep posting
I‚Äôm sick of you already, I‚Äôm jealous of your skills

jk, keep it up man
just simply beautiful!!
That's some badass welds
I need more lotion
Wowzers
Beautiful welds! ü§§

For a boat?
Wow
This looks unbelievably beautiful. Well done man great job.
sex
Im hard as a rock rn
Beautiful work !!!!!!!! I can't imagine it gets much better than that. Well Done !!!!!!!
Nice.  Very nice.üëçüèº
Remarkable!!!
I don‚Äôt even weld and this makes me wanna touch myself
That etch line is so tight. I assume you're not using much cleaning action because it clean, virgin material?
What is your balance set to? 
Thanks!
What machine are you using?
I‚Äôve never so much as touched any variety of welding machine and these welds make me feel inadequate as a human being.
Are you taking apprentices lol

Hats off to you üëè 

Awesome work!
You‚Äôre bench cranks out some nice welds üëè
i love burning ally. Sweet stuff
The least divided I've seen this community, lol. Good stuff
Sexy af
I dont know what they pay ya. But it should be more. I tried alum and it looked like a dog puked on a cat shit
What temp do you preheat aluminum to?
Me if the boss would just let me smoke my mystical plant medicine on the job
Slick Rick...

What type of machine?
Love seeing welders you can‚Äôt fuck with. I‚Äôm a good welder but that‚Äôs above what I can do. Unless it‚Äôs aluminum.
Hell yeah depending on where you live way higher. I make over 45 running MIG and if I learned to TIG like this I would demand more haha.
Miller Dynasty 350. 
2% 3/32 lanthanated electrode. 
150 amps, not using all of it though. 
20-25 cfh argon. 
1/16 and 3/32 5356 rod
Of course. Too OCD to be in a relationship lmao
Use a more modern tungsten like 2% lanthanated and give it a point with a slightly rounded over tip to help prevent fractures from heat cycles.
I set my amperage higher than what I‚Äôm gonna weld at to ball up my electrode. Then turn my machine back down to weld. Could also reverse polarity and ball it up.
The best tungsten I‚Äôve used with aluminum is LaYZr by ck worldwide. It holds a point much better than any other tungsten I‚Äôve tried and if you prefer balling it doesn‚Äôt start to pull to one side or split nearly as much as other brands.
Nova Scotia mechanic checking in, same shit here
No ndt, just visual inspection
Pretty low amperage and corner to corner welds with intermittent tacking
Small parts for Navy Zodiacs
100% agree it pretty - but without NDT pretty is pretty.  A weld that holds - holds.
Couple hours for the 4 boxes roughly
Yes
üçª
Thanks! So I'm clear 75% EN?
75% cleaning and 125 hz. The material is fresh off a waterjet or a cnc router, so pretty clean anyways. The small stuff doesn‚Äôt require much penetration usually so I prefer the cleaning side of the dial. I‚Äôll flip it to the penetration side for thicker material or something that‚Äôs getting tested.
Miller Dynasty 350. Best machine I‚Äôve used.
No preheat, start slow and allow the work to get up to temperature then increase travel speed
Miller Dynasty 350
Oh ok good. Because those are gorgeous welds. But I thought it was done with tig. Impressive either way tho
wtf where do yall live
What frequency?
God I love this machine. Only thing I‚Äôve found comparable is the Lincoln precision tig 275.
Squarewave?
No time for women. Must. Keep. Welding!!!!
‚òùüèªwhat he said
This is the way!
ive used dcen on brass to reasonable effect
interesting! ive tried blue and green as well from CK, but never olive green. ill let my boss know
Vancouver TIG welder here. I‚Äôm gonna agree with you guys on that
Really nice work man. Thanks for sharing.¬† Is it 5052 h32?
So damn cool! Be careful what you post tho üò≥
Nice. Beats the hell out of my 40 year old Airco Heliwelder.
Gotcha
I was agreeing with you haha those aren‚Äôt mine
It is tig. GasTungstenArcWelding
I live in Indiana
120 hz
The Lincoln aspect 375 is comparable as well üçª
Thanks man üçª 5086. We use 5052 for sharp rad forming to avoid cracking
Oh i see now üòÇ
Tungsten Inert Gas Welding
Should post a video of you working, super sick!
That is an insanely nice machine.  Cheers!
I‚Äôll post a video next weeküçª
Screw skiers‚Ä¶
First day with my new board and camera‚Ä¶ dude broke my collarbone, and broke his femur

Well, at least he broke his own femur instead of yours. Hope you have a speedy recovery.
That‚Äôs insane. Even seems like he‚Äôs looking right at you.
Skier is a complete moron. So sorry about your injury.
I‚Äôm having a hard time seeing how dude didn‚Äôt see you. It looked like person almost purposely ran into you
He never really ever got in front of you enough for you to see him. Fully in the worst of your blind spot. Why would he come across the entire run after sticking to the other half?! Skier needed to take his blinders off.

At least you have video if he tries to blame you at all.
I‚Äôm ready to set aside the skier hate but that dude is a moron‚Ä¶

Edit: I‚Äôm slightly curious how this will go over in r/skiing. Posts seem to be getting shared across subs lately.
It looks like its on purpose man. What the fuck... he went straight for a very long time right at you... much more than the previous turns.
https://preview.redd.it/7x6hk6b5ufic1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=757186b3ad8f5b414a081ba9b5dee59267e7fd7d

That‚Äôs not his knee bending there ü¶¥
Not about the skies - this is about the person being a total moron!
It's like he thinks he's a dog trying to sniff another dog's ass
That is awesome that you got video evidence
Were his eyes closed? What the fuck was that? 

Edit: Honestly bro, I would sue the shit outa this guy. That‚Äôs completely inexcusable. You should talk to an attorney.
Super fucking annoying. I‚Äôd be livid. Last year I had someone break my arm and all I could smell while they apologized was liquor. That‚Äôs why I advocate for drinks after the slopes and not on them. I‚Äôd guess that is the cause for a lot of accidents but it seems this guys just braindead!
He saw you scraping the snow off of the mountain and had to take immediate action to stop the criminal
Good news is you broke your collarbone versus your femur. That dudes leg looked fucked.
I can‚Äôt stand when skiers meander back and forth across the entire fucking trail like they are entitled to the whole thing.
"man I'm so good I can ski this mountain with my eyes closed."
Gotta stop looking at it at boarders vs skiers. Hate the individual. 
This skier is an incompetent prick, absolutely, but plz don't paint us all with that brush. I've had a boarder do basically the same to me, there's asshats on both sides. 
If he was a certain race, are you gonna hate that race? üòÇ
I mean, even if completely pretending he doesnt see you, why would he cross the track like that?

You had an area and he had an area.

First rule I follow on the mountain, I ride in a certain space, continuously, so as to avoid accidents even if I dont see them (I hope they see me). Suddenly crossing like that is a recipe for disaster...
This makes me thankful the one bad collision I had didn't get either one of us fucked up. Night run, both with black cloths. I'm hauling ass strait down the hill, he's crossing from a trail on one side to the other (I didn't have that exit marked in the brain, black diamond is more than my skii's every 2-3 years ass wants to do) we collide, knocked him off his board, I lost a ski. Couple minutes later we both compose ourself and finish the hill. Just a bit sore, no injuries, thank fuck. He gets a few glow sticks, gives me a few, I get him a pizza and a drink. Bullshit for a bit because we're not complete assholes and have a good night after that.
Definitely sue that man.
Dude, he‚Äôs has the right of way. He‚Äôs up hill of you. You slowed down without being aware of your surroundings. Totally your fault‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Just kidding, skiers suck! Get well soon!
That was an assassination attempt. He was aiming for you.
Wide looping turns literally the width of the run ‚úÖ
No regard for surroundings despite ability to look left and right ‚úÖ
Bright clothes still in blind spot ‚úÖ
Absolute comical yard sale of a fall ‚úÖ

Classic skier. Really sucks sorry about your injury dude. Hope the board is at least alright
So often do I watch these ‚Äúscrew skier‚Äù videos and think, both parties are a little at fault and instead of putting blame on someone, just accept what happened and move on. This video though? Fuck that guy.
I wouldve beat the shit out of him, good luck with your recovery
You hit him with the ninja smoke bomb lol. He probably thought he was going to ski right through that cloud.
Damn dude both of those breaks are no joke.
Feel better bro, that video is rough to watch when you notice his femur snapping in half
As a snowboarder I have never understood why skiiers are so dense. Using the entire trail is like swerving between all lanes of traffic on a highway, sometimes at the same speeds. That guy sucks so bad
Yes the fault is on him and please don't take this the wrong way but... At no point in that video did I ever see you look to the left and you certainly didn't check before slowing. That guy was with you for a while yet it kinda seems like you were oblivious to his presence until the impact. Liability aside, getting hit hurts and better on mtn awareness can go a long ways toward keeping you safe in the future.
That skier is blind
Damn that dude was looking right at you too wtf
Dude literally honed in on you like a heat seeking missile. It‚Äôs amazing how many people ride like this, has a wide open run and literally locks on to you and dick rides. Sorry this happened to you, definitely recover asap!
100% skiers fault
[deleted]
You are definitely 100% not at fault. This is crazy! I will say though I'll never understand riding side by side with someone like this. The whole hill looks empty. I'm surprised one of you didn't let up to get some space from each other. The crowds on hills always come in waves - if you pull off to the side for 60 seconds and let the wave pass you almost always get the run to yourself. Maybe it's just me, but I always let up. I don't trust anyone out there.


¬†Hope¬†you heal up¬†quickly! Broken¬†collar bone is not fun...¬†
Would be curious how old he was roughly. For some reason seems like a grandpa. At least that's the only way I could explain it.
Are people fucking blind?
Skier didnt even pizza. Should be an assault case honestly
brutal, and totally his fault.  sorry, man.
lol what an idiot
Sick selfie stick
Hope this fuck has to cover your medical bills
Idk if I'd say screw skiers, but yeah fuck this guy in particular. Doesn't matter what's strapped to your feet, you always need to be aware of who's around you. Glad you caught the whole thing on video though, pretty easy to see who was at fault.
Almost this exact scenario happened to me a few years ago but I caught the skiier in the corner of my eye and reacted, ended up catching a toe edge and eating shit. Hit the ground so hard my binding broke off my board and I sprained my ACL, MCL, and bruised my femur. Skiier just carried on without stopping like nothing happened. Would have loved to have video of it. Why the hell do people just cut across the whole slope without looking!?
I‚Äôve been sued over some bullshit on the slopes‚Ä¶ and even I would say absolutely hold him liable for this.  Medical bills, pain and suffering, lost value of season pass and snowboarding season cut short.

He will have homeowners (or renters) insurance which should have a minimum of 100k personal liability coverage. Likely more.
I was ran over by a skier from behind, never saw him on that slope, a couple of weeks ago. Didn't care if I was ok, didn't apologise. Didn't fall either so I suspect it was on purpose.
It wasn't because he was skiing. I think it was just a moron.
These guys should be prevented from going on the slopes such as drivers do if they run over people. A'holes do not belong to the mountain
It‚Äôs so funny that skiers say that snowboarders are the ones that can‚Äôt see where they‚Äôre going. I can see 360 degrees around me throughout my turns. Most skiers can‚Äôt ever see what‚Äôs uphill of them. But this MFer can‚Äôt even see what‚Äôs right fucking in front of him. What a disgrace. Sorry about your collarbone, bro. They heal quickly (I‚Äôve broken both).
I know you‚Äôre not supposed to say certain words anymore that are now considered demeaning to portions of the population that don‚Äôt deserve it. I respect that, but for the sake of humor and denigration of the party at fault, I‚Äôm going to say it. That dude is **retarded** for having all that room and hitting the one person who is right in front of him on the edge of the run.
As a skier, and on behalf of skiers, we do not claim this man
Thankfully collar bone isn‚Äôt a horrible healing process relative to a femur. 

Just broke mine and was right as rain in about a month and a half.
Skier here, that guy sucks ass at skiing.
Skier should have reacted or noticed but also always important to check your surroundings frequently
This happen at Breck? If so I rode the gondola down with the guy and girl who were there when it happened. Girl stayed with you guys and the guy went to get help. Dude on skis was mad they had to cut his pants because they were new.
Saw from the other thread you got your nurse‚Äôs number. Right on, bud!

I bonked my head in the park 15 years ago, woke up in the hospital two days later. Asked the cute nurse out, now we‚Äôre married with a couple of kids.

The outpatient care has been top notch.
Probably just figured as a snowboarder you‚Äôd want to be on your ass some more.
Definitely the skiers fault. They were uphill and veered right.
Lmao if you check the post in /r/skiing the subcomments under the top comment are clawing at any reason the snowboarder could have been in the wrong. 

"holding a camera" 
"stopping on a dime" 
"staying too parallel to the skier"

It;s ridiculous.
As a skier, this was fucking egregious. I‚Äôm so sorry
Dude had half the slope open on his side and still chose violence.
Wtf?! Looked like he crashed into you intentionally.
That dudes an idiot. Fuck that guy. Ski under control
no, screw that guy. why would you generalise a whole group of people based on what this one person did
I wonder if you can sue to cover medical bills as if it's a car accident
That honestly looks like he aimed for you, what the fuck, hey man at least you fucked up his femur which is a pretty serious injury. He is either an absolute asshole and wanted to take you out for "Getting in his way" (Which you weren't) or he is the most oblivious moron on the planet.
Ugh my first time doing a night ride some skier totally clotheslined me and dragged me halfway down the mountain. Then he asked me out. Barf
That dudes just a complete idiot, I promise I‚Äôm not like that on the slopes
Sorry to hear that.  I ski but this guys looks absolutely out of control.
Honestly, what was the skier trying to do?
The skier looks like a total beginner imo, like what is that stance?! This is so terrible just awful that he did this. Embarrassing.
Looks like he wanted to hit you. Good thing you got that on video
Fucking moron. Glad he got injured the most since he deserved that
I have been a lurker on both communities for a while, have friends that do both and I honestly lean towards skiing, but skiiers are the worst. It seems it is their fault 99% of the time I see this shit. I hate that people overestimate their abilities and underestimate the dangers of rocketing downhill at 40 mph.
At least he got it worse. Maybe the pain in his leg for the rest of his life will make him yield better.
What the fuck is he doing?
damn he broke his femur?? crash doesn't seem gnarly enough but maybe he wasn't drinking enough milk
What the f*ck?!
Well, then‚Ä¶ his skiing days are certainly over.
Blind skier lol damn
I hope you are fine, otherwise I wish you a quick recovery. The skier is 100% at fault, he was uphill. However, I wish the title of the post would be "screw this skier" instead of all of them as the title suggests.
Broken collarbone sucks! Hopefully it‚Äôs your off arm and doesn‚Äôt need surgery.

I think that stance switch got you. Same thing happened to me but luckily no broken bones. Knocked the wind outta me and ruined my week though can‚Äôt imagine what this feels like for you and the broken femur guy :(

Hope you heal quickly <3
This was 100% the skier‚Äôs fault. He had a good sight line in you and you were ahead of him.
No. Screw that skier.
Fucking pole holders.
What a jerry
Found rare photo of the skier

https://preview.redd.it/bqiy9bx1qkic1.jpeg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eed4a0b6992773378d939abbf0ea996aa9d525cb
This is the type of idiot that could kill a child on the piste.

I hope he never skies again.
Damn you can kinda see when he broke his femer
Apparently a blind skier. Had so much time to avoid collision
He ran directly into you...smh
Skier was out of control, no awareness, probably blamed the boarder. I‚Äôll never understand the entitlement. It‚Äôs like a highway, stay in your lane.
They always do this shit
Pause at 14 you see him go full on pizza mode  
Dude is an amateur and wasn't in control, and had no business going french fry on that run 

Imagine being 1 of 2 people on the entire mountain and you make a, what could  only be conscious, effort to run into the only other person there.

I wonder if he can tie his own shoes
Had a skiier coming downhill at me "excuse me!"

I said "not how that works!"

After she passed she somehow simultaneously started a yard sale and face planted. Gotta love the local mountains in LA.
How blind is that skier. Wtf....... He has his fucking eyes closed or what.
with that much open space on the run, how could the skier hit him? ridiculous that he even got that close.
Why? Like dude what? How does he drive on the road?
Snowboarders catch a lot of shit, but there is nothing more dangerous than some idiot skiers taking the biggest s turns possible who think they're decent
As a skier, I‚Äôd like to apologize on behalf of my fellow skiers. I am trying to get more into snowboarding but reckless behavior like this is not ok. Hope you recover well!
I have a torn shoulder from a very similar incident. It was 20 years ago but still hurts from time to time
These videos are wild. So sorry this happened to you, people are idiots
What a god damn retard. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. Did he have to get carted off? Femur can be a bad break.
Such a wide hill. Stay on your side skier dude.¬†
Wtf‚Ä¶ is that person blind ?
What an asshole‚Ä¶
Accidents happen. Why blame all skiers?
He French fried when he should‚Äôve pizza‚Äôd
Someone, maybe OP, is going through all of the new comments and downvoting them if there‚Äôs even the faintest hint of ‚Äúhey maybe you should have been more protective of yourself‚Äù

 
As someone who‚Äôs never been to a mountain, I still maintain no urges to go to a mountain.
Big ass mountain and can't hold 2 people. Retarded fucking rich people who have 0 survival skills but 100 points into money
Ever heard of defensive driving? Same applies to snow sports. Always assume you are surrounded by idiots - because you are. A head on a swivel and defensively maneuvering to avoid potential idiots would have saved you. Hard lesson to learn but hopefully it sticks
Kind of your fault for stopping in the middle of a run.  Be more aware next time
This was your fault, though
Don‚Äôt just stop in the middle of a trail
You should never just stop in the middle of a slope without looking uphill first. Yeah the skier should have dodged you, but this could easily have been prevented if you looked around and stopped to the side of the slope.
Skier is crazy at fault. It's in slow motion at the end, but I'm wondering if the skier thought OP was cutting more to the left and skier thought OP was going to be way clear of OP? Definitely seemed like an unnecessary move.
What a great place to stop, while not taking any care to be aware of your surroundings!


Bravo üëè
You did break check him :/
Why the fuck would you go to stop right there..
Tbh neither of you are paying any attention to each other. Both gotta be more aware on the mountain
I do both and love both I've seen reckless snowboarding far more than skiing. People get the hang of snowboarding after 2 or 3 sessions and start carving up the mountain like they've done it their whole laugh and than smash right into people and throw their hands up like it's not their fault. Skiers running into people more often than not is also someone learning but someone more hesitant and makes a mistake. Point is both sports have plenty of dumbasses running into people but the amount of times I've seen a snowboarder who's brand new take out like a kid or anyone vs the opposite isn't even close. So.....fuck bad skiers and snowboarders. Not one or the other dumb dumb
You caused that intentionally.
put your damn camera down and shred like you are supposed to! and get well
I don‚Äôt ski or snowboard, I‚Äôm curious why you would just stop all of a sudden? Is that normal? Looks like just in the middle of the slope and not the bottom.
Why'd you stop for no reason
You both signed up to go speeding down a hill where injury can occur. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. The world doesn't revolve around you or anyone else when it comes down to doing fun shit like this.
You can really see when the femur breaks üò≥
I love how people always group 1 idiot into whatever group they choose üôÑ
Hopefully the snowboarder died
Why did you just randomly decide to stop?
this is not a Ski/Snowboard thing.

If you're uphill of someone then you _must_ give way to them and maintain control to avoid a collision with them at all times, under all circumstances (including them falling or stopping quickly).

it's precisely the same as the highway code: if you are behind then you must give way to those in front.

for example:

NSAA, CWSAA: (USA, Canada)
> 1. Always stay in control. You must be able to stop or avoid people or objects.
> 2. People ahead or downhill of you have the right-of-way. You must avoid them.

ASAA: (Australiaa)
> Stay in control and avoid other people and hazards.

> It is your responsibility to avoid and give way to people below and beside you.

FIS: (France)
> A skier or snowboarder must move in control. He must adapt his speed
and manner of skiing or snowboarding to his personal ability and to the
prevailing conditions of terrain, snow and weather as well as to the density
of traffic. 

> A skier or snowboarder coming from behind must choose his route in such
a way that he does not endanger skiers or snowboarders ahead.
Honestly looks like you tried to blind them on purpose.
Don‚Äôt stop in the middle of the run dingus
Wow, pretty nuts blaming all skiers for this one idiot that ran into you. Just cuz one woman cheated on you doesn't mean "screw women" either
You were in his way, maybe wear more than black douche bag clothes.
Why did you stop?
Screw nerds filming themselves üò≠

(I'm a snowboarder)
They‚Äôre the bicyclists of the slopes
ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?!
That skier is an idiot, but so is anyone who films themselves with a selfie stick
Not to defend the skier (who is definitely at fault), but it looks as if he though he started to cut over assuming you were maintaining the same speed you were at and was planning on going behind you, but your rate of deceleration lined up with his trajectory. Again, not defending him, but people here saying "it looks like he's *trying* to hit you" is a bit wild...
Since each turn included a slide, skier probably figured that rider simply slid a bit more and would go back to toe side like they had previously, and did not anticipate full stop for no apparent reason. I'd blame skier about 85-90%.  Riding groomers is like driving on roads, you need to be aware of everyone, (i.e. look over you shoulder) not being at fault won't make the pain go away.
I mean skier is a fucking moron, but speeding up in front of the dude and then stopping in the exact same lane you were previously snowboarding in is kinda of inviting trouble no?

Like this is the same shit as not being at fault when you get into a car accident. Just cuz it‚Äôs not your fault doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt do a lot of things to help cause it
I would talk to a lawyer because it looks malicious and people like that have no place on the mountain. Regardless of intent.
You'd think for as straight as those skies are they'd be able to go down the mountain in a straight path besides taking up the whole mountain
Normally I'd say something about a blanket statement like "screw skiers" but I've noticed they're particularly bad this year.

No self-awareness. No understanding of basic etiquette.

Was out on Sunday and had to mash on the brakes multiple times due to skiers suddenly cutting the run. Even my cousin, a skier, called it out several times.

Even had one dude go through the singles line and try to hop on with us, when there was one couple behind us, and NOBODY else in line, sandwiching me in the middle.

And the majority of them are grown-ass adults, who are definitely at least a decade older than my grown-ass adult ass.

Sorry you got wrecked... Broken collar bones suck, but at least they heal fairly quickly.
Just out of curiosity, why did you stop in the middle of the run?
[full 360 video](https://s.insta360.com/p/276ce4f6b5c74aae7444ef35add24a36)
been skiing nearly 40 years only ever ran into by snowboarders, happens a few times each season... I think they all stoned or something
It‚Äôs always the skiers fault.
And yet skiers will go on and on about how snowboarders are a problem and act with extreme prejudice even while just on a lift line. Absolutely numbskull behavior. üôÑ
The ICBM special
Looked intentional
Skiers have tunnel vision. I see it every single day. I live in Summit County. Have for 8 years year round. My family has live here for the past 30 years.
Honestly it looks like he did it on purpose which is wild üòÇ
What the actual fuck
As much as I‚Äôd like to call it a mistake, it takes talent for the skier to be that stupid
I think you can see his femur break left leg bends too high for a knee
Lawsuit?
Looks like he scoped your selfie stick/camera and was pacing you, then somehow didn't notice or improperly judged how much speed you checked and tried to pull a maverick-buzzing-the-tower stunt without actually being Tom Cruise or having a production crew. Sucks to have your season shortened by such selfish douchebaggery >.< Hope next winter makes it up to you, OP!
https://preview.redd.it/57gsv73hbjbd1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d522feb268e2685786693f67ca1bbaadab439e7f

My brother passion-of-the-christ‚Äôd you
What goggles are those
While I do agree that the skier is at fault here, there's a few things to be said....

Put the selfie-stick down. You aren't pro and nobody cares about your groomer footage. You clearly aren't a good enough rider for it not to be a distraction. 

Shoulder checks. Do them often. You should have known he was close to you, as he was basically beside you at times... Especially if you're about to stop in the middle of a run.

Ignore all the idiots telling you to sue... Holy shit, is that the American answer to everything? Dude broke his femur... He has enough problems to deal with. If he's dumb enough to try to sue you, you have video evidence to shut that down quickly.

He did not run into you intentionally... Nobody does that. Perhaps he was trying to buzz the tower, but I guarantee there was no intent to injure.

Getting sick of this whole skier vs snowboarder thing... People are dumb, regardless of what they strap to their feet to slide down a mountain. 

What I see here is 2 people with no spatial awareness and even less luck. Sucks that you were both hurt... Hope you heal up quickly.
Jeeeeeeesus these fucking dorks
[removed]
God damn snow boarders coming to a dead stop in the middle of slopes.  Sometimes just sitting down.  You are a hazard to everyone including other snowboarders
lol what? You stopped in the middle of the run and weren‚Äôt looking around, go sue them and win like gweneth paltro or whatever but I would never ride with you.
Last time out I was getting on the lift, knew I was turning left off the lift so I got aaaallll the way over on the left side. As I go to sit down, there is a skier who had crept in BEHIND ME and sat on the furthest left seat, you know, where I was trying to already sit down. 

I actually said aloud ‚Äúwhat the fuck?! Why?!‚Äù
Why do people go so wide. Hog the whole slope.
WTF!? The skier is either blind or has the situational awareness of a roll of toilet paper.
Da fuck
As someone who suffered a season ending injury recently, this is very sad to see. I hope you have a speedy recovery..

Since the skier is totally at fault, can you sue or something?
Would definitely talk to a lawyer that knows Mountian law.

Edit: After reading a law offices site that covers this. I would 100% talk to a lawyer that has done this type of work before. This video is enough evidence to at least protect you from going into debt.
So you suddenly stop and get mad when he hits you?
I hope you are suing him for your medical bills , lost wages etc?
That was on purpose.
Ya shouldn‚Äôt have break checked someone driving a truck!
This is why I don‚Äôt feel bad about snowboarding just a bit faster than everyone else. It isn‚Äôt about being a cocky or main charactering like some want you to believe. If I‚Äôm going faster, even just a bit, then I‚Äôm leading the current and the current can‚Äôt blindside me. I use the same principle on my motorcycle too. I bet this guy stood up and thought you were in the wrong to some degree
Your camera angle is weird and it's hard to tell who is at fault.. we don't have a full picture here to make a conclusion. 

Skier is innocent until proven otherwise.
Looks staged
Both of yall are retarded
Well you did slam on the brakes randomly, fuck snowboarders they're always assholes
I think you were both dicks here, honestly. Dude didn‚Äôt have his eyes open and didn‚Äôt need to be taking up the run like that, but are you serious with that sidehill dusting you gave him? It looked like a purposeful and successful attempt at spraying him for getting too close. That‚Äôs  part of the reason he accidentally went into you‚Ä¶and he broke HIS femur? More than enough karma for knocking into you, a femur break is no joke, that‚Äôs the biggest bone in your body and it‚Äôs like a concrete pillar. Sorry about your little collarbone, dude, but you‚Äôll be okay. That dude will be fucked up for a while.

Shake it off, and next time, try yelling to space eater skiers to watch their space.
wait are you serious trying to say this was the skiers fault?  when its on video of the skier being cut off and dusted by the snowboarder being a douche for the camera?  unreal.
I guess I‚Äôm seeing something different than literally everyone in the comments. But the snowboarder stopped in the middle of the run for absolutely no reason other than to kick up some snow. Of course the skier ran into him. If the snowboarder would‚Äôve stayed progressing downhill then neither one of them would‚Äôve gotten injured
At least we don‚Äôt turn the entire trail into fucking ice. Learn to snow board , stop going down mountains sideways please üòÇ 

Btw I broke my collarbone skiing due to a snowmaking pole being left on a trail. Couldn‚Äôt stop because snowboarders turned the entire trail into Ice because they don‚Äôt know how to stop/ride on sides of board like you‚Äôre supposed to.
Screw him because you stopped in the middle of the slope??? Screw you! Learn how to board safely
Now do the video without slow motion. We‚Äôll see stopping and curling into the middle of the trail is not wise. Why would you put faith in the skier and be 50% at fault here? The wide angle lens is also deceptive. 50/50 accident here. Sorry for your injury, but the vast majority of skiers are not this inept by comparison. Meaning 8 of 10 skiers are good trail mates whereas 7 out of 10
Snowboarders are. More idiot kids in the latter grouping.
Not 100% skier's fault. Snowboarder slowed down/stopped in middle of the trail. When going downhill the worst is someone stopping giving less time to react.
Both of you have a skill issue
Why did you stop like that? Eesh, you're as much at fault here as the skier is.
You‚Äôre both idiots. Why would you stop in the middle of the trail without looking around?

GoPros should be banned on resorts. The number of people filming themselves ride on a groomed trail, without a single fucking clue what‚Äôs happening right next to them, is scary. Dude was literally right next to you, the entire clip.
Looks like Joe Biden skiing
Skiers fault mostly but you are insane for stopping in the run and not looking in your blind spots and up mountain. You knew he was beside you. 

Just crazy to be that carefree - probably because you‚Äôre too worried and focused on your camera. I hope they ban them.
Angle of the camera is deceiving.

Skier is holding their line back and forth evenly and predictably.

Snowboarder is all over the place and distracted, pulling some serious r/ImTheMainCharacter, then towards the end cuts way over in front of the skier.

Camera is fixed on snowboarders perspective and makes it look like the snowboarder is traveling straight. Watch the tracks in the snow. He abruptly carves over in front of the skier without warning or even bothering to look around as he stops. Too focused on his own little show.

Snowboarder broke the skier‚Äôs leg by being a selfish jackass. Then goes on Reddit to garner sympathy. And the community backs him like sheep. Embarrassing to be a snowboarder.
It looks like you had zero situational awareness, slammed on the brakes, and blinded the only person that needed to stop in that moment. 

You can‚Äôt throw a smokescreen and expect the other person near you, carving the same as you, to see you through a wall of snow.  From the video, you had no idea he was there, but your 360 cam did.  

Only after the incident, you choose to do these mental gymnastics to sound like the victim.

Long story short.  You both lacked important situational awareness in this video. 
Be that as it may, I hope both of you heal up healthily and quickly.
You completely cut into his line and stopped. 

It‚Äôs a bit of an optical illusion because the camera follows you, making it seem like you aren‚Äôt cutting across the run. 

But watch the shadows. He‚Äôs skiing along at the top of the trees shadows and that‚Äôs where you get hit. You‚Äôre riding about 30 feet from him before suddenly cutting toward your blindside without looking and stopping. 

You both share some fault here.
Yeah a femur's more punishing than a collarbone
Right lol i hope the snowboard really dug into the guys shins
Yeah man! First time I went skiiing I broke a leg...

Thank god it wasnt mine!
Target fixation is a real thing
You got yourself in the skier‚Äôs blind spot. Right in front of them.
He fucking AIMED for OP it looks like. 

OP, send him your hospital bill.
It's slow motion in the end. But still wonder why he have no reaction, like braking a bit or try to avoid it.
This feels staged
Skier 100% at fault.  What a D-bag
Ya what the fuck was that
Imagine he looked anywhere other than straight ahead
This looks like assault
Just look how much room is out there.  Not like it‚Äôs a tight trail or anything.
That skier was either skiing outside his limits or high maybe both.
I need some clarification.

Like driving, but skiers and snowboarders need to be predictable. If you can't, get on green.

This snowboarder was speeding down the hill and then full stop. He's the obvious idiot here. I'm still on the fence for the skier to be at fault here tbh 

It's complete white terrain, so I can't tell whose lane is who. I just can't imagine if they're both in their own lane and one stops the other would aim right for him to plow into him. It's more likely he stopped in the other guy's lane. But that's all speculation. Maybe there is a turn or curve to account for.
Boarder with a selfie stick stops in the middle of the tub with no warning then cuts toward skier at the last second... Skier is at fault, boarder could use some instruction as well. this is how to get hurt.
I rear ended a lady driving once, she slammed on her brakes going through an intersection. My fault I hit her. She did dangerous and thoughtless thing.
Or like he was trying to buzz past him for the camera.
I don‚Äôt even ski and the lack of situational awareness that skier had is insane.  It looks intentional.  Glad that fucker broke his leg.  Hopefully it end his skiing hobby.  Slopes are safer now.
Skiers pull this shit all the time, there's a lot of skiers specifically that think they're the main character and just cut across runs. It's especially bad on cat tracks at my mountain
You can still see straight with blinders. This dude had the whole blindfold on.
Idk. For all those reasons, this seems sus.
Not checking your six is a good way for this to happen. It‚Äôs better to be aware, take a sec to look. Especially when stopping or crossing a run. Skiers like to pull over and never look uphill more often imo.
I wonder if somehow kicking up the snow obscured OP from the skiers view. Skier looks to be well enough in control and making predictable carves up until he decided to just send it into you. Obviously his fault and I‚Äôm sorry it happened to you.

Are there any trails that connect where you stopped?
Skier here. Skier is 100% at fault. Skier approached the boarder from uphill and from heel side while flying across the slope like a reckless fucking 200lbs water skipper.
I thought the skier hate was a joke. This is just idiot hate.
It was two posts after this one in my feed this morning in r/skiingcirclejerk
I'm a skier, never been on a board, the skier in this video is fucking blind or riding with his eyes closed, I don't know what is going on in his mind, he should have been totally aware of OP here... I hope he doesn't drive.
As a skier, it is definitely the skier's fault, 99%. (Snowboarders at fault 1% for being on the same mountain as that idiot üòÇ) The snowboarder wasn't exactly predictable, but the skier knew he was there (or should have) for quite a while, and should have given enough room to avoid the snowboarder regardless of what the boarder did. 
With that said, being predictable will help lessen your chance of getting run over by someone regardless of whoever is at fault, and unfortunately we can't stop the moron's from strapping on planks, so all we can do is try and minimize their stupidity.
If so that was a bad mistake because that leg was bendy boi and not in the right ways at all
I think the skier was simply trying to stop a crime in action
Doesn't look like a bad skiier, either... Before the incident, of course.
holy fuck I played that back by frames and youre right ugghhhh fuck
That is his knee. It's just perspective. Look at his hips rotation.
If you broke your upper leg from colliding with another movable softbody your bones would either have to be made of cardboard or be 90 years old.

Favorite comment
Yep, absolutely sue
The suing culture in America is insane. Skiing and snowboard are high risk sports - you accept that every time you go on a mountain. 

Fuck knows that his guy was thinking but he wasn't trying to break his leg and OP's collarbone.
Ah, land of the suing.
An attorney?? Bro you‚Äôre the problem with this world lol. Sure get pissed, but call an attorney cause someone ran into you while fucking snowboarding? You‚Äôre an asshat
Yeah, I don't get drinking during the day.  It will just make you a sloppy rider or skier.
I really don't understand drinking alcohol is allowed in the ski resorts.

We're doing activities which can easily surpass the speed limit of vehicle in matter of seconds. Like I don't want to share a road with drunken drivers, I don't want to share a slope with drunken skiers/snowboarders either.
It looked like it completely crumpled
Wdym skiers like they're the only ones doing that?

What the fuck is going on in this sub? Separating skiers and snowboarders in two distinct categories like they don't both have an equal amount of good people and shitwads?
As a skier, it‚Äôs all the same man. Same amount of dicks in each category. Only difference is the nature of them. I find skiing douches to more often be mad, overprotective dads who fail to realize that they are actually the ones endangering people on the mountain, and people who want to slalom carve every run edge to edge at slow speed, making it harder for people to avoid them and get good runs. Whereas snowboarding douches are usually people who think they are gods gift and try to do a 180 or a 3 off of every little piece of vertical terrain in the worst areas possible, like cat tracks. I have done a small manual/wheelie thing to purposefully run over people who did this before on cat tracks after they fell in front of a massive group causing chaos
That‚Äôs when I wait and fly by them
I know, right? Both have lots of dicks. I will say tho that a lot of the time, the two groups are being dicks for completely different reasons tho
Honestly, this wasn‚Äôt the work of ‚Äúskiers.‚Äù This was the work of one idiot ‚Äúskier.‚Äù
I think it‚Äôs an optical illusion. The snowboarder is the one who cuts across the run. 

Watch the shadows. The skier is consistently skiing at the top of the tree shadows. Snowboarder is about 30 feet away and decides to cut to his blindside and stop. Collision happens at the tips of the shadows, right where the skier was consistently.
man, you sound like a cool guy.. 

the mountain is suppossed to be fun, and glad you could make the best of it.
[deleted]
Especially assuming what OP said is true in the comments and they actually tried to blame it on OP at first. 

If aggressively suing for the money isn‚Äôt enough, then do it for everyone else and go after this tool so he never puts anyone else in danger again. Make skiing too expensive for this idiot.
The gravitational pull of a snowboard grinding to a stop was so strong it literally pulled the skier directly into the snowboarder. There was nothing that could be done.

Yes but the femur is clearly the winner for worst injury. Clavicle fracture doesn't impact lifespan. Femur fracture does, and quite significantly if that skier is of a certain age.
Bruh, there are dicks on all sides. Skiing tends to get the attention of the more elite/snobby crowd, so you will have a lot of dumb overprotective parents and snobs and people who think it‚Äôs cool to carve edge to edge on a packed groomer. Snowboarding tends to get the attention of the more rebel/youthful crowd, so you get the young dumb type doing more young dumb stuff, and people trying to impressive everyone around with small jumps in bad areas to do so that causes wrecks and chaos. Then both groups have the reckless, out of control speeders that can‚Äôt avoid other riders. I‚Äôm a skier btw
[deleted]
He was definitely in his 60s, I‚Äôm worried about his recovery more than me. A femur at his age is no joke
That‚Äôs wild, small world
Honestly wtf am I missing here. Dude literally stops in the middle of the slope
Angling toward the middle of the trail to do a hard splash stop halfway down for a selfie certainly wasn't the safest choice to begin with.
No because he should be allowed to slow down as needs, this isn't the sport of just straight lining down a hill. This is the sport of going as fast as you are comfortable with and staying in control. You cannot get angry at people stopping so that they can remain in control.
You are also looking at the EDITED version of the ‚Äòvictims‚Äô video.¬†

He sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to make himself look bad before he posts it on Reddit for sympathy points.¬†
Because a skier slammed into him.¬†
Guys.. what are we doing. lmao this is snowsport-ism, who tf cares whether you ski or snowboard, it really doesn't matter. There's no need to group all skiers or snowboarders into one group of "annoying people doing this or that."
I got the camera to show my mom clips of me snowboarding, i was on a groomer so I could get used to it
The idea to sue is not because he wants money, it's to recover medical expenses and lost wages just like you would in a car accident.
üö®TOUGH GUY ALERTüö®
>video of the skier being cut off

lol which video are you watching??  Snowboarder was going about as straight as I've ever seen a boarder go.  Skier was weaving back and forth on a track like 50' wide.

Downhill traffic has the right of way.  Skier looked like a missile that suddenly acquired a missile lock and veered way out of the lane he'd been in to hit him.
it doesn't matter why someone stops on the slope. the person uphill _always_ has to give way to those below.
that's not how it works. if you're uphill then you give way.
People constantly stop in the middle of runs and are allowed to.
You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about if you see this as 50/50 lol
Are you like, stupid? The snowboarder in this clip is further down on the slope meaning he has the right of way. The skier began a wide turn and had BEYOND ample time to see AND react to avoid hitting him. In fact it‚Äôs the GoPro which is responsible for clearly providing concrete evidence that the skier is 100% at fault.
I kinda agree that they‚Äôre both idiots. OP even says in a comment here that he had no idea the skier was there, despite the skier being downhill from him at points of this video (being in a blind spot isn‚Äôt an excuse for not seeing someone who is downhill from you, you should be looking around at all times). 

With that said, this is still 100% the skiers fault. It looks like the skier had a bit of target fixation or was just in his own world paying no attention. I really can‚Äôt figure out why he skis straight into him without attempting to turn or stop or anything.
FYI The downvotes mean you‚Äôre right.
finally a voice of reason. nobody talks about the snowboarder acting like an idiot, doing what looked like a hard left turn, then stopping almost in the middle for no reason whatsoever.
I agree with the first part but that dude was not right next to him cmon. He took a line so absurd it looked like he was trying to do run directly into the person with the right of way.
[deleted]
Congratulations on the dumbest take on Reddit today.
Man, it‚Äôs gotta be so hard being you and wrong all the time. You could watch the other video and still see you‚Äôre massively wrong. But you probably just tube at the resort.
I disagree. it‚Äôs not my job to see everyone on the mountain, it‚Äôs my job to see the people alongside and below me. And if he did his job he would‚Äôve distanced himself instead of staying completely in my blind spot
I don‚Äôt know what part of that is mental gymnastics
I wish I could share the full unedited 360¬∞ for you, what you‚Äôre saying makes sense. But you don‚Äôt have the full picture, he has about twice the distance on his left than I do on my right. Him being as close as he was in my blind spot when he had a ton of room is wild. It looks like I came to a stop but I cut from 38ish mph to 12-15, on my side
100%
Collarbone is extremely painful though
I didn‚Äôt mean my comment to come across as unsympathetic. Broken collarbone sucks.
collarbone is made for breaking :D
Worked as an EMT in college.  Femur breaks were fucking traumatizing.  You see a lot of shit in EMS but that level of pain always made me nauseous.
I broke my femur skating with a wheel in my pocket. My dad had to throw me on his shoulder in order to get to the car with my broken leg dangling . I wanted to off myself as an 8 year old right then and there
I‚Äôve done both, woohoo!  Getting dressed sucked with the collarbone, and any movement that first week hurt pretty bad, but if you just hold your arm mostly still it‚Äôs fine.  I dropped a pencil like 3 days in and went for it with the wrong arm- shooting pain, but that also means it wasn‚Äôt hurting at all just resting on the desk, my mind was totally off it.

The leg- bit misleading, I only cracked it really.  I had a nonossifying fibroma, a big spongy part in my bone, and one day when I was running I felt something pop.  I cried, which isn‚Äôt cool in 6th grade, limped to the nurse, then couldn‚Äôt even put weight on it when I got to the doctor‚Äôs.  Had to use my 5 foot tall mom as a crutch, good times (thanks mom!).  I got incredibly lucky, I basically had a cm of good bone on the other side and nothing else, otherwise my femur mighta collapsed a solid inch right above the growth plate in my knee.  Anyways, I got cadaver bone inserted, a metal plate, a cast that went around my waist so I had to bathroom in a bedpan, physical therapy, a second surgery to remove the plate, more therapy, boom good as new, kinda.  I think I went through 1/5th the pain a full break would be, and would rather break my collarbone once a month than break my femur ever.  Just the physical therapy alone was worse than anything with the collarbone.

Anyways OP, hope you and powderhead over there heal up alright!
Having broken both, can confirm. Would rather do my collarbone twice instead of femur again
It should be. Tf was he doing
Dude I was just explaining that the other day to someone. Don‚Äôt stare at the thing you‚Äôre trying to avoid lol
100%. 15 years or so ago I took the AiARE course. During our backcountry day I went right into a tree. Guide explained to never look at the tree b/c that's where you'll go.   
One giant thigh hematoma and a solid life lesson later...
Skiers fault, not his.
injury lawyers gonna be in his DM's lol
Because the skier was 100% trying to buzz the snowboarder but wound up being a raging Jerry and couldn‚Äôt control his distance well enough
I think its the slow motion. This whole encounter from skier identifying snowboard in his path to crash is <1s.

You can see the skier stop his right turn as the snowboarder appears to be stopping in a straight line (on heels). Skier makes decision to go in front of snowboarder.

Then the snowboarder lets off brake and does a falling leaf motion to left. You can see the skier hesitate and then its too late and the crash has happened.

Ill get roasted because this is r/snowboarding ‚Ä¶ but the snowboarder was moving pretty erratically and unpredictably. I can see how it was difficult for the skier to make the right decision. 

That doesn‚Äôt absolve him of fault, but the snowboarder wasn‚Äôt doing himself any favors in the situation and can adjust his behavior to possibly avoid this in the future.
What? How?
>broke his femur

The price was paid at least
I mean. I REALLY doubt people are out there like oh boy if I see someone snowboarding near me I‚Äôm going to throw my body into there‚Äôs while going a high speed. That being said. If you don‚Äôt feel like you can stop in time WITH THAT MUCH FUCKING SPACE you need to seriously slow down or give yourself (and I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this) more space than that. If he did go man fuck this boarder I‚Äôm going to hit him. Jokes on him. His season is completely toast. He might not ski the same ever again. OP miiiiiight be able to squeeze some beach days in end of season. Broken collar bone is about a month to heal. Femur? Lol. Forget about walking without crutches for a month
A graduate of the Gwenyth Paltrow Academy of Skiing no doubt
cuts across the *entire* slope (and its a pretty wide one) to annihilate OP from behind
Imagine skiers were taught to look somewhere other than straight ahead. 

All the while I teach snowboarders to look uphill regularly, and before making weird turns. But WE have the blindspots....::rolls eyes::
As a skier, wtf is this! I‚Äôve had this happen to me. Same dude did it twice to me. Wasn‚Äôt a full wipe out like this but the second time I was beyond irate. Again, as a skier, I do not understand how the fuck they manage this. I‚Äôm not even a great skier, but it‚Äôs so much safer to just bail and fall back than to run into someone. Like a straight hit like this is definitely a choice and definitely battery
Trollllllll, or you have never been on a hill before, because your comment is complete nonsense. The skier can clearly see the snowboarder, and didn‚Äôt yield the RoW, the snowboarder did nothing wrong in this situation.
There are no lanes on the mountain. Skier came from behind, and if he can't avoid someone who stops in front of him with like 2 seconds of warning he shouldn't be off the kiddie slopes yet. 100% skiers fault.
What does buzz mean in this context? I‚Äôve seen a few people in this thread use that lingo.
I mainly ski now and this is my least favorite thing in the world. There needs to be some rule that gives snowboarders right of way in cat tracks and flats
I've gotten hit/cut off by skiers a good few times doing exactly this, and I don't even go up that often
Thank you. Skiers constantly cut me off in the cat tracks.
ran into two huge douchbags at vail last week. some people think if you haven't been skiing for 30 years and a pro you should just get off the mountain lol
Can we not with the tribalism shit lol

I‚Äôve been riding for over 20 years and there are just as many douchebag snowboarders as there are skiers.
Yeah the more I watch it, the more it looks like 1. The skier did it on purpose, or 2. The skier is well beyond legally blind
This video makes no sense. 

At the start of the video it looks like the skier is far enough uphill that he would have a sense of where the snowboarder is. Why does the snowboarder randomly stop in this cruiser? And after the snowboarder starts to stop the skier locks onto him like a homing missile. Skier seems to be clearly looking right at him but makes absolutely no attempt to stop even at the last second.
What the hell would be kicking up snow though? Doesn't make sense to head straight for the snow to investigate.
I mean I could understand this as a pure accident due to the unpredictable snowboarders cut to the left, but the skier didn‚Äôt even even attempt to hit the breaks.  His skis were pointed straight downhill through the whole collision. 

It only takes a fraction of a second to switch to a hockey stop. And the guy had fair warning in the form of getting sprayed by the boarder that he should hit the brakes.
Skier/snowboarder here. No fucking shit the skier is at fault üòÇ
It‚Äôs pretty real to some people, but I do see it as jokes as well. I don‚Äôt get the inherent hate. I ride with skiers and borders, I used to ski, crashes are usually skill and awareness issues, not what you ride on.
It also did hit Skiing now lol
That is a definite disadvantage to skiing
Left leg is toast
A lot more going on than a simple collision here‚Ä¶ Skier broke his femur when his ski under the board and his leg twisted. The torsion is what contributed more to the fracture, not the impact.


There are ~90 year olds on the hill shredding, had an 87 year old break 5 ribs and a humerus last week going off the top of a mogul.
OP said that the skiier broke his femur
[deleted]
You‚Äôre right. Ever single skier ever has done this exact thing and not a single person on a snowboard has ever done anything like this.
He wouldn‚Äôt be suing to punish the guy smh. He would be suing to cover medical costs bc this idiot skier should be paying the entire bill.
You've never heard of negligence?
"sorry officer, I didn't *mean* to hit that guy with my car. Driving is inherently a risky activity. He should accept that responsibility anytime he goes outside"
The suing culture is stupid, but you don't accept idiots in the mountain anymore than you accept them on the road. This is the equivalent of rear ending someone without touching the breakes. It's not a risk you should have to live with.
I have a $7k deductible. I would absolutely sue
Yeah there‚Äôs no way you could sue anyone for this
You're really stupid.
It‚Äôs no different than being injured in a car accident due to someone else‚Äôs reckless or negligent driving. Medical bills add up quick. 

In this case I didn‚Äôt realize the end of the video was in slow motion so it looked a lot more reckless than it probably was. 

Tough to make such a general statement though... Imagine if you are stationary at the bottom of the slope on your board/skis and someone plows into you breaking your back. You are telling me you would not peruse some sort of legal advice? It‚Äôs your choice, but you don‚Äôt get to decide for everyone else what they choose to do.
I get that thought process but the one lunch beer always slaps.  A great brown ale or stout/porter is just perfect.
It's a lot like driving TBH. I am totally in control with having 2 or 3, don't feel my riding suffer at all I'd even day it improves in some ways with confidence.


But like 5+? You're asking for trouble you're drunk.
As a beginner a couple of fireball pocket shots helps the nerves. Shits scary when ur starting off.
Exactly! I‚Äôve never compared it directly but I agree completely! You can get going super fast and easily hurt or even kill someone.
Money.
Fun police
That‚Äôs just when they mix it up and cut back in the middle of the trail lol
That's when they unpredictably hard-swerve into you
I disagree. the boarder floats skiers right before hitting the brakes. you can see he actually stays on the skiers right tree line and the skiers cuts that way as the run opens up.
The fact that you have such a clear video of the incident is kind of a free golden ticket. Personal injury lawyers would salivate over it, easy slam dunk case.
Hire a ski injury lawyer my guy. Easy case he should at the very least be paying your medical bills. I‚Äôd personally want some pain and suffering cash for such a reckless crash.
Yes. Speak with a lawyer.
Oh you forgot the juicy stuff, this upgrades the guy from a moron to, should never go on a mountain again‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs the one crossing the whole trail, he‚Äôs the one behind, I‚Äôd love for him to see the footage some day.
GL with collar bone recovery my dude, I've heard that sucks. Not more then a femur tho...... Also you've got pretty clear evidence on cam in case there's an attempt to come at you. Dude's body language looks like he's completely obviously you were in his new line.

&#x200B;

Plus the wild part is y'all had a wiiiiiild open run to just yourselves.
[deleted]
I hope you have a way to get him that video he needs to see how much of an ass he was
Work on your technique and you'll feel comfortable enough to still look around while going 40. Looks like you should work on bending your knees more and carving your turns instead of sluffing them. Being low and on edge is far more stable.
I‚Äôd delete these couple of comments if you are planning on contacting a lawyer‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs like you read over the it where I said he‚Äôs not at fault but he is inviting trouble.

Yes, you are supposed to be in control of yourself at all times and be wary of the other people on the hill.
No, not everyone on the hill is going to be competent or in control of themselves at all times and wary of the other people on the hill.
That makes OP a moron who‚Äôs inviting trouble, just like drivers who follow the rules and then complain they get in collisions often that aren‚Äôt their fault. It‚Äôs not about doing what‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs about doing the smart thing to minimize potential collisions.

He could have done a bunch more to avoid a potential collision. Like literally just slowing down a little more before coming to a compete stop so that homeboy is in front of him makes this not happen. Not at fault, still not smart
Whether it's a skier or a snowboarder, people lazily meandering at high speed like that skier are a major hazard to be avoided.  It's fucking stupid to put yourself at risk by staying in their vicinity for more than a few seconds.  Someone like this skier needs to be much further in the rear-view mirror before making a quick stop like the snowboarder, and splitting focus/balance with a selfie-stick makes an unplanned stop all the more likely.
Situational awareness is still a thing.  Skier is at fault but it is pretty stupid to stop on a heelside turn towards the middle when you are going fast with somebody neck and neck with you.  Either stop on your toeside towards the edge or slow down and let them pass and then stop.  If he had no idea the skier was there then he has a massive blind spot
I know. Snowboarders hate the fact that the world exists on both sides of them.
That makes it okay to randomly cut in front of someone?
I‚Äôve seen too many people totally oblivious to their surroundings while using a selfie stick, it‚Äôs ridiculous.

Congratulations, I‚Äôm guessing you are 19.
You are like 90% not at fault but he he‚Äôs right. That attitude there will get you hurt again.
Unfortunately you have to be defensive, and anticipate other people‚Äôs incompetence.

Thats a rule for skiing/snowboarding and driving. Ok. You do everything you are supposed to do, but get hurt still because an idiot. Much better to accept the fact there are idiots out there, beginners out of control etc and be proactive about protecting yourself from them, rather than just doing your basic responsibilities. Because not everyone will do their basic responsibilities, and you‚Äôll eventually get hurt by one.

So it means you definitely over compensate. You don‚Äôt stop suddenly, or suddenly change direction when slowing down(because as in the vid, it will confuse an out of control idiot), without checking your sides even if its on the edge of a slope just because you are downhill with right of way, because some idiot like that skier can be there.

I know its a bit above the call of duty, but that is what it actually takes to stay injury free snowboarding and skiing. That is something most people learn the more they get experienced. 

I hope you both recover, and you can learn from this that there are idiots out there and you need to put anticipation into your practices.
it your job to board/ski in a PREDICTABLE manner.

faking a hard turn then stopping towards the center of the piste, at high speed, for 0 reason, is a very stupid thing to do.

  
you should get sued and pay for damages for reckless boarding/stopping
wait wait, this is you?!!?! lmao, you caused this. stopping in the middle of nowhere so abruptly for 0 reason. this is the equivalent of just slamming the breaks randomly on the highway.

not only did you stop, you swung outward in front of the dude. if you didn't snowboard like an asshole, this wouldn't have happened. here is a thought, stop when you get to the bottom of the run, or to the side if you really need to....no way you needed to here and probably just wanted to check on your video...which makes you even more of an asshole.
That‚Äôs still a huge slow down. The more important point is that you shot across the run - towards your blindside without looking over your shoulder - before dramatically slowing down. 

He definitely takes the majority of the blame, but you share a lot of the fault here. You essentially caused this collision.
Genuinely nothing compared to a femur. When people break femurs they scream uncontrollably until the painkillers kick in
And a broken femur is 100x worse lmao
I‚Äôd rather break my collar bone 10x over than do my femur once. Your femur is going to be the most painful bone to break and the absolute worst recovery.
Femur and pelvis are the two single most painful and live threatening things to break fyi. I wish my collarbone broke when I separated the sternum side. Turns out that‚Äôs one of the harder parts of the shoulder to fix‚Ä¶
Not always, and nothing compared to a femur break. I broke my collarbone in a soccer game and there was almost no pain. I could still do most things normally, just had to keep my arm in a sling for a few weeks.
When I was younger I broke my collarbone on the mountain. Cracked it when I took a fall on some ice and road the rest of the way down in pain. As I was taking my arm out of my jacket it I completely snapped it. My dad drove me down the mountain to the hospital and by the time we got there, I couldn‚Äôt even stand up I was in so much pain.
Yeah during a driving coarse they said that target fixation is what causes so many accidents because people are looking at what they are trying to avoid. Or they look left turn left. 

The instructor also said it‚Äôs why drunk drivers bounce from line to line because they are fixating on trying not to cross that line get really close then fixate on the other one instead of looking ahead. He talked like he had experience with it.
That's why in MTB-ing, I learned to look around an object such as my line (the trail)  instead of an object  (such as a tree or rock).

&#x200B;

It does take a lot of repetition to teach yourself to no fixate on something as a split-second decision. Once you've identified a hazard, you want to instantly look around for a safe line and focus your vision on that.
My golf putting would suggest otherwise
I saw a dude go off the road at Sturgis this year right in front of me cause of this.
I think the person you responded to was making a joke
I agree with this. Seems like a pissy douche bag mad at the snowboarder spraying while they‚Äôre carving
Buzzing is retarded and buzzing heel side is about as dumb as you can get!
You have no idea how many times I dealt with this situation as a teenager snowboarding in Tahoe.

Thank goodness I was always able to dodge or bail out, but you have no idea how many times I'd be in front and have the RoW and some Jerry skier would wanna show off and I'd have to bail out to avoid a collision.

Then I'm in the snow and jerryboi is yelling some shit at me from down the slope about how I need to be more careful.

The only time it never happened was the one or two times I was wearing my jersey for the mountain.
Buzz how?
I‚Äôll say. The femur the strongest bone in the body. It‚Äôs going to be a really long road to recovery for him. At a bare minimum it‚Äôs 12 months before they ski again and even then it‚Äôs probably gonna sting like a bitch or have some PTSD and have to walk it down on the first run. I know ppl who have walked down for less.
The skier thought, I‚Äôll ski really close to this guy to show off, forgot he actually sucks and crashed into him.
Huh, Gwyneth was as much in her right as OP was. It's a stupid take.

Edit: a word.
No Doubt was Gwen Stefani not Paltrow‚Ä¶

(Bad joke)
Like a missile.
>definitely battery

Somebody that actually knows the difference between assault and battery. I would gold this comment if it still existed.
I just shoot the gap and announce "on your left"
I recently picked up skiing too for backcountry, my history with boarding has made me a lot more aware of how I'm interacting with others.
You‚Äôre right, but let the people have their moment.
I feel like they are two different beasts. I'm a snowboarder and the inconsiderate boarders are usually just cutting it close to me but seems like mostly doing it on purpose. Skiiers tend to be the ones who are cutting back and forth across the slopes like this and that causes different issues.

It makes sense that a video of a skiier hitting a snowboarder is going to bring out hate for that.
It almost looks like the skier looks at something to his right around the 12 second mark and doesn‚Äôt bring his eyes back to the slope until it‚Äôs too late‚Ä¶ I see his head move back to the center before impact. 

Could easily be wrong though.
It‚Äôs so bad it looks faked
3 it was staged.
>Why does the snowboarder randomly stop in this cruiser?

Could be waiting for friends. Could be avoiding someone in front of him. Could be getting a phone call or taking a shit. Most likely, he's committing some crimes.
The skier was on his side, not directly uphill of him. and he is not in the middle of the run, although he could have gone further to the side. The skier is the baffling one
He has gone 30 seconds without sitting on his ass in the middle of a trail.
What‚Äôs sad is snowboarder community thinks skiers never take blame just cause‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre fellow skiers (see original comment‚Äôs edit). No one cares, it‚Äôs easy to determine fault here.
Non-skier/snowboarder here. Idk how this came into my feed. Skier is at fault.
Chill. They were literally asked how this video would go down in a skiing sub
Agree - I‚Äôve been snowboarding for 30 years or so. It bugs me when people try to hate on people for what they are riding down the hill on. We‚Äôre all just trying to enjoy ourselves - idiot‚Äôs exist everywhere and can choose to strap either on their feet, just like we can‚Ä¶.
As a snow eater who plays for both teams, that guy is a moron
Ski vs. Snowboard rivalry is as stupid as Xbox vs. PlayStation. Such a trivial thing to generalize people for.
[deleted]
Dude he was making a joke because guy wrote "skies" instead of "skis".  You're the moron here.

Edit: hahaha downvoted then deleted their comment - what a wimp
Judging by his comment, I don‚Äôt think the commenter is American. So likely has never paid a medical bill.
Suing culture seems bad until you realize that the cost of healthcare following a femur fracture can run up to $50K when you include surgery and PT, and the average life savings of a 30 year old is $11.5K. Sad reality is that the American Healthcare System is more often to blame than the suers greed. I‚Äôd rather sue than go homeless.
? Literally send this video to an injury lawyer/health insurance company and you're not paying a cent
You are very wrong about this lmao
Why imagine that when that‚Äôs not what happened? What does your random made up scenario have anything to do with this video
I completely agree.  But I see people riding around with backpacks full of beers and pounding fireball. It's nuts.
I usually have a single beer if I‚Äôm with my boys. Depends on the conditions and the vibes.
:( good lord i hope not, crashing on the mountain makes me anxious which makes me vigilant
There are lawyers specializes, not just in personal injury, but also ski injuries?
Copy, thanks for the advice. I think I was more comfortable on the other board, it was a stiff full camber and it dug in and stuck pretty well. The burton I just got didn‚Äôt have as sharp as an edge and I just wasn‚Äôt as used to it. A couple people have said to bend my knees more so I‚Äôll definitely think about that every time now lol
You can see from the video he does not actually stop he is shedding speed on a heel side, it takes a bit of experience to be able to look around while snowboarding. The skier downhill is never expected to look uphill unless they wanna cross the entire run. That's because to look uphill you have to take attention from Infront of you. It's like driving a car, the person behind you is responsible for having a good enough following distance so that of you were to suddenly need to stop or slow down they would not strike you from behind. I saw you said it's not his fault but it's also silly to believe he could have avoided this.
He didn‚Äôt do that, though
Ha. God I wish I was 19. More so, my body wishes it was 19.   
No matter my age, I've been riding (and skiing) long enough to know that downhill always has the right of way.  
This rider was pulling even further towards skier's right before he hit the brakes - you can see the trees get closer to him at the end.   
And anyone with a bit of sense would know that he's allowed to slow down whenever he feels the need.   
The skier actively cut to his right to get near that boarder.   
There were two people on this run and the skier figures out a way to run right over OP.   


Although, as someone whose body isn't 19 ;) , I would be fine with cameras being banned - Ride for the moments not for the gram.
[deleted]
OP is like 90% at fault. Swap that number around. He stops randomly and swings outwards without any inclination of what could be behind him. That's simply dumb, people are moving at high speeds, you can just stop and swing your board around and "hope for the best."

100% OP just wants to check on the video or something dumb, because there is literally no reason to stop at this part of the mountain.
Lmao, you‚Äôre ignorant. I didn‚Äôt stop I slowed down to like 10mph and then tried to continue at a slower speed. I stayed in my lane, he shouldn‚Äôt have stayed that close to me at all. And he had time to react when he decided to come to my side and he didn‚Äôt. Check the full 360 video I posted
Go review the responsibility code for the mountain before you ever go out again if this is your ignorant opinion. You must be one of those entitled skiers that thinks they have the right of way even when the other person is downhill. Downhill rider has right of way. You're really trying to argue you shouldnt ever stop mid run? You're an absolute clown¬†
Dear God I hope you don‚Äôt ski with kids!
Ummm, since when is a blind spot directly in front of you. The skier hit him square in the back, not from the side.¬†
Can also kill you with a bone marrow embolism, which I've been terrified of since reading that summer reading book a separate peace.
I've broken both. The immediate pain from femur is incomparable. The daily struggle of common daily activities during recovery is nothing compared to collar bone.

Don't break bones. Give way to leads on slopes. Eat your veggies or something.
It took my cousin about a year from breaking his femur until he felt confident on it to try to ski again.  He took it super careful for 2 seasons after that, mostly do to mental issues of pushing it again after snapping his femur completely through (xray is gnarly).
Femurs are bad for a lot of reasons, one of them being that it's one of the strongest bones in your body.  So the force which it took to break it most likely caused trauma to lots of other places as well.  That and that pesky femoral artery is sorta important.
Broke my pelvis in the side country a year and a half in a wheelchair then a year and a half on crouches, almost 4 years before I could walk again. Still able to snowboard.... I was riding above my skill level, when it happened
I haven‚Äôt broken either my femur or my pelvis, so I can‚Äôt say how painful they are, but I have broken ribs and can say that that is the single worst thing I‚Äôve done in my life.
Not as bad as a broken heart. That‚Äôs the worst pain. And anal warts.
Collarbones are built to be broken‚Ä¶and they heal like it. When my kid broke his collarbone (dislocated fracture), I asked the doc about surgery. His exact words were, ‚ÄúWith kids this age (he was 9 at the time) I could throw one half of their collarbone in that corner of my office and one half in the opposite corner. In 10 weeks they‚Äôd have grown back together.‚Äù Then I proceeded to watch that happen over the next 10 weeks worth of X-rays. Pretty cool.
Broke my collarbone MTBing over ten years ago, and my femur two years ago. Nurse described the break like a baseball bat hitting the ball which was exactly what I heard when it broke.
Missed all of last season, just now getting back snowboarding & femur still hurts. I am back to beginner status. I am also 70 yrs old.
It depends on which part of the collarbone is broken. Mid shaft fractures are most common and if they‚Äôre not displaced, typically you‚Äôll just need a sling. But proximal and distal clavicular fractures can cause some vascular issues and will earn you some OR time. Am a hospitalist, not ortho, but I take care of a lot of these patients post-op. Overall, people keep saying tib-fib breaks are the worst but those are typically young healthy guys. I‚Äôd take them any day over an osteoporotic 80 yo lady who fell and had a hip and pelvic fracture. Now you‚Äôre also dealing with their BP, A-fib, COPD on top of fractures, and a family that wants heroic measures for meemaw when she eventually dies. Give me the snowboarder patient any day of the week.
If you broke your femur, you most likely would have passed out with how you responded to a collarbone. Femur is so much worse
 There‚Äôs also a tendency for drunk drivers to crash into police cars that are pulled over with their lights on for the same reason.
Ate shit twice on a road bike from this very thing. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hit the hole, don‚Äôt hit the hole.‚Äù  Hit the hole.
lol self-burn...respect
Ya target fixation is a big lesson with motorcyclists. Or at least the ones that care enough to be aware of it
Apparently I was just too tired earlier cause when I first read that I just saw blind spot and thought he was talking about the snowboarder letting the skier hang out in his blind spot  


Obviously the crash was the skiers fault, but what I meant by that was that it was the skiers fault that he was in the snowboarders blind spot  


Either way I just can't read
You already know. I swear to god, some of the pretentious people in the world are skiers at Tahoe. Kinda dudes that are having the competition of their lifetime with some snowboarder that doesn‚Äôt even know they exist. So much to prove to nobody that cares‚Ä¶

Cant wait to get back up there next week
Like get dangerously close to the snowboarder to assert slope dominance. You‚Äôve never been buzzed?
I broke my ankle bombing a hill on a longboard and its definitely in the back of my mind every time I think about getting back on (I haven‚Äôt fully finished rehab) but my heart says do it anyway.
No only is he an idiot but he has a weak ass femur
Same. Every time.
We need horns or bells like on a bicycle or motorcycle!
Yea same. Knowing the pain that is speed checking on a soon to be flat because of a Jerry skier really makes you think while skiing
I see what you mean. When you go frame by frame I noticed that too. However, I can see enough of his orange goggles that I'm not entirely convinced, but it could be a possibility that the skier looked into the trees for whatever reason.
Yes, he was clearly looking at something over his right shoulder and could not see that OP had suddenly stopped until it was too late.  Skier is clearly at fault, but people need to put their knives away... this didn't happen because he's a skier, or an idiot, or an asshole, or blind.  It was an accident that happened because he dropped his vigilance for a couple seconds... something everyone does at some point even if we won't admit it.  Sucks that it resulted in serious injuries... hope OP recovers quick.

...or maybe it was really just a failed assassination
He also didn't brace for impact at all
Naw he could of stopped.
That‚Äôs a lot of pain to put yourself through for three seconds of not even fame lol, I can‚Äôt fathom why somebody would do that. Occam‚Äôs razor tells me the skier is just dumb
Crimes kinda go without saying‚Ä¶
Dude was so eager to be triggered he totally missed the joke
To demonstrate that it is not black and white. Simply talking to an attorney about recouping medical expenses acquired by someone else‚Äôs recklessness is not against the law.  Pretty standard and straight forward honestly speaking. Although this post seems like simply an unfortunate accident after taking a closer look and realizing the end of the video is in slow motion.  

Same goes for the person whose fault it is. It would be wise to look into protecting yourself.   It goes both ways. 

If you disagree with that I couldn‚Äôt care LESS because I don‚Äôt give a shit what people who stoop to your level of communication think.

Have a nice day.
Seriously. If you can get a DUI on a bicycle, same should go when on the slopes.
Yeah I‚Äôll have a few drinks throughout the day but they‚Äôre always spread out every hour or more. With the amount I sweat and the physicality of riding I usually just rip a shot or two to warm up and don‚Äôt feel it
Really? A sudden hellside speed check into someone's line doesn't count as cutting them off? Judging distance, I'd be surprised if the skier is much more than twenty feet, maybe twenty five, behind when the boarder hits the breaks, right in the skier's path.


Could the skier have avoided? Probably. But it wouldn't be necessary if the boarder wasn't a dumbass. Like if you're driving, change lanes without signaling and slow down. Yes, the person behind should be able to stop, but it's a risky move.¬†



¬†I hope no one does the same to you.¬†
Dear God I hope you don't stop in the middle of nowhere  for no reason.

One of the first things you teach kids is to stop on the sides of the mountain. Because you know, it's dangerous to just stop in the middle of the mountain.  Or are you telling me you just stop wherever you feel like with no thought?

If you are honestly saying you've never deliberately stopped on the side of the path to avoid accidents then we have other issues. But if you can that you have, then I'm right and you are wrong.
My friend's sister died of that (after she broke her foot hiking); left behind two young children. Doc knew she had a clotting disorder that predisposed her to it but didn't give her blood-thinners, just to make it even sadder.
Or just cause you to bleed out from severing your femoral artery
Sweet new fear unlocked.
Man, I was about to say that's catcher in the rye. Only to look up separate peace and realize my memory has combined different parts of that book into catcher in the rye.

We must've read them the same summer. The coming of age summer.
I loved that gay ass book
I hated that book so much.  I would have jounced the limb for all of those guys.
Duuuuude I remember that book! Could never remember the name of it but had some type of feeling association with it. Thank you for the reminder üôèüèº
I've literally think back to that book at random times since I read it in school 20 years ago. Up to this moment, I could never remember the name of it. Thank you, and kindly fuck off for reminding me of it again lol.
thanks for unlocking that terrible memory!!
omfg that book! i also had it assigned in high school. Grade 7 or maybe 8 i think? and yeah, i think it was assigned as summer reading too, dammit you didn't by chance go to high school in mtl canada did you? haha. haven't heard anyone else mention that book in yrs. 

marked me too, but more for the guilt etc, also I was/am really into stories with a major trauma etc. Didn't remember that was the injury cause tho, just recall the treefall, it's sorta the narrator's fault who's ¬†plagued with guilt and i guess how i remember it (wrongly? will go look it up now heh), is it was ¬†paralysis due to a spinal cord injury?
Hey. I know that from House
Glad you‚Äôre still mobile, scary how quick we can get in over our heads.
Ribs are that constant pain, id put them at a 9/10 personally but that‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt busted my hip or leg.
I've broken both collarbones 5 times total. (Sister pushed me down the stairs, football, snowboarding x2, getting beat with a cane by a cocaine riddled tweaker).  And of course it fucking hurt, it hurts pretty bad.  However, not nearly the most painful thing ive ever experienced.  That being said, given the choice, I'd rather break my collarbone 5 more times than my femur once.
Like moths to a flame
What seems to be the officer problem?
same with woman...   

dont date her, shes crazy

dont date her, shes crazy..


then before you know it, your getting yelled at for who knows why..
Ate absolutely shit when I was like 12 on a mountain bike in the Ozarks when I did that. Went ass over head and half scorpioned.
In my first year of riding I target fixated myself right into the bumper of an abruptly stopped car that I should have easily swerved around. 

Lesson learned. Look for the solution, not at the problem.
It was a joke about skiers not looking where they‚Äôre going. 

It‚Äôs ok. I hope you get to have a rest.
It‚Äôs all good lol, happens to me all the time, just didn‚Äôt want you to catch strays over it
I like to do a 180 and ride switch when this happens. Usually freaks them out.
It's been almost 5 years since I fish tailed on a bicycle and broke my wrist. Still haven't had the courage to go down a steep hill on my bike.
Had an ankle and a finger injury bouldering, still cautious whenever I go climbing.
I have a client who was working as a ski instructor when she got wiped by a kid playing tag. Left hip replacement, right foot reconstruction, and 22 months later‚Ä¶ she is back working as an instructor. Don‚Äôt let it keep you down homie.
Hope he recovers quick as well
Look how close the boarder is to the trees when he gets it. 

**It‚Äôs exactly as close as he is at the beginning of the clip, and pretty much the entire time in between.**

The boarder didn‚Äôt go into the skier‚Äôs line at all here.
Of course I only stop on the side, not on the corners, not under the brow of a hill, and not where everyone else is congregating.
This geezer wasn‚Äôt stationary also.
Sounds like a different kind of embolism from a deep vein thrombosis but yeah being immobile can predispose to those as well, bone marrow embolism is worse, blood thinners won't prevent that it's the bone marrow that blocks the pulmonary artery. Very sad story though, terrible that happened, especially if they knew she had a clotting disorder.
Yep. When I broke my femur they considered it life threatening for this exact reason. But the broken neck was way more painful than the leg.
Don‚Äôt google compartment syndrome.
He shook the branch, or so he thought, friend fell and broke his femur, then broke it again hobbling into an auditorium to defend the main character and died iirc
Don't leave us hanging like that. What have you experienced that was more painful than breaking your collarbone??
Done both, titanium in the femur and surgical steel plate on the collarbone. Femur break was at 17 and I don't really remember the pain being horrible but morphine at 17 has a memory wipe effect. Collarbone didn't even hurt when it broke, 2 months arguing with the doctor that it wasn't healing before seeing the surgeon sucked and the surgery went well and recovery was going great until a screw popped drawing back my bow. I would probably take the femur break for $1500 Alex
Hot/crazy scale
Damn well I‚Äôm glad you got back out there and didn‚Äôt let it stop you from doing something I presume you love.
>Of course I only stop on the side

So we agree, the person stopped in a dangerous spot causing both risk for themselves and others.
Off the top of my head, crushed wrist, nail in my shin bone, kidney stones, broken ribs hurt more even, oh, and that bitch that broke my heart.  Jokes aside, I've broken a lot of bones, and it always hurts, but there is a huge discrepancy in pain between each.  I've never broke my femur but I'd put that at 10/10 break.  I'd put collarbone at 4/10.
Broken bones gang!
Broke my nose, pinky, 2 ribs and scapula, arch in foot and torn ligaments, and had ac separation 
Id say ribs and scapula were most immediately painful i literally couldnt stand up straight and was hunched over but it healed rather quickly. 
Breaking the arch in my foot though that never healed correctly and took 2 surgeries and was most painful at the time and was painful for the longest amount of time.
PSA: Milwaukee cut level 3 gloves will NOT protect you from a man eater blade on your angle grinder. 
Decided it‚Äôd be a good idea to feed my finger to the man eater back in March. Here‚Äôs a few pictures from then to now.  
What the hell is that blade even for? Besides consuming flesh, of course
Fuck that lol
We used to call this the meat-axe at my last job. Aluminum boat refurbishing.
I think you need full chainmail gloves for that.
Ok what kind of blade is that?
I like how cordless grinders stop really fast
Just seeing the gloves and the words "angle grinder", made me think "those gloves won't protect from an angle grinder"
What the heck do you even do with a blade like that. Almost looks like a metal cutting Circ saw blade.
Fuck man, looking at those gloves I probably wouldn't trust them with even like a pocket knife...looks more like they're for abrasion, not cutting.
In our shop, we teach that putting that blade on an electric angle grinder is a deathwish. We only use them on ingersoll rand air powered angle grinders and only use them with leathers. We also teach that if it's not cutting, it's disconnected. We disconnect it the moment we stop cutting and then reconnect it when we start cutting. sounds annoying, but it avoids accidentally turning it on while you're moving around your workspace, inside a boat.

Stay safe man ü§ò
What do you do with one of those blades? Never seen that. Aluminum?
Oh, FUCK THAT. Here I was, thinking that grinding a chunk of skin out of my finger with a flap disc was bad enough.
I saw the NSFW, I read the Warning: Gore. 
I still wasn't ready for pic #3
Sana, sana, curita de Rana.
S√≠ no se sana hoy se Sanara ma√±ana.
Those blades are viscous. Great for cutting aluminum but they‚Äôre nasty on flesh. That blade is gonna treat the level 4 the same as it treated the level 3, it slices through metal like butter. Skil saws are just as fun to cut through aluminum. Worked with an old boat builder who would cut the window holes in cabins with an old Milwaukee saw. Dude was an artist with that saw.
What the hell gloves would?
im sorry but i don‚Äôt think someone could pay me enough to use that ‚Äúblade‚Äù‚Ä¶ if i had not option id use welding gloves, but even then.
Did the grinder buck on you? I didn't notice a handle on it. If you pull the trigger with your left hand thumb and grab the handle with your right hand, when it does buck, it will go away from you.
Fuck that blade‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care how much time I save, I‚Äôd never use that shit
you have a lot of faith in rubber dipped gloves lmao.

my suggestion is to not run your grinder across your fingers.
Holy fuck, I would never put a carbide blade on an angle grinder. Pneumatic power only. You are insane, or non union.
I am not a weak stomach man and these pictures have me a funny nauseous feeling. Holy shit. I am glad the injury was not worse.
That'll do it...
My old foreman had one of those but they used a cheaper air powered grinder with that style blade because it slowed down if you put too much pressure. Seemed a lot safer that way.
The outcome is much better than I expected after seeing the blade.  

You have to tell us:  WTF are you grinding/cutting with a wheel like that???


I have done similar to my hands but with regular sanding pad or cutoff wheel.  Can't even imagine the carnage on the scene...
What a horrible tool. Right up there with those chainsaw type attachment for grinders.  Should have never been created.  My brother did some stupid shit with a blade like this connected to a ln angle grinder. Fucking thing rolled over what he was trying to cut and ran up his leg. He's lucky he didn't cut an artery it was that close and happens so fast.  I will stick with cutting disks grinding stones and flap disks thank you.
I have an old 8mm thick 125mm Dia milling cutter I use for the same thing. It's heavy as hell and would chew my hand off if I ever let it get near. Guard and handle with both hands once that monstrosity starts up. Clearly a death trap but  it's the only thing that's ever worked for alloy that I've ever tried.
I lost a good chunk of my knuckle using that kinda blade. Was at a boat shop working aluminum. Got handed that blade and was told to use it to speed up my work. Was also given a grinder without a guard to use it with. Searching far and wide for a grinder guard to no avail I try out the blade. As a anxious apprentice I tried my best to use it but the soft metal threw the blade back at me and into my left knuckle. Luckily I still have my finger but it's painful some days.
You can‚Äôt honestly tell me you believe those gloves would prevent a cut do you?
... OK ...

The tool was improperly used (No handle) and the gloves are NOT rated for that blade.

So blame the workplace and tool instead of the operater??? 

Bad welds we bash the welder ... yet improper tool use ...we blame the tool ... ü§£
Im going out on a limb and say that's not the safest tool for the job
Cut resistant gloves work, it‚Äôs just a matter of what cut you‚Äôre expecting them to resist.

I personally love the Milwaukee gloves for general work but I imagine you‚Äôd need damn near chain mail for that wheel lol.
A good rule of thumb is don't stick your finger anywhere you wouldn't put your Weiner.
Would you have laid your Weiner out next to that?
I work with aluminum and have for almost 10 years and never once had to use this kinda disc tf üòÇ
No glove will protect from that blade m8. Maybe super thick leather.
I was not ready for that third picture.
Yikes but of course the glove didn‚Äôt prevent this you‚Äôd need like chain mail but then you‚Äôd get your hand ripped off
Ouch, I'm sad to see this. Do they make gloves that stop blades like that
Man: ate.
We always called them meat axes. And I don‚Äôt think anything will protect you from one of those
What kind of finger eating blade are you fuckin‚Äô using dude?  That‚Äôs a scary as the one with chainsaw teeth I use for carving.
To be fair, I don‚Äôt think any pair of gloves will stop one of those
If this was my company they‚Äôd say the grinder was net used properly because there‚Äôs no handle on it. Then they probably try to blame you for it and not try to cover you medical bills lol
Well, at least it healed ok, and it seems your finger won‚Äôt be in the way next time.
OSHA needs to come pay your employees a nice little visit. Just to catch up on old times‚Ä¶
People who put those blades on grinders shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to vote, it never ends well
Damn that just gave me the chills.
I‚Äôm just gonna believe you instead of trying it out myself goddamn
At least its.....just the tip.
Yea you did
Those milling blades are nasty, I use them for aluminum and they're deadly. But they work great for prep work.
Thank you for doing the research to determine that which no one could've known
I had falling glass from a window go through those gloves like butter. Learned it is mostly paddling not cut resistant.. I would have been better with heavy leather work gloves.
Looks like your whole tip grew back, thats nuts
This cut is clean for that kind of blade!! Did it hurt? Or only after?
Sawrizard
At least most of it came back. 

Honestly, I would have tried to push the pieces together. Probably wouldn't have worked out so well.
Brother, I would not rely on the gloves to protect you. Protect yourself. You are now one of those guys for the rest of your life. Some guys pride themselves on that, others do not, because they do not have to.
Idgaf where I‚Äôm working you ain‚Äôt getting me near that fuckin blade lol. I‚Äôll quit before I use that shit, that‚Äôs scary as hell
How about plasma gouging instead?
My brother. I had something thankfully. Not nearly as bad a while back. When my stitches were healing, every time I had to clean it

Handles belong on grinders. 

Guards are also good. But handles belong on grinders. If you have to take it off for a moment that is what it is but otherwise it's easy for them to run off on you
Ouchie wowchie!
if you thought those thin rubber gloves were gonna prevent that ‚Ä¶that‚Äôs on you i would be wearing g the thickest leather gloves i could get with that scary blade
That 4th picture stood me up for a second‚Ä¶

‚ÄúGyat-damn, they had to take his whole finger?!‚Äù
Might want to look at cricket gloves, steel fingers in them.
I don't think anything can protect a thing that is as functional as hands from such a tool.
Something tells me that any type of glove, if it isn't a gauntlet, will not survive this blade. What the hell
I‚Äôd wear cut gloves under welding gauntlets to use that thing.
That tip will be numb for a couple years.
That grew back?! What?! Guitarists nightmare btw
Ouch may you heal well
Holy. Fuck. Lucky you still got the finger. Shit could've gone way *MORE* sideways honestly.
That‚Äôs about the result I‚Äôd imagine from most gloves with that set up. Glad you‚Äôre ok, or at least mostly ok. I don‚Äôt do a lot with aluminum right now so I don‚Äôt know what a better suggestion would be. I usually wear leather with a grinder but I can‚Äôt imagine the result would‚Äôve been much different.
Ah, you‚Äôre one of those now lol congrats
Duct fab shop here. All the guys complain about Milwaukee gloves. They should've Stuck to power tools
I did the exact same thing with a box cutter 25 years ago‚Ä¶. Completely grew back, and have a perfect fingerprint.
Yea no shit bro those gloves will save u from the normal disc blades, those metal blades are pretty dangerous why use them over normal ones? Also here is a tip make sure you cut steel with the blade spinning away from you not towards you, reason for this is if the machine gets ‚Äústuck‚Äù it will jerk towards that position so if it‚Äôs spinning away from you it will jerk away from your body saving you at times, I learned this as a kid and it saved my hands a few times from being thorn apart.
That's like expecting a bulletproof vest to stop a tank round bro.
i‚Äôm not sure why on gods good green earth you thought those gloves would do anything to protect you from more than maybe a staple or razor blade
GahDAMN bro that's a narsty tear. Glad to see it healed up alright, hope there weren't any more complications after the initial removal of part of ya finger
Hey OP @domefarmer I‚Äôm sure it may affect your bottom line, but I would definitely suggest looking into pferd‚Äôs solution to this problem, unless your purpose is just to cut the aluminum but rather gouging and you mentioned on an early comment. Take a look at these [blades](https://www.zoro.com/pferd-4-125-alumaster-high-speed-disc-hsd-r-20100/i/G706375812/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=surfaces&utm_campaign=shopping%20feed&utm_content=free%20google%20shopping%20clicks&campaignid=21460994857&productid=G706375812&v=&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADw3hZdexC_60T6j8Orn8sa5k2sYY&gclid=CjwKCAjwvKi4BhABEiwAH2gcw3yzgNUakue6ETD83hDPskFUP7ujgJWyBjNGwyjIDOwuZlse5mYsuhoCv7cQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) . The teeth design reduce kick back and can also be easily used with a guard. Again, I know the price is a bit high, but you can probably get the smaller one cheaper or the same one at a discount from a local welding distributer. Note that the teeth are interchangeable and you get two uses per tooth before needing to order more.
Wow, that could have been so much worse
Jesus, talk about a close shave! At least it only nipped the tip off of your finger, rather than lopping the whole digit off.
i use those exact gloves for diving for lobster and they still poke and fuck up my hands. wouldn‚Äôt even think to use them for a (meat saw)
No ahot I'm not buying alimunim disks. I wouldn't run a literal saw like that with someone ELSES hands.
I felt that in my gut
Good Pointer!
I‚Äôm glad it was just the tip of your finger and not any more

I‚Äôm also glad that I don‚Äôt have to work with aluminium, that blade is scary dude
Fuck that‚Äôs a dangerous disk.
damn that sucks brother hope it heals up fast
Did you cut the hole finger off? No, the one next to it.
Good to know üëç
Put a spoiler on this one my guy
Jesus christ. Idk if I'd even trust kevlar-lined leather with that thing¬† ¬†
Yeeowch
I don't wanna sounds like a dick but..... NO FUCKING SHIT
PSA: Don't use that kind of disk on your angle grinder, you idiot.

I tried to warn my father about the danger of that....thing...he continues to use it from time to time.
Good lord
Man, I'm glad you didn't lose the finger.  Glad your injury healed OK and you've a better process to protect yourself.  I almost wonder if this type of tool would be better with a second safety on the handle, forcing both hands to be accounted for before the tool will start.
Not to channel my inner shop teacher, but WHERE IS YOUR HANDLE ON YOUR GRINDER
Oh man, that‚Äôs brutal. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre healing up well.üç∫
That thing is terrifying
When I saw the picture with your finger surrounded by white, I though they amputated it for a split second and thought "that seems excessive." But then I realized I'm just really REALLY tired lol
Well my post of my hand injury had hundreds of upvotes and almost 100 comments and the mods took it down cause it ‚Äúdidnt contribute to the community ‚Äú. Seems odd considering all the upvotes and the clear conversations that were taking place in the comments. 

That said this beats my loss of fingertip any day. Threw up in my mouth a little.
first time i saw someone rip aluminum with a skillsaw time slowed down. honestly, what did this feel like?? on a scale of ouch this burns - seppuku time?
Fucking ow!!
I should not have looked. I shouldn't have and I knew it but I looked and now I regret it.
Never wear gloves when operating rotating machinery. This is why.
Yupp, I could've figured. I use those gloves aswell as a brand that my apprenticeship position give out for free. I'm too scared about risks so I'd probably use thick welding gloves if I had to use something like that
There are 9 levels, Level 3 is sufficient to prevent cute from non-power tools, like from metal flashing, sheet metal, etc. You want 6+ for working with power tools and level 9 for that hand mangler.
Damn for a second it looked like they cut off your finger and put it on a paper towel
Mr tudu fingers
Jesus glad recovery went well enough but fuck that‚Äôs a gnarly cut‚Ä¶
Do you feel your paycheck equals losing a piece of your finger?
That's what you get for using a dewalt grinder
Dam we need an update on your finger once it is fully healed
Did they do the chemical cauterizing with the giant long match stick with a black head?!

Chopped the corner of my thumb off and brought the piece in to sew on. They promptly told me they could not sew it back on and they had me put my thumb in some gel to numb
 it(didn‚Äôt do much‚Ä¶)Rolled that thing all over the open wound to stop the bleeding‚Ä¶terrible experience. 

TLDR; don‚Äôt chop kindling after a beer or two‚Ä¶
How did you manage to do that with a guard on?
With all due respect, sir, you didn't have to tell the whole internet you were foolish enough to f around and find out. 

Most people wouldn't feed their hand to a regular grinder bc after taking Osha classes, they'd know better.

This is almost equivalent to saying I fed my leg into a woodchipper, and I barely escaped with my life. Look how shitty these safety pants/boots are.

Those gloves are great, and your decision-making is not.
Maybe time to invest in some level 4 or level 5 gloves
Have you ever watched The Fly. Well there is a scene where he rips off his fingernails. I had the same reaction watching Jeff Goldblaum rip his fingernails off as I did seeing that
Send this over to r/medizzy
Idiot
Holy shit son. That‚Äôs the worst I‚Äôve ever seen on here.  None of that crybaby ‚ÄúWeAr yOur PpE yALl‚Äù with a picture of some scratches.
Lol...it's the gloves fault
Aluminum. We fabricate aluminum boats. The man eater comes in handy for back gouging and grinding out welds and tacks.
I've used them on some big aluminum projects. They work insanely well but they're also (obviously) terrifying
Yeah man. I got some cut level 4s so next time I should be fine
That‚Äôs what I do also. We‚Äôre fabricating a 24‚Äô landing craft now.
to get it tangled in the blade lol
Better off just losing flesh I think. Imagine getting entangled in the glove and blade
It‚Äôs basically a 4-4.5‚Äù circular saw blade. We use them for aluminum. Mostly for back gouging, or grinding out a weld. They can be used just like a hard stone disc, just have to be A LOT more cautious. As long as you‚Äôre following all the rules it should be safe. 
I wasn‚Äôt following all of the rules and fucked myself up. Live and learn.
I like that feature too, but I don‚Äôt think that the blade even went a full rotation before the damage was done. 
We have a corded dewalt grinder at the shop that has that feature. It‚Äôs one of those long grinders with the finger trigger and no trigger lock.
we only used meat axe air grinders with a covered guard, and a lock on the trigger.

they're easier to stall when they jam, less kicks and less carnage.

Still well known for eating apprentice fingers.....
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much that will, considering what they‚Äôre meant to cut through.
Aluminum. You can get a nice clean grind without impregnating the base metal with dust from a hard stone. That‚Äôs what my boss told me at least. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Totally. Used them a lot for detailing stainless hand rails and the likes. They‚Äôre great for what they‚Äôre intended for and have an amazing fit. 

I‚Äôve since wondered how much a leather glove would have changed in that specific incident though. I had my finger between the guard and blade by mistake when I kicked the grinder on. I doubt that a layer of leather would have bogged down the grinder enough to save my finger. Although, since the glove is bulky I‚Äôd imagine my finger wouldn‚Äôt have fit into that spot as deep, and I probably wouldn‚Äôt have hit the bone. Who knows. Either way, those gloves aren‚Äôt the correct PPE so it doesn‚Äôt matter at the end of the day. 


Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
That‚Äôs a good idea. 
Since the accident if I bring that tool into a boat with me I unplug it everytime I‚Äôm done using it. Helps me stay more aware when I pick it up and using it. Also help keep me from accidentally kicking it on with my foot or something.
My wife has like a 60 day Duolingo streak I‚Äôm gonna ask her what this says
I‚Äôm completely kidding about cut levels. Fully aware that the blade is going through everything short of chain mail. 
We use skill saws, miter saws, and jig saws all the time for boat fabrication at my shop. I‚Äôve done that exact same thing with a cordless Milwaukee skil saw. This specific tool isn‚Äôt meant for cutting, mainly used for back gouging, removing tacks in the weld zone, and grinding. You can grind a bevel into a piece of aluminum just like you would with a hard stone on a grinder. Certainly an intimating and dangerous tool. It‚Äôs one that demands your attention and awareness for sure.
No it didn‚Äôt buck. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm just flat out retarded. I picked up the grinder with my finger in the guard. When I grabbed onto it I just squeezed the trigger and depressed the safety.
Wish you would have told me that sooner!
Same, I don‚Äôt have a weak stomach at all, but the sound the grinder made going through my finger bothered me for a couple weeks. It wasn‚Äôt anything specific, kinda sounded like cutting any other soft material with a saw. Kind of a high pitched ‚Äúweee‚Äù sound, but it was my *finger*, not just any other soft material. Hahaha
Yeah it‚Äôs a joke man. Nylon dipped gloves obviously aren‚Äôt going to stop death spinning at 8,000rpm. 
The grinder I was using did have the handle on it. Getting injured was my fault, I‚Äôm fully aware of that.

Well seeing how nicely my finger healed up I‚Äôm not so worried about my bird being around it.
Yeah, my boss was understandably pretty pissed I wasn‚Äôt wearing leather gloves. Since the accident I‚Äôve wondered how much a leather gloves would have changed in this incident. Because the leathers are bulky I imagine my finger wouldn‚Äôt have fit into that same spot, but the blade absolutely would have still shredded through the glove. I mean, it went through my bone like it wasn‚Äôt even there. Would it have pulled my finger in further? Who knows. Either way nylon dipped gloves aren‚Äôt the correct PPE so it doesn‚Äôt matter at the end of the day.
Dude, that‚Äôs not a normal saw blade. First off it‚Äôs meant to attach to the angle grinder. It‚Äôs meant for cutting aluminum. He was using the right tool for the job, just not the right PPE.
For the most part yeah. The most damaged corner didn‚Äôt grow back fully. My finger basically ends at the nail now. Like I don‚Äôt have extra skin padding in front of the nail. I hit the bone, so I was surprised with the amount that did grow back.
Hurt like a motherfucker dude. Felt similar to smashing my finger with a big hammer. Throbbing hot ‚Äúwomp womp womp‚Äù pain.
First instinct was to find some electrical tape. Pulled the glove off and saw my finger fall open and thought ‚Äúfuck maybe super glue‚Äù then my lizard brain quieted down for a sec and realized I need the hospital. I walked very calmly to the first aid kit and grabbed some gauze, wrapped up my finger and walked to my coworkers. They were already following the blood trail to me. Lol.
Yeah man, I didn‚Äôt think the gloves were going to save my finger in this incident.
Yeah that‚Äôs the day after. They took the flap, folded it over and stitched it down. I had 3 stitches through my nail holding the flap down. That made me want to gag when I first saw it.
I nicked the tip of my index finger on a table saw in 2020. It took a chunk about a third of the size of this poor fucks ouchie and the nerves in my fingertip are screwed. If my heart rate is up I always get a cold feeling pulse on the scar lol
It‚Äôs actually not numb. It was numb for a few months, but since then I‚Äôve gained a lot of feeling back. I can use it pretty much the same as I used to before the accident. It‚Äôs just very sensitive now, but the worst part is I chipped the bone, and removed a bunch of the padding between the tip of my finger and the bone. If I accidentally poke something hard with that finger it feels like an ingrown nail almost.
Man I did this right before fishing season kicked off. I used to use that finger to cast with. Had to switch to using my middle finger for everything for a few months. I have feeling and use of that finger now, but I‚Äôm used to using my middle finger for most things now.
Honestly. I got super lucky that it was a nasty accident but healed so well. Scared the shit out of me and all the other guys in the shop, but still walked away with my finger at the end of the day. Well, at the end of the year. Haha
My only solace when it happened was that I get have a deformed blue collar finger. Fucker healed up so nicely that people don‚Äôt even notice it. Definitely not worth the trouble.
Thanks man! I‚Äôve actually been looking into these. The blades we have get dull within about 2 months. Having interchangeable teeth sounds really nice. Our shop is on an island in Alaska, so we have to ship our blades down to WA for sharpening and it takes forever. Being designed to reduce kick back is a huge plus.
Are my eyes lying to me? A $1000 4-1/2 inch blade? Are you cutting gold in the shop all day long or something?
I think you knew where this was going before you got to the finger photos.
Last two picks are fully healed.
Also had gloves on taking burs off some steel tabs using a giant belt sander one time  at the fab shop (key words ‚Äúone time‚Äù)  Gloves caught and sucked my finger in taking 98% of the finger nail from intact to hello nail bed before I could say aw shit. 

TLDR; gloves can also be bad and belt sanders will bite you and don‚Äôt give a shit about your feelings or the fact you have to finish the work week out. lol
No cauterizing. They stitched the flap down, and dumped three bottles of medical superglue on it. The ER doc looked at me afterwards with a face that looked likeüò¨
And said ‚ÄúI hope that works!‚Äù Hahaha. Luckily it did.
A lot of those scratches are trips to the ER if they go another CM.

Wear your PPE people, don‚Äôt listen to dumb fuck fudds like this guy.
I don't work with aluminum so this is probably a dumb question. Why do you need saw blades and not regular rocks? Contamination?
Also an aluminum boat builder here! We call ours a death saw. Ours is a 7 1/4‚Äù aluminum skill saw blade on a 7‚Äù grinder body. Shits gnarly. 

Where are you located?
I figured it had something to do with aluminum given the size of the teeth on that thing
Seriously that blade looks like a heavy slitting saw for use in a milling machine.  For aluminum I'd use an abrasive cutting blade made for that.  OSHA would have a fit on that one.  Glad you were able to grow that finger back Mr. Lizard.
Very smart of you to choose a body part that grows back. I sanded mine off many moons ago on a belt sander with a BRAND NEW  60 grit belt. I grabbed my hand & was scared to look at it. (probably you had a similar feeling when removing your glove). Glad you healed completely (as did I). I used a skill saw with a similar blade for cutting aluminum treadplate. Would have liked to have one like yours for radiuses. That thing must be a chip throwing beast when cutting aluminum. Wear quality glasses, the eyes are a lot less forgiving than the hands. Take care & please, be as safe as possible.
It's called a MAN EATER dawg what did you expect??
What brand of you don‚Äôt mind me asking? In a bit of an aluminum boat enthusiast lol.
we call it the meat wheel over at Zodiac, ended one coworker‚Äôs career with 10 stitches up his pinky
I really liked usually a small circular saw with carbide blade for this
Bro that's a straight up slitter saw
How about a roraty file or carbide burr on a die grinder?  I also wonder if setting a metal cutting circular saw shallow would work for gouging?
So it's like a nibbler,  but I'm blade form? I'd imagine it'd take a lot of effort to keep the blade from paddling its way out of the cut.
INSANELY well. Honestly one of the most used and handy tools in our shop. So handy for neatly cutting out a shitty weld, back gouging with nice shiny cuts, and amputating the tip of your finger. Can‚Äôt recommend them enough for that last one.
Maybe go cut level 5 just in case
anything you do to stop a hungry blade is akin to pissing on a forest fire, but chain-mail gloves should offer slightly more protection. i recommend using a mesh glove like a [Ergodyne #7070](https://www.amazon.com/Ergodyne-ProFlex-7070-Resistant-Surfaces/dp/B09MGB1728) paired with a chain mail (butchers) glove on the outside, similar to [this](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Resistant-Durable-Rustproof-Protection/dp/B0824J4HWN) but from a reputable source.

the idea is the chainmail catches the blade and slows or binds it and the kevlar glove acts as a buffer/shock absorber.
You're a fucking moron using a blade like that
Those blades are a cut level 9 though. So you'll need to look for cut 10 or better.
I don‚Äôt think that the glove no matter the cut level is gonna protect you from that use proper tool handling and vises or clamps and for god sale keep your dick beaters away from the cutting wheel! Dude that sucks but that thing is flying at those speeds it‚Äôs gonna still tear your hand up in the glove just from force alone but at least you‚Äôll be able to find the missing pieces still inside of the finger
well...you were lol
Instead of getting your finger cut you get your hand wrapped up in the grinder and the bones in that finger turn into gravel
I was imagining gloves like chainsaw pants that are full of fibers that tangle around the blade and stop it from moving.
So you can put pressure down and grind with it just like a normal grinding disc and it doesn‚Äôt bend the blade and fuck it up?
I'm curious how exactly? I broke my phone once from having a grinder kick back from a cut I was making and it slammed into my leg, bending my phone like 10 degrees. Saved me a nasty bruise though.
Makes sense. Not sure it's worth the danger factor though.
I‚Äôm guessing the stone wheel residues cause porosity issues when welding. I‚Äôve been known to take some stupid risks but idk if I would want to use a meat eating disk like that.
It's a nursery rhyme we tell kids in Spanish when they get hurt or sick.¬†


It roughly translates to:


"Heal, Heal, with the frogs seal (bandaid)
If it doesn't heal today, it will heal in the morning"
I've seen this happen before, ironically on a safety tour (no meat grinder, just regular metal grinder). It's pretty easy to understand when it just boils down muscle memory and a smidgen of complacency. Glad it healed well... You're not fully retarded, you're just a human on that human grindüòÇ
That's in the shit happens category. Live and learn. Deadly looking blade.
Those are excellent blades.

With proper use and in the proper tool.
You're a better man than me. I can't spare a 1/16th.....
Just because you can do something doesn‚Äôt mean you should, almost every job I have worked has not allowed those blades because of the safety issues
Good luck healing.
Damnit lol as many times as I‚Äôve smashed my fingers, never had anything to show haha just hard working hands ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I dont use it often. But when i need it it‚Äôs a blessing. Even for butt welds since the design is round.
Its essentially an endmill for aluminum. I mean considering the cost of multiple abrasives wheels or in the case of OP an ER visit, $1,000 seems quite fair. I believe we got them for a little over $800 from our local supplier.
Fair enough.
Oh snap I didn‚Äôt make it that far I stopped at the Stitches that looked like it hurt couldn‚Äôt look at it anymore
I found one!
Also, I wear my PPE religiously. I just don‚Äôt need an idiot who hurt themselves telling me the obvious.
Aluminum like to be cut, not abrased. It just takes off way more material with much less effort
I think any grit of abrasive would load up with aluminum so you‚Äôd want to cut chips.¬†
Aluminum is super soft. It loves to gum up abrasive wheels if you look at it wrong.


It's such a weird metal compared to steel
Regular grinding wheels gum up with aluminum, then they heat up and explode at however many rpms and come flying back at the operator.
I wouldnt use this for aluminum, but to each their own. They sell flap disks for aluminium, much safer and they eat aluminium for breakfast lunch & supper.
I wish I didn‚Äôt know that existed. I would want a full set of knights armor to even plug that in.
AK!
That is retarded.
You're self-savage. Love it, man.
Is there a level 10? I‚Äôll go with level 10.
Maybe don't put your finger in the path of the grinder
It's too bad there isn't anything like the SawStop for angle grinders... those things work *awesome*.
Thanks for the advice!
Hmm. Think I should bump it up to level 5 then?
Savage
Jesus Christ. You‚Äôre not wrong.
You don‚Äôt need to put pressure down. If you‚Äôve ever cut aluminum with a miter saw or something similar, it‚Äôs the exact same. I think if you‚Äôve ever cut applied any real force to the grinder it‚Äôd want to buck on you. With a freshly sharpened man eater blade it‚Äôll gouge into the aluminum with just the weight of the grinder. If you‚Äôre using it in a safe manner everything‚Äôs fine. Just like every other tool in the shop. Complacency kills.
Yeah, I hear you. My respect for the tool went up pretty sharply after the accident for sure. Wish I would have been more careful to begin with but here we are haha. Complacency kills.
It's not.  We have these at the shop.  I avoid using them at all cost.  Ive seen 3 injuries in 3 years.
Dude I had only done steel welding before starting this job. I did great on my weld test for a separate shop, moved up here for the shop I‚Äôm working at and couldn‚Äôt weld aluminum to save my life. Everything I did looked like hammered ass! I was for sure in complete grind mode. Moved my family up here and started falling back at work. Was rushing something and nipped my finger. 
Luckily, since then I‚Äôve gotten way better at my position. Worked my way up to $32/hr and love my job. And I still have my finger!
Clearly. Look at the tip of that guys finger.
If you wax your disc you can get some decent cuts.
They make aluminum disks for this reason.
Yea pretty much, there are work around with abrasives but they are only so effective
I use Irish spring soap when I‚Äôm cutting aluminum on just regular Zip disks, it def helps
the regular ones at our shop are green stripe walther, for aluminum
how many flap disks will it take you to create a 1/4‚Äù x3/16‚Äù groove 32‚Äô long?great, now do 3 more. now remove all the contamination
They‚Äôre air powered üò≥
Wouldn't be too hard to fab. We have a bunch of scrap aluminum sitting around
Oh damn!! You‚Äôve probably seen some of our boats up there. We do a bit of business with Dewey‚Äôs in Cook Inlet!
On second thought, if there‚Äôs a 9000, he probably needs more than that
I've got one that goes to 11. It's louder than 10
I can tell you don‚Äôt use a grinder much, sometimes if you hit something just the wrong way the grinder can kick back and you can lose grip.

This is why grinder come with guards and handles

I‚Äôve had a grinder in a split second go from facing away from me to being pointed directly at me because the cut off wheel hit the work piece in just the wrong spot
How did this accident happen? Were you holding the grinder with one hand? Just getting into construction and this shit is scary ngl
I was meaning like using that blade as a grinding blade not a cutting blade
Fuck yeah, man. ü§ò
Hell yeah brother!
Which one
But even those clog up long before they wear out.
grinding is an option, but the meat wheel is the cleanest, and fastest.
They make small circular saws for cutting metals, ferrous and non ferrous. Same blade, but way safer.
If i wanna make grooves id use a mill because thats a machining job, not a handheld angle grinder job.

Op stated they use it mostly for back gouging and taking off tacks.

Id sooner mount that disc to my mill than I would my grinder. Also no side handle on it ftw lol
Might not be the best choice of material with a blade designed to go straight through it.
What‚Äôs the name of your guys‚Äô shop? I‚Äôll have to see if we have any here. I‚Äôm in SE Alaska. We finished a 32‚Äô specmar last year, working on a custom design 21‚Äô landing craft now. Thing‚Äôs tough looking dude. 
I‚Äôve done 95% of all the welding on it too. Nice to weld on something and be able to take some real pride in it!
*It‚Äôs over 9000!!*
Been working fab shops for 20 years and I know full well how quickly a grinder can get away from you. That's why you always position yourself and the tool so it's pulling away from your and your body parts. If you get bit, you fucked up, not the tool.
Yeah, holding the grinder with one hand. I picked it up and hooked my finger in the guard on accident. Kicked it on and it did that. My buddy told me that he had to clean my finger hoop off the interior of the boat. The blade slinged my finger all over the place hahaha
The aluminum one.
Btw I hope you are doing alright
Walther green stripe doesn‚Äôt load at all
Buy a higher quality disk
Fastest and cleanest until you stop for a hospital visit, and then have to clean blood off of your aluminum
Yea definitely, if you rub castor oil on your sanding discs it will help reject the aluminum particles, not perfect but you get about double life from your discs with that method

E: not castor oil, it was come kind of wax/grease from either Castro or turtle wax. I‚Äôd have to ask my buddy because it‚Äôs been a couple years for me but it was some kind of wax or grease in those paper towel roll looking tubes
I‚Äôd love to see you get a boat set up in your millü§£, to backgouge the chineüòÇ BTW I do the same job ‚ö°Ô∏è
I think that kinda was the joke...
*AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH*
Giggity
A lot easier said than done when you don‚Äôt have to shove your head into the underside of a  conveyer with a boom lift because there isn‚Äôt enough clearance underneath to position yourself lower, so the grinder is 6in from your face. 

Or the times were you have to grind with your arms fully extended above your head while stepping on the middle rung of the lift because that‚Äôs how close you can get. or laying on your back in a confined space with the work less than a foot above you

Point is it‚Äôs easy to position yourself correctly in a shop, but you rarely get that luxury in the field. A lot of the times the contractors only send on/off grinders instead of paddle actuated grinders which makes it extra spicy.
LOL hope you got him some beer for that at least.
just running the things without gloves will leave the back of your left hand bleeding from the sharp chips. Meat wheels are nuts, honestly. There‚Äôs just no good replacement.
Like I‚Äôve done some welding and grinding in my time. But holy shit, fuck that‚Ä¶there are machines made to use blades/tools that aggressive. Again, not in the industry, but that looks akin to putting a 5 inch 12 tooth wood blade on a grinder and then trying to cut a sheet or plywood.
I guess I value my fingers more than the boss man's money.
I‚Äôd be curious if an accident report were filled out, what an osha investigation would find. Hopefully op was at least covered by the company.
I haven't encountered a situation in which I would use whatever that is. pipelines, compressor stations, shop work; never even seen one and hope I never do lol
Right, at least use the fooking handle
When total package is $75/hr straight time the tears dry themselves /s

But in all seriousness I‚Äôm in one of those situations about once a month on average, a lot of the times you can get pretty comfortable, but there‚Äôs always that one damn cut that needs special attention. Boss man is contractually required to provide all the necessary PPE and we can refuse to work without much pushback if they don‚Äôt. All of those scenarios we are wearing face shields and proper gloves for the job so we aren‚Äôt just raw dogging it. 

Plus if a contractor tries to make me do too many unsafe tasks I can just drag up and give them the finger and I‚Äôll be back to work for another contractor within a week
I work with asbestos mold and lead currently for a living and did coal mining for 20 years prior.  I‚Äôve done some wild shit. But seriously FUCK THAT.
Nice catch, and wtf was he thinking‚Ä¶ was almost using all the protection he could. While I feel bad for the injury, I hope he learned. I know many that I have died. Please op, pass your story on, tell everyone to not skip any steps as your injury could‚Äôve been much worse
To the jerk who stole my new snowboard from the crappiest mountain in Jersey
You went to bloody Campgaw mountain, all 800 feet of it, where parents go to bring their kids to learn. You obviously saw me take my gear off, leave it with my 4 year old‚Äôs snowboard, and go in to take her to warm up and grab some food. You decided to knock over her gear, take her dad‚Äôs stuff, and to ruin her day-not like she can get in the chairs without me there with her.   Nevermind that im a single dad who gets less time that he likes with the kiddo. You stole over 2 grand of my stuff, and I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre stupid and can‚Äôt use it.  I hope you get a lot of good riding in on a 3d printed powder board on the ice coast, you deranged muppet. I brought it out to bust it in (as brand spanking new and was Breckenridge bound later this month) and slide behind my daughter as I instructed her.   I hope the dynamic chambers on the 3d print channel the snow directly up your tuchas if you ever strap in. 


There is low and then there is stealing something completely assanine from the crappiest learning mountain in the northeast from someone obviously teaching their kid.  The police officer who took the report even thought you were a toon. Who takes a powder board from Jersey?
Post photos of the board, keep a look out on FB Market place and CL.

I'm in Bergen Co, I can keep an eye out as well. 

Ps. Had no idea Campgaw was even open.  

Good Luck!
Bro, don't let up. 

The dumb ass will either try to sell it on Ebay of Facebook marketplace or ditch it in the woods. Either way, if you make a lot of people aware of it, the odds of recovery go up. 

What this clown really stole was quality time for you and your daughter. Teaching your kid a sport and getting outside is really healthy. Hard to do without a board.
I‚Äôm sorry to hear this, what size deck you ride..? I have a 163 NS w/ cartels bindings you can have‚Ä¶.People who steal gear WILL receive a huge helping of Bad JuJu/Karma‚Ä¶.
‚ÄúKarma is a bitch and that bitch don‚Äôt love ya‚Äù
*Mac Miller
I lock my board and have an AirTag under the base of my step on binding.
I got my board stolen once too. Do you have Venmo? I‚Äôd like to help you replace it.
Dude I used to disc golf Campgaw every week, that's so shitty to hear. I'll keep an eye on FB marketplace and the like in my area
you can hide, but you cant run
Post a picture of the board, we will keep a lookout on local markets.
Hey OP, I'll add to the list of folks keeping an eye out. I'm in Union County and I'm actually looking for a new board so Facebook Marketplace serves em up to me from all over the region. I saw the photo but can you describe it in a little more detail?

Also

>Who takes a powder board from Jersey?

Right? LMAO. What's "powder?"

ALSO also, you might wanna cross post this to r/newjersey
Is this the model? Here's the [listing](https://www.burton.com/us/en/p/family-tree-3d-deep-daze-snowboard/W23-222481.html) on Burton's site, for all those on the lookout. Looks like all the sizes are the same colorway.

Ppl look at me weird when I bust out my dakine lock. For this very reason. I don‚Äôt trust any of you fucks
[deleted]
Lock. Up. Your. Gear. It‚Äôs amazing how many boards are not locked. A lock is $15.
Man, that sucks. I had a board stolen over 20 years ago when I was a teenager and it still stings to think about. I'd begged my parents for months for it and money was tight but they made it happen for Christmas, and it got stolen on my first day with it. Literally gone for 2 minutes while I ran downstairs to the repair shop for something. I felt awful telling my parents.
I still lock up my board, I wonder if skis get stolen as much as boards.?
Do you have a pic of the 3d printed powder board? Sounds sick
That really sucks OP. 

Were you able to continue the day at least a little bit? When I was helping my kid learn I'd ride the lift with no board and walk down the bunny hill helping my kid.
I'm a NY VT rider. I doubt I'll see such a specific board up here, but if I do, I have no problem dropping the Mitts to fuck up some Jerry's day. Fingers crossed for you brother, in the meantime don't let this slow you down, hit a play It again sports or whatever your local sports consignment shop is and find a plank to throw around in the meantime! 

Also, any particular markings on it that might make it unique? I know you said it was new, but was there a stomp pad? Any stickers? If the guys a true Jerry he probably didn't even change the stance, how did you have your bindings set? Anything like that would be helpful
Shoot me a dm. I‚Äôm 15 minutes away and I have an older setup you can have for free. As a former single dad, I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you.
I pray that this thief gets his \*\*\* \*\*\* in \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*
Thst sucks, man.

I've had property stolen before. It wss a motorcycle. It wasn't much... But it was mine. And I worked hard for it.

It was such a violation. Like for a couple of weeks I was so sad and I felt so violated. I kept wondering why did someone steal it? It's mine...

Anyways. It sucks. Take care.
Hey man I have a couple of extra decks. I‚Äôll gladly give u an older option 157 signature. I‚Äôll even ship it to you. No charge.
If you purchased recently with a credit card, check your card benefits for consumer protection. A few of my cards have loss / theft fully covered for 1 year.
Don't worry, karma is on your side and she can be a real bitch. What goes around comes around and you will find that board soon.
I‚Äôll keep an eye out I go to creek pretty often but I couldn‚Äôt imagine this kid bringing this into the park
Who knows maybe he had a trip to Breckenridge planned as well
Ullr does not look kindly upon theft. That guys season is ruined. Hope you get your gear back, homie.
That sucks, happen to me at mountain creek a while back. Jersey is the worst for gear thefts
Had someone steal my Burton Pill like 10 years ago. It still hurts. I rode that board for a month and it was purely amazing. Nothing will replace it.
I live in NYC, I‚Äôll keep a look out on FB marketplace man. I hate that there is scumbags like that on these mountains
I've been locking my board since 2000 because I grew up snowboarding at Mountain Creek (and even before it was called Mountain Creek).  People think I'm paranoid especially when I go out up North or west and lock my board and no one else does.  But Crackheads are everywhere and its easy money.
This is why I always lock up my board. Yes, someone with any kind of bolt cutter would easily break it but it is a deterrent nonetheless
They‚Äôre either gonna sell it or use it for the day and dump it so keep asking around as it may have been found after they‚Äôd tried it out and no doubt had a few yard sales‚Ä¶

Keep an eye on eBay/facebook. I know you said it was brand new so I guess it‚Äôs not that likely to have any defining marks on?
Post better pics in here and crosspost to r/icecoast 

I hit Mountain creek often and will keep an eye out.
I don‚Äôt understand how this happens- do losers drive to a resort (pay for parking) and look for a board to steal?  Or, is it someone already there boarding who decides to take an extra board home with them?

Sorry to hear this OP.  Sounds like you made the best of a shit sandwich and your daughter probably still had a rad day just hanging out with you.
What size are you? I have a few extra boards and bindings and am in the area!
Honestly local crap coast mountains are probably the riskiest without a lock, I take the same risk with no lock but I get worried at my local one.
That sucks bro. Post it everywhere. My buddy just got a mtbike back after a few weeks with a similar situation
Hey man I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you and especially sorry it ruined your day with your little one. I design and sell a 3D printed AirTag mount for snowboards called ShredTag to help with theft. If you think it could help you out, I‚Äôd like to send you one free of charge to use with your new board.

Honestly - if you can get this circling amongst the lifties in the region they will find it
Literally $1,000.00 setups untended and unlocked on the racks steps away from the parking lot. There are even signs warning about theft.  Lock up your boards even to just remove temptation.
I don‚Äôt live near you. But I‚Äôll keep an eye out on different selling websites, because maybe they somehow blocked people in your area from seeing it. I‚Äôll let you know if I see anything. What size is the board?
That sucks bro, I wanna know more about that board though! 3D printing a board would be pretty sick...
The thief will put a lam sticker over the top and enjoy it the rest of their life.
This happened to me and my renters insurance covered most of it. Depending on your situation, it's worth a try.  Sorry for your loss, man. It's such a shitty feeling. Every snowboarding trip I think about that libtech attack banana
I doubt the thief even knows what stole enough to put it in Marketplace or eBay.  They will slip up eventually and get caught stealing again. I‚Äôm assuming you checked already but any chance they caught the guy on a camera at the place?
What a freaking tool who ruined your quality time. You daughter is very cute.

I got my bike stolen one time and I checked Craigslist to see if it was posted. That might be a good option. It‚Äôs a long shot, but doesn‚Äôt hurt. Good luck bud.
You sound like a great dad. I truly hope that things work out in your favour.

Snowboarding with my dad is/was one of my favourite shared activities. He can't do it anymore, which makes those memories even more precious. It warms my heart to see that you worked around the stolen-board-problem so that your daughter could still hit the hills.

Keep doing what you're doing. It means a lot to a kid, and I know this because I was one.
If it makes you feel any better, Breckenridge needs like 5 big storms before it can be classified as powder conditions. I hope you are able to track it down.
fuckin hate thieves. hope you find your board OP
Yo when you come out to Colorado and want a board to ride hit me up, I got a couple decks you can pick from to use while you are here. Just gotta stop by my place in Denver before you head up to the mtns. Most have bindings or if not you can swap some on to the board you want.  Dm me if you don't find your shit before your trip.
It has always been my contention that Resort should be responsible at least in part for thievery. I‚Äôm sorry that that happened to you. The larger resorts should have surveillance cameras to deter swiping
I got my whole setup stolen and then some.. still haven‚Äôt recovered. Booked a trip the end of February but I‚Äôll have to rent, it really does suck.
This happened to me but since I used my Visa with purchase protection and got the mountain to give me a report stating it was stolen, I got my money back. The principal stands, however, getting the dollars back feels so good..
I came in here like okay yeah let's roast Creek.

MF I forgot about campgaw. 

I hope you get that board man fuck that fuckin fuck.

If someone smart out there is reading a perfect use of image recognition AI is to feed a picture of your stolen item into a program and then have it crawl the various second hand sites to find a match.
I saw Jersey and that‚Äôs all I needed to know
OP hit me up when you get out to CO if you don‚Äôt find it! I‚Äôve got some connections out there and might be able to help out.
I ski, haven‚Äôt in a decade and don‚Äôt follow this stuff so I don‚Äôt know how this post popped up on my feed. I have a two year old. You seem like a great dad. Most important, smiling. Hope you find your kit. Easy
I hope that fucker tries to take a jump and when he bottoms out the binding back goes right up his taint and rips him another asshole.
Bummer that happened! Frickin Mahwah buttholes!

On a side note, I live in SLC now but I lived in Mahwah when I was a kid. GREAT memories shredding Campgaw.
What exactly did you have stolen? Brand model and size of board? Any mittens or googles or anything? I don‚Äôt have a lot of cash from lawyer fees fighting an ex but I‚Äôll see what I can do.  I have a few items with tags still on.. and will see what k can do. 

If anyone else would want to donated mildly used or new gear, or $$ towards snowboard hit me up and we can make it happen. Or send him the cash. I get some prodeals and a would like to help out  a fellow dad on a rough spot. 

Just joined ski patrol but have always found there are a lot of great people on the mt and only a few scumbags. Dont let it get you down. 

How much were your passes and did they refund you at all.
I used to work rentals at the mighty Gaw and definitely would have hooked you up with a rental for the day at least. Hell, we basically kept a library of our old boards for situations like this. No one wants to see a kid's day get ruined. Good luck with tracking it down and keep on shredding.
I am really sorry this happened to you. Here‚Äôs my board theft story: I grew up skiing but switched to snowboarding in grade 7 because skiing wasn‚Äôt cool anymore. I quickly became a park rat and would bum a ride off whoever I could to get to the local hill. My aunt was a big supporter as she had no kids, was close to my siblings and I
and would offer to pick me up. One day she came with her partner at the time and offered to buy me some food before doing some park laps to show my new moves. We went inside and I didn‚Äôt lock my board up for the first time. We come back out and the board is gone. I‚Äôm 13 maybe at this point and have saved and spent everything on snowboarding. We search everywhere, but it‚Äôs a small place and obvious my board isn‚Äôt there. We report it to the front desk and start walking to the car. Im a total wreck at this point. Take most of my rage out on my helmet. Her partner had noticed a truck doing donuts in the parking lot at some point. He suggests we head to a nearby hill and look around. We arrive, talk to ski patrol and report what had happened as well. As we‚Äôre talking a truck matching the description appears. Her partner talks to the driver and notices the truck had 4 others in it. I look in the bed and see there is 20+ boards. I see my board sitting near the top. I tell him and he grabs it as they rip out of the parking lot. Ski patrol chased them down the road on snowmobiles but ultimately couldn‚Äôt keep up. This is all reported to the police instantly with a number of others. Months go by then years and they are eventually convicted through an organized crime ring and served jail time. I have since gone back to skiing but I still have the board and ride it occasionally.
sucks it happened...but this is really a great reason people should get something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Dakine-10002709-Cool-Lock/dp/B07PVZJP9T/ref=sr_1_7?crid=1NQKS7IHJF371&keywords=snowboard+lock&qid=1704728924&sprefix=snowboard+lock%2Caps%2C80&sr=8-7


is it easy to break? yea, but you sure look fucking sus if you are attempting to break this in public.
Fuck Campgaw. Sprained my wrist there some years ago.
They make these things called LOCKS.
Ill keep an eye out fellow crime doer
So sorry to hear OP. People can be really shitty more often than not. I really wish these places did a little bit more to ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen.

Kudos to you for getting out with your little one to make some memories. As a dad of two kids I can totally relate. Don't let that discourage you though, get some locks and keep at it.
You know, after reading these all these board thefts over the last two weeks on this sub, I finally opened the little board lock that came with my one jay ball waxing kit that I bought 3 years ago. Turns out. Takes just a few more seconds and gives me more piece of mind. New board, new habits I suppose.
Next one you 3D print, design a cavity for an AirTag. And that really sucks. Sorry bro
Back news, Breck isn't very snowy this year.
What a fucking clown. Sorry that happened. I hope you find it.
Oh mannnn not the mighty camp gaw! I grew up one town over from that bump. Sorry about the board man :(
If there‚Äôs a local shop nearby, let them know to keep an eye out in case someone comes in to get the bindings changed.  Keep an eye on pawnshops, Facebook marketplace, and setup eBay alerts for whenever a new listing for that model gets listed.

I write my initials in sharpie under the bindings.
If it ever comes down to catching someone red handed and they claim ownership, ask em to tell the cops what letters are written under the bindings
I‚Äôm so sorry you had your snowboard stolen. Shame on all the @holes who go there stealing other people‚Äôs snowboards. We shouldn‚Äôt have to lock up our boards but unfortunately nowadays it seems like we do. F U allüèÇ thieves out there, hope you get your karma.
Don't know if someone already said this but file a police report. If the person attempts to sell it at a pawn shop, the pawn shop should run it through the police stolen item database. Also, call your local pawnshop and tell them the specs of the board and bindings and provide them with pictures.
I grew up right near campgaw and snowboarded the east coast my first 25 years.  I have had a couple of boards stolen over the years.  IMO Board theft happens more often at smaller type places, and definitely more on the east coast.
My girls board was stolen from mountain Creek years ago.  Ran inside for 2min and it was gone.   Saw another girl upset her board got stolen an hour later.

Local police said they thought there was a somewhat organized ring there with possibly people working there.  Ton of thefts there 

Bought locks, used them ever since.  Every time.
You sound like an incredible dad, sorry this happened to you. People suck!
What size boots? I got a free pair if you want.
That sucks. And the asshole who took your shit,  hope they break their collar bone and leg in the same fall. That being said. General PSA to everyone else. Check your board, or put it in your vehicle when not strapped in. Too many kooks out nowadays, can't trust anyone.
Yikes bro 45 minutes from the city I would of never let my gear out of my sight. Criminals work very hard at their job man and nothing is worse than getting ripped off while you are being a dad. If you have a police report and renters insurance policy you might be able to get some of the stuff back. Terrible man I feel for you. I'm teaching a 6 and 9 year old right now
Sorry this happened, OP. I haven‚Äôt snowboarded in over a decade and am not in this sub but it popped up on my feed so I‚Äôm commenting for post visibility. I hope you‚Äôre able to get your gear back!
Maximum lameness.  I don‚Äôt know what sizes you are, but if you need to borrow a ride for your Breck trip I got you.  I‚Äôm assuming you still have your boots?  DM me if you want a loaner!  But respond here first cause I don‚Äôt ever check DMs.
I have no idea on the area you mentioned, saw this post today‚Ä¶. Fingers crossed for youü§û 

Edit: post saying gear found in Murray

https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/s/aSK2LIKir2
I got a board stolen from mountain creek (another dog shit jersey mountain) during a preseason ride in November. I was like 14 at the time and devastated. Joke was on them since the board was starting to delaminate and had completely split apart in one end. I hope the thief ate SHIT. 

Jersey sucks for skiing and boarding. Tons of shit bags come up from NYC and bring their thieving bullshit with them. Never had an issue leaving my $1000 board unattended in VT or PA. sorry for you loss man.
Originally from Passaic county and now living in Morris county, if you post any photos of the board, I‚Äôll keep an eye out on any Facebook groups I can find
Look man, it sucks what happened to you. Next time buy a couple of locks. I never understood how people can be so carefree about their gear worth a couple grand. There are always those that ruin it for everyone.

Hope you and the cops can find your gear.
This immediately made me buy a lock, can‚Äôt believe people can be so greedy. Why even go to a mountain if you don‚Äôt have a board just to ruin someone‚Äôs day. What‚Äôs even the point, especially if you tell the lodge to keep a lookout they can‚Äôt even use the board at that mountain. People are seriously ignorant and stupid. I hope you figure this out it‚Äôs always been my worst nightmare when I go into the lodge to warm up or get some food. I wish you the best and hope this problem resolves quickly, so you can get back to shredding with your little one. Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è.
Damn, what happened to the days you could just drop your board in the rack and go grab a drink?
OP, I know you're addressing this to the jerk that stole your board... but c'mon. You know he can't read.
Feel like small mountains are where most of the theft occurs.
Had same thing happen to me with my 5yr old at the time. Put stuff down to run to car with him on my shoulders. Someone watched me set my new board down and immediately stole it. Thank goodness i brought a spare. It was first day of 3 day trip. Almost ruined my weekend
what a fuck :(
Welp, youll never do that again.

Always lock up your stuff when you leave it unattended

Bad karma stealing a board. It would suck if the person hit a tree!
I‚Äôm local to the area. I‚Äôll keep my eyes peeled on marketplace and set a notification. So sorry to hear this happened to you. 

Did you talk to anyone that works at the mountain about potentially catching them on some cameras (if they even exist in the first place‚Ä¶)?
Man, I‚Äôm so sorry. What a piece of shit.
That sucks, I had the employees over at mountain creek take my setup when I was getting a drink at the bar after my second time snowboarding. Found them at the rental shop joking half joking about how suped they were for their new setup. Needless to say I bring a chain bike lock with me every time now to lock everything up to the stands. 

Not gonna lie though, not surprised that poo poo mountain now has another reason to be avoided besides it being bottom of barrel for anyone besides beginners.
Ugh of course it happened at campgaw, I had friends get their stuff stolen there when we were kids. Its way to easy to pull off. I was at mt. Creek one time in jersey and just so happened to see this guy nonchalantly pick up a board and walk away. 3 seconds later another guy walks up and was like did you see someone take a board that was right here? I said yeah just saw a guy like 3 seconds ago grab it and walk out. Dude caught him in the parking lot and the cops that were near by sorted it out. That guy was just lucky I happened to be admiring his board when someone tried to steal it
Sorry this happened to ya. Hope you get it back. Id be livid too. 


I spend 1k on my setup. I lock my stuff up. Is it stealproof ? No not at all. 
 

But theives prefer easy grabs.
Man, that sux. Hope the thief gets what‚Äôs coming to them. If it‚Äôs any consolation, this thread just made me buy a cable lock for me and my son.

So from one dad to another, thanks for sounding the alarm on stuff we don‚Äôt always think about.
Dude...not trying to blame the victim but how do you not lock your snowboard up?
Dude...not trying to blame the victim but how do you not lock your snowboard up?
Can you dm me a picture of the board, I've occasionally gone to camp gaw to help teach friends  as well as ride all the other local mountains (Mt Creek, Hunter, Windham, Mt Snow, etc) and have no problem smacking around a low life like this to get you your board back.
Dude you gotta bring a board lock man. I‚Äôm sorry your board got stolen, happened to me at Blue Mountain when I was 13. I got a brand new K2 WWW for Xmas and it was gone. Learned a tough lesson.
This is absolutely the lowest of the low 

There is a code. I should be able to leave my shit by the side of a the mountain for days without it moving. 

This dude is a piece of shit. We will find it
Look into if your renters- or homeowners insurance handles it. Best wishes,  bro.
Had a limited-run K2 World Wide Weapon called the Enjoyer. It was all-black and probably my favorite board ever. Worked at the mountain, forgot it overnight once. Came back and it was gone. C'est la vie. I worked at Big Boulder in PA (before Vail destroyed it) and it gets a lot of Jersey traffic.

Edit: [Here's a video of me on the board](https://imgur.com/XMcKTeS)
Ooooffff that is harsh. If you‚Äôre going for to spend $2k on your gear, spend $10-$15 and get a lock. Still I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. Brutal.
I‚Äôm sorry man. You sound like an awesome dad, your daughter is lucky to have you.
Angry Snowboarder knows how to handle these situations
Ohh man that sucks dude. I actually have gone there to teach family members. I lost mine in Killington on the last day of my trip.
As a fellow Bergen county resident and dad I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your unfortunate situation. Will check FB and CL for you.
Shit cunt!!! That's all I can say about these shit cunts that prey on ppl with kids, singles or couples. But on single parents they know that they won't be pursued likely... if spotted. And they know you... you don't know them and that they got your gear. Shit cunts! Meth head freak no doubt who will have karma come full circle very soon. Always does. It will be beneficial as that's what it's there for. Karma! Perfection.!!
I bring a heavy duty cable-lock with me every time I go skiing or boarding. Because to put it plainly, people can‚Äôt be trusted.  It won‚Äôt stop everyone but it will stop the grab and go thieves from any easy score.
Riding in Jersey for ya.
Hard to tell if their webcams cover the racks, but maybe they have CCTV that does?  Wicked bummer.
Make a gofund me I‚Äôm in
I mean that sucks but the part where you keep mentioning it was a powder board and who would steal that in jersey.. probably similar people to you? That ride in more than one place throughout the year? Vermont is like 4 hours away and it pisses powder there
Jersey rider here, send me some photos I'll keep a look out
props to the 100 people in here offering a free board
Hope that guy gets into a car accident on the drive home what a jackass.
This is was homeowners/renters insurance is for if you have it file a claim.
Who leaves 2k of stuff lying around!
Do you have insurance?
I'm sorry that happened to you and your little one bro.  I've locked mine up a couple times when I feel the need.  I use one of [these](https://www.matadorequipment.com/products/betalock)

I can usually hook it to a binding on a rail on the stand if it's thin enough, or you can get a little wire they sell as well to loop around larger things.  Hope you find your gear and who took it.
Hate to say it but NJ has a reputation for this in the Northeast
There‚Äôs a good chance your homeowner‚Äôs insurance may cover the theft
Never ever in my whole life have I seen a locked board/ski, been to many countires in europe. Shit maybe its time to take my bike lock with me this year
damn post a pic im in bergen county will keep a look out on fb marketplace etc.
Shitty. This is why I bring my board into the bathroom with me anywhere I go or have a friend watch. I don‚Äôt trust a soul on the mountain. If I need a longer break I take my shit to the truck and chill.
Thanks!  It just opened again this past weekend, but they had like 2 days earlier in the season around Christmas.  

And yes, there is more mud than a swamp
Ditto on this, I'm in monmouth county I'll keep an eye open
Same, I‚Äôm shocked Campgaw is open. I‚Äôm in Passaic co and will keep my eyes peeled. Please share pics!
Dude keep looking. I know it sucks, but I had a board stolen and I kept looking on Craigslist.  Boom 3 weeks later, there it was! I was on of the few to fi d there stolen board, but keep looking
I‚Äôm in the area too! I can lookout. Post pics for sure! Can‚Äôt wait to get my little guy out. Almost two this year but next year I‚Äôm getting him out there to slide around.
Thank you brother. Means the world to me.  As a dad, teaching her snowboarding has been the coolest thing ever. She started at 2 at big snow and we go every week. She is turning, stopping, (sort of) Ollie-ing and most importantly smiling. Seeing her get more confident with every outing is the best feeling there is. I never knew I could like something as much as being out there with my daughter. I‚Äôm not the smartest guy alive, so even if I can pass on whatever little skills I have, I just want her to do better than I can with them.  She is my world and thank you for listening to my rant
And thanks but I have a quiver and I want my setup haha. That‚Äôs truly an amazing offer, tho, and you deserve all the karma. I am floored and feel amazing to even be offered. Keep being good
That‚Äôs a 154

And thank you for the sermon quoted from the Letter of  Prophet Miller to the Degenerates
Love to see this. This is why the snowboarding community is top tier. If his board is too big, I also have a 153 head true twin with some step in bindings not to be confused with step on bindings, old feel but much quicker and easier to get your backfoot in! It's a pretty basic ride, but it slaps for a free ride! I'm in the Hudson Valley
What a G, man. Makes me so happy reading stuff like this, thanks for being a bright spot on the internet.
Airtag idea is smart
Never thought of putting it there. Good idea!

That said, I have been going to Austrian and Swiss alps this past 2 seasons and I‚Äôve seen that I‚Äôm probably the poorest person there so why bother üòÇ
Honestly, I feel for OP but absolutely would not leave something that valuable unlocked.
How did you fit it there? I had to stick mine on the topsheet.

That's a great suggestion. I got step on bindings last year and bought a lock with them. I always lock it now when we go for lunch, but this would be helpful for piece of mind. The cold/dampness doesn't mess with it??
I appreciate that, but I‚Äôm blessed and have a job that pays. 

Do something nice for some random next time you‚Äôre at the mountain.  Just move the good vibes forward.  That‚Äôs basically magic at its finest.
Kind soul
Really nice reading this. Thank you for being kind
Thanks!  If you see anything I‚Äôll send you or whomever a cash reward. It honestly sucks but you guys seriously are making this better

Good thought with Jersey!  Will do. 

Also powder is something that we don‚Äôt get here. We get to spend the cost of a new setup to fly out to see it, then come home and talk crap about Hunter
That‚Äôs it.  The sale price should also be a reminder to everyone to not buy boards the year they come out because you get excited like a kid.  I should have waited.  Holy crap I overpaid. Oh no. Oh no.

May I interest you in a pair of skis and a pocket protector <3
I wish good health to him and his family.
This should be the top comment. None of us wanna hear that, and we should all know better.
A 15$ lock is dead within 30s and a cable cutter‚Ä¶
Damn that is legit trauma right there. Oof.
Oh my god that‚Äôs horrible.  I don‚Äôt even wanna think about it.  Good on you for keeping riding; that stuff causes anger that can last a minute
A lot harder for boots to work. Even same size ski boots brands to brand have different sole lengths. Stealing skis almost always would require a binding remount. No guarantee that it has been recounted already.
No because they‚Äôre too nerdy to steal and even if they did they‚Äôd tell on themselves to ski patrol
Burton deep daze. I have a crappy selfie with it, but it doesn‚Äôt show the channels. It was supposed to funnel the snow out and feel surfy, and is way offset and rockered so you‚Äôre basically floating like Casper the snow ghost. I was very hungry to feel it on proper snow in a few weeks.
Thanks man!  Yeah we went over to the carpet and I she had a good time!  Just had to block her view of the chairs hahahaha
So who‚Äôs got the funniest fill in the blank for this? I almost had a good one; one letter off.
Doo doo in his pee maker?! I agree
Pee pee in hot water. What do I win?
Bro thank you but I don‚Äôt need it.  Like I said to the other person, I got a job and am blessed in that aspect. God help me keep it up.  Anyways, take those vibes and do something cool for some random next time you‚Äôre up, or do some dope shit and post vids for us to watch :)
Yo there are some people in this thread that were trying to give me decks and setups. They have the karma. I‚Äôm screenshotting these comments to show my kid when she gets older. This is the coolest day ever, to see how people would do that for me even when I don‚Äôt need it.  I effin love all you hombres and hombrettes
Someone stole a wheel off my precious bicycle ten years ago when I was a broke student and I'm still kinda mad about it lol. But a wheel isn't even a big deal compared to a whole snowboard, I can't imagine how awful it would feel especially after a month of happy riding. I hope you got an even better board afterwards and that the thief is cursed to catch edges every day for the rest of his life.
I feel like mountain creek deserves its own thread for the crap that goes down there. It‚Äôs a fiesta.
154. Short guy special
Dude it‚Äôs the white whale. I totally get it. Nothing will feel the same. A newer and better board won‚Äôt even do it. It‚Äôs like this core weird part of being human that is like super susceptible to tantrums. It‚Äôs weird how we get attached to stuff.
She‚Äôs the best.  Thanks for the advice and I‚Äôm sorry about your bike. Jerrys abound
This winter also stole something from me. It‚Äôs been whack a doodle
I get so excited whenever I see it mentioned.  Creek picked up where action park left off
CO and former Ramsey checking in. Learned at The Mighty Gaw and spent a ton of time night skiing there as well. Glad you made your way out to some real mountains.

I have a cheap combo lock that I keep in my pocket and it takes almost no time to pop it on and then take it off after. I grew up renting equipment, but once I bought my own gear I just wanted the extra peace of mind.
(I live up here)
In ocean county tho so I‚Äôll keep an eye out on I‚Äôm a daily scroller on fb marketplace and Craigslist
Never been to a base area? Shits laying unattended everywhere.
What's your boot size?  I have a pair of step in flow bindings I was going to give away free to someone (less than 4 years old and less than 10-15 usages)
Also, OP - for future ref.

I have one of those [Crab Grab binding backpacks](https://crabgrab.com/products/binding-bag) on my snowboard.

In it, I have two things:

- A Dakine snowboard lock
- An AirTag

I use the lock every time the board will be out of my sight. It's not going to stop a determined thief, but it'll deter anyone just looking for a quick pickup. The AirTag will  also help track it if you do lose it - and also is handy in the case of travel, where checked bags don't always make it to the right place at the right time.
There‚Äôs somebody in queens on OfferUp selling a ton of different completes, all different sizes. You might want to check. It seemed a little sus with how many and how different they all were, I remember thinking it feels like somebody snatching and grabbing from a mountain
Work in Bergen county and live in Hudson county. Let‚Äôs see that pic and I‚Äôll keep an eye out too.
Jesus, that really sux man, I got an older board with bindings I could give you, I'm in Passaic county, dm me if tour interested.

On another note I have never heard of a 3d printed board? Did you design and print it yourself? How did you put the edges on? Im a maker too, and this interests me greatly . How was for the short time you had it?
And most important, smiling. Keep that up Dad.
Sorry this happened to you, you seem like a very good father.
People really suck, man. Love that you take your daughter boarding though. Hope karma strikes and returns the board to its rightful owner.
Mate I'm sorry that this happened, and it's shit timing for me to ask, but do you have any tips for getting kids in the snow? My first is due ina few days and I can't wait to have a little shredder along side me. 

Hoping you get all your gear back and you two get to ride it off!
Post images and all these details over at r/RBI need to find this fucker
Absolutley‚Ä¶.I love to see the Fam out together‚Ä¶Go Little Grom Go..!!!
+pray for snow..‚ùÑÔ∏è
The only caveat to that is if the air tag knows its traveling with a person with an IOs device it will eventually chime and give its self away. This is the "anti stalking" feature. There are some videos on youtube that show how to disable the speaker permanently, making it a stealth tracker.
It's really not.

It's *piss easy* to find an airtag and disable it.

The features which protect people from being digitally stalked by someone placing an airtag on them are the same reason airtags are pretty trash for theft deterrence.
I always look for a nicer board to put mine next to when going for a piss üòÇ
I agree; it‚Äôs unfortunate and I really should have been better at adulting. 

Seriously that feeling of going to the trunk and seeing the lock you chose not to use is like eating a big pile crap
Eh, go to any serious mountain, there is 1,000,000$ of gear unlocked outside every lodge.
This post is actually quite unsettling... I always found the mountain sports crew to be rather good-faith humans.

Has to be some bad karma attached to stealing people's unlocked equipment at a ski resort
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a locked up board when I‚Äôve gone boarding in Utah. Maybe I‚Äôm just not looking. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So many people in this sub the past few months calling locks stupid
If you lift up the rubber padding it just barely fits right at the 12 o‚Äôclock position on the angle disc. My bindings are size large.
This thread makes me feel better about humanity
Still really sorry this happened. It‚Äôs such a shit feeling. You never stop looking for it. I have a lock and the only reason I didn‚Äôt lock mine is that I has powder all in my gear. Should have taken the moment. I lock every time now.
Renters insurance may cover it.
Always hurts man. It‚Äôs not the money, but the time with the kids. That‚Äôs irreplaceable. I wish the best for you and your family, and I hope the scumbag thief gets what‚Äôs coming to them.
You never stop looking. It‚Äôs the worst feeling.
Thanks buddy!
Awhh shes adorable! But dangerousüëø
Cute kid.   Sorry bout your board.
*> "I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my ~~daughter~~  snowboard  go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you."*
She‚Äôs adorable. Look away for a second and that stealing asswipe gets it with the chair.
I have a three year old daughter and can relate. 
Hope you have a spare board for your planned trip or find it on eBay or something. Fingers crossed.
OP I can tell you are an amazing father. I have always wanted a kids of my own and my super jelly you get to shred with yours. Don't take it for granted! I hope you get your board back. As a new skiier, I had no idea snowboarding equipment was so expensive.
Oh my gosh shes so cute. screw that guy who ruined her (and your) day!
Dirty theif better hope she's not the one that funds them.
As the dad of my own little grom, this makes me so pissed off for you! That thief better watch out. She looks like she wouldn‚Äôt take it easy on them!
She‚Äôs adorable! Sorry about your board, that‚Äôs terrible and taking time away from teaching her to board. But hopefully the upside is spending time with her is still quality time with her.  She‚Äôll have happy memories regardless on the mountain or not!
Nice board.  I will keep an eye out for it.  Pocono local so if it shows up around here for sale I can ping ya.  What size is it?
Will keep an eye out. Do you have any identifying stickers on it by any chance?
Just set notifications for this board and this area on FB marketplace. Hopefully whoever took it incriminates himself and I will reach out if I see it!
Camelback OG and 30 day a year skiier here.  If I see that mofo out here I will let you know.  Sorry that happened bro.  That board is super easy to spot, no one at CBK is on a deep daze.
Out in Hunter as we speak and headed to Vermont next week - hard board to miss. Coming right back to this thread if spotted. Goodluck OP and thanks for being a cool Dad and good human!
link the image in the main post, I had to scroll a bit to find this!
God this is so accurate you can't even laugh.
Never regret that. Tomorrow isn‚Äôt a guarantee, better to spend some numbers and make some memories.
FYI the 3D in the description doesn't mean 3D printed; rather it is a reference to the shape of the base. 

That said, totally sucks what happened. Some people are such losers.
Sounds like the same shit when I was in middle school some 30 years and everyone was bagging on people wearing helmets. Now you‚Äôre looked at funny for not wearing one LOL
I don‚Äôt have another $1k to replace it all. Lock it up.
Lololoo. Seriously you gonna get a lock? I get the most stares at nice spots. Jackson hole, vale, etc. fuck that I still lock it up.
Skikey locks can't be cut with a cable cutter and no one is walking around with cable cutters on the mountain. Furthermore, a thief will take the easiest target first so locking up your board works great when most don't lock theirs
But they likely won't bother and will just get one of the hundreds of boards that are not locked up instead.

Thanks! They were able to get me a much cheaper replacement and I think my guilt is the reason I rode that thing until I finally bought a new one two years ago lol.

And good on you for introducing your daughter to the sport and creating some lasting memories! I have a girl about the same age and she's starting to express an interest, I'm excited to get her out there.
Demo bindings are pretty common on skis and can easily be adjusted. Though it would take more time to do that vs. strapping the wrong snowboard in.
Nerdy skier here in PA who will also keep my eyes peeled on FB marketplace and when I'm out and about, telling on myself to ski patrol ;)
Ahahahaha
oh I thought you printed your own with a 3d printer haha
You're a great dad for making sure the kid had a solid day, even with shitty people out there.
what was going on at the chairs? Or so she wouldn't want to go up?
Will do. Take care.
There are some wonderful people out there that give me hope for the future. üëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüèÇüèÇüèÇüèÇ
I would argue a wheel would be more frustrating. I bike in nyc and if I got stranded at work and had to walk my frame home that would be a mesmerisingly bad day
Okay thank you. And I‚Äôm super sorry this happened. But I will do what I can to help
lol this sounds like a meal. Hope you find it üëçüèª
Ah it‚Äôs all good. I eventually bought another one lol
I was an instructor there for a few years. Good times. Miss snow every day.
I‚Äôve been there many times. 

What does this have to do with me not leaving 2k worth of gear lying around?
Honestly, it will stop pretty much any thief because most people don‚Äôt lock their stuff so if they see yours is locked they won‚Äôt even bother and just snag one of the hundreds that aren‚Äôt
TagVault - The Ultra-Secure... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1P475Y6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

I use one of these and have it secured on my bindings. I also got the 3M sticky version but it was to noticeable and easy to remove. This one requires a tad bit more effort.
Skier, not boarder, but we have the same issues. The moment I purchased a decent set of skis was the moment I bought a $15 lock to secure them. It doesn‚Äôt need to be bulletproof, but these are crimes of ease and opportunity. It doesn‚Äôt take much to keep the shitheads who do this walking past your gear.
How do you attach the AirTag to your board? Is there any trick other than to clip it to the binding, where a thief can notice it and just unclip it?
That's the coolest bag I've ever seen.
Yes you need to disable this function. I have ruined a few to get one working correctly but it was worth it in my opinion. I like being able to track my snowboard bag as well since I‚Äôm always jamming about 4k worth of gear into it.
I mean 1. It's better than nothing and 2. Do you think that pisspoor excuse for a human being has high changes of checking for airtags and other things on a board? If your board is 1 of 20 sitting idly at a resort, any means of securing it might put a thief off and make him go for the next, hassle-free one.

Someone stealing a board probably doesn‚Äôt even know how to mount bindings or remove them. They aren‚Äôt going to find the AirTag.
I‚Äôm sorry your and your kids day got ruined by some dickhead. Hope you‚Äôre able to recover it!
Well sucks but be sure to file reports & post pictures It's a small world. I mean people found two cell phones that fell out of the Alaskan Airlines plane, and the missing plane panel. Here stolen cars are recovered daily.

And I had my flipping bindings stolen (you know your board is crap when they remove bindings so they leave it!) Locked, at a mid mountain lodge FFS. Don't beat yourself up too bad, you don't want to further put bad taste in her mouth about snowboarding.
Agreed. Around here there two types of thief, the dude riding an ancient pile of junk wanting a free upgrade, and the guys that show up just to swipe a few items and leave quick. I hate them both equally
Will have to check that. What discs are you using? I have Burton Genesis and Cartel 4x4 with straps.
I had my BMX bike stolen when I was 13. I'm 50 and I still think about it. It's a horrible feeling.
Dude they‚Äôre amazing at this age. Seriously, it‚Äôs like she goes to Disney land every time we‚Äôre at big snow. It‚Äôs so cool and adds such perspective. Especially as some crusty 30 something out on the ice coast who usually just complains.
Thank you. Seriously :)

wow didn't expect this density of wisdom here. All we have is today.
I have one. That I looked at, said ‚Äúnah f it,‚Äù and then looked at again with sad eyes 4 hours later.
I see your point. In Austria and Switzerland I‚Äòve never seen a skikey compatible stand though. 
I used to carry a leatherman like tool - that would probably do for the typical cable lock.
But yes. You‚Äôre right. I lock my board too.
Depends on if they want to sell or use for themselves. But I see your point
Demo bindings are uncommon by default, they are much heavier and generally only on used rentals or demos.
This is the way
‚ÄòYou wouldn‚Äôt download a snowboard‚Äô‚Ä¶.

Yet‚Ä¶.
For sure. Only reason I'd imagine it wouldn't stop someone is if said thief had a vendetta against you... Maybe you rode too close to their kid, or dropped a glove in front of them, or some other egregious offense.

If he has a smartphone, it will notify him that there is an unknown airtag with him.
Ok, it's better than nothing, but why spend the money on an AirTag when Apple has plenty of competitors whose products are actually suited for the application you want to use them for? Tile is just one type of Object Locator available and is more suitable for anti-theft tracking than AirTag.
Anywhere that I go and don‚Äôt use a lock I would expect this to happen ‚Ä¶.Which is very sad actually what a time we live in! 

‚Äú Hope for the best prepare for the worst‚Äù my friend you are a great dad giving her great experiences!
That's a number of poor assumptions based on nothing lol.

Go to any cycle commuting forum and ask how effective air tags are as a theft deterrence.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm not sure to be honest whatever came with my step ons. I‚Äôve been switching back and forth between a pair of old switch team n bindings and the step ons. The boots are more comfortable with step ons but my switch step ins are half the weight and I can get a full 540 around on flat ground where as the step ons I can barely get to 360. The switch bindings are a much better mechanism and easier to get in and out of but it‚Äôs hard to find boots and even when you get a newish pair there still is a lot left to be desired in the comfort department.
I absolutely feel that! I‚Äôm
I‚Äòll have to see how I get mine on a snowboard. No daytrips for us (next proper area is a 7-8hr drive so trips are full weeks) and I‚Äòd be alone with her, so no riding for me.
;(
Here most racks are ski key compatible. I'll remember to bring a different lock if I ever rode outside of America!
I‚Äôve never seen that before. Looks awesome and will check it out 

Thanks
Use a cable lock then that is what I do. Yeah someone can cut it but it makes it less attractive when your board is locked and ones around it are not. If someone wants to steal something there is very little you can do to stop them. You can really only deter them. If they want it they will find a way to take it
Yeah I‚Äôm aware but someone who steals a board probably won‚Äôt know how to take the bindings off to get to the AirTag.
540. yeah ok. üòÇ
I‚Äòve been putting off to learn switch riding for a few years now. 
Will check out that AirTag hiding spot though. Thanks
Get a riglet. You can pull them around on grass and stuff. And I‚Äôll give a free lesson if you‚Äôre around the city
For sure! Just edited, added a couple other solutions too.
It‚Äôs cool, but make sure it fits around your binding back snugly. I had one for about 3 months of riding and it keep popping off until the strap tore. Luckily I didn‚Äôt lose it
I agree.

A cable lock is infinitely more effective than an AirTag. Especially a hidden one.

You want to deter thieves from even trying, you don't wanna spend half your boarding weekend chasing down some thief on your phone GPS and then waiting for the cops to show up but they never do.

You want your board to *never* get stolen in the first place.
Haha. I‚Äòm from around Berlin üòâ cheers for the offer though!
No one's suggesting an air tag in lieu of a lock
I think Dubai has an indoor place if you‚Äôre into that kind of stuff
Seems that there is an indoor snowcenter in Wittenberg. Might be an option, if she can handle the 2h drive without getting grumpy. Probably not the nicest place (also without mountains), but might be enough to learn some basics. 

And have some fun while doing this/afterwards. 

I've learned the basics in Landgraaf. And I was positively surprised about the two small learning pistes. In the evenings I had that partially to my own. 
Might not be exactly the same in the small German ones, but if you manage to go outside of the winter season, this might work out quite well.
Do you realize Dubai is a 6hr flight from Berlin? ü§£
Learn from my mistakes, the Honey Badger and Trash Panda suck
Let‚Äôs start with the Trash Panda. It‚Äôs loud on everything I‚Äôve tried it on (308 bolt and gas gun, 6.5 creed bolt gun, 5.56 and 300blk ARs). The FRP on subsonic 300blk (all the rounds in this video are subsonic btw) is legitimately loud enough to be painful to the shooter and bystanders. Subsequent rounds are somewhat quieter, but if you‚Äôre just shooting one round, like if you‚Äôre hunting, it‚Äôs loud enough that I‚Äôd wear foamies or over-ear protection. 

Gas stack is also a real issue with this silencer & host combo, whether you‚Äôre shooting supers or subs it starts spitting gas back at you within a few rounds. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just adjust the adjustable gas block to tune the gun?‚Äù Great question. The geniuses at Q decided that I shouldn‚Äôt be able to do that, so they installed the gas block [so canted it is gauging the inside of the handguard.](https://postimg.cc/qgsR0y70) This is the kind of flaw I‚Äôd expect on a $300 BCA, not on a $3000 gucci gun. I guess we can assume the Q doesn‚Äôt stand for quality control.

Your money would be way better spent on an Anthem S2, ODB or Hyperion and home-brew 300blk AR15 than this piece of junk. Wish I hadn‚Äôt spent $4200 on this setup but hopefully someone on here can learn from my mistakes. 
But every time I‚Äôve said the Honey Badger sucks dick in here, the Kevin nut huggers and his Down syndrome employees always come in and sing his praises on some dweeb shit. 

I say this as a previous owner, avoid this bogus ass gun like the plague. It‚Äôs not worth 1,500 let alone 3 bands. Unless you‚Äôre a fanboy or collector of expensive bullshit, this gun isn‚Äôt worth a fuck.
Q's one of those companies I always tell people to avoid. Looks like you learned the hard way.
>  **$4200**

Insert Kevin Brittingham copypasta
>Q products suck

This just in, the sky is blue, water is wet and grass is green. More news at 8.
As much as I love the look of the Honey Badger, I will never be able to justify buying one. I have my home built .300 blackout look alike and a Griffin can coming soon so it‚Äôs close enough, for a fraction of the cash
Side note, I‚Äôve tried Callaway ballistics, Discreet ballistics, S&B, Hornady Black, and American Eagle 300blk subs and they‚Äôre all gassy. S&B was by far the worst and Callaway was the best though
[Looking at this post after that same exact setup was what I was gonna go with but instead got a Sig Spear and a Jolene.](https://i.imgur.com/kPqvjqP.png)
Yeah I never fell for that Q crap luckily. If I want a good gun I‚Äôll stick with actual NATO contract manufacturers *cough* H&K *cough* FN *cough* Sig
 But but but James Reeves can't get Kevin's dick out of his mouth, Q or Die something something "better than everyone else cause I said so."
What am I looking at?
Q just wants you to do everything the way Q does it. They don‚Äôt leave any adjustability or tolerance for other people‚Äôs preferences or ways of doing things.
Well, that sucks got a trash panda in jail right now, so it doesn't really make me feel good, haha. Luckily not going on a Gucci rifle, so it will be a less expensive lesson for me than it was for you. Sorry man
Hmmm welp.. I went to the burger joint everyone recommended yesterday . It was my least favorite burger from recent memory. I told my co workers my opinion after lunch and was immediately told I may not have good taste and should stick to burger King. I was an assistant kitchen manager and sous chef for 5 years lmao. People have different opinions and experiences.
Yeesh. My Omega 300 is quieter than that with subs and that is some pretty old tech compared to a lot of stuff on the market now.
Obligatory Fuck Q and Fuck Kevin

Did you contact Q‚Äôs customer service about the canted gas block?
It‚Äôs in the name ü•∏
I don‚Äôt blame you. It‚Äôs all marketing. People still buy LaRue and Geissele for match guns when White Oak sells better stuff for less.
Surefire and huxwrx my guy that‚Äôs the play.
I HAVE AN INSATIABLE KEVIN BRITTINGHAM FETISH
Mf gassed on point tho
My buddy has the Q Fix in 6.5CM.  I shot it, I absolutely hate it. So small, so light it kicks like a mule.  Kept knocking my right ear protection off my ear.  Not fun to shoot.  If you are walking through the woods hiking for days on end and want something light that can take down a bear, maybe it‚Äôs the gun for you.  But for 1/3 of the cost, I‚Äôd carry my Magnum 500
My Reddit self muted after the first shot and I thought you legit had the quietest can ever after that first round pop
Damn. I have an Aero 300BLK with a Omega 300 can and its probably 25% this loud. Thank god i never bought Q
People always defend low performance high cost things they spent too much on. I love hearing Q get shit on but I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.¬†
I have a honey badger upper kit that I assembled myself and I have no issue adjusting my gas block at all. I can‚Äôt speak for the trash panda but I have a Thunder chicken and yes there‚Äôs a tiny bit of frp but it‚Äôs insanely quiet. No gas to the face at all. I don‚Äôt shoot supers so I‚Äôm tuned for subs only. It‚Äôs probably my favorite gun I have and everyone who has seen it shot it says it‚Äôs the quietest gun they‚Äôve ever heard. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to expect a short can like the panda to get you super quiet if that‚Äôs your goal for the host.
Q kinda sucks in general
I'm glad I read this. ADM it is.
https://preview.redd.it/qedjprcwocsc1.jpeg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f750f30de15a989373413033f8a2ce5732f940b
My honey badger is quiet as fuck with that combo‚Ä¶.
I just don't know why that tripod has to be involved in all this drama
**I have an insatiable Kevin Brittingham fetish.**

¬†It is my ultimate fantasy to be gagged, tied up, and brutally assfucked by Kevin Brittingham. I have accrued tens of thousands in debt attempting to fill this void with sexual 'toys,' including several custom, unregistered form 1 silencer dildos and a balding Kevin-shaped real doll with a tramp stamp that reads "Take My Bepsi Challenge" in Chinese characters. I have had my face made love to by hundreds of balding, bearded, gen Xers, but not one of them could make me climax. Only Kevin is capable of giving me that release.

The wife and I are separated, and have accepted the fact that I will never see my kids again. The only thing keeping Karen from divorcing me is the fear that she might be the final push into a deep. inescapable abyss, at the bottom of which lies my death.

The truth is, our marriage died nine years ago on the night I met the love of my life. While browsing Instagram I saw Kevin's inconsistent welds and became rock hard, collapsing in the shower and sobbing at the realization that Kevin would never, could never, pin me down with his perfectly smooth body and stubby arms, penetrate me with his incredible shallow girth and empty his huge, aching balls deep inside my tummy. I sat there all night, sometimes weeping, sometimes ramming my flaccid dick into the shower drain in frustration.

It has been nine years since that night. I have nothing now. I have accepted that. My apartment is a squalid den of inescapable despair, filled with jizz-stained 300 blackout shells and tormented notes etched onto lewd posters of the trash panda. I spend my days printing out screenshots of his forum posts and crying. My only friends are the roaches.
Honestly I have seen a couple of these cans in action and I totally agree not the best sound suppression
I mean if anything it looks like you are undergassed there, so the AGB likely won‚Äôt help (not to mention adjusting gas cannot completely remove gas stacking).
Well it atleast has a better ejection pattern than my DD M4A1 with Griffin M4SD-K
Just to add my 2 cents but I have a sugar weasel with a ventum 7.62 can. I‚Äôm a lefty so flow thru is more important to me than the quietest setup. I think it‚Äôs quiet enough and the gun runs and groups great.

The only real advantage I see to Q is the 1:5 twist on the barrel. If you can source that twist rate on your own build then you‚Äôre gtg.
I had a .300blk sugar weasel and the barrel was blown within 1000 rounds , sent it in and all he said was he ‚Äúcleaned it and it‚Äôs the most accurate sbr he‚Äôs ever shot‚Äù 

He doesn‚Äôt know I marked the barrel but before sending it and my mark was moved. Weird cleaning strategy if you ask me
Im sorry you had to spend $4200 to figure out that Q is a junky hypebeast brand. Kevin B might be one of the most unlikable persons on the planet. He is so fucking pretencious it blows my mind. Just the naming schemes alone were enough to keep me away, not to mention the almost comical pricetags
I‚Äôm baffled. Every single 300BO gun I‚Äôve built has a NON adjustable block and they aren‚Äôt gassy. At least not compared to a suppressed 5.56.
Sorry to hear this. I tell customers that the gun isn't worth it all the time. I've heard to many sad stories about it. It's amazing it still has this cult link following
Unpopular opinion but they look as bad as they‚Äôre made and perform
Q products suck?

Shocker
All their stuff is hot garbagio
Never messed with a badger but I enjoy the panda very much with 300blk
Sugar weasel and trash panda with 300 subs is very quiet on my setup
My omega 9k on a 6 inch 300 barrel is quieter than this lmao
Thanks I was just looking to buy one. Nevermind now lol
Wow that FRP is bad
And I was just regretting my ddm4 pdw today. Looks like I made the right choice
Bought a mini fix a few years ago‚Ä¶ total hot garbage. Didn‚Äôt hit factory primers hard enough to send the round. Contacted Q to get my money back. They surprisingly agreed - only to find out that was because they had a recall set up for the mini fix to be announced like 2 weeks later. They‚Äôre a total hype beast company based on social media bull shit and looking cool. They‚Äôre the absolute last company I‚Äôll ever buy from again
Anything Q generally is over hyped garbage
Dude's entire career is a laundry list of failures.¬† AAC Prodigy, AAC SCAR-HD, AAC rachet mounts, Sig taper lock, every Q product.


Was just talking to a friend last night about how the guy is a marketing genius. Every product is trash, but he's still selling stuff.
How is the gas block canted? There's a pin on the barrel it's supposed to index on. Is the handguard tight? I'd suspect that tiny turnbuckle before anything else, then maybe QC on the gas block/barrel/index pins. If something is twisted, the gas tube is twisted, and you're having to run way more gas to get the action to cycle, which makes everything way louder than necessary. Can you not see/reach the gas adjustment screw through the handguard cutout? A picture from that angle would be useful. I'd have already taken the handguard off to figure out what's going on.
I'm not saying to take it apart. If you do, cool, because I'm curious, and you should do it on video. But I'd talk to customer service first. Maybe send it back to them to look it over. I don't really care if a company leaves a bad taste in my mouth with an initial problem, or anyone else's problem, it's how they handle my case. I may or may not buy anything else from them, but they're on the hook for this one until I sell it, or the warranty no longer applies.
Well, I'm sorry that it cost you that much for such a meh rifle. Although I wouldn't be surprised if this gasblock problem might be the root of everything or just a problem you can see and a bunch other that you can't. For that money, I'd 100% send it in the them and see if there weren't more fuckups going on that caused this. I don't hold Q to some special standard or anything, but it should be better than that.

On the suppresor... to me their considered old tech. Maybe dope in 2010, very meh in today's market with so many different offerings.
Try the nomad L mines stupid quiet
The People's post.
[Me with BCM guts in an Aero upper set and a Sandman S shooting the shittiest Ammo Inc bulk possible:](https://i.imgur.com/zlnXPDH.jpeg) 

In all seriousness, sorry OP. Kevin's misogyny and misplaced arrogance aside, I have also been thoroughly unimpressed by the products. Dude I took Haley D3 Carbine course with back in '22 had this exact same combo. The gun quite literally wouldn't cycle properly or hold zero even after we did a quick n dirty zero confirm with his optic on another gun. He gave up and brought a different stick for the next two days.
I built a Honey Badger from Aero parts and I love it, was less than 1/2 the price. Put a Deadair Nomad Ti on it and it‚Äôs deliciously quiet.
I like my hb and tp. Ive owned both since 2019
I don‚Äôt m ow how you‚Äôre having these problems, I run a trash panda on all my guns and it‚Äôs pretty damn quiet. Pretty good on my 5.56 and .30-30 and awesome on Mini fix. Cherry bomb makes switching it from gun to gun super easy.
I mean yeah what do you expect from a company that literally does bro vet posts on reddit and tells customers to stfu lol

That first round pop is wild. Have you tried it on subs through a bolt gun? I see you've tried .308 and 6.5 and I can't help but wonder how much better it would sound with a subsonic projectile and no port pop.

In general I've always been skeptical of the honey badger. No it's not technically an AR and it's light weight and an AR can't be as light and blah blah blah brittingham BS. It just doesn't seem like the juice is worth the $3000 squeeze, just build an AR with an adjustable gas system that you like. That really sucks to see that you got a factory dud that you can't adjust. Q is very much a textbook case of personality being the whole marketing approach with basically zero real world advantages.
Have you tried any other cans on it?
I hear their 22lr suppressor is good though.
I have often pondered getting one, but have yet to do so...I see a lot of hate in the comments, but do not know why. Is this the opinion of a few or a majority?
Wow, that thing is loud, my cheap ass 300 blk BCA upper on an Anderson lower w/ a now defunct Rebel Silencer Hunter 30.
All in, 950.00 bucks including the stamp.
https://youtu.be/A07PAPfrVr0?si=edxzf2HWHhzJv4m5
Old farts have to stretch the dollar, so we research stuff instead of follow the Gucci crowd.
looks like it's barely running too. with a can on there you should be throwing brass pretty forward unless that's subsonic you are shooting
ROASTED
How does Q‚Äôs ‚Äúbest trigger ever made‚Äù compare/feel in comparison to a Geissele or LaRue?
The gas block is canted?
Why not just e-mail Q and inquire about the canted gas block instead of making a reddit dipshit post?
What?  An overhyped product by a narcissistic asshole is actually garbage?  I am shocked. Shocked!  Well, not that shocked.
Buying anything from Q is wild. I can‚Äôt think of a bigger scumbag in the gun industry than Kevin B
Fuck Q! They are trash!
Damn. That sucks. I never understood all the Q hype. Always thought that shit was overpriced for no reason.
Not sure what the disconnect is on your experience but my Trash Panda is definitely quieter than any silencer its size on 300blk.
I have a Sugar Weasel whit a Thunderchicken and it‚Äôs awesome. In fact it has performed perfectly. Zero issues. Eats majority of the ammo I‚Äôve put through it. Never had to adjust the gas block. I‚Äôd bet my life on it. Sucks to keep reading this stuff. On the flip side my dad bought one at the same time and we had to spend a lot of time dialing in the gas block. Even with the gas block dialed in, his is still picky about the ammo it uses.
blown 2 endcaps off of my HB... Pretty sure it's due to pressure and not endcap strikes...
It makes me sad that people spend that much money on Q products, you could have gotten any god tier AR out there.  Why did you buy it in the first place? Marketing?
Q is trash in general.
SIG MCX Rattler.
As much as the Q guns suck, their business practices are even worse
Quick question, is it any fun shooting from a tall tripod like that? I always thought those were for people that are pretty much going for actual stationary precision and like hunters?
Honestly not that far off from my r/hyperion_rattler_saga  experience at least yours cycles subs
Subs from my 8.5 psa 300blk with a 36m in long configuration is really quiet.ü§™
My 300BLK JAKL and enticer s are, how you say, "chefs kiss" üëå
BCA upper + Aero AGB. Value menu of ARs.
Can you sell the gun at least?
I paid almost 5k for a rifle I had wanted for a very long time. It's a hard pill to swallow sometimes and I try not to think about what else I could have gotten for 5k that would have been better suited for me. And now I'm restocking it because it's just not working for me as it came from the factory. And I'll probably swap out the factory muzzle brake for something with no anti muzzle rise ports. The buttpad was swapped out. 

Make mistakes you learn from > repeat mistakes you don't learn from.
I really want a honeybadger, but definitely not with that can, and only because it was my childhood love in a ton of videogames
*sort by controversial*
Like I‚Äôve said a bunch of times, got my LMT Defender and put an LMT 10.5‚Äù upper (plus stamp) and sold all my fancy crap. The thing just runs and is soft and smooth to shoot. Oh yeah it‚Äôs got the regular semi auto carrier.
I think FRP is going to have to have its own Suppression rating, because people are neglecting it,
MY MINI FIX SD AND HONEYBADGER SD IS QUIET, I WON‚ÄôT SPEND THE TYPE OF MONEY I PAID ON THEM AGAIN THOUGH , RATHER SAVE FOR FULL AUTOS.
And you using supersonic or subsonic rounds?
But bro!! The Pepsi challenge!!! BLLLLLAAARRRRRRGGHHHHHH
How do we feel about "The Fix" 

I understand that there are much cheaper bolt guns out there. However, there are much more expensive bolt guns in this current trend of bolt guns.

I bought a .308 Fix last summer, ran it with an Omega 300 and loved using it to harvest 2 bucks during this past deer season.

Currently have it as a 12 inch 8.6 BLK and am having a lot of fun with it.

  
Did not pay anything close to full retail for the gun nor the parts to convert to 8.6 BTW
Where's the Kevin Brittingham copypasta?
I mean, I built my own for ~1k, and I like mine more. It's essentially $300 worth of cerakote away from looking identical. ¬Ø‚Å†\‚Å†_‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†_‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø
You can build a better gun for 1k less or more. Honestly. I mean they look alright but that‚Äôs about it. 1200$ gun will do this or even better
Q is the Hublot of the gun world
Literally sent my mini fix bolt back twice and still have light primer strikes. One of there reps at the NRA show said yeah it‚Äôs a problem. Now my mini fix bolt throw sucks and isn‚Äôt reliable enough to hunt with.
Yup Q even commented on our channel trying to defend themself. Invited us out so we could do a video and talk with engineers and then never followed through. Needless to say to say their stuff is overpriced big time for what you‚Äôre getting. But people want to justify their expensive purchases
"Q" and the retard behind the brand are a cancer to the gun community. Of course they suck
OP's "canted gas block" is another lie/fabrication.. originally the guns didn't come with a witness hole. OP lacks any laser engraved firing markings, has a polished Q/D socket and FDE strike dust cover. **This tells me that the gun an earlier honey badger with no witness hole. NOTHING IS CANTED. SEE MANUAL BELOW. This issue was fixed years ago and OP didn't get the memo.**

  
[Anyone who gets a post 2019 Q Honey Badger will have this witness hole to easily change the gas in a few seconds. ](https://imgur.com/XQdX5am)

 OP are you aware that the late 16-2019's with that same polished QD socket DO NOT HAVE A WINDOW FOR THE GAS BLOCK?? You'd need to update the handguard to the new one to avoid removing it to adjust the gas.  **\*\*\*Did you read the manual?!?!\*\*\***

>Per Q Manual:  
*NEWER* HONEY BADGERS HAVE A WINDOW ON THE HANDGUARD TO ACCESS THE GAS BLOCK. **IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER HONEY BADGER (EARLY 2019-ISH), YOU MAY HAVE TO REMOVE YOUR HANDGUARD AND SILENCER TO ADJUST THE GAS BLOCK. MISTAKES WERE MADE...**
That's a 2018 Honey Badger without a witness hole for gas adjustment. It's not a canted gas block there is nothing wrong besides the fact you need to remove the handguard with a quarter inch wrench to adjust the gas. [https://imgur.com/CL8zaVQ](https://imgur.com/CL8zaVQ)

This issue was fixed years ago.. surprised you didn't even know this.
Not sure where are you guys are coming from hacking this gun down. Super late, super compact, super powerful and very accurate. Frankly, in some blast. It's not loud unless you have an apply the suppressor correctly. There's a lot coming out of a 300 blackout boys and girls. And the suppressor is too loud, put a little silicone in there. Beat the hell out of water doesn't corrode, doesn't come up, doesn't attract dirt synthetic.
This gun can handle a lot around very quickly. Mari complaint, is the pistol adjusted grip doesn't have length adjust.
The trash panda is a K style can. If you wanted optimal performance, you chose the wrong product for the quitest can ever. The honey badger is great if you like uncomfortable stocks, so you also chose the wrong product. Not everything they make is a banger. However, I love my Q products, a Fix in 8.6 blk and .308, thunderchicken, and El Camino.
You literally described the results from any can out there. 

Supers through short barrels always suck. Subs and supers will always have first round pop, and then subsequent shots are quieter because science.
I can‚Äôt stand anything Q, owner is a pos!
Their cans are OK at best and north worth their sticker. Their rifles are overhyped from my experience. The ghetto blaster is superior and very similar. In my opinion, pistons are da way if you wanna suppress
Well, they did put ‚Äútrash‚Äù in the name s/ Thanks for your post man, I‚Äôll make sure to avoid Q cans.
The good news is you can always sell it to an unsuspecting buyer
[deleted]
I honestly think the Daniel defense pdw is. Egged than the honey badger or sugar weasel
I have both the sugar weasel 16 inch 556 and the HB. The sugar weasel is a nice gun. Very light and reliable. Although I did change the factory bolt. The honey Badger after waiting over a year for the stamp it‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs cracked up to be. Running unsupressed is not reliable. The stock is jinky and stiff.
What 300blk pistol should I get instead of the sugar weasel
Yeah no point getting on of these when maxim defense exists
I got a pair of El Caminos for cheap. I really like them, but they‚Äôre pretty much the only Q I‚Äôll own.
In my opinion not worth the price. If it was full ambi and the stock was better then maybe. The qc is dodgy as well
I miss when the Honey Badger was actually a decent gun, back in like 2012.

I don't know what the hell happened with the Honey Badger, maybe they made some terrible changes with the new models, but it went from being a cool and fairly quiet gun, to being genuinely one of the worst suppressor hosts other than a direct blowback PCC.
Hey aero came out with the clear anodized parts and the sniper grey so you could make your own. I brought all sniper grey parts separately had an Anderson black lower that‚Äôs SBR‚Äôs got a ballistic advantage 8.3 barrel,  a raptor suppressed charging handle, spikes tactical nickel baron BCG put a Silencerco Muzzle break on it  and Lahar30k and my little version of a quiet Q that not spitting gas in my face
Atleast they are trying to innovative
If you wear ear pro while hunting with a can, I don‚Äôt trust your opinion
I have the Sugar Weasel .300blk and a Mini Fix. Had a Honey Badger and sold it because I couldn‚Äôt stand the cheek weld. I like most of Q stuff including Thunder Chicken silencer but I agree.. everything they offer is insanely overpriced. But I‚Äôll never tell anyone who to spend their money
So what other options do we have for a 300blk piston pdw system like this, sig canebrake and brn180?
TP is good but you do you
Why would you buy a honey badger when the boombox is going to be in the next few months
Damn. Came out the gate swinging. I like it.
Same. Downvotes galore for speaking the truth about Qs questionable quality, outdated designs, and overpriced mediocrity.
Hey now that's an insult to folks with Downs syndrome, even they know better than to kneel to some dude like he's god.
If I want a Honey Badger I'll get a 300BLK Blackout Defense DTL in similar colors AND save money lol.
Yeah fuck Q, Kevin is a cock sucker and their products are trash!
Yea, I learned my lesson many years ago. My first suppressor was the Trash Panda, and since then, I have bought so many others that it hardly leaves the safe. YHM less than half the price and better sound signature.
Preach brother, he can develop a round quite well I'll give him that. Everything else he does is just marketing to brain dead tardos with more money then sense or taste.
Yeah I just used my HB SD for the first time last week and was not impressed. What a waste of $4k.
I like the concept. Built a ‚Äúclone‚Äù using an mob arc stock. Personally I think the guys at mvb built the better system as far as collapsible stocks go. A bit on the heavy side but whatever, it can use a standard carrier and you can adjust buffer weight too.
Amen, brother.
Honestly I like my frankensteins. I wait til sales happen and I buy parts. Never had better functioning pieces than bargain parts. LOL
Enlighten me on this, what makes the honey badger so bad? Like I can't see what's wrong with it in the video
It do be looking cool as fuck though
That's an expensive lesson.
I mainly avoid because of the $$$, just don't see the payoff for an extra ~$1k for any model I can get otherwise. I've also never been hands on or shot any product, so my opinion is from afar.

I'm genuinely curious some of your reasonings to avoid?
Wow.  Interesting.  My nomad ti with e brake sounds like a pellet gun.  Even supers sound good

But the peanut butter cerakote üò©
The owner seems like a dick and 95% of the shit I've seen on here tells me he'd screw you for a slice of cheese.
Because?
Their Fix is the best option for 8.6 at the moment, but it‚Äôs such a niche round that it‚Äôs not really worth it
It hurts me to think about it, trust me
It's because OP didn't use Gorilla Ammo. Paying 30% more per bullet makes up the difference.
**I have an insatiable Kevin Brittingham fetish.**

¬†It is my ultimate fantasy to be gagged, tied up, and brutally assfucked by Kevin Brittingham. I have accrued tens of thousands in debt attempting to fill this void with sexual 'toys,' including several custom, unregistered form 1 silencer dildos and a balding Kevin-shaped real doll with a tramp stamp that reads "Take My Bepsi Challenge" in Chinese characters. I have had my face made love to by hundreds of balding, bearded, gen Xers, but not one of them could make me climax. Only Kevin is capable of giving me that release.

The wife and I are separated, and have accepted the fact that I will never see my kids again. The only thing keeping Karen from divorcing me is the fear that she might be the final push into a deep. inescapable abyss, at the bottom of which lies my death.

The truth is, our marriage died nine years ago on the night I met the love of my life. While browsing Instagram I saw Kevin's inconsistent welds and became rock hard, collapsing in the shower and sobbing at the realization that Kevin would never, could never, pin me down with his perfectly smooth body and stubby arms, penetrate me with his incredible shallow girth and empty his huge, aching balls deep inside my tummy. I sat there all night, sometimes weeping, sometimes ramming my flaccid dick into the shower drain in frustration.

It has been nine years since that night. I have nothing now. I have accepted that. My apartment is a squalid den of inescapable despair, filled with jizz-stained 300 blackout shells and tormented notes etched onto lewd posters of the trash panda. I spend my days printing out screenshots of his forum posts and crying. My only friends are the roaches.

Callaway runs great but the gassing has been a little inconsistent/weak for me on 300BLK. For example if most run well with an H1, I‚Äôve had to go to an H with Callaway rounds. Not a huge deal but worth noting.
I chuckled, take my upvote.
I like Kevin and Q but the only thing I own from them is a Mini Fix in 300 blk (which I do indeed love although I‚Äôve never done a video about it). I will allow Kevin to come on my program and talk shit about other brands just as other brands are welcome to come on my program and talk shit about Kevin. I‚Äôm glad to make the video for either. In other words, Kevin explaining why Q is better than Y is not James adopting the opinion that Q is better than Y. As an example, I said on my video about the MCX Rattler LT recently, it‚Äôs my choice for this very narrow field of 300 BLK PDWs. 

Q is not an advertiser, and does not pay me (because I‚Äôd get fired) or the company that owns me. My compensation for filming with Q was a plane ticket and a *shared* hotel room in Portsmouth with my camera bro, Ryan. Q gave me the aforementioned Mini Fix for appearing on the Q podcast, but that was after my Q content (which Q content did not contain my opinions, anyways) was filmed.

I‚Äôm extremely transparent about the content I create and the relationships that I have with the people I create content with. My trip to Q was the first time meeting Kevin in person (or otherwise). I would say I'm sorry if my videos make you angry, but I admit that I get some enjoyment from people getting angry about videos on the internet because it‚Äôs simply something not worth getting this riled up about.

Thanks for the tag /u/phraoahactual

ETA I am not conceding or denying the grievances OP has here. I‚Äôm generally impressed with Qs engineering and QC but I have no reason to doubt OP either.
Bc he did one video in a hot tub?  Doesn‚Äôt shill for them at all, he got more excited for beretta B&T etc.
James Reeves is an industry stooge
[deleted]
I have a trash panda as well.  I haven't heard first round pop like OP mentions.
I have one and it's great on my 300blk and 556. No complaints.
Buddy don‚Äôt worry you will love your TP, I have one and use it on multiple calibers and it does its job very well !
dont worry about it, they sound great on 300blk and 556. No clue why folks compain about it being loud, it sounds great to my ears for a 30 cal can. 

There are newer designs out that obviously learned over the years but it holds up fantastically
I have a TP I use on a 7.5 300blk and it has a little FRP but nothing alarming. It is super light and I have had zero POI shift on any host I put it on. It is also super easy to take on and off. The Cherry Bomb mount does suck as a muzzle device by itself but with the Whistle Tip it is better at not blowing your ears out or kicking up dirt bit doesn't do shit for flash. I wish they made a flash hider type mount that was for standard threads. You will like the TP.
I love my tp as do my friends who have nomads and others. Fear not.
Goddamn.

I can‚Äôt speak for how a Geissele compares to White Oak since I‚Äôve never shot a White Oak, but Geissele is freakin awesome. I have a 16‚Äù Super Duty and I love it. Very pleased. 

Though I am curious, what about a White Oak is better? Admittedly, I‚Äôve never even heard of them..
For my money, Sionics is the best value for money in ARs
Huxwrx isn‚Äôt really that quiet‚Ä¶.
Trust me, the fix just sucks. My 280AI doesn‚Äôt weigh much more than a similarly equipped fix and is much more comfortable to shoot - despite having a more powerful round (162gr @ 2850fps vs 144 @ 2750 fps)
I mean, that‚Äôs cool and all but I‚Äôd expect the people selling the rifle to be somewhat competent at installing the parts correctly
HB barrel assembly, HB handguard, and Thunder Chicken on my build; wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. I have it tuned leaning to undergassed on subs, very quiet and no gas. Supers are louder of course and fairly gassy. I‚Äôd wear ear pro and not mag dump supers but they‚Äôre just for self defense and I range subs so it‚Äôs whatevs
[deleted]
The gas block has to be adjusted. He‚Äôs going to have to take the hand guard off
I‚Äôm definitely mad, but so long as others learn from my mistakes it doesn‚Äôt sting as much
I hate my sugar weasel prob the worst gun purchase I ever made
Don‚Äôt regret it. That‚Äôs a great gun.
same, DA hate aside the nomad L is a super quiet can on my 8‚Äù 300blk
I‚Äôve got a CAT ODB 718 on the way, assuming I can fix the gas block issues I‚Äôll give it a try on this host
Came here to say this. Have a Nomad L on my home build aero .300 and it‚Äôs been perfect. Too bad DA as a company sucks ass.
I feel like you ought to give the company a chance to fix what's wrong before bitchng about it online.
I don‚Äôt owe Q anything, and if I can convince people that wasting their money on poorly made and poorly performing firearms and silencers is a bad idea then it‚Äôs worth it.
agreed.
I just used the tripod as a reference point in camera. I do enjoy shooting off a tripod though, it‚Äôs a good substitute for learning to shoot off a barricade
HELL YEAH BRUTHER GOBBLESS
That‚Äôs subs
I like mine as a dedicated subsonic silenced hunting rifle. It is very accurate, stows nicely, fends weather very well, is light and well balanced with a short silencer, and has been very reliable in my weather.

More often than not I pick up my Kimber Montana instead, but that is as much habit as preference as that rifle and I go way back.
I really want a 8.6 mini fix but I don't want to support Q nor pay their retard tier prices.
Excellent analogy.
You calling it a lie when I can clearly see the gas block touching the handguard is funny lmao free floated handguard not even free floating
Except the gas block is canted and impacting the inside of the handguard, to the point where the handguard is marred by the gas block.
Are you blind? Seems like you are. The gas block is canted and pressing into the handguard.
There are tons of cans with much much much lower FRP - even in that size and price range.

Also it‚Äôs a Feisol CT3372 w/ RRS Anvil30
It wasn't out in 2012 wtf?!?
Nothing they do is innovative

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt believe your eyes and ears! Trust the manufacturer, they say it‚Äôs a good can so it is!‚Äù

2) 8.6 blackout is fucking stupid

For real...why insult a bunch of innocent homies with extra chromies?
I know a lot of people don‚Äôt really like Kevin because he does come off as a bit of a smug prick, but this is the first I‚Äôve heard of the Trash Panda being bad. Why is that? And more specifically/importantly, how is it bad relative to other cans?

Bad sound reduction? Gas blowback? Heavy? Too big? Something else? All of the above?

That said, I just ordered my first can from Griffin about a month ago (although I‚Äôm *still* waiting for ATF approval üôÑ); specifically the EXPLORR 300. I bought it because while it doesn‚Äôt seem like the absolute best at any one single thing, it does seem to be a good jack of all trades (including a more compact size, reduced gas blowback, good sound suppression, etc.). We shall see!
The one I had 3 years ago had feeding failures, terrible QC with marring all through the receiver and weird gassing issues that really couldn‚Äôt be adjusted, on top of it having a stupid ass takedown procedure that was asinine. Furthermore, it‚Äôs overpriced for what it is.
They can't afford it- look at the OP's prior post history. He's full of shit. The account was made to trash Q. He also claimed to buy every one of their other products as well. Doesn't add up. Someone at some company is trying hard to convince people to avoid the industry's biggest disruptor. Just search this guy's Reddit history and registration date. He shows the gun firing perfectly fine and proceeds to cry like a baby and gets a mass hysteria response from people who can't fork up the cash for one. 

  
People pay almost 3k for a sub-BCM quality KAC SR15 just because the company has a bunch of military contracts and produces the famous SR-25.. I don't see anything special about Knight's consumer AR. A straight gas tube? Rounded "lugs" on the bolt? 3k? Great.

  
The Badger looks like it's worth 5k. It weighs nothing and is more accurate than I am. I can't hear my fucking rounds at the range (w/same setup as OP without the stupid safety swap and unnecessary lights and shit.) nor do I feel any recoil impulse shooting 220gr's out of it. It was the best 3k I've ever spent.
It ‚Äúlooks‚Äù cool but in reality it‚Äôs dogshit. I got mine off to a fanboy who thought he could ‚Äúmake it better‚Äù, just for him to sell it 6 months after I sold it to him. 

If you wanna scam someone, buy a bunch of them shits and sell it to your local LARPer. You‚Äôll make a good ass living.
If it looks cool you can build something yourself that looks the same and isn't absurdly expensive for no reason
Feed issues with the Fix, light strikes with the Fix and Mini Fix, cans aren‚Äôt quiet, general QC issues
Well that's dead air, who is also on my shit list. The full nelson is the best 300blk can they made for a traditional gas trap style can. Great for a bolt gun but a headache for tuning a semi auto.
I want the e brake for my nomad L
Kevin is a huge asshole, they make cool products but the prices are just out of hand on guns. Can's aren't anything fancy for way too much.
spray paint can go ppssshhhh

Thank you for this very important and scientific insight
It‚Äôs thinner and supposedly lighter. That‚Äôs where the proprietary parts come in, there‚Äôs cutouts in the receiver for the rails for the stock to fit narrower, and I want to say it‚Äôs overall shorter because I think the buffer and bolt carrier are one piece (don‚Äôt quote me on that).

I used SB tactical‚Äôs version of the honey badgers brace and the Q rail, and the rail is super light. Other than that it‚Äôs aero precision and Faxon components. Looks the part for a fraction of the cost
>or the company that owns me

Ok, I'm starting a Free James Reeves campaign.
Did Kevin at least spring for two beds?
Hush up with all the text and show us your weiner already. 



Please



Also, we (I) ‚ù§Ô∏è you
Yoo I didn't even notice you in here at first because you typoed my tag üòÇ. Np dude, figured you deserved to defend yourself, and you brought one hell of a mic drop lmao. Keep doing what you do, you're one of my fav guntube personalities.
He's done way more interviews with that douche than just the hot tub one.  He's also reviewed their firearms, trigger, etc hyping the shit out of that overpriced trash.
I respectfully disagree. James is probably as genuine as it gets in the industry, and everyone has a different opinion on certain things.
He's something that's for sure. Miss his old videos
Nah, that's not true. I've personally met him and he was super cool and humble. I would bet my house that if you saw him in the wild and told him you watch tfbtv, he would stop and talk to you for a while. Might even buy you a beer
Thanks, I appreciate it. I watched so many videos and researched a ton. Got a good deal on one so I decided to buy it for my 300blk build. I knew it wasn't the best ever, but I've never seen it as loud as this. Definitely worried me seeing this video. It's definitely good to hear your reply. Thank you! It's my first can as well as you may be able to tell haha.
Great to hear! 

That's basically what I understood about the TP from research. It is not the greatest because of new technology, but if you get it on a good deal, it's worth it.
Going on the list
Exactly it‚Äôs right there, in black and white üòù
Prob his company
Match barrel. May not really notice if you‚Äôre not shooting distance but you‚Äôre not really going to see a lot of DD, Geissele, or Larue at an AR match. Mostly white oak, compass lake, JP, some noveske, or full on custom builds with proof, Bartlein, Kreiger, shilen, etc. barrels
White Oak is old school Quality AR. They were hot shit, especially in the high-power scene, when bendy bill was in diapers. Instead of chasing govt. contracts and fad stuff, white oak quietly kept making some of the best barrels and mil-spec parts in the country, and have nearly the same catalog today as they did 20 years ago. "Don't fix what ain't broken" seems to be their motto so innovation is low but Quality is very high.
Friend of mine has a WOA barrel and it flat out shoots everything he‚Äôs ever put through it (edit: shoots very accurately). I didn‚Äôt know anything about them until he told me about his. Apparently they‚Äôre known for precision stuff.
I honestly haven‚Äôt had anything Sionics. I‚Äôd love to try one out. Do they do full ambi lowers cause I‚Äôm in the market for one?
It really is not quiet at all
I really like their RAD45. Pretty quiet on my 9mm. Don't have a rifle can from them though.
Mine is on my B&T 300
7.62 flow on my rattler with 220 gr subs is stupid quiet
The company is all hype
That‚Äôs fair. I don‚Äôt disagree at all. Especially at that price point.
ACRO P2
I don‚Äôt think he knows how because you adjust it with Allen keys and you don‚Äôt even need to remove the hand guard to do it.
How ?
Mine is amazing I love it
You say that, but I had to replace a ton of parts on it to make it functional. Bcg was awful and caused a ton of feed issues. Also the trigger was trash for a $2000 gun
True they do get a alot of hate rightfully so. I would have went with a different can but I already waited and got mine out of jail before the whole Sierra 5 issues. 
I do love my nomad L and have put it through some serious use even some FA
Have you shot yours on a 6.5 creed? It's super pleasant
Why give Kevin the chance to blame the customer for "breaking" stuff again?

Hell, he blames people for his companies failure to treat steel to H900 hardness correctly, and they then send in warranty stuff because the mount and muzzle device seized together when a quality from someone like Rearden is used with his junk.
I have never had an issue adjusting the gas (even at the range). a canted gas block would be solved through an e-mail to customer service. I spent much more than you did and I love mine =)
lol
It does sound loud. If you are a reloader try to find a recipe you like.
ü§ù
So now the handguard isn't free-floated? I can assure you there is no endcap on your Badger. Dude-- you've spent 28 days on this subject..  Have you called Q?? In all of those hours have you even called and asked for C/S? Or are you a paid shill from some competitor spreading total false shit.

You never even said (what I stated) was wrong which is ironic. Why does my Honey Badger preform movie quiet with no issues (like all of the other owners-- you should join on Facebook) but your so special that they sent you a rigged gasblock? Please, explain why your Badger can't shoot like this and mine does : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l711XHiwyQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l711XHiwyQ)
please take a picture of your gas block witness hole and post it.
You're just mad. It's all good.
[deleted]
It was, or was at least being shown off. They started producing them in 2011. Not the Q version, but the original AAC one.

Like sure, it was originally LE and Military only for a bit, but like, FPSRussia got his hands on one in January of 2012
Just helps people skip what not to do I guess 
 üòÜ
I‚Äôve had my eyes and ears on one for 4 years big boy üòÇ
I mean it‚Äôs just a better version of 300 but ok lol
Can I join your anti-retard gang? That‚Äôs a pretty low risk ideal to get behind.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen anyone in recent memory get downvoted for saying Q sucks. Especially since they were talking shit about Reddit‚Äôs newest fling Rearden.
Muh NaSa WeLdS
Gas blowback more than other 30cal cans, and the sound signature was louder then my other cans as well for its size and price i expected more. But I will say despite the shit you hear about Q their customer service took care of me when I had a baffle strike no questions fixed it and sent it back to me. ( took about 3 months tho). 

But for the wait times and money I think there are better options. Also I always suggest pew science for solid suppressor ratings.
Fuckin Christ and the fact they charge 3k for that shit is absurd. Might as well go with some BCM or Aero build for that and still have some left over money for ammo and accessories.
Brother let‚Äôs get something clear, that whole ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt afford it‚Äù comeback is some stupid shit and a way to cope and dickride. You can literally go on my page and within the first few posts see I have zero issues affording a Honey Badger, considering again, I owned one 3 years ago. 

So according to you, I can afford a Spear LT, which is almost the same price as an HB, A Galil Ace, GHM9 Gen 2, and custom .300BLK PDW that functions FLAWLESSLY by the way unlike my HB, dedicated cans for all those setups, a Staccato C2, Gucci Glock etc. but I can‚Äôt afford a $3,000 POS? Lmfaooooo aight man.
Youre an idiot. Theres not even a nice way to say that. Youre wrong, and gargling kevins nuts wont do anything for you
Yeah, but it DO be lookin' cool as fuck!

We all know looking cool is half the battle.
Everyone is downvoting me seemingly because they think I'm supporting this gun.

I don't own one, won't own one, and don't recommend it to anyone. I *do* think it looks cool as fuck, though.

And again. Looking cool is half the battle!

However anyone wants to spend their money isn't my business. $25,000 or $5,000 or $500. Whatever. Not my problem. I will appreciate cool looking things, though - just as I also appreciate things that function superbly.
Make a post about the fix and mini fix! I was kicking around that idea for a little bit, but don‚Äôt want to justify 3k ish on a 308 bolt action
This is why I stayed away from
So you hate your Honey Badger but your familiar with/owned/waited for all of their weapons?
It‚Äôs the best can they‚Äôve ever made and they stopped making it for some reason. Good thing other companies (OCL, LPM, CGS, CAT, etc) have stepped in making even better offerings on 300blk
Truth my gas port had to get drilled to 120 for my full nelson to cycle subs
Well- it runs flawlessly and super quiet so far...on the regular - setting

I am pretty sure that E-brake makes it more of a flow thru, plus I have it direct mounted via sig taper adapter so it has more blast chamber room (no mass from muzzle device inside there)
I have a Nomad LTI also and with E brake it sounds identical to the Nomad Ti with E Brake
Sorry, that was meant to be in quotes from the perspective of these folks who dish the money out for these things

All in good fun ü§£
They pay me less than I would make if I were on my own, but I don‚Äôt have the time to organize all of this shit and still practice law and respond to regarded individuals on Reddit. I‚Äôm trying to make my own non TFB content on my own channel as a side-side-gig.
He did, but it was just the two of us so we only needed one of them.
Only the tfb interns get to see that
I feel like Ian from Forgotten Weapons is shilling for Q a lot. Hes had KB on and hes always got the Fix on his channel.
Well yeah dude he traveled all the way to NH, makes sense to prob get some content and do what tfb does.  Maybe I‚Äôll give it another scrupulous rewatch.
Hop is as genuine as it gets in the industry. I‚Äôm amazed that him and Reeves work for the same company
FOUND JAMES REDDIT ACCOUNT!
lol he did a review of the B&T Station Six and failed to mention that it‚Äôs very loud and has maybe the worst trigger you‚Äôve ever felt on a firearm. I don‚Äôt believe any of his reviews any more.
I mean, I‚Äôm not gonna lie and say that I like it on the hosts I‚Äôve used it on because I don‚Äôt. However, if you tune it for your gun and use weaker subs like Callaway ballistics you might enjoy it more
I posted a video of it at the range in use if you want to see it !
I will say the trash panda does do way better on longer barrel 556 than shorter barrels. 

on a 14.5-16 its hangs really tight to an rc2. better tone but overall maybe a little bit louder? it was a 2/3 vote last time we did some blind taste testing. 

it can also take 500 rounds of 556 in one sitting without dying unlike some other titanium cans folks are selling nowadays
Hell yeah
You fucking nerd, take my vote.
Gotta say, I shoot a 20‚Äù LaRue Stealth barrel and I‚Äôm hitting torso sized steel plates with consistency at 900 yards. It‚Äôs also phenomenal and well under MOA at 100-200 as well. The others I agree with but LaRue makes a damn fine barrel.
Gotcha
Maybe im reading this wrong, but are you insinuating there are ARs and even ‚Äúgucci‚Äù ARs that won‚Äôt shoot every round of their given caliber? There isn‚Äôt a single gun I own that can‚Äôt run any grain or manufacturer in their caliber (that I‚Äôve used, atleast).
They do. They are most well known for their barrels and uppers but imho everything they make is quality.
man I really need to get my hands on a 7.62 flow and see if the performance increased with subs
That‚Äôs good to hear, I had seen some videos and wasn‚Äôt super impressed with the sound suppression but could have been the videos I saw.
And the mount?
He must because he mentioned that the AGB came canted enough to rub the handguard. Why he doesn't send it back to Q or uncant it himself, it isn't rocket science, I cant figure.

Too gassy imo even when tuning it right it‚Äôs just spits everywhere
Well, shit.
I haven‚Äôt yet! Once this snow lets up I‚Äôm going to take out my bergara and try it out
I haven't experienced anything but great customer service from Q. I've found they're easy to work with. What experiences do you have with Q customer service?
"I spent much more than you..."

That's the problem with Q customers.
It's not even my gun dumbass. And yes, if the handguard is touching the gas block, it is no longer free floated. I'm a 3rd party laughing and your inability to see the crooked gas block and comprehend what it meams
Did you even click the link OP posted to look at the gas block clearly touching the handguard? Lmao you're arguing against literally photo evidence. Like.. we all see it's crooked bro
You absolute moron. Keep dickriding KB, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll notice you
Again, you‚Äôre just wrong.
I like it a lot. Protects the legs a bit better from bumps and rocks and I can molle on stuff like kestrel holders for when I‚Äôm out hunting.
UHM. NO. THEY. DID. NOT. They had a few concepts; but the gun was for a SOF military contract-- some samples were reviewed (FPSRussia?!) but the gun never saw any civilian production under AAC. **In 2010** **the only way to get a Honey Badger was by purchasing MW: Warfare Ghosts and unlocking the fucking gun**. **Q started in 2016.**
In this day and age, good luck being low risk walking down the street in an "Anti Retard Gang" tshirt.
I have definitely seen dudes dragged for dogging Q. Now wtf happened with Rearden?
Makes sense. And yeah I haven‚Äôt really heard many bad things about Q‚Äôs products (or customer service)‚Äîthe only two being 1) prices and 2) Kevin seems like an a-hole üòÇ 

Anyhow, just got ATF approval a couple of days ago for my Griffin can! So should be less than two weeks away from finally receiving it!
Yeah what did that earlier comment up there say? "Downvotes galore for speaking the truth.." People are such hypocrites.
What do you think is the current best for .300 blk if the Full Nelson is no longer that?
That's not what an ebrake does at all, if anything an ebrake would turn it to an unintentional poorly done hybrid design as it can't trap gas as efficiently toward the end of a single flow regime. It does how ever dump pressure at the muzzle thus raising the signature at the muzzle and ear. 



What cans have you shot on this same set up with the same ammo to compare? Have you removed the ebrake and shot it traditionally to compare sound?
üòØ
I‚Äôve got some Mk318 Mod 1 5.56 ammo and that was posting single digit SDs
What's the side-side channel? Drop a link or what to search, you and the guys make good shit so I'd be happy to see more of what you come up with.

And maybe as a show idea just film daily life with you and your uncle Carl and your disappointed lesbian aunt Hop üòÑ
You show me a paystub for 72000 wangs and I quit my fuckin job right now and work for you.
Ian will shill for absolutely anyone who gives him free shit or sponsorship dollars.

You said one video and I pointed out that he has made several hype videos for them. But it seems you already know your initial post is incorrect by your reply
This. I don't fw tfbtv or James, so I don't know how often Hop puts out material for them, but yeah-I much prefer Hop's brutal honesty. If he's still doing tfbtv, I would guess it's just for the paycheck or maybe a contractual situation.
Hop is easily excitable and gets too emotional for me to even take serious. I can‚Äôt stand his super-hype style of reviews. Homeboy needs a Xanax.
Nahhh, that would be u/Preauxmetheus lol. I like his shit whether it's paid for or not, he's done a lot of work to go in depth on some niche things that others don't. He at least deserves a tag and the chance to talk some shit back.
Why would anyone ever think a station six has a match trigger?
Yeah, I definitely will be researching how to tune it to my gun and get it as quiet as possible!
Thanks for the info. I really appreciate everyone telling me their experiences it's really cool and thoughtful!
Mark is also a little anal and went out and bought that fancy Swiss lathe to make those barrels. Sometimes his boomer tantrum attitude pays off for costumers. (Like with how the MBT could be had super cheap for so long, because him and Bill had their little fight)
They‚Äôre good barrels, I agree. But not necessarily better than a WOA which is less money. I think LaRue‚Äôs big sales are still more than normal WOA prices. 

Torso plate at 900 is a pretty big target though, you gotta hit that thing on a mover off a rooftop!

Edit: just for clarity it‚Äôs a partial /s
For the price you can‚Äôt beat the performance if you‚Äôre shooting rifle distances. You don‚Äôt really even see that much Geissele at Geissele‚Äôs own match lol, which is fantastic by the way.
Lol I should have been more clear, it shoots everything very well/accurately as in 45gr - 77otmk under an inch at 100 yards. But yes, clearly you don‚Äôt own a BCA that will not fire rounds of their designated calibers.
Don't forget their np3 BCGs. I haven't heard anything about any of their other products, but everyone sings the BCGs praises.
Have 11.5 sbr with the reduced gas port and standard 16 inch Sionics and both are awesome guns. Zero issues with thousands between them. Be cool if theg ever came out with a bolt gun or AR in 300 blk.
Flow 7.62 with subs is ok like my sandman. Everything else it's very quiet especially behind the gun. I probably wouldn't trade it for anything.
I know some of their older models are loud, but the new stuff has been pretty great imo. My mk18 and 7.62 flow can pair up pretty nicely too. Way more enjoyable to shoot
If you watch garand thumb‚Äôs video on the honey badger that‚Äôs literally what it sounds like.  Not only his/ mine but there are countless of videos with this same combination being just as silent.
Its really just a basic bitch ar with an adjustable gas block, theres no reason why you shouldnt be able to make it run fairly nice. What buffer do you have in the rear?
https://preview.redd.it/njemxi77rdsc1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68e3f97f9de5d27ecf649211be1992eff885b805
It functions great now that I fixed all that, not super gassy either. I run it with a silencerco omega 300
You'll be impressed I was at least
Okie dokie. üëå
They literally did.

Explain to me how people like FPSRussia has the Honey Badger in January of 2012 then?

Or how literally every single source says they started production in 2011?

Yeah, Q started in 2016, but that's almost entirely unrelated, because AAC produced the Honey Badger before Q even existed.

I never said civilian production, and I outright said it was military and Law Enforcement only for a bit. That doesn't mean anything, it was still being produced.
They can‚Äôt cancel ya if ya don‚Äôt care
I literally laughed out loud reading (and imagining) this hahaha üòÜ
Something about their muzzle devices being out of spec or some nonsense and not to use them. Was quite a while ago so can‚Äôt remember the exacts but I‚Äôll try to find the thread
Under $1k, probably the LPM Mach L. Over 1k, probably the forthcoming CAT JL
Do you actually have one?

Dunno what to tell you.  The performance speaks for itself.  It is incredibly quiet and seems quieter with the E

I‚Äôve shot YHM resonator (R2).  ResK.  
Both are much louder, obviously the K lol

My Nomad LT is about the same suppression level
I have run both my nomad 30 and ti with and without the ebrake. While i understand your point of not trapping gas as well at the end that's not what happens. 

It doesnt replace a final baffle, just the end cap..in fact, if you look at the internal side of the ebrake, it's designed like a minimal additional baffle (without the nomad outer annulus, more like a k), that then vents into the brake chamber. It allows expansion and cooling and venting in all directions rather than the higher pressure venting through an end cap hole.

All that being said, i personally see little to no difference in how the gun is gassed with/without. It does help with muzzle rise a noticeable amount with 300blk supers and 308, and while there may be a sound difference, not enough for me to care.

I use the ebrake on my larue obr because its a tank and length doesn't matter. The others i just run the flash hider end cap now. Fun experiment, kind of waste of money imo.
I am apologize and thank you for your service. I shouldn't have gone that far bro.

If we could get myself and Carl and Hop on a reality show together we could call it "2 and a half autistic men"
I know - I remember them talking about that. 

Initially, I thought that was a really cool idea  - and I still do. But the Fix has nothing to do with that
This is, theoretically, actionable defamation if TFB cared enough to do anything about it (they don‚Äôt), but to me it's crazy that people are willing to throw out completely falsifiable and factually inaccurate shit like this with this much confidence when they have no idea what they are talking about.

Vista Outdoors owns manufacturing brands - Federal is an example. You can check this on Wikipedia. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vista\_Outdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vista_Outdoor)

VerticalScope, a media company, owns TFB and TFBTV.

TFB is paid by its advertisers and those relationships are disclosed. Q is not an advertiser as per the inference here.

Gun reddit is incredibly alarming. There are two blatantly false statements being made here as if they are completely true, and people are actually upvoting them, most likely because they want them to be true.

ETA: this guy has made and deleted multiple comments about TFB not "wanting that smoke" because it would expose them to written discovery.I've typed this response 3 times but the comment I'm replying to keeps getting deleted, so I'll just leave it here:

*As I said, initially, no, I very seriously doubt TFB would sue over a reddit comment, even if it were defamatory. But to answer the theoretical question about discovery: You'd have to make a prima facie case. Vista Outdoors is a publicly traded company and they disclose who they own. You don't get access to the CEO's text messages if you can't at least make a facial showing that Vista Outdoor owns TFB. The really funny part is, if it were true, they would just admit it and it would never get to litigation. If you had a scintilla of evidence that TFB was owned by Vista (you don't), then it would get to written discovery.*[*https://vistaoutdoor.com/brands/*](https://vistaoutdoor.com/brands/)

*But you've walked your comment back and made and deleted a bunch of comments so I'll leave it at that. I can be easily baited into legal discussions so I'll stop now.*
So they were bought by alloutdoor.com, and you‚Äôre saying alloutdoor is owned by vista outdoors, I‚Äôll believe you because I can‚Äôt find that at the moment 

‚Ä¶ okay so next show me where one of their heavily invested assets / owned manufactures correlates to a bias in coverage by tfb.  

Otherwise I‚Äôm not seeing the point.
No I said one video in a hot tub.. alluding to your homoerotic fantasy inspired post. So by the transitive property; you are gay.
He puts out the same quality of content on tfb as he does his normal channel. And no, he's not just there for contractual reasons lol.
Well, that is his official account ;)
Did I say ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt have a match trigger?‚Äù 

No, I didn‚Äôt. I said it has *the worst trigger ever put in a firearm.* That is a lot more noteworthy than the words you just put in my mouth. I‚Äôve tried four of them now and each required so much force that the users all checked repeatedly to see if they had activated the grip safety by accident. This is not something that would escape the notice of a professional reviewer.
I have a trash panda on a sugar weasel I haven‚Äôt tuned shit and it‚Äôs quiet as fuck don‚Äôt worry. I know people love to hate but I‚Äôve simply never had an issue 3k rounds in.
Love me some MBT! I prefer the SSA-E but not $100 more lol. I run both on multiple guns and think they are both fantastic in different ways.
Dude it‚Äôs hard enough for me to even see that plate at 900 üòÜ. I‚Äôm using 77gr OTM and they are great until it gets real windy and then I have some trouble. May need to check out a WOA barrel then!
Ahhh ok I figured but I couldn‚Äôt tell for sure. Thank you for the explanation.
I live in WA state and stocked up on those before the ban
ouch similar to a sandman on subs is not exactly a compliment. I guess if you get zero back pressure and maximize your bolt closed time it would be nice with ears on.

Probably baller as hell with supers though
H1 or h2 depending on ammo

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a POS just think i could have built one way better for the price. It is light though
I love my SiCo Omega 300. I have a Virtus 6.5‚Äù 300 blk.
Kevin isn‚Äôt gonna notice you bro
KB lived close and let him play with a (fa) concept gun.. show me another video besides FPSRussia's...
Reference me an AAC honey badger for sale (ever) just give me a link where they were announced for sale.. you can't but if you can let me see.
He made a whole video about it
Gotcha. CAT will be on top before long I bet. Their tech is really something else.
üòå
Well how about that, I'm already subscribed. Maybe it's not showing up in my feed because YouTube shenanigans? I'll keep an eye out for your stuff in the future either way üòéü§ôüèΩ

Netflix executives; "write that down!"

Last dumb question for now, has Hop met Carl?  What does Hop think of B&T stuff in general?  I imagine he breaks out in angry rants and hives when the msrp is past a certain point lol
You guys are so bad at posting you made James use his law degree! Wild.

Anyway, post more CZ content.
The man himself. Keep being you, dude.
I will defend your honor shorts king James from the clown suckazz.. the fool‚Äôs blind hatred for Q thinks mere tfb coverage is mouth hugging hype.  (I don‚Äôt even find kb likable.)

So did verticlescope purchase all outdoors after they purchased tfb or were they owned by them prior?
‚Äú‚Ä¶.one video in a hot tub..‚Äù that‚Äôs first sentence in your initial post you fucking dense idiot
I have zero doubt that he puts out the same quality of content. I didn't say or imply otherwise. I said that I don't watch James or tfbtv. It's rare that tfbtv shows up in my YouTube feed (because I don't watch it), but when it does, it's usually concerning something that doesn't interest me. I do, however, actively avoid clicking on tfbtv videos because I don't want more of them in my feed-because most of their content isn't interesting to me.
  
On the flip side, when Hop or Brass Facts puts out a video that doesn't really interest me, I'll more than likely still put it on the background because I find those channels (or individuals) entertaining. I like to hear them talkü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   
  
Either way, I can't help that I get a "shilly" vibe from James that I don't enjoy. Vibes aren't facts, but my video entertainment time is limited, and it's my own personal YouTube feed, so I choose to avoid tfbtv. Honestly, there are very, very few guntubers that I watch, and Hop is probably the 'biggest' one that I really find engaging.
True, but to be fair he's most likely felt some that are even worse.
Thanks. I really appreciate the reply. I'm definitely excited for mine to get out of jail. It's been 120-130 days, so I forget about it until I see a post like this.
Just fucking around lol. I don‚Äôt think many people are doing that even with 6 dashers.

I use Lapua scenar 77s for my DMR matches and have had great results. Slightly higher BC than 77 SMKs and higher consistency in weight and bearing surface length. Basically can‚Äôt even sort them by anything because they vary so little.
Washington banned BCGs?
It's just not it's strong suit but it's much better then the past. Everything supers it fucks hard I LOVE hat Flow 762. Just like with everything, you can't have your cake and eat it too
Shit brother its an ar just swap the part around you want to change.


Give the jp scs h3 a shot. Its been the #1 imrpovement for di shootint ive found
Ooh, nice! Sounds like a quality build
Bold of you to assume that isn't Kevin's alt lol
Kevin who?...
Again, homie, idk why you're so stuck on civilian production, when again, it wasn't particularly being sold to civilians.

It existed, and was being produced, which was what I was talking about.

You're the one that decided to argue semantics, and tried acting like it didn't exist, and wasn't available in some amount for us to see and understand it.

Like I genuinely don't know why the fuck you're trying to make this an argument when all I said was that it was cool in 2012.
Yeah I‚Äôm excited for the ODB I‚Äôve got on the way
That's completely irrelevant. A trustworthy gun reviewer would have said, at the bare minimum, "this may not be the absolute worst trigger I've ever felt, but it is extremely bad."
I'd write a letter to NICS if I were waiting that long. It worked for me unless it was pure coincidence.
A very complicated and comprehensive AR ban. It wasn‚Äôt clear what the final form would be, so I stocked up on every just in case.
I mean dude that‚Äôs what I mean by building my own. Why do I gotta throw in a $150 buffer and spring of all things to get this to run well
Ill have to [post more pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/SigSauer/s/DzLVguJPgt) sometime soon.
My ODB is incredible, absolutely love it
Just got my ODB a week ago. You‚Äôre gonna love it.
Fuq ya, I'm saving up and ideally can grab one when in stock! Will also be nabbing their "Rat"  or whatever they end up calling it for the Rattler.
my odb is fucking bonkers on 6.5 cm. Just ordered a muzzle device to run it on a 16" 556 and another for the 308 16" dd5 im ordering next. You'll be very happy with the odb.
I've never thought to reach out directly to NICS. I wonder if they'd be able to help.

I have a state representative working on my case, but it seems to me they're worthless. The atf sent them an email back basically saying f you we're understaffed and it takes a long time here's a link for wait times.  My state representative sent me the email they got from the atf and then added on to it saying if we hear anything else we'll let you know but it seems that you're close to the date listed in the link.

Complete joke, I replied, basically out of line, kinda ripping their ass saying that the atf sent you a f you leave me alone about my case and you have no care in the world. They didn't say anything actually pertaining  to my case just pending find out more information  pertaining to my case, not everyone else's case. This is unacceptable. You aren't trying to fight or find out what's going on. You're not helping me at all. Find out more about my case and make them give out info since they're infringing on my rights. The worst of it is my state representative has stated publicly his dissatisfaction for the atf. 

Sorry for the rant. I was probably  out of line, but I couldn't believe these people are supposed to represent us since we obviously  don't have a voice and they are uncapable of doing so.
Fair enough!
Well its mostly because they dont know what suppressor folks will use and want it to run unsuppressed so your port size/buffer weight, essentially your whole recoil system, is gonna suck to begin with.

TBH I'd be shocked to find any factory 300blk that comes with an H3 buffer from the factory
Great pic! I definitely need to post up more of my pics too, I‚Äôm awful at getting stuff posted
What mount you running?
That's got to be frustrating. I've never went that route before. I would definitely try to email NICS so you can get pushed closer to getting approved. Some silencer subreddits can give you a template of what to put on your request. Good luck!
I mean mine came w a carbine buffer which is a joke for a 5in barrel, especially when they  put it being suppressed. That is the state of Q, to be cheap as possible, it‚Äôd cost them <$5 a rifle to add any H buffer system. Mine also came w a POS mil spec trigger and charging handle. 

Just saying man, the rifle is just not worth it. Period.

Ive built rifles w the best components for right over half I paid for this
Huxwrx Ventum 12 baffles are wild 
Here‚Äôs a disassembled Ventum 12 for anyone that might be curious. 
"be not afraid" lookin baffles
That's a muffler. For a small engine.
NEAT
Lools like a mortor round..
I lick the carbon off mine like a whisk covered in cake batter.
The Forbidden Buttplug
This just clearly illustrates how much additive manufacturing has changed the game; that‚Äôs such a beautiful design.
Do these sound decent?
I assumed that can was printed not serviceable
This is amazing, thanks for sharing.
Well that's super neat
Sloppy toppy with a twist
Fucking sick that looks like a weird mortar round
These Fleshlight sleeve designs are getting out of hand! I'm becoming desensitized.
So if you leave the endcap off, does this rocket launch when fired?
Ho-Lee-fook that‚Äôs some wild baffle design
Bro that lewd like hand holding lewd
That's pretty wild, actually.
I am curious how the stiction adapter works. And how the muzzle device would attach. Is it only for "tactical" shotguns with some kind of threaded muzzle?

I've run my Salvo 12 on the Benelli M2 and those require the specific SiCo chokes. The problem with the Salvo 12 is the extra weight. The 6" and 8" configs are about as the longest I want to run before it starts to get comically heavy in the wrong place.

Also, cleaning the plastic wadding out of the baffles is a royal PITA to the point I don't really want to use it much. The blast/sound reduction is cool, but the 12 gauge was never that bad for recoil or blast.
Does this design work better than others?
The detail in the u-turns makes me think they used generative design.  The perforated section looks like, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt let AI design ALL of the internals.‚Äù
Thank you for scratching that itch.
And it‚Äôs loud.
How good is this can for reduction of noise?
Interesting design.  Remember to be wary of any manufacturer of shotgun silencers that conveniently neglects to mention ammunition.  Subsonic loads make a significant difference for 12 gauge.  I've always believed a silencer that doesn't reduce the loudness of the report to a comfortable level isn't even worth the cost of a tax stamp alone.
This is why the 3d printed can internals are so neat. Thanks for sharing!
I can't wait to see where additive manufacturing take suppressor development
how about some video comparisons?
Pretty neat
Oh man, try getting THAT through airport security.
Baffles look like a maze
Thanks now I don‚Äôt have to open mine lol
‚Ä¶ alright that‚Äôs cool as hell.
So when is this available?
They made the 12 ga suppressor baffles look like a 12 ga slug that Taofladermaus would be testing on his channel.
I love my Salvo but I definitely want one of these as well.
Can I run this on a 1301 Mod 2 yet?

I'm really bummed I can't get one of these for my beretta 1301. Is there anyone out there with plans to make a choke adapter?
This is one of the coolest looking cores I've seen. But how does it perform? ü§î
I really hope this comes to civi market soon with some choke adapters I'd love one on my 1301
Wild looking baffle structure. Imagine the amount of R&D that went into developing this. I'm sure it's proprietary but I'd love to watch a video of the CNC machine cutting those dynamic wavy angles, I imagine it would be mesmerizing.
Is it 3d printed or 5 axis machined?
Crazy. I really want one. It‚Äôs the Salvo killer
Always interesting seeing inside a silencer, looks like I remember for them.
Wonder if Hux stole that design too
Biblically accurate baffles
Fuck, now I can‚Äôt unsee Warframe‚Äôs Sentient design seeing this.

The Anal Umbrella (without the splash guard)
Could this be wax loss casted?
I could see this being machined but there‚Äôd be a ton of waste and you‚Äôd need at least a 5 axis mill. Same technique as making turbo compressor wheels.
Are all the suppressors rated for sound relative to a host cartridge on some website?

Feel like I‚Äôve seen that somewhere; if someone has that link please share it.
It does sound great. Almost like a suppressed 556
There's unibody 3d printed cans that are 100% non serviceable but this one is a 3d printed core in a traditional sleeve so it is. Two different designs.
Even their full one piece 3D print cans are serviceable now, so long as you don't send a round through the SN on the side. 

They drill out the core, print a new one, and weld it into place.
Sure it‚Äôs serviceable just replace the core
So it works with my SEG 12 choke adaptor, not sure of what size that is. This one came with the 5.5‚Äù Gen-12 and it just threads on to the barrel once you remove the blast deflector.
If I got one, it would be for my KSG. That one bucks with slugs. It‚Äôs ok with buckshot.
Following want to hear some real world impressions
I‚Äôll try and get some on the 22nd and compare it to a SEG 12, however all I have is my iPhone to record it so take the sound comparison with a grain of salt
Not sure, this one was a package deal from piece of mind with the 5‚Äù Gen-12
How font heavy is it to shoot the salvo? Seems to get a quiet enough 12 ga can to be worthwhile, they'll add a lot of weight.
If you can find the Rex Silentium Beretta Choke Adaptor it will run on the 1301

You‚Äôll need the choke mount and the M22
it is on the market now, and you can use rex's mounting solution for berratta chokes
It doesn't look machined. It looks 3d printed.
Judging by the surface finish this is a sintered metal core not machined. This is definitely doable on a 4 axis mill but it doesn't look like they're doing that.
Surface texture makes me thing 3D printed or cast.
3D Printed titanium according to the manual, just like the Ventum 762/556 core
I‚Äôm hoping this is the case‚Ä¶ that on the genesis and gen 12 SBS‚Ä¶ all I want for Christmas‚Ä¶ for the next 15 years lol

**Theoretically**, I don‚Äôt see any geometry from this picture that couldn‚Äôt be replicated through a lost wax method, but it would be plagued with issues. 

1) The fins are super thin and double back on themselves repeatedly, so it would be very difficult to keep the molten metal flowing into those features. Voids or inclusions would be very common. Maybe a genius sprue placement could remedy this, but it‚Äôd be a stretch. 

2) the vented feature on the lower portion would suffer from the same flow/void/inclusion issue. 

3) a cast part would have a randomly oriented grain structure and will be brittle. The mechanical properties for an SLS printed part would be better due to tailoring of the finer, columnar grain structures iirc.  

 4) producing the wax pattern seems like it would be difficult and you‚Äôd lose a lot of the patterns to breakage. 

5) you‚Äôd need to do post processing on these parts and with them being intricate, brittle parts, you‚Äôd probably lose a lot to post processing too. 

All in all, there may be geometry we can‚Äôt see that required 3d printing to achieve.
Not whilst retaining any mechanical capability - I work on some of the most complex exotic alloy investment cast components on the planet, and we'd struggle to do this with literally the best vacuum induction furnaces on the planet without horrendous porosity/scrap rate.
True, a 5-axis could probably do these features. I think the original flow through OSS cans were 5-axis machined, but it was a LOOOONG cycle time.
Pewscience.com
With subs or supers?
Akshually, there's a lot of commercial chem options for soak/ultrasonic cleaning breakthrough suppressor cleaner, CLR, the dip, cat 206 etc
That‚Äôs awesome
I meant serviceable as in cleaning not repairable
I had to look up the choke adapter, it looks like REX even makes one for Benelli Crio Plus! Now I understand how it attaches!
Did you pick one up already? I didn't hear they even came out, been waiting for these after I got my 10" and SEG-12. 

I see it is OOS on their site, but can you confirm it comes with the can and EOtech for the $5k?

If you use Comic Sans 8 point, it shouldn't be font heavy at all.
On my 1301 tactical and the 10" kit for the Salvo it's really not bad. I hunt with it.
Meh, the sound isnt that quiet. Big advantage is recoil mitigation. Shooting 3.5" goose loads feels like shooting a 20ga.
Fuck me‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt planning on buying anything in the near future üò≠
Well fuck. Now I have to buy another suppressor
Ahh, I see. Thanks! That makes a lot more sense. I had no idea metal 3D printing had advanced this far - that thing looks clean.
Yep, surface finish is a giveaway that it's printed.  It's probably cheaper to print than conventional machining.
Nice!
Me tooo
The original designer/one of the founders of OSS got booted by the guy who bankrolled it, hence why OSS dissolved and became HUXWRX and DeadAir too if I'm not mistaken. The original designer had all his old designs left behind when he was booted, and HUX is still using them today. The designer has since started his own company with an even wilder design, Strategic Sciences.
LOOK BROTHERS! Tits. HAHAHAHAHA!
They must live in California
Thank you, I didn't think about grain structure and thinness of the features. Also, if it was cast, I'm sure we would see signs of machining after the fact to ensure the perforations were uniform diameter and other details were uniform.
Yeah that‚Äôd be a really long cycle just for one.If the tube is printed around the structure that would eliminate machining all together. 

If I had a Cnc mill it‚Äôd be fun to form1 some variations of these flow through designs.
Nice! I hadn‚Äôt seen that one before but I‚Äôm bookmarking it for sure.
Not sure, I have just watched some videos on it on YouTube
Ack-shoe-ally, serviceable when talking about suppressors though means it can be disassembled for cleaning. If you tell someone a can is serviceable and they can't take it apart for cleaning you've deceived them.
I assume then that you mean 'serviceable' now in the context of taking it apart to clean it, because even unibody cans can be cleaned via soaks in cleaners, ultrasonics, etc.
They are listed for sale on modern warriors and a few other sites. 5k for the rifle and can but no Eotech on Modern warriors
Almost definitely cheaper to print. 4th axis time is not cheap and this would take a while to machine with those deep pockets and many small holes. It looks like it could be machined though just from a part geometry standpoint, nothing about this immediately stands out to me as impossible on a 4th axis mill or live axis lathe. Those would just be a lot slower and more expensive to run probably. I'm willing to assume Huxwrx did the math on that.
Not quite‚Ä¶. Illinois which now objectively has worse long gun laws than Cali. At these those fucks can have the failed abortions that are the compliant ARs and AKs
lmao
If Ally would take that shoe out of her mouth she‚Äôd quit cooking in it‚Ä¶  it‚Äôs a bad joke.
He said cans were 100% not user serviceable which isn't true
Sweet, thanks. I somehow missed the drop. I can't recall how much I spent on my previous Gen-12 and SEG-12 but not sure it was 5k, oof. Still want another one.
Second this. As someone who lives in a free state, but temporally living in Illinois it‚Äôs fucking wild the laws they have here. This place is so amazing except for the liberal gun laws
I know what he said he's me... 

If serviceable just meant cleanable it'd be a basically useless distinction. It always meant you can take it apart to some extent to clean the baffles directly.
They look awesome and are deff on list to buy
Well I don‚Äôt know where in Illinois you live my friend but apparently you have never heard of Chicago. The only nice thing is Illinois has a protection against civil liability if you‚Äôre involved in a self defense incident and it‚Äôs deemed justified.
That‚Äôs good thing. But do you want a jurry of folks that agree with the laws deciding what isn‚Äôt vs what is justified? I don‚Äôt.
Had a visitor yesterday evening 
Never seen one with antlers before. Took a few seconds to realize he was real and that I had time to grab my phone. When I first saw him he was almost right in front of me! He was so calm!
[deleted]
Your hydrangea tree is gorgeous! So is the moose haha!
I love this state so much. Thanks for sharing your video with us. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ahh this is so cool!
Stunning thank you for sharing!
Sweet! What part of VT?
is it already fall in VT??
That's awesome! Since the moose lottery we hardly see them any more. We actually just saw one yesterday too! In a place that used to have them frequently but hadn't seen one there in years. It was great to see. (Female that we saw)
I just love you kept the ‚Äòsneaking-up‚Äô part in the video

Hello fellow Vermonter.
Stay alert!
What a handsome moose! I haven‚Äôt seen one with antlers yet irl either, but hoping it‚Äôs also when i‚Äôm not in a vehicle and we also leave one another alone lol
Awesome!!
Even with seeing them all the time, it's still nice seeing them more.
How sweet!
The way I didn't see him for sooo long because I was expecting like a bug or a humming bird or something üòÇüòÇ
Hello?!!  That was a bold statement.  What if he came prancing over to say hello back??
how old is an elk before it becomes a moose
Beauty!
ü§ç
He looked at you and decided it wasn‚Äôt a good idea to be on camera next to a hydrangea that big
Awesome
There‚Äôs this amazing guy in Alaska who has nondomesticated moose living on his property and bringing their young. It‚Äôs so cool. And his cats get along with them too.
Or you see this near center of Vermont?
Awesome!!
I'm sorry that the awesome moose was very unimpressed by you, hooman. üòè
A LEGGY horse - that‚Äôs for sure
yes i‚Äôm not detracting from the moose but that hydrangea is the stuff of dreams!!! i can only imagine how beautiful that must have been this past year. they really popped and i bet this particular plant looked like a masterpiece
üòÜ
Between Windsor and Plymouth.
Pretty much. Should have peak color in a couple of weeks. Not much rain lately so color may be dull.
It was more than hunting that has changed the moose population. Ticks. Climate change.
The moose lottery is the only reason you see any moose at all. Too many moose is more harmful to the herd than too few. A lot of Vermonters don't understand how fortunate we are to have the Fish and Wildlife management that we do.
Then you get the opportunity to pet it/go to the hospital!
kento
so sick
Dude had his schlong literally skidding on the snow. This guy is one with the force. Nasty carves, he possesses.
Bet even skiers like watching this guy
This is raw riding style. Craziest carves I have ever seen. If anyone has seen better please link it or I won‚Äôt believe it.
...maybe I don't actually know how to snowboard
‚ÄúAm I carving or just skidding?‚Äù
There was a way longer video of this guy posted awhile ago - dudes an absolute animal. This showcases pretty much none of his skill

Edit: found it. Way better version https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/s/6k6aG6Cyvk
This is definitely how you blunt chud some snow bunnies.
Ok I tried doing this shit this past weekend and ate it every time. How is this man licking snow on carves?
It was the switch front layback that got me.
Smh that slope has a family
Bro fucked the shit out of that one turn. Save some ‚Äòtang for the rest of us!
This dude is on another level
The switch carve with that stance. That combo is really impressive
That 360 into the toe side carve was fucking CLEAN
Doesn't count, his hand touched the ground.
Dudes giving Knapton a run for his money
I can make some sharp carves but man when he hit it switch‚Ä¶ a single tear dropped from my eye
![gif](giphy|13n7XeyIXEIrbG)
That reverse carve into a backwards heel carve, i fucking lost it
That nose press front 3 in there‚Ä¶what..?!!

Try that on my shitty 12 year old brick of a board, buddy!

Can anyone tell me what board he‚Äôs riding?
gonna get frostbite on his pecker.
...and with a (massive) posi/posi stance.  


my back knee would not be happy with that.
Dumb question but as someone who isn't an expert, is carving more fun than not carving? If I'm just trying to have a good day boarding with friends, is it worth trying to learn/improve at carving? There are a lot of other things to work on like jumps, butters, etc.
Doesn't matter how good you snowboard, if you listen to this trash you should be shot.
I can‚Äôt be the only one that thinks this style of riding looks stupid.
I can do what he does going down. But when he went backwards carving. WTF broo. That so fucking sick
Ugly ass board
Yo what‚Äôs up with Japanese snowboard culture. All the content out of there is straight from the baby park or something dangerously close to  ski ballet like this

This is criminal

This is what everyone who gives advice on how to carve thinks they ride when in reality they look exactly like the noob posting the video‚Ä¶.

Bro think he ryan knapton
Is he carving? Or skidding?
Hand to ground. Count em as falls ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This is the dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever seen. This guy would be laughed off the mountain in the 90s. Ski boots don‚Äôt belong on a snowboard
He angle grinding those edges every run or how is possible?? Very stylish
Holy shit..
I love QWOP
Crazy!! Fuck!
Sheeh
What kind of board do you need for this type of carving ?
Thats Some gnar carve steez
Makes it look so easy‚Ä¶.. I make it look like a ‚Äúplane crash‚Äù!!!!
Noice!  That‚Äôs using the edge
Dude doesn't ride switch. Switch rides him.
I wonder what the edges are set at? Like what‚Äôs the base and side? Feel free to chime in anyone who knows
This looks exhausting
The look back switch backsides üòç
Good shit!
Probly cleanest, thinest pencil line I‚Äôve seen. There isn‚Äôt even a transition line in between turns, straight vertical edge to vertical edge. Dude is nuts
Ski patrol is coming to rescue
Nah man! Your posture is all wrong
Do you need specific kind of board to do that? üò≥
He wanted a snow cone but didn‚Äôt wanna stop
It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a snow bender
The snowboard jacket store downhill loves him
pure crime
Let‚Äôs see how he does on some east coast pow
How
Wow, definitely traveled back in time to serve those carves up and pave the way for his future self.  Mind bending.
And me, sliding downhill on my buttüòÇ
Wow so fucking stylish !!! so they call you the shredder ? Lol
Nasty
Turning and burning üî•
That just looks like so much fun. Way to make it look easy. I‚Äôm sure it took lots of practice to get there.
Sickest POV ride I‚Äôve seen yet!
Anyone have an ID on the board?
Anyone got the song remix? Lol
I just want to know wtf kind of bindings he's using cause those things must be responsive as fuck
What is this?
He‚Äôs got that alpine stance setup
Truly living life on the edge

Criminal!
üçÜ‚ùÑÔ∏è
He‚Äôs like a snow bender
Id get hard
Skier here and I‚Äôll vouch for that. 

Question: how much did he have to crime to get that good?
As a skiier who likes to bomb the runs, I would be very confused seeing a snowboarder have intercourse with the mountain. But I guess I just don‚Äôt understand snowboarders!
Play the video at normal speed and without the TikTok-ified music and I'm in.
nope. actually, just the opposite. I fucking hate this shit. bring on the downvotes, it‚Äôs my opinion and I‚Äôm sticking to it. 

people who snowboard like this, in my experience, are inconsiderate assholes who think the mountain is there for no one other than themselves.
Yup
I could watch this all day as a skier.
Always nice to come across a rider that inows how edges work.
Idk that he's better, but Ryan Knapton is a fucking dog.
Check out Toy Films on YouTube. Many vids of folks carving it up like this in Japan.
Look up Dylan Gamache
[Ryan Knapton](https://youtu.be/h70kgLV2_Vg?si=gM8GHH22isqH_mZS)
>Ryan Knapton on youtube
Me: "I've been snowboarding for 15 years I'm a pretty advanced rider"

*Sees the video*

"Actually I'm pretty shit, I consider myself more of a skier anyway".
Keep your dick off the snow
"might want to get a little more weight on that front foot bud, and maybe try to keep your arms in a little"
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a few times your knees could have been bent more. Also you should work on keeping your arms down by your sides‚Äù
Nice.
don't know what this means but sounds cool
Buy a carving board, wear hard carving boots and proceed to carve like that. Otherwise you won't.
He has a specialized hammerhead shape board that is very specifically made for this type of riding.

Japanese also come up with some wacky shit. Some JP riders use custom machined titanium replacement discs called [PlatePIA](https://www.platepia.com/en/platepia10). We‚Äôre talking $300 USD discs that may cost more than the bindings. Not sure if this guy uses them, but wouldn‚Äôt shock me. 

Most importantly he‚Äôs invested more thought, time, and energy into the craft. When Japanese decide they want to be good at something, they don‚Äôt half-ass it.
Look up Ryan Knapton and check out his boards.   


Stiff board + A alot of edge.
As someone who‚Äôs been on around 15 snowboarding trips, my mind can‚Äôt wrap around how to move my body like this or my feet without one stupid edge catch that sends me flying into my next concussion.
Bros practically falling down the hill
No fucking joke
I‚Äôm not seeing the comparison. This post is all about carving. That ballet stuff is about ballet on snow. 

Am I missing something?
thanks for this
Best i can do is tree-fiddy
You can lay some deep trenches on a regular board, especially toeside. Heelside will be similar but most likely not as deep and once you start spinning into those revert carves, you probably will lose your edge once you go that deep.
Ya this one 
https://youtu.be/UmGQb7sBA9o?si=Txz6q5NUuKjaoKao
He‚Äôs probably using a bc stream hammer shaped board. It‚Äôs odd in Korea and Japan they are crazy about this euro carving style it‚Äôs like all they do
Sidecut radius is in the 12.5 meter range on that board
It‚Äôs a gray desperado snowboard from japan
Maybe a Virus carving board?
Carving is extremely fun. The sort of g-forces you can generate are amazing once you get good at it.
Yes, way more fun even (especially?) for casual riding. Without question the number one skill resort riders should be prioritizing beyond the absolute basics.¬†

He‚Äôs in regular soft boots. Just very high angles.
[something like this](https://oxess.ch/collections/softboot) although I‚Äôd recommend hardboots if you want to do carving like this. They give much more response and stability at higher angulation of the board as well as translate more power into the board.

Oxess offers special boards for such boots as well
Flux XV front and Flux CV rear, or its the other way. I do know he does XV and CV

I dont carve like him because I havent done that much crime, but im guessing at least one grand theft auto to get this good.
This is a multiple time homicide offender, quite clearly
I‚Äôd guess at *least* 10
mean to do a couple flat ground 360s and lie on the ground what???
Some of us just like to enjoy the ride, instead of trying to finish as quick as possible
We are crime people. Do you understand now?
There's a better version on his Instagram, or instacrime as the kids call it
Im glad i watched this muted. üòÅ
the whole point is to have fun. he's not taking up the whole run or anything.
Is being a fucking dog here good or bad? I feel like lacking context lol
Ryan Knapton is a fucking dude. would love to run into him at breck on a trip sometime. I dont give AF about any celebs but I would pester the shit out of him on a lift haha
Links?
Ryan is an OG and I watched all of his how to videos when I was learning. But this guy has better flow and style.
Dang he looked like a video game for a while on that
no disrespect to ryan, but this guy's better.
Knapton has his own style for sure and mad respect for how he rides. But I've found several Japanese carvers who I think are better than he is (Kazunori Hirama, Naoyan, Zamakun to name a few)
I can‚Äôt. It just feels so good
He might have a vajeen?
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative and get's the people going
also use a posi/posi stance.
He‚Äôs not using hard boots. High angles, soft boots.
He rides soft boots
You don‚Äôt need a carving specific board to carve like this‚Ä¶ you get a carving specific board when you can carve like this.
What‚Äôs the distinction in the construction of the board and boots?

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
He's a softboot carver. Wears Ride Insano boots and Flux XV bindings
kkkkento uses riser/carving plates--brand is called T-Plate out of Japan
It‚Äôs all in the leg strength. He is just overpowering everything working against him, dominating the board so to speak.
Heelside is tougher carving for reasons I can't figure. Theoretically on a twin it should be the same if you can posture and bend the board properly. I can lay deep lines toeside but on steeper grades my heels start to skid. Drives me nuts.
Thats actually a huge sidecut for how snappy he's making those turns look.
Thanks but I'm having a hard time imagining what feeling the g-forces is like?

I don't know, that looks like at least a bakers dozen worth of crime
And it has to be at least 4 stars, if not 5
I mean he's definitely killing it.
Hey man, I still enjoy the ride even if it‚Äôs quick! It‚Äôs others that may find my style less than pleasurable.
Yes. We like to crime and take our time.

Edit: that sounded a lot worse when I read it out loud.
I think in America its a good thing, definitely not what it means in Australia.
He's pretty fucking gnarly

It's a good thing in the US. Kinda like being called "THE shit" versus just "shit."

I don't even snowboard (have skied for 30 years) but a slightly posi/posi stance seems way more intuitive for carving. It's how I ride a downhill board and cruiser skateboard.
Whilst you can logically carve any board to some extent, such extreme angles and turning radii do require more specific gear, there's no denying that. I wouldn't be able to eurocarve with any board, specifically more narrow ones because I'd just boot out. 

And if gear didn't matter at all, why do the best carvers (e.g. Knapton) use boards that are so specifically tailored to carving? Because it makes a big difference. If gear didn't have a material impact, why the hell would carving boards even exist? And no, it's not a marketing gimmick either.
Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me dawg. This type of carving and edge lock isn't going to be found in non-carving boards. There is a reason it looks like he is defying physics and it's not just his skillset. He can do the things he's doing because he has an extreme carving board with hard boots, lower binding angles, single radii sidecuts, locking bindings and are hella firm. You can hard carve with a standard board, but this sort of extreme carving isn't that. 

I'm thinking this is a custom Virus X-treme Carver but also look up the SWOARD Extremecarver for more fun.
This guy is not using hard boots. The board itself will be stiff, with a large sidecut radius and long effective edge (short nose and tail).
They're made to carve like that. And only do that as they are pretty limited otherwise.
Cpt Insano strikes again
The reason is pretty simple actually. The two are different because the mechanics of your knee joint are different in the two turns. If our knees could bend both ways, you'd be equally as good in heelside turns.
Watch the video and see how low he gets. To get that low you need a combination of speed and turn radius. He‚Äôs turning very tight so he‚Äôs not going all that fast. The combination of speed and turn result in a lot of force on the board, that‚Äôs the g-force I mean. Similar to riding a bike, the faster/tighter you turn the more you need to lay it over.

Duckstance is still a more balanced position. 

It's more suited to a majority of riders. 

posi/posi means you're basically never riding switch. It's only for hardcore carvers or people who just bomb down the mountain.
Facepalm indeed. I think nearly anyone can benefit from turning the back foot in till about -6, 9 and turning that foot a little further than +15.
What's the suggested setup for beginners these days? I worked in a rental show 20 years ago and we were going +15 0.
He has higher angles not lower. Most carving specialized boards are running complicated multi-radius sidecuts. Like most Japanese riders he is using soft boots at hard boot-ish angles.
if you can't carve well then buying all the kit isn't gonna make you a better carver, it's just gonna make you a shitty carver with a good setup.
What can they not do that a traditional board can?
Posi-posi and open/square shoulders helps solve this problem to an extent. You're no longer using your knees as a primary fulcrum, you start to use your hips side-to-side. It creates much more symmetry between body positioning on toeside and heelside
I see, interesting
yea, like if someone does something crazy (a good crazy), you would say they‚Äôre an absolute dAWG. on the flip side, if someone does something really shite, you respectively say, YOU‚ÄôRE DOG

Yea that‚Äôs my natural stance on a skateboard too so I tried that setup on day 1 and learned pretty quick
Nor is being a great carver with a shitty setup going to make you look like this. Your point?
Anything but carve.
They're closer to ski boots than board boots. Very hard.
It feels a bit like being on a roller coaster, which I think we can all agree is fun!
Yep this is how I live my life right here
> Duck is balanced when you‚Äôre standing still. When I ride a snowboard, I‚Äôm moving forward. 

Nope, you're standing still on a board. 

 

>Duck is preferable for only one reason - riding switch.  
>  
>Duck is absolutely not preferable for the majority or riders. The vast majority of snowboarders never ride switch. There is no bio mechanical advantage to that position. In fact it is disadvantageous when carving. You don‚Äôt have to bomb to carve. The guy in the video is not bombing.

Nope he's not bombing. He's licking distance away from the ground which as I wrote, is hardcore carving. 

You're making the assumption that carving is the only thing snowboarders do. Dunno where you ride, but here in Japan it's still a pretty niche/advanced thing to do. The majority of riders fall into the beginner/intermediate category. As such, duck stance is by far an easier stance for getting rotation in your turns. You turn with posi/posi using tilt - something most beginner and intermediate riders have trouble doing. 

Riding switch for a majority of riders is still very important if you get yourself in a situation you can't ride out of. 

 

>You ever see anyone ride a surfboard duck?

That's kind of irrelevant to bring up. You ever see someone surf with their feet bound to the surfboard?
Uh, surfers ride with their back foot at zero, most definitely NOT pointed forward.
I've been riding duck because I wanted to learn both sides evenly (pretty even now). How do I know what settings is right for me when switching to posi/posi?

Yeah, but you aren't going to carve like THAT without the equipment. You can carvy carve carve all you want, but it isn't going to look like that. You won't have the ability to edge pop and reverse bend/crossover without the gear. Sorry, but physics just doesn't work like that.

 Extreme carving started with standard boards and you can certainly lay your armpit down without special equipment. But you're not going to do much of that video without the gear.
And just how many riders do you think are hitting the groomers on first tracks vs. the amount of casual weekend warriors who get to the resort at 10?

> You think carving is niche? That statement indicates how clueless you are.

Prove me wrong. A majority of snowboarders fall in the beginner/intermediate category and will struggle to do any real carvin

Strong agreement.
I‚Äôm old and my board/bindings are Ancient. And I‚Äôm the fastest MF‚Äôr on the mountain.
The board is a 1997 Burton 162 with Burton X-base bindings. I bought it new. I‚Äôve ridden it everywhere: Whistler, Fernie, Banff, Mt. Tremblant and my local hill Blue Mountain(not a mountain). 

The board itself is a weapon. When I ‚Äòhit the wax‚Äô right nobody can keep up to me. The bindings are carbon fibre. They are as thin as cardboard and as strong as steel. I‚Äôve had to Frankenstein assorted straps over the years and the heel cup straps are strips of bicycle tire. I replaced the toe straps last year with Burton Toe Caps. Love those! All of the mounting hardware is original. Burton only made bindings in carbon fibre for two years. 

My boots are 15ish year old Burton SL6‚Äôs. Still firm and comfortable with a cool black lizard skin finish. 

The board itself is a light weight bullet. Every top sheet scratch and repaired ptex rock hit is a reminder of all the epic(and shitty) days I‚Äôve ridden it. I sometimes think about replacing my setup but why?

I‚Äôm a 60 year old criminal on the hill that started snowboarding in 1983/84. They‚Äôre gonna have to pry this board from my cold dead hands when I finally leave this Mortal Coil.
You're 60 and you're still ripping that Johan I'm gonna go ahead and bestow the **crime people** flair just because that's fuckin rad.
If they don't bury you with that board I will haunt your family when I die.
Man sorry - but honestly I laughed cause I just saw the short description, went through the photos and the last was of you and I didn‚Äôt expect it!!

That‚Äôs fucking awesome, I started/learned late and just feeling comfortable doing any thing and just trying to get comfortable with MORE speed and better carving.  

Kudos and respect to you sir! Be safe and to someone point above, bury you with that board!

EDIT: I misread the Im old as you were talking about the board, but glad I did cause I enjoyed the laugh. Good shit still!
Title made me think this was going to be some 45 year old douche, then I flipped to that last photo. Shred Gawd.
You sir, are legend.  Here‚Äôs to many more epic and shitty days fellow criminal.
Man, someone at Burton needs to see this and honor this man. I bet they got some gear in the warehouse for you.
Can I get you a beer sir? Or perhaps you‚Äôd like to use me as a rug when putting your boots on at the car?
Stay rad forever my man üëä
I have johans old Iron Maiden shirt he left at island lake. Take care of those old bindings‚Ä¶
You're my hero
Right to jail king
This rules, keep it up!!
You rock, I love to see people riding quirky setups and fixing shit themselves.
Your an absolute dog
Boarding in a surgical mask is crazy. üòÇ

Rocking it, man. Looks like a nice spot you found.
You‚Äôre an awesome smooth criminal.
Well yeah dude you got üî• on the bottom of your board. No one stands a chance
Shred on sir
Corn Dog Franz.
And IF you do die, you will come back and haunt the bastard that rides your board üòé I ride 1998 Burtons... Those older boards were made to last and shred like mad.
Fuck ya. those cf bindings are beautiful, see you on the hill
I find this post funny because some MFrs on here swear their boots are shot after 60 days and board is toast after 2 seasons. This dude riding a board older than Johnny Tsunami üòÇ
keep on crime-ing, bro.  i‚Äôm not too far behind you
THAT'S HISTORY RIGHT THERE! 
THAT is the Johan Olofsson pro model. 
That board is awesome. It was my first board in, indeed, '97. After years of abuse it still serves me, turned it into a lamp in my garage.
See what Olofsson does on that board in a movie called Terra Base 5: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_W3Vl4prN_I
3000 feet, 50 degrees, 35 seconds.
The whole TB series is awesome, changed how avalanche experts looked at what's safe and doable.
Thanks OP! Took me back. Cheers

Experience  + Technique > Expensive equipment + lack of experience
Thanks for inspiring future generations to pursue a life of crime!
Not uncommon.   Any Burton with that binding pattern worth holding onto.  I bought my 3rd supermodel last fall.
Holy shit. I remember dreaming of this line. Flipping through the paper catalogue I picked up from my local board shop. This hit me in the nostalgia harder than anything. Thanks for sharing friend!
im going to tell my kids this was their grandfather
RIPPER
Yo this is fucking awesome
Hey let‚Äôs go, Blue Mountain People!!
I see that GoPro mount on your helmet. Let‚Äôs get a video of you committing some crimes, for the people! ü§úü§õ
The bike tire strips are insane
Holy crqp‚Ä¶someone riding gear older than mine.
Crime father ü´°
Had that Johan on a pro form deal. It was the best board I ever had but it delam'd on the nose so I warrantied it and ended up selling the replacement new (plus it was the blue topsheet which was epic). Miss that board to this day.
That Johan is so sick. I remember seeing it at full tilt and it was such a massive hog.
Fuck yeah brother. Still got my '02 or '03 custom and a few sets of decidedly not carbon bindings for it. It's better art than board at this point.
I knew it was you. You Ol Salty Legend you
Absolute king.
This guy fucks
U what!!! Damn dude!! I still have my 2004 burton omen and bindings, maybe its time to dust that baby off! 

Keep it real!
Shred the gnar old balls! Ha ha I've got my old 50/50 from 97 that I still rock from time to time she's a classic
I saw the sign for the Upper Orchard Glades and new it was Blue (not a) Mountain!

I hope to see you ripping it up on the hills for years to come. I'll be the brown dude on a janky old set up just mellow cruising, and likely getting lapped by you.
This is rad. Papa shred.
Gnarly
The Johan 63 is my favorite board of all time.  By far the fastest and most stable board for high speeds that I‚Äôve ever been on.  Wish I never sold it decades ago
Epitome of steez in the flesh
This criminal is my hero and I would follow you any day into battle
You are one of the coolest people I‚Äôve never met
Wow, I haven‚Äôt heard the words Johan Olofson since high school. Legendary rider, legendary ride.  

I keep saying on this sub, it‚Äôs not about the equipment as much as it is the rider. However, when I upgraded from an early 2000‚Äôs Burton Nu to a modern Burton Process and bindings, I noticed the board felt lighter. I‚Äôm still super fast on both - Does weight really matter if you‚Äôre just bombing hills and not doing tricks? Probably not. In fact, heavier might be better at high speeds.
To all posers claiming they ‚Äúbomb hills‚Äù: Go home. This dude bombs hills and probably invented hill bombing.
I still have my 1997 Nidecker board with Flow bindings, am not as old as you but I can still keep up with the young ones. Fun times when they see my face when I take my helmet off!
I love this.  I'm in my 50s! along with my wife.  Didn't learn until I was an adult so I've not been shredding as long as you, but just love it!   Got my kids on early!
Instant legend, just like Johan.
That Johan board is one of the best boards I‚Äôve ever ridden. And it was a few years old when I got on it. Ride it till the exes rip off.
Man, that's badass.

Obviously you've got your shit more than handled. But, I guess I'd just say that at your age, you are really putting a lot of faith in that old, beat to shit gear. If anything fails and you have a real bad fall because of it, your recovery will be brutal.
I‚Äôve had my lib-tech skate banana with flow bindings for almost 2 decades. Props for sticking with the deck!
Dope, you're from my area, Blue Mountain is 'bout an hour from me. Good ridin', my dude!
This guy boards

My father‚Äôs bindings he got as prototypes in I believe 96, I might be wrong though. Interesting to see that there are more out there.
Im you too. But slowing a little at 56 n a couple mild surgeries plus young kids.
Ego out of control. Not a good look‚Ä¶
Id be concerned about those bindings. There‚Äôs a reason why nobody is making carbon fiber bindings and 90s carbon fiber wasn‚Äôt anywhere in the same league as modern CF.
You're rad man ü§ô
Bruv.
Those boots look like they‚Äôre made for making flapjacks.
My board is about that old.. I'll race you.
What angles do you have your bindings set at?
ü§ò
Meet me in the terrain park, well have a throwdown.
What do you recommend? Duck or posi posi?¬†
Hell ya big dawg.
Fantastic!! Shred on ü§òüèª

Respect
hell yeah
Legend üèÇüèÇüèÇ
Fuck yeah man, love seeing shit like this! Keep up the grind
I‚Äôm getting mad Godfather vibes.
Probably worth buying new bindings, you don‚Äôt want them to fail on you while you‚Äôre sending it.  The straps are likely brittle.  I‚Äôve had it happen to me, with straps that appeared to be in much better shape than that.
Love it!  I can't quit my 1997 Burton Balance either.  I just bought step ons because my last boots disintegrated but now I need to find some 3d reflex discs so I can keep the ole girl in the rotation.
üí©
Why are you wearing a mask?
Wouldn‚Äôt more weight help you move faster down the mountain?
I love when people think speed is the only justification of skill. I'm sorry but that's a skiers mentality.
[deleted]
Same.  No laminate issues 25 years on my Burton BMC.
That is a serious relic!
 These comments show the benevolence of the boarding community.
Good for you! Like I‚Äôve always said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the board, dude‚Äù
Unexpected criminal in last slide. We salute you sir.
Ah buddy don't be afraid of new gear!  A lot of stuff doesn't get better, but some does.  I cycle through boards as old as this, and as new as this year.  It's really all just about having fun now, there's always gonna be some young kid willing to go faster than you!  

Try some newer boards, they're actually getting some things right!  I got a Donek built to my specs this year and I'm loving it.  Has more edge than my 1998 Supermodel 181...
Why didn‚Äôt you weigh the boots on your kitchen scale?
Low key you should for sure upgrade. The ¬†new tech will make you a salvage (Plus easier on every joint in your body) ¬†keep shredding g bro!
You‚Äôre supposed to start your thread asking if you‚Äôre streezy, & then talk about your gear.  Hehe.  Keep ripping it up!
You are an inspiration!

This is awesome.
I still ride my 1999 Supermodel 59‚Ä¶.with cant plates. I‚Äôm hitting up the canyons, solitude and Brighton for a trip next week. If it ain‚Äôt broke‚Ä¶.
Also I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô5 135 pound female that can lay a carve on this board but also fly by you in the trees :)

This is absolutely what it‚Äôs all about üëäüèª pure boarding
Respect.
I'm 55 and still tearing it up OG style.
That's a pretty sick setup overall for the Northeast, no wonder you rage.
I got the same board but white.
You‚Äôre a certified dawg my dude
Fuck yeah. Get it, grandpa.
I bet those flames melt the whole slope and shut down the resort
Fuuuuck yea
Thank you, sir! You just made a 30-something boarder feel like he might yet have many good years on the slope.
Whatever helps you sleep at night.
Is it not completely sprung at this point?  It'll still hold a carve without chattering?

Are you appropriately sized for 162?  My appropriately sized boards got totally used up.  But if it was me on a 162 the board would be like "are you in yet"

Damn son thats wicked. But speed is not an indicator of how good you are unfortunately
I just hope I‚Äôm still boarding at your age!
Imma keep an eye out for this board the next time I‚Äôm at Blue.
A god amongst men
It's the rider not the ride. My dad is on skis nearly as old as me and I can barely keep up. He's 69, I'm 38. He's probably just trying to get away from his criminal sons.

Keep shreddin dude.
Love everything except the helmet GoPro mount. That‚Äôs how schumi became a vegetable.
Have a pair of mission bindings with cap straps from years ago. They literally fell apart up the mountain, the plastic crumbled to dust. Had to throw them away
Dude. Way cool! Ya ever make it up New England way and want to leave another in the dust let me know!

This was like 15 years ago
Sick board man!  Love it.  What‚Äôs up with the mask though‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre going that fast down the mountain you should be able to outrun covid.

I speculate that your riding style would benefit from a jump in the present. 

Personal experience: Had for 11 years the same board, hybrid camber deformed to a vrock, heavy and bindings were super unresponsive. 
Had friends telling me ‚Äúoh man you‚Äôd be even better with a newer board.‚Äù I was ignoring them as I was still carving better than them. Yet one day I tried one of their newest boards. Started at 8:30 finished at 16:30 30 mins break in between, jumps, jibs, carves and still had a lot of energy‚Ä¶ usually at 15 my legs are gone. I understood it was time to hang it on the wall and replace it.
Is your local hill Blue Mountain in PA?
Insane condition for a 25 y/o board
‚ÄúWhat is with all these weirdly detailed photos?‚Äù I wondered as I flipped through. Then I saw the OP‚Äôs selfie and thought, ‚Äúoh fuck YEAH, dude!!! You absolute beauty!!!‚Äù

Put a big smile on my face, thank you for giving us all joy by sharing how good life looks at 60. Love it, hope to catch you around - though ideally in BC or Quebec, our little foothills here in Ontario leave much to be desired!
this reminds me of one time I was on the mountain and this really elderly guy passed me on skis with his maybe 4 year old grandkid or something just hauling with him. I was 12 at the time and was astonished to see both an actual kindergartner and elderly man pass me at the speeds they did.
I still got all my gear from when I was younger too lol. Mad props for still hitting the mountains! I hope I‚Äôm still able to board when I‚Äôm your age.

HELL YEAH OLD MAN!!!! This is what I aspire to haha.
Dude. My comment is late so I hope you see it. You remind me of this bad ass down hill mtb guy at our local that hit every jump with so much style, riding a beat up hardtail with shitty front suspension. Made us all look like a bunch of idiots with new bikes  studying techniques and shit.  Keep ripping bro. Big respect
I learned on a very similar board a couple of years ago...

Hope I will be there some day. :)

P.S. And yet, we have bunch of crybabies here, whining they are too old for jumps or park in their early 30ies.
This guy fucks, can only hope to be this rad when I‚Äôm 60!
everyone knows that flames = speed
Well, the board I understand. But the bindings... Why are you keep using it with so much makeshift repairs? Using the same boots for 15 years are surprising.
God damn I hope you start a youtube channel love to see you ride around, cool snowboard grandpa!
Legend
I‚Äôm surprised the bindings are still holding up. My last trip consisted of my bindings slowly disintegrating each run until they were unusable. Bruton we‚Äôre cool though. I got in contact with them and they sent me new parts for all the busted bits (soft plastics etc).
The scales on those boots are sick
Fuckin rad man keep shredding it! Hope to be in your shoes one day
I‚Äôll bet I‚Äôm faster than you on my brothers 170 K2 recon riser from that same era‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll rattle lift chairs and chant ‚ÄúHomer Paint Bucket the Ghost says no knuckle draggers welcome oooooo. This hill is for respectable skiers only ooooo‚Äù
They should use it as his gravestone.
The man's a lifelong career criminal and I respect that!
Haha, I almost missed out on seeing the last picture till I saw this. That was unexpectedly awesome!
This dude has been shredding since Neil Diamond debuted.
If you mean apparel then yeah, but it seems like he‚Äôs taking his board setup to the grave. I don‚Äôt think he would want to ride another setup.
A new board with pop may break his legs. I‚Äôm sure that Johan is a noodle by now.
Best comment
When I mentioned that I rode it at Fernie I didn‚Äôt mention that I did a day at Island Lake Lodge cat skiing. The top sheet scratch on the upper right was from the basket of the cat! I‚Äôve still got the now frayed pullover shirt I bought there. I wear it all the time.
That photo was taken two years ago during COVID and they wouldn‚Äôt let you on the lifts without a mask. I call that spot The Toilet Bowl. It used to be an out of bounds poach above a derelict loft. It was a hollow where the lift counterweight used to be. Now the fence has been removed and a parking lot is right there but nobody seems to ‚Äòsee‚Äô the powder bowl that forms in it created by westerly winds laden with lake effect snow off of Lake Huron. Even on busy days I get fresh tracks through it before riding onto a groomed run.
Idk man, the mask might help with the weekend warriors on the gondola that smell like Tide and farts
They had too at blue during Covid
I'm sure it's Covid times, but I actually saw a couple beginners riding with one in Japan...in 2018.  I guess if you don't own a buff and it's cold and you live in a place where masks are popular.
And that‚Äôs not cigarette smoke on the top sheet. I am a criminal after all!
Those are still the original laces.
Best kind
Blue mountain represent!!
Which Blue Mountain though?
I had an early version of a GoPro but I didn‚Äôt really like it too much. I‚Äôd forget it was up there and I‚Äôd bash the safety bar against it gettting off the lift and the picture was too wide angle. I prefer to hold my iPhone in my hand now. I tried to post some video but it wouldn‚Äôt upload.
This is how I feel about my 99/00 Custom haha. I love looking at it but unlike OP I'm not a shred god and that shit is real hard to ride.
The alter ego to my criminal intent is being a professional firefighter (Captain). I‚Äôm at work tonight waiting to battle a different beast.

I see his plates have the degree markings. Mine didn‚Äôt. Looks like he had to do a few strap replacements as well!
While the base plates are carbon fibre the heel cup is made of Tepex. It was developed for the exhaust nozzle of the jet engine of an F-16. I inspect my bindings every time I ride and the carbon fibre is holding up just fine. 

https://techcenter.lanxess.com/scp/emea/en/products/tepex/article.jsp?docId=35682241
What do you think is stronger, the 30yo carbon fiber, or his bones?
Dudes 60. I bet if he went out due to binding failure, he‚Äôll have died happy.
I‚Äôm not as old as this guy but my Burton board and bindings are slightly older than his and those old brittle things snapped a couple years back while riding in deep pow. Not fun. I‚Äôd shelf these if it were me. Just not worth it.
There are no degree markings on the mounting plates. You can see little Sharpie marks on them so that I remember what to set them at when I take them off to wax and sharpen. I think it‚Äôs about 12¬∞ back foot, 27¬∞ front. I‚Äôd have to put a plastic disc in to know for sure.
Posi, posi. My kid‚Äôs always wanted me to set up their boards duck when they were younger but it always seemed odd to me. I want everything pointed downhill when I‚Äôm riding.
If any of my straps were brittle they would  snap. They‚Äôve all been replaced over the years in various locales. That‚Äôs one of the benefits of Burton equipment. I can always get a part, sometimes 25 years later. Thank you Sporting Life in Toronto for having the Burton Toe Cap in stock when I needed it 2 years ago. The beige top strap on one of the bindings was replaced at Whistler in 2012. The other one is original. And when it breaks I‚Äôll be able to replace it close to the base of the hill- because it‚Äôs Burton.
I also have a few donor pairs of bindings for parts if I need ‚Äòem.
Union makes them for their bindings, I know for sure, not sure if compatible with the step ons but maybe worth reaching out there.
That photo was 2022. Could get on the lift without one.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm old and fat as it is. The light board is nice when it‚Äôs hanging off my foot on the lift.
I‚Äôm not out showing off 180‚Äôs in the terrain park to friends. I‚Äôm out there to push myself to the limit. I think the ski trail sign in my last photo is double black diamond. That run wasn‚Äôt about speed. It was about skill.
Right? You can be the fastest person on the mountain your first day riding. It‚Äôll be your last day riding too but f‚Äôit, glory is forever.
Would you believe it was because I was eager to put everything back together yesterday to get a Tuesday afternoon session in while the kids(other people‚Äôs kids- mine are all grown up) were still in school?

I always knew my setup was lightweight but I never had a scale available. I only weighed them yesterday for shit‚Äôs and giggles. Posting about it was an afterthought. I‚Äôll throw them on the scale tomorrow when I get home from work.
This is actually the first snowboard I ever rode. I belonged to a friend of mine. It was probably 79/80. And we were smoking something that day. Some things never change.

My wife wouldn‚Äôt let me have her stand up- yet!
Yeah but are 60 years old?
Zeigler would be proud
No lie. We've found our big boss. Next time I go to Blue Mountain (not a mountain), I'll definitely make sure to check in and pay my dues.

I meant maybe some premium hardware or straps for these vintage bindings etc or maybe a duplicate of this board , but new, and yes apparel!!! Gear him out
Actually the board has a ton of action still left in it. I was going to start another thread about that board when I next wax and sharpen it with some pictures of the flex. It still rides like a dream.
I was married to that Craig guy. Johanna‚Äôs a late bloomer for us but being buds with terje we got to hang a few times.  Those old carbon binders have done you well. Craig experimented so much with the‚Ä¶.everything. But those were not as easily ground down or cut or fucked with. Ha.
And here‚Äôs the shirt!

Honestly if I was still in Ontario I would have LOOOVED to ride with you. You are probably the best border on the mountain. Keep her going
Daddio bats lefty hah.
This is awesome a real life Jekyll and Hyde! Thank you for all you do sir!
Yeah a lot has been replaced, most of the bolts aren‚Äôt even the same
what are your angles? I am thinking of transitioning from duck.¬†
I‚Äôm more worried about you coming out of your finding when you‚Äôre hauling ass.  Just saying the straps look sketchy to me, and I‚Äôd personally proactively replace them.  To each their own though.
Couldn‚Äôt I should say. Covid.
Girl don‚Äôt be a cunt
I'm just saying, speed isn't the only determination of skill. And the only people I've ever ridden with that care about speed that much, are skiers. I'm not saying you specifically think its the only skill factor but I wish more riders would get better at the basics before trying to ride fast. I can burn down any run on the mountain and keep up with just about anyone, but i would rather hit the trees and as many side hits and kickers as possible. 

Btw I live in Summit County. I've been here year round for the past almost 8 years.  I've had family living here for the last 30 years. My cousins are in the middle/high schools here. I've watched the evolution of this sport. I just want people to walk before they run. And to get away from the skier/racer mindset that speed is all that matters.
On the hill I‚Äôm a Smooth Criminal. Been doing this for 40 years- I think I‚Äôve got the speed under control. Clocked 76 km/hr at Whistler in 2012 on this board according to the ski app I was using at the time.
Definitely female in that vid. Sweet riding!
I like to ride on the very edge of the run, bashing tree branches out of my way. All the loose snow gets pushed over there and nobody rides it. They‚Äôd rather ride down the center ice. But when I get into the glades, the trees always win!
Loved seeing your video.

Right on. Shred get shredded and put out some fire üòé
This was at Whistler.

I definitely ‚Äòhit the wax‚Äô that day. You can see it in the way the sun reflects off of the base.
No lol (but I‚Äôm 50)
And I‚Äôve been running the original clicker bindings since around 98
My soft goods(apparel) is also all Burton with the exception of a Patagonia sweater I‚Äôm wearing under it. It‚Äôs all of varying vintage but I‚Äôm pretty sure that I was wearing that red shell back when I got the board. Bought the Smith googles at Fernie in ‚Äò98. The temperature on a couple of days was -30¬∞. Not windchill, actual temperature. I bought them when I needed to figure out a mask/google setup to keep my face from freezing.
We spoke a few months ago here, talking about the 1986 US Open at Stratton! I‚Äôd seen a bumper sticker from the event in someone else‚Äôs post and mentioned I had the same sticker. I misplaced it but I‚Äôm still looking for it! Hope you are having a great winter.
I actually bought the X Base‚Äôs the year before with a Burton Custom 164- because that‚Äôs what I imagined Craig designed and rode. I bought the Olofsson because I loved the graphics(lame reason) but as you can tell I Love the ride of this board.
No shit. The internet is a funny place!
My goodness - your comments brought me back to much simpler times‚Ä¶ 

What an absolute trip to see you in this thread!

Johann was a fixture in the Whistler Creekside in the mid to late 90s.  He was a nice guy and an absolute shredder - his pop was unmatched round those parts.

When his first descent down Curios George premiered (TB5?), the screams could be heard from Squamish to Pemberton. 

Never had a chance to ride with that Craig guy, but I heard he was pretty good üòâ
> I was married to that Craig guy.

You're Savina? I rode at Island Lake Lodge in '94, I think that was before Craig got involved. Wonderful place, out of my snack bracket now.

This is one of the original nuts. They were some kinda special ‚Äònever loosen on their own‚Äô nuts. I have most of them still- the ones on the toe clips are all original. I have some strange custom nut/bolt arrangements elsewhere on the bindings where I had to make repairs/replacement.
I always assumed duck stance was more of a fad when my sons were young but I guess it may be good for terrain park riding which I avoid. I‚Äôm not only old but I‚Äôm also a bit brittle. I mentioned in another reply that I believe my angles are 27¬∞ front, 12¬∞ back but my base plates don‚Äôt have markings. I‚Äôd have to put in a plastic disc to confirm.
I hear you. I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs, been riding since ‚Äò95 and also been on a ‚Äò03 Burton Omen 162 the last couple of seasons. I bought it new but didn‚Äôt like it at first so it was stored away until a few years ago.  I‚Äôm also not the most talented rider out there, almost no park, big airs, etc. but I used to race motorcycles and am sometimes the fastest guy on the mountain (depending on the mountain).  Let ‚Äòer rip.

Edit: my post above was poking fun at a now deleted post above mine that said it takes no skill to go fast.
I tell my kids, ‚Äúif you take care of your gear, your gear will take care of you‚Äù I‚Äôm nothing of the example you are, however.
Baker suks. Tell everyone. I hear you guys are having a though go as well.
He‚Äôs pretty decent. Ha.  We lived down creek side when they first built houses or condos or something I barely remember but I do remember it was 1700$ a month which in 86 or 7 was an astonishing price. Ha. Lived in Whistler one fall after camp and had a crazy Halloween out at the old rainbow lodge it was called I think.  After 10 years of summer camp I feel like Whistler had a real impact on me. Curious George.  Ha. It‚Äôs been a minute.
I‚Äôm Kelly jo.  Craig n I were together in the old days of the early 80‚Äôs then buddy‚Äôs till he died. I talked to him the day or two before he died. Gave him a good lecture about ‚Äúsnow science‚Äù and how there is no 100% proven theory‚Ä¶as he was very analytical‚Ä¶then a day later‚Ä¶super lame.
Yes I always used it because I like to ride switch, but I am mostly carving these days as well. Thank you for your response. I will try those out.¬†
I still have an old M6 asymmetric board with plate bindings.  I haven't ridden that thing in decades.  I rode a 180 race board one time and that was a blast.  Posi, Posi goes fast.
We were all shocked that day.  Seemed like he did everything right by the standards of the day and still paid the price.

I never met him but as I've been riding since 1985 he was certainly a big inspiration.
Mechanic says 4 out of 5 lugnuts is okay?
Apparently the last shop I went to tightened the lug nuts too much and one was unable to be removed. I watched them use a few impact wrenches and the largest breaker bar I‚Äôve ever seen. Now the nut is broken and they just want to put 4 out of the 5 on and call it a day. I don‚Äôt feel all too comfortable with this but wanted to see if anyone had some advice on this.

I can feel the downvotes coming but most of the advice here is bad.   
1. You can get home and around potentially forever on 4 out of 5 although i dont reccomend it but i've seen it dozens if not hundreds of times and have done it myself. it needs fixing though, every day driving you'll be fine, have a little oopsie with a curb you might have consequences.   
2. you cant just drill it out its a lug bolt and the last person that put it in cross threaded it. if it wasnt cross threaded once the head broke you could spin it out and just replace the bolt.   
3. the only way to fix it right is to replace the hub, you cant (generally) tap a hub to the next size and make no mistake these are threaded hubs.  
4. whoever INSTALLED it is responsible not the guy that broke it off (unless they are the same shop/person)   
5. the rest of the lug bolts are most likely stretched, they're not cheap (not terribly expensive either but often overlooked) but they should be replaced.   


i know there are almost a million certified master mechanics here so let the downvoting commence!
You should obviously get it fixed properly, and don't let the mechanics talk you out of getting it fixed properly even if it means a new hub.

&#x200B;

However, in my experience, there's zero chance the wheel is gonna fall off if the other 4 lugs are tightened properly. If it was my car I wouldn't blink at driving around on that for a couple while waiting for a new stud or hub to come in the mail.
I mean 4 out of 5 star isn‚Äôt to bad right?
I mean the wheel will stay on but it is not "okay", especially if they are big boy/girl mechanics that know how to do their job. Letting a car leave your shop like this is laziness at best and incompetence at worst
It‚Äôs ok for a little while but gotta fix it
Going against the grain here, it's fine if you are missing one. 

I drove a car for months missing one with highway driving included until I got around to replacing it and nothing bad happened. Obviously it's not recommended but the car is still completely fine to drive.
Replace all studs. Likely they are all stretched
There's not a huge safety concern if you run four out of five but at this point why not just pop the old one out and throw a new one in? It would literally take 5 minutes.
Get a new mechanic!!
Whining Karens world wide are shifting bricks while millions of po'folk are driving this way daily.

So would a farmer.

Don't do 80 mph, don't heavily load  your vehicle but yes, around town this is fine for a week plus..

Keep the hub cap off, pack a wrench, inspect and properly test for tightness daily if that keeps you calm.

Three nuts, triangulated, would still make it home safely.
‚ÄúCall it a day‚Äù like park the vehicle, order a new lug bolt & drill the old one out?

Because only having 80% of the bolts is unsafe & I would advise you not to drive the vehicle until 100% of them are installed & helping hold your wheel on.

Also fire your mechanic once this ordeal is resolved.
You can have one missing.
Until they can fit a new stud, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre fine
It's fine. Mines been that way for years now
Even if the wheel doesn't fall off, the uneven distribution of force (lugs not evenly spaced) will warp the wheel and eventually cause more damage to the car.
They are absolutely right 4 lug nuts are ok, but ones fucked so you can‚Äôt drive the car
You will be fine on a temp basis with 4 of 5. Would I drive it like that forever no. But I would until I got the other stud replaced. I've did it before, I would do it again if I had to.
I currently have 3 of 4 on my sentra but the bolt is still there going through the rim holding weight just no lug nut! Personally i have been driving on it for a while now! Just my experience
It's always interesting to see comments on posts like this and assuming the people are in/from USA. I go down to Mexico all the time and recently pointed to a neighbors truck who has three lugs out of 5 on a vehicle used for multi hour trips with hundreds/thousand pounds on it, and the guy laughs and says 'it's fine, no problems, been like that for years'. Sure, 5 is technically the best but people outside of America would be stoked to have 4/5 working lugs but aren't even worried when they are down to three.
So easy to fix idk why you‚Äôd risk it
My Tacoma has 4 out of 5 (booo 5 lug) nuts on it because I lost the key to my wheel locks... and by lost I mean, I left the key on the lug nut and drove off. I welded some home depot machine nuts onto the end of the wheel lock, removed them, and then never bought new. I got a new set of tires a few months back and asked if they had any spare lug nuts laying around. He says $5 each, I say I'm good.

My steelies can probably flex right through my next 100k miles without the fifth nut.
80% is a passing score
4 more than a Boeing door.
My co worker only has 4/5 on every wheel lol. You‚Äôre fine as long as the others are tight but fix it as soon as you can. I‚Äôd check tightness every drive just for peace of mind
Will it work, probably. My brother's Passat only has 4 of the 5 on all four for a very long ass time.
Until you find a mechanic...
I‚Äôve had my car with 4/5 lug nuts for about 2 years but definitely no long distance driving just locally.
Your new mechanic is clearly on bath salts and is putting your life in jeopardy.
I run 3 of 5‚Ä¶ been that way for decades‚Ä¶ got some new studs sitting here for years to replace the messed up two‚Ä¶ someday I might get around to installing them..
There's a lot of ill informed morons in here spouting information like it's gospel. The lack of mechanical understanding or frankly any clue on how an automotive shop works is insane. 

4/5 is fine. Fuck 3/5 is fine. Certainly not ideal but it'll fucking live. Not to mention that the stud breaking has NOTHING to do with this visit and everything to do with whoever touched the wheel last.
What's your mechanic formerly employed by Alaskan airlines by chance?
Yeah it‚Äôs definitely fine to me but what professional would be content with 4 out of 5? Like the whole point should be that they can do what I can‚Äôt.
Yes. It‚Äôs okay. But if he broke it? He needs to fix it. That‚Äôs, not, alright.
Lmao wtf tell em replace the lug bolt
Need to turn around and ask them , Would you drive this back home ???

Don't even try it bro..
I wouldn't even risk it,  my 2 cents
If they take the rotor off there might be enough to weld another nut too. Or heat it and use a turbo socket. 

If not going to need a new hub and wheel bearing
Meatloaf says 2 out of 3 ain‚Äôt bad.

Yes‚Ä¶ you will be ok but should get it replaced at some point.
4 of 5 is safe to drive.

But long term you will want 5/5
Idk I‚Äôve been rocking 4/5 on my 03‚Äô Subaru for the past 3 or 4 years
If you're trying to lose some concerns I have personal experience running 2 lug nuts on a 94 Honda del sol. Ran the car on closed roads to about 120mph a whole lot of times, sent it off a few jumps on a trail, and then may have daily drove it for a while. Wish we had nice cameras on phones back then. Also, ran a burnout comp with 1 lug nut on a 94 camaro but that was just once.


Edit: they both were hub centric bore as well btw.
yes 4 is totally fine. Think about it this way. They know that some people will put ridiculous amounts of weight in the back of the car so they are engineered to withstand more then that. So 5 bolts is way strong and 4 is still very strong but not as strong as 5 so just don't over load the back with hundreds of pounds of a weight set in your trunk and you will be fine. That would drive for ever like that and you would not have an issue. Is 5 better well of course but 4 will hold out I am sure almost indefinitely. This will get downvoted but I am right.
I had several cars over the years that I drove on four for the life of that vehicle. If you're not a stuntman or planning and getaway driving, four is fine.
I have been rolling four out of five on my ram pickup for probably 4 years now. Zero issues. No vibrations.
4 out of 5 mechanics would call your guy an idiot.   Its not hard to get out this stud (weld nut on and spin), if it is, replace hub or roll the dice.   I would have you sign a release before driving off . .
Drove my big V8 on 3 out of five on the rear axle for a couple months.  Not a problem.
Well, for starters, find a new mechanic. Unless this is some end-of-day, this car came in 30 min. before closing kinda deal? Any technician would fix this same day if parts are available and time permitting. Now, you can run on four lugs, but not for long. And, no credible shop is going to suggest that as a long-term fix. Too much of a chance for a liability lawsuit if shit goes sideways while you're driving. You don't have to replace the hub assembly right off the bat. First, you try drilling the old lug bolt out, and then using a thread chaser kit,  you can clean out the threads. It's hard and time-consuming work, but it usually does the trick. Had to do this myself many times on the job. But, occasionally, things go wrong. That's  when the hub and possibly your rotor would need to be replaced.
No. And don‚Äôt go back to that mechanic.
If 4 won‚Äôt hold it. 5 won‚Äôt do it any good.
I have a 2006 honda civic with only 5 lug nuts total in each rim/tire, two of them only have 4 total lug nuts on them and I‚Äôve been driving on them for nearly 3 years with no issues at all, I worked as a oil/tire tech for 3-4 years at luxury dealers and mom n pop shops, and asked around and have always been told I should be fine
Take your car to a dealership. I had the same problem, they fixed it for $120.
It‚Äôs fine
That's never ok!  Regardless of who over tightened it, they broke it!  They need to fix it!
You need a new mechanic.  That's *not* appropriate, and will lead to balance issues, if not worse.

It's *not* a big deal to drill out a stud and replace it.  I've done it on my own vehicle when I was changing brakes and broke off a stud.  So if a shade tree mechanic can do it, a *shop* should literally be able to do it in minutes.
2.1 brain cells out of 999gawdzillion is ok.
Have them pay for a tow to a shop with the mythical drill that could actually fix this.








Then tell everyone you know you never take their cars to these dumbshits.
Ask him if 3 of 4 cylinders is ok
Ok, I'll say it...

This is a very fishy story. No legitimate mechanic would say 4 outta 5 lugs is ok. Ever. No mechanic would replace an entire wheel assembly when only a lug stud is needed. Something doesn't ring true.
Absolutely unsafe. 

Engineers design a vehicle as cheaply as possible. If they could save 4 lugnuts per vehicle, at a cost of $5 each, that saves $20 per vehicle. 

Stellantis sold 347,700 vehicles in the last quarter of 2022. Thats roughly 1.2 million vehicles a year. If they could eliminate $20 from each, that would save $24,000,000 in just lug bolts/nuts, per year. I assure you that every fastener that is on your vehicle is there for a reason
If you walk in with 5 lug nuts, you should leave with 5 lug nuts. Nothing about that is okay.
If only 4 was okay then the factory would only put 4. It's not okay tell them to extract the bolt they broke. Do not leave the shop like this
If that nut cost only 5 pence, and they make 100,000 cars per year, that is a saving of 50 grand over a 10 year production run. They wouldn't fit 5 unless it was absolutely necessary. Hence why some cars have 4 or even 3 if they can get away with it in the design.
Don't do that. You want all 5 lug bolts cause it's designed to be secure by 5 lug bolts. Any compromise on that is a compromise on safety. Do NOT drive that around for a long period of time if you do. I always treat everyone's cars like my kids are getting in it. I would not let my kids get in a car knowing there is a missing lug bolt. They didn't try to get that out either. If they did, the rotor would be off and they would have tried to run it out the other side. That's what I'd do. Next is drilling and tapping it, after that, needs a new hub if all else fails.
Oh it'll be fine. They'll get you all the way to the scene of the crash!

In all seriousness, I'd definitely have that fixed (and I'd replace all of them at the same time).
Nothing will happen for a few days, but not ok long term.
Its okay to drive it to a different mechanic to get it fixed
Absolutely not safe.
I can say you that much, wouldn't pass MOT/roadworthyness inspection. Interpret that as you wish. I wouldn't drive that, there is a reason why the manufacturer put there 5 lug nuts, especially since you have now a uneven clamp of the wheel.
I would suggest to report him
It takes less than five minutes to replace a broken stud and they didn't? Wow...
For now yes‚Ä¶get an easy out drill kit and reverse that lug. A 12 year old can do it!
STOP get a new mechanic.


That‚Äôs a lot of risk to be taking driving without the items that secure your TIRE. To your vehicle‚Ä¶.. please for the sake of my family and kids remove the nut and replace.

‚ÄúSorry it was an accident‚Äù won‚Äôt cover any accidents caused by it.
Can you? Sure...to drive home and park it. Other than that fix it or don't drive it.
It‚Äôs engineered to be hold by 5 lug nuts. Do you want to risk your life? Get them to replace it. It might cost some money but I‚Äôd have it done. You can always take your chances, thought.
Ask him if 4 out of 5 fingers is ok.
It had 5 on it for a reason‚Ä¶
Negative ghostrider!!
ITT: illiterate rednecks.
Absolutely not, 5 is hardly enough
No, not at all. 20% of your wheel will not be fastened to the rotor. So when you take a turn or move your steering wheel at all, your rim will be trying to rip itself off of your rotor. Tell the stupid asshole that broke it off they need to fix it, because that will endanger your life.
I had 1 out of 6 broken on my truck. I wasn't comfortable driving 4 miles across town at 30 mph.
Mechanic is an idiot. Go to a mechanic that won‚Äôt give you unsafe advice.
Looks like someone didn‚Äôt use a center punch before drilling.
Take the brake disc off they can get it with stilsons
Do you want us to guess which one is bad?
That‚Äôs terrible what happened. Time for a new mechanic maybe‚Ä¶?
Put 4 out of the 5 on and call it a last day
Wtf no, it's not hard for them to drill and extract it. If they don't know how to do that, then holy hell they're just masquerading as mechanics.

If they were pressed in, that would require removal of the hub entirely, at which point all 5 would be replaced, but these look like they're studs unless I'm mistaken so extraction couldn't be easier.
You need a new mechanic. It might be okay temporarily, but they‚Äôre designed to have all the lugs secured with a lugnut.
Temporary okay but you still need 5
Does the shop know that a drill and extractor kit is a thing?
Driving home like this WILL warp your rotor, and could cause other damage. Please have them fix this, and find a new mechanic. If they don't have a welder, they will likely need to replace the hub.¬†
4 is better than 3 out of 5. But from a liability standpoint  I‚Äôm impressed they‚Äôre doing what they‚Äôre doing.
I just want to remind you we still have 2 out of 3 branches of government‚Ä¶and that ain‚Äôt bad!
Ask them to sign a document saying it's safe and they will be liable for property damage and injury. I'll bet they choose to fix it then.
Yes it would be fine to drive it like that. But I would only drive it like that if I did it. I‚Äôd let them pay for an Uber ride home well they fix it.
Technically it‚Äôs ok in a pinch if you need to get somewhere, even 3/5 is ok then. But you really need to get it fixed. Simply gamer it out and pull a new one through with a nut. It‚Äôs pretty simple.
Easy to replace
wtf
Actually 1 is meant to be replaced in this kind of situation so no hard feelings
I unknowingly drove my Corvette on 4/5 lug nuts for a few months, but I don't recommend it. We all know that having all of them will work. Why roll the dice with your life and your car on the line? It's a PITA to get the piece of a bolt out, but it needs to be done. I am mostly sure that you'd be OK on 4/5 for a short time, but I don't recommend it
4 out of 5 mechanics would recommend
The thing to replace here first is your mechanic.
So they tried to drill it out, messed up and are now saying you have to pay for their oopsie?
Broken bolt was cross-threaded and/or overtightened, therefore whoever tightened it last is the one who should be on the hook.  Hub is likely compromised.  Would be suspicious of the other bolts since the same guy touched them.

Driving with 4 out of 5 is not super likely to result in wheel-off, provided the other 4 are secured.  Can you trust the same guy that messed up the one to not destroy the others?  Also, you will be more likely to end up with a warped brake rotor and thus shorter brake pad life, vibrations, reduced brake performance, etc.
It sounds like you would be better off without them repairing it to be honest!! If that is their best attempt just let them refit the wheel with 4 bolts and drive it home.
I would drive on 4 bolts short term with no problem , then find a mechanic who can easily repair it
A lug nut is not brain surgery, they broke it. Have them fix it! To not break things is why you go to a competent mechanic.
Drunk ass old man drove around like this for most of my childhood. That was an old crusty 85' Crown Vic. Tires shops never gave him any shit about it. I've done it once or twice before too in a pinch. Seen crackheads do it with 3 on a Dodge Neon. So basically, drunks and dope monsters do it this way. Dunno if that's for you, but in a pinch, it'll go 40 miles from and to the shop. 

For emergency, it'll do, but for safety, go the long way and stand by for the part. Besides, not many modern vehicles are built like an 85' Crown Vic to include the studs. My butthole would clinch a just little more knowing I was doing it on a modern car.
For god sake, that's likely a 15 minute job to sort!

Load of penetrating oil, drill through it and screw in an extractor.

Not exactly rocket science!
If the current shop is not the last one you went to, then the current shop isn't responsible. No mechanic has a crystal ball to tell them if a lug nut/lug stud is crossthreaded BEFORE they remove it. So your options are limited. You can: 
A.) Have current shop document the issue, and take it to the former shop to express your displeasure and try to hold them accountable and have them repair it.

B.) Have the current shop repair it, or take it to a totally different shop and have them repair it, and just pay for it out of your pocket. It's money but at least it's peace of mind.

Or C.) Take it like it is, drive it, do nothing about it, and lose sleep over whether the rest of your lug studs are okay or not.


If this was my car and I was not in the position to repair it myself (I do it for a living but that's beside the point) I would take it as-is to get home, then do some research and decide on a reputable shop. I would then take it to said shop, explain the situation, and request them to replace the affected hub and all of the lug studs (for that hub, not for the entire car) . I believe that solution would bring me the best peace of mind, if it were my car.
Okay for sum to agree with, but for me I cry fowl, look at the hub, lug bolts! Not nuts, a nut would require a stud!
If it was remotely true, the really smart engineer that designed that vehicle part would had designed it with 4 lugnuts.

Its your safety behind the wheel, dont cheap on it.
Yeah, you could replace the entire hub, or bang that broken stud out, fix it for about 10$.
Looks like there's plenty of bolt left for an easy extraction to check for cross threading.

Could always remove the caliper with bracket to remove the rotor for even more grip on the light bolt.

Surprised they didn't give it a try and went straight to suggesting hub replacement.
I've had this happen to 3/5. I used a screw extractor, and I hammered a hole directly in the center with punch. Used a drill but to start the hole , made it large enough for the extractor, then hammered the extractor in the hole and used the T handle it came with to turn it out. Took 30 minutes rode like that 2 years.
Your mechanic is either lazy or unqualified.  Im not a mechanic, i am a metal worker, and it wouldn't take me 10 minuttes to get that bolt out.
The shop broke this‚Ä¶? 

Several people with the largest breaker bar you‚Äôve ever seen means they broke it off. 

They should remove and replace the stud.
I drove for about 4 months on 4/5. Seems like a decent mechanic not trying to hit you with extra repairs not really needing immediate attention or just lazy to get that sucker out lol
4 out of 5 dentists agree.
They would replace if it was mine. Had it happen twice on a truck and trailer. You‚Äôre no longer easy money. They rather just move on to next customer.
Three of five is ok to back out of the garage
I think you need to find another mechanic
No.
No, I know some people say it‚Äôs not true but I have had it happen on 2 cars, missing a lug nut will cause your rotors to warp. I would find a new wrench turner, I mean if they aren‚Äôt concerned with a missing lug nut what else are they going to skip over ? Changing out a wheel stud is pretty easy.
It's fine for a little while, but I would get them to write it up, and then give the shop that last had the wheel off the chance to fix it.
OK hear me out, the only reason I‚Äôm saying this is because I have done it in the past and was successful (may not work in your situation but if you‚Äôre able, it‚Äôs worth a try) what I did was drill a hole into the center. get a bit of weld into the hole and weld another bolt head onto the top. Then try again immediately while the hub is still hot. I don‚Äôt know the physics of it, but my assumption is that it came out easier due to the heat. Also I assume the hole bored through the centre allowed the metal to twist/compress a little so it was no longer as tight when previously attempted. (I did not use an impact. I used a breaker bar because I was scared that my weld would break off. (mind you the first time the weld did not hold, but the second time long behold it came out. Almost too easily in fact.

Edit: the biggest complication I see here is that yours broke off pretty close to the hub, and I am not sure if you will be able to weld it without welding the threaded part to the hub. Worst case you could also drill a hole into the centre of the bolt head to allow a weldable area, although may not be as strong considering it would be in the center.
After watching whistlin diesel I‚Äôm convinced 1/2 of your lug nuts are unnecessary and wheel spacers are fine, even when you bolt 5 together for the sweet sweet minty dope doppity dope dope sick look dude

Feel free to watch his old duramax videos, boosted launches with like 3 lug nuts‚Ä¶ he even did a lugnut-less boosted launch, yes he made it 6‚Äùs and landed on pavements ü§£üòÜ
Pay them to change the stud
They are not nuts. They are bolts. No that is not ok unless it's to get you home.
Yes it's perfectly fine and I drive 4/5 currently. Now I'd advise getting it fixed but you're not exactly gonna die. My main problem is they gave up which is reasonable considering they can't make money off of it because it takes too long but at least try and drill it out.
Kind of u related but is that a Saab 9-3 aero? I can tell by the brakes and that‚Äôs pretty cool if so. Awesome car
i drove with 3, but slow and till mechanic to get it fixed
sENd iT m9
why won't they fix it?
My mechanic says the same thing
Youd probably be fine but a wheel falling off is never something is risk like that
I have been rolling four out of five on my ram pickup for probably 4 years now. Zero issues. No vibrations.
Have them put a nut on the piece sticking out, and weld the nut on good, then remove, the heat should help with the sticking threads as well
These are lug BOLTS not "lug nuts".  

The easiest way to fix is probably weld a nut to the broken off bolt.  Try to remove it.   They probably cross-threaded it pretty bad.  

The ideal fix might be to replace the entire hub.  (Because if it's all crossthreaded, you might get the broken bolt out and notice the threads are all damaged and can't be fixed)

You‚Äôre getting 80% of the strength. Should be fine
You won‚Äôt pass inspection.
This is so easy to replace that I wouldn‚Äôt consider running the risk. If you knew what you were doing it‚Äôs a 40 min job.
It's like having a phone with 80% of the screen working. It will probably do its job, but if something happens (falls or something) you can forget about it. So yeah, just repair it.

That happened to my car because my fianc√© overtightened the bolts one time because we were doing it at home and he didn‚Äôt have the right tools ‚Ä¶. 

so the next time he took it to work and watched some YouTube video and made a small cut into some metal piece‚Ä¶ like some kind of dust shield for the axle I think he said, and he was able to get the broken lug nut out and put a new one in and it‚Äôs fine now ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
You do NOT need to replace the entire hub to fix this lol pull the friggin brake pad off, take the caliper off, take the friggin caliper shoe off, then you'll want a rubber mallet to wack the damn rotor and free that loose. Then after removing the rotor, looking at the backside of the hub, you should see the heads of your studs, put the lugs on all your good studs so you dont mess em up and grab a big hammer and knock the broken one straight out the back... slide the new one in, put the rotor and all assembly back on, except your tire lol put the lug on the new stud and torque to spec. Back the lug off and put your tire and lugs on then torque to spec.
So yes, 4/5 lug nuts isnt unsafe.

But also sounds like your mechanic is fuckin lazy and doesnt want to change the stud. Id be concerned about what kind of corners this dude cuts on things you cant see. Id fire his ass, personally.
I mean I drove years with only 4 lugs on one tire on a Toyota. However, considering they broke it off with the breaker bar. I would have them fix that. I wouldn't have used a breaking bar. They have a tendency to snap off. Impacts plus heat never fail in my experience. I would be OK with it long as it has the lug style fasteners I would not be OK with it on my BMW. It uses Bolts instead of lugs. Huge difference in my opinion that's why they have a extra bolt to hold the brake rotor in place when you remove the tire. So long as it's not a European car should be fine
That‚Äôs why there are 5.. it‚Äôs not the end of the world for 4 if they‚Äôre torqued appropriately.
Not if he is the one responsible for making it that way. He may just be trying to get out of the repair. And definitely not compliant in many states (unsure where you are) that require or run random vehicle inspections.
[deleted]
Wheel won‚Äôt fall off but depending on you‚Äôre local laws on MOT and stuff it wouldn‚Äôt pass. Here in the Netherlands wheels must be hold with all the things made for it, so in this case 5 wheelbolts.
I had 4 of 5 on my one tire for a year - no issues. Don‚Äôt recommend it, but is what it si
It's one of those "it's ok but not recommended" situations, Yea it's safe to drive but it's better for piece of mind
4/5 is fine but I'd be worried that the dude that overtightened or cross threaded the one might have also damaged the others. Drive around until you can afford to replace the hub.
That‚Äôs what lazy people would say. Any job worth doing is worth doing right. Guess the engineers just like adding studs for no reason.
I can tell you from personal experience from a younger time that 4 out of 5 ended up only being fine for only a very short period of time.

A shop had damaged one of the lugs, but I personally installed the other 4 lugnuts properly and torqued them. It turned into one of those stories about time passing much faster than you expect it to when "You'll get around to it". 

Anyway, a few months wentby and I needed to get the wheel off. Lo and behold, somehow despite installing them by hand and torqueing them with a torque wrench, two of the lugnuts had actually seized completely. I got them off, but the lugs and lugnuts were ruined in the process.

  
Moral of my story: I could have had a lug and lugnut replace for free, it ended up costing me a pain in the ass wheel removal and two extra lugnuts because I decided to wait around. And yes, this is anecdotal evidence. I don't care, I'd pretty much only run 4 to get me home or to a shop.
I mean it‚Äôs better than 2 out of 5. I think 4 out of 5 mechanics would agree with this statement.
hubs are cheap, 50.00 or so.
Ask them if they can do 4/5ths the price
get the hub replaced OP. Better to have everything correct.
I ran with 3 out of 4 lugs for the longest time on an old Honda.

If it's a "race car" and gets diven like one, then absolutely get it replaced, but if it's just a commuter I personally wouldn't bother.  I would probably eventually fix it just because it messed with my OCD.
When you are handed the bill, hand over 80% and call it good enough.
1 failure is ok for temporary travel, meaning get to a shop asap.   1 failure is not ok to send you on your way from a mechanic.
One of my friends has driven on 4/5 for over a year. She has had no issues. I will be replacing her hub soon since I only just found out.( I live and a small town and am my friends go to "mechanic")
It came with five for a reason. Any decent garage would have fixed it
Mama said these my runnin‚Äô shoes
If 4 won‚Äôt hold 5 never would have!  /s
Wheel balance will be out due to the missing lug and nut, this is NOT a long term safe solution....
I haven‚Äôt seen one answer to drill hole and use an easy out to unscrew the broken bolt. I see no reason this would not work. There is no reason that the bolt will not unscrew fairly easily!
My opinion?  Drive it normally, until you have the spare cash to have it fixed.  It won‚Äôt be the end of the world but it shouldn‚Äôt be left alone forever though.
4 out of 5 mechanics would say it‚Äôs not and you got the 5th
Yes its okay to have 4 out of 5 until the new hub arrives to get replaced !!
I once owned a Renault R5 that actually needed four lugs yet was designed with only three.
Drill it out and then use a thread insert, plenty of brands available...üôÑ
Still battin 800 in my book ü§£ü§£ü§£
What causes the ‚Äòstretch‚Äô? The lack of fastening from the missing lug?
On our safeties the require you to have no more than 25% of missing lug nuts or studs. So one missing is okay ha. Not optimal but okay.
Hub assembly are cheap. Just buy the hub assembly and take it to the guy who fucked it up. Pay him $40 saying that you don‚Äôt have too but you will.
Perfect fine I run mine with 1 and I‚Äôm a
 Taxi driver
Its ok for A DAY. As long as they remove it tomorrow.
No.
It's a 10 min fix like why wouldn't they just fix it lmfao it's a 2$ part.
i drove around on 4 lug nuts and embarrassingly didn‚Äôt notice it for at least a week. had no problems. that being said the last thing you want is for the studs to snap and your tire just rolls off down the freeway as you slide into a family of 6 going 80mph. 

don‚Äôt delay, get it fixed.
4 out of 5 is okay. I‚Äôve been running 4 out of 5 on my daily driver the past 35k miles with no issues. BUT you should get it fixed. However depending on your finances, if you can afford to fix it go ahead, if not. You CAN wait, just know it needs done.
I‚Äôm not sure what vehicle this is, but on some Hondas you have to replace the wheel bearing to replace wheel studs.
If it was ok they would have built it with 4! üòÇ
Always fix it properly. Can‚Äôt go through life being lazy.
Imagine if a surgeon wanted to get half the job done and just call it a day lol
It will hold until you can get around to it... Avoid "Spirited" driving and tier annihilating burnouts are right out.

Cost will be negligible for the stud and nut and half an hour to an hour of labor to install.
I purchased a Mini Cooper with 3 out of the 4 bolts. 
The 4th bolt was a size too small and had tape around the threads to stop it from falling out
Will last forever.
Replace when you do brakes as that rotors is semi fucked from removal anyways.
Dont think lug bolts are streched.
If they broke it demand they replace the stud. You can drive on 4 lugnuts just fine but it‚Äôs definitely not right for a shop to let you be at peril for their mistake.
Fuck no bro they broke it they fix it. Point blank period. You tell em fix it or talk to my lawyers
It usually is. Depends on what kind of driver you are. However, if he broke it you tell him you want it like new. Sadly, it was most likely the last guy that put the lug nut on incorrectly.
What is this page, the Jerry Springer show?
Dont do it‚Ä¶..i was not aware that the shop had broke off a stud and didn‚Äôt mention it to me..I was on the highway doing 75 and the rest of the studs broke off and my wheel went up into my wheel wall‚Ä¶was a scary minute of driving when that happened that could have ended terribly for me or if my tire went flying into oncoming traffic‚Ä¶.the shop coveted all damages incurred at the end.
There is a degree of over engineering in wheels.

I've seen folks drive for over a decade like this. 

To repair it will be a new hub. Not a big deal.
Get a new mechanic.
if you drill a hole down the middle of that snapped lug you can probably tap it with a blow directed towards the center of the lug a few times, then try rotating it by tapping a flathead against the exposed material. Many ways to do this.. It just needs to be freed up, not sure why the mechanic didn't just remove it.
In Michigan 4 out of 5 lugs is considered good
Hell our Indian friends at Tata get away with just three, so you are likely ok...
TIL lug bolts on small cars screw in instead of being held in with splines like on semis and tanker trailers.
So you think the mfg put a lug and stud that wasn‚Äôt needed?
Take the calipers and rotor off. Heat up the hub around the bolt. Clamp vise grips as tight as you can and spin it out
Meatloaf said 2 out of 3 ain't bad, so 4 out of 5 must be better!
Nope.  I did this and drove a couple hundred miles.  All of the other lugs got worn out.  They no longer stayed seated snuggly in the axle flange.  This is probably one of the reasons why you see the occasional video on here of a wheel popping off a car and rolling down the highway.
You are good bro. Like the other guy said you might want to replace the stretched lugs and go about your day. It looks like a BMW, but nothing high end so unless you seriously track your ride the remaining 4 lugs will probably outlive you AND I.
If the car only needed 4 ..it would have been only built with 4.   


Make them fix it ..and that they expected you to drive away with this, never use them ever again.
Well actually if you extrapolate 2 out of 3 ain‚Äôt bad it should be 4 out of 6
 Are*
Lmao what kinda shop is this ?
you‚Äôll be fine, just get 5 as soon as you can and check they‚Äôre tight regularly.
Not going to kill you, but I‚Äôd stay off the highway, just drive it home, and take it easy.

Then you need to get it fixed.
Ok to drive around town for a few days and then to the next shop to get the stump extracted?  Sure.

Ok to drive flat out at Nurburgring?  If you‚Äôre done spending time among the living, sure.
They broke the head off, tension released from the threads, try using a hammer and chisel to spin it out.
It‚Äôs good enough for NASCAR so I would wager its good enough for road use too. Do get it fixed asap. Chances are, the others are about to snap as well.
I‚Äôve driven with one many times and once with none on a back wheel.
5 poorly tightened lug nuts is bad. 4 properly tightened lug nuts is fine.
Although that is correct, you want to get that fifth one replaced as soon as possible incase one of the existing, breaks. Wishing you safe travels.
A small Oil/Tire shop i used to work in actually had something similar happen. It wasn't cross threaded but the Metal in the Stud was so Weak from years of Wisconsin Weather that, the second they used the impact to spin the lugnut off the half the stud came with it
^^^ this is the correct information, really hate that I had to scroll this far down to see someone post it
100% agree with this. I work on cars myself though not as a day Job but have rode many a cars with 4/5 lugs and been perfectly fine. And NO its not the shops fault of having to drill out the cross threaded lug. It was the person/shop who done it before 100 percent. So this type of fix would fall onto to customer unless the shop themselves done the prior job on it last. And when riding on 4/5 of them I'd deff replace the hub as mentioned above might as well and if your strapped for cash just drill out the threaded bolt with a bit smaller then the bolt size to not mess up the threads and replace just the lug bolts. That's depending on if the hub or threads not trashed from drilling though.
Scrolled down to see what you were talking about and man oh man there‚Äôs a lot of bad advice. They really should make it so you have to prove your credentials before you can comment on posts
This is the correct answer and i literally never had a problem until I parallel parked in the snow. Now I need tie rods and potentially sway link bars.
It‚Äôs not cross threaded. You can‚Äôt get lugs that far in while cross threading. What‚Äôs happened is called galling or friction weld which is the result of rust or debris on the threads.
1. Agreed. 
2. Not cross threaded, galled. This why we use antisieze. That said, it‚Äôs not exactly the ‚Äúother shops‚Äù fault. It‚Äôs just part of the business. 
3. Half agree. I‚Äôd at least give it the old college try, ya might get lucky. Reverse drill bits can be pretty amazing. 
4. Half agree. Responsibility is moot. As a shop, you take on this risk with every bolt. It‚Äôs just part of the deal. I would never dream of trying to convince a customer to drive out of my shop on anything less than what they drive in on. 
5. I doubt they‚Äôre stretched. This wasn‚Äôt over tightened, it‚Äôs galled. If it was over tightened the piece of lug bolt could be removed with a little work.
1, 4, and 5 are right. I disagree on 2 and 3.

The easiest fix for this is to slap a nut on the face of the hub with a sheet of aluminum behind it and weld the old lug bolt to the nut. The welding will make it a half hour fix rather than a 2 hour fix and the only cost should be labor.

It's most likely not cross threaded but is a victim of thread deformation and galling from over tightening.
If 4 won't hold it 5 never would have lol
Agreed! 100%
>you cant just drill it out its a lug bolt and the last person that put it in cross threaded it. if it wasnt cross threaded once the head broke you could spin it out and just replace the bolt.

Master Mechanic here... How often are lug bolts threaded in a way you could cross-thread them? In my experience, the threads are not screw threads, but inline threads like seen below:

https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Serrated-Compatible-Expedition-Navigator/dp/B09V19CCKZ?th=1

Couldn't you drill a pilot hole in the stud and use an impact tool to press it out the back of the hub?
This is the way.
I drilled and tapped out mine. What happened was the splines on the head were stripped, so the lug nut got so far and just spun as the stud was spinning. Yes, the lug nut got stuck, too, as it was on the wheel and there was no way to stop the stud from spinning due to the wheel.

I took the lug cap off (chisel) and drilled into the stud until the wheel could break free from the hub. I then tapped out the stud and replaced it and the lug nut.
This right here
I hate when someone posts the best response in a thread then ruins it with multiple "ohh boo hoo here come the downvotes! M'lady" warnings
^ this is correct.
It's some sort of Volkswagen or Audi and they intent to rust even so hard that your bolts will break so i would suggest to drill and clean the treath. Check how it looks like!
Nope, an upvote.
Great info, this is the correct t answer.
Couldn't agree more. I've been in the automotive fields 25+ years.
This
The only thing I‚Äôd say is ‚Äòoff‚Äô is that lug studs are typically pretty cheap in my experience. I‚Äôve never spent more than $3 for a lug stud.
Lug bolts are a bitch compared to studs. Studs you can hammer the shit out cuz the threads are on the stud itself
This is perfectly stated. You get my upvote.
If I can get home on an F350 superduty crew cab on 4/8, I think OP will be ok on 4/5 on a car....
Like the saying goes, if 4 won‚Äôt hold it, 5 never would have. It‚Äôs a little joke, but it‚Äôs true in this case. I agree that‚Äôs it‚Äôs plenty safe to get to another shop, get home, wait for an appointment at a shop, whatever they need. Just get it fixed soon.
You can absolutely drill out the hub and install a timecert.  The spec is only 88ft-lbs, plus hubcentric wheels.

Lug bolts are cheap. Oem is 5 dollars each from VAG.
This happened to me about 4 times, and each time I was able to just remove the rotor/drum and use a hammer on the broken lug bolt. It popped out the back of the hub, and I was able to put a new one in each time. I never had to replace the hub. But I did eventually replace my mechanic who was overtightening my lug nuts!
Would rethreading them to a larger size cause a significant enough weight misbalnce to cause issue?
>i know there are almost a million certified master mechanics here so let the downvoting commence!

I'm an amateur mechanic who learns from Reddit and YT. 

Am I allowed to join the downvote party as well?
At least when they replace the hub they‚Äôll probably get a new wheel bearing in the deal‚Ä¶
yeah i see ppl runnin around with missing lug nuts all day
I 100 percent agree with all those especially number 5. I wouldn't trust the rest of them if one was over torqued
This is what happens when you use the impact to tighten the lugs, I always back them off afterwards and torque with torque wrench, then retorque after 150 miles. I never go over the manufacturers torque specs.
I‚Äôm a VW mechanic and I approve this message.
Currently riding on 4/5 since December when I swapped to winter wheels and the cheap lug nuts I used cause rusting on some of the studs. I'm gonna replace 3 when it's warm enough...
Also, this looks to be a Volvo on the P3 platform potentially from the brake calipers and five bolt pattern, either that or another vehicle that shared the platform with FoMoCo. The hub situation is a little weird ‚Äî the bearings are pressed into the knuckles instead. Afaik it‚Äôs annoying to deal with the hubs on these cars.
Yeah spot on, I‚Äôve seen it hundreds of times as well, you‚Äôll need the hub/bearing assembly replaced or get lucky and a shop can get the rest of the lug out and attempt to re thread but I doubt they would try that and I don‚Äôt blame them. You‚Äôll be alright for a while just get it fixed when you can
Yup happened to me and I just replaced the wheel hub
It also depends what vehicle this is if it‚Äôs a smaller sized car then I 100% agree but anything that‚Äôs on the larger side I don‚Äôt know how comfortable I‚Äôd be with that
It should need to be drilled, out should be able to take a punch and hammer and pount it out of the hub..... then the new one just pops in and tighten down lug nut to secure it..... would help to have a torch to heat it up really good before you start but it's fairly easy
My own input. I drove with 4/5 lug nuts for like probably a full season, or almost a full season. A good amount of driving. More than the average person, like 10k+ easy I‚Äôd say. 

Finally one day as I was coming off the highway, true started to wobble really bad. What do ya know, some of my lug bolts had partially unthreaded themselves. Something I don‚Äôt think would‚Äôve happened with 5, but that‚Äôs a total guess.
Not entirely true? You don't necessarily need to replace the whole hub...they do normally have press in wheel studs you can buy for around $3-$5 and any reputable mechanic can get it done in about 10 mins and thats if they have any issues!
I got my tires done at Sam‚Äôs club I don‚Äôt remember the exact timeline I go back to get the same tire replaced they can‚Äôt get one out and tell me they can‚Äôt do anything because it will break if they force it out, I fought with the manager saying they were the last ones to work on it so they are the ones responsible for fixing it either way eventually he agreed and it broke and they paid me to get it fixed somewhere else lol
Yeah people in some of these comments are being so dramatic acting like the wheels gonna fly off while they‚Äôre going down the road because they only have 4/5 bolts
Right
80%, that‚Äôs like a B right?
Some places just don't do that kind of work. Lots of little quick lines and Walmarts for instance that only have guys trained to do the oil change and the tires.
Agreed, they‚Äôre not trying to
Agreed. As long as the wheel is seated right, not an issue in the short term, it'll still clamp to the hub fine. Just check it frequently until it's fixed.
I'm going to agree. There was a post in this sub where most people agreed that 4 should be sufficient to hold on the wheel while three (four stuts one broken) would be unsafe (edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1akcvw1/i_bought_new_lugnuts_for_my_car_but_they_are/ maybe?)

In my personal opinion, which really is just a feeling, 4 bolts still clamps down with quite a significant force and nothing would move even a tiny bit. Half of all cars only have four bolts...
‚ÄúCompletely‚Äù fine to drive? I‚Äôd say mostly fine to drive, until it‚Äôs not.
I agree. 80% of lug nuts is fine, even 3/5 is good. Anything less than that you should fix immediately
There are no studs, it's a lug bolt design common on German cars

Edit: unless you meant to say bolts in the first place and accidentally said studs, then I'm sorry. Regardless you're right they would be stretched
They are trying to convince me that it‚Äôs completely okay like this and I have about a 20 mile highway drive home. The issue is they would need to order a wheel hub assembly which would take a while
Yes, agreed. However, if you'd be driving home for around 3 to max 5 miles without going over 30 mph, you probably won't feel a thing. Do i recommend it? No. Is it safe? No. Will you die? Probably no.
Agree 100%. This is walmart-level service.
It's probably safe to drive but they lost a good deal of safety margin. That being said, the mechanic should replace this. It's not that hard of a thing to do. Most lug nuts can be punched out. If not, drill it like you said. 10 min fix.
My old work routinely let people go with a missing stud. If it had more then 75-80% (Depending on lug pattern) they considered it okay so a 5 stud missing one is fine but a 5 stud missing two was a no go. (This is not advice I‚Äôm just sharing what I learned and want to see others opinions)
Wild. I have had one snapped lug nut on my 2006 yukon since getting new tires in 2010. Been about 180k and never once did a mechanic or tire place tell me that it needed replaced. Stopped asking them years ago.
Which mechanic?
You really believe that‚Äôs unsafe? You could drive with 4/5 lugs from the first oil change until its last and never have a problem.
Shitty old gm truck in the parking lot has 6 of 8 on one rear wheel, that Chrysler T&C over there is missing 1 of 5 on the drivers side rear. Will it get you home and back, sure.  Does it need fixed, yes. Will you die, certainly. Today? Because of this? Less likely.
Odds are the other 4 are stretched
No
Also you need rotors
Might be okay to let it sit on 4 bolts/nuts but I sure as hell woundn't drive that down the road.
I would 100% drive it home.
I drove with 4/5 studs on my Subaru Legacy for months, and I would drive it like a rally car. I never had any problems. You're right that having 4/5 lugs isn't ideal, however under any normal driving they should be perfectly fine.
Yea they claimed they tried all this and would require a new hub
Excellent answer.  With no tension on the bolt it should come out of the hub, unless it was cross threaded
Ever heard of reverse drill bits?
Drove home about 70 miles in UK as teenager with holed piston .  And drove full size Buick 74 wagon on 3 out of 5 after all worked loose from I 40 to Las Vegas. ( left from Houston)
Umm no, that‚Äôs not how engineering works. In engineering there‚Äôs a concept called a safety factor. Engineers design things to achieve the desired safety factor as cheaply as possible. Let‚Äôs say the lug nuts will see a max force of X. Well the typical automotive safety factor of around 1.5-2 means I‚Äôll design the wheel bolts to hold  at least 1.5X. I‚Äôd design to that spec as cheaply as possible, not to the actual force the wheels will see. 

That way when you are missing a wheel bolt your wheel will still have plenty of force holding it on.
I'd like to hear more about this 20% number you came up with.

Edit Ahh fuck I read it wrong.
Your comfort has nothing to do with the reality of the situation. Some people aren‚Äôt comfortable on planes, doesn‚Äôt mean planes are death traps waiting for disaster
I did this repair on the side of the road. I had a police car from auction and I was romping on some back roads, spun all (5 I think, crown Vic) sheared off on 1 side. I was within 2 miles of home so I stole them from the other side. Stole meaning the other side never got them back, you gotta replace every one you touch. This is an easy fix, but if you ever get one that spins in the hole it is not an easy fix.
These are wheel bolts
Wheel bolts not studs
There are wheel bolts not studs.
You'll be happy to know it's the first comment in the thread now!
You get that a lot around here, very frustrating as somebody who actually knows a thing or two on the things I'll speak on.
Sort comments by ‚Äúbest‚Äù. It will kinda change Reddit for you.
Bull shit, it‚Äôs nobodies fault or at least you have no evidence of this being the case from a thing which just broke. Shit breaks, just pound it out and install a new one. This post read takes long then repair. I‚Äôd same it‚Äôs about 15mins with the wheel off (if you have proper tools). 

The blame game is useless. Why? Example: I am a professional tech and have a show car which also is in studs. They break and I have a digital torque wrench and every stud gets antiseize. Nothing is over tight or cross threaded. The nuts are replaced seasonally. Stuff breaks, no need to worry the cause unless you find this is a symptom of another issue because it continues to happen in the same corner.
lol...I had to say something, now you see why. and my comment started at the bottom of that mess
There was another subreddit (car talk maybe?) where users could be flaired with their certification.

Might be something to consider for here.
Why hasn't anyone told them to weld a nut on, looks like it broke flush so should be easy to weld a nut on and spin it out. Plus the heat from the weld will make it easy
i dont disagree with anything except you cant get em that far in. with a fine thread and enough uggaduggas they'll crossthread to seat.  usually because some lazy guy starting them with a 800 lb gun and shop air. every bench grinder i have has a wire wheel on it, a clean bolt is a happy bolt. a clean bolt also torques correctly which can make you or break you.  plus its not so prone to do those nasty things you described.
You absolutely can get them more or less seated while cross threaded. Even more so if using an impact.
I agree with you on everything but the better method for extracting this would be to weld a nut to the bolt vs trying to use a reverse drill bit.
im all for learning but i dont quite get what your trying to describe, you mean tack a nut to the broken stud to extract it?
well...

under normal boring commute-level driving circumstances, yes, I agree.

In various more "spirited" circumstances, that allowance of flex can result in WAY more stress on the adjacent lugs and cause them to fail.  (I've seen that in road racing -- a stud sheared, so we went on track with 4...came back with TWO!)
At least in pot county
with that style not very many, heres what your dealing with in this particular scenario though. your dealing with VAG though, im guessing audi from the caliper. these are the lug nuts for it, you can see the difference [https://www.amazon.com/dynofit-14x1-5-Shank-Factory-Volkswagen/dp/B07SCY21JF/ref=sxin\_15\_pa\_sp\_search\_thematic\_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.92181fe7-c843-4c1b-b489-84c087a93895%3Aamzn1.sym.92181fe7-c843-4c1b-b489-84c087a93895&crid=2L417NOUM87OM&cv\_ct\_cx=audi%2Ba5%2Blug%2Bbolt&keywords=audi%2Ba5%2Blug%2Bbolt&pd\_rd\_i=B07RBP18ZY&pd\_rd\_r=b25c40c7-f993-4ecc-8e6a-04ffb3b9d89a&pd\_rd\_w=K8eDs&pd\_rd\_wg=8wRq6&pf\_rd\_p=92181fe7-c843-4c1b-b489-84c087a93895&pf\_rd\_r=11A8BC0TRCEM8PNNHBJF&qid=1707342801&s=automotive&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=audi%2Ba5%2Blug%2Bbolt%2Cautomotive%2C76&sr=1-3-364cf978-ce2a-480a-9bb0-bdb96faa0f61-spons&sp\_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dynofit-14x1-5-Shank-Factory-Volkswagen/dp/B07SCY21JF/ref=sxin_15_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.92181fe7-c843-4c1b-b489-84c087a93895%3Aamzn1.sym.92181fe7-c843-4c1b-b489-84c087a93895&crid=2L417NOUM87OM&cv_ct_cx=audi%2Ba5%2Blug%2Bbolt&keywords=audi%2Ba5%2Blug%2Bbolt&pd_rd_i=B07RBP18ZY&pd_rd_r=b25c40c7-f993-4ecc-8e6a-04ffb3b9d89a&pd_rd_w=K8eDs&pd_rd_wg=8wRq6&pf_rd_p=92181fe7-c843-4c1b-b489-84c087a93895&pf_rd_r=11A8BC0TRCEM8PNNHBJF&qid=1707342801&s=automotive&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=audi%2Ba5%2Blug%2Bbolt%2Cautomotive%2C76&sr=1-3-364cf978-ce2a-480a-9bb0-bdb96faa0f61-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM&th=1)
Ya you were dealing with a completely different animal. This is a euro vehicle which uses lug bolts.
i'll change my format next time lol
Some people get in early and it really does look like they‚Äôre standing up to a tidal wave of uninformed redditors. Me personally I don‚Äôt mention downvotes in my post.
if they attempted and broke it only by hand without an impact i'd agree with you but if you put an impact on it it'll usually rattle enough of the rust off to zip out. I've tried to save over half a dozen with zero success. and audi i believe with that big ol block of a caliper on there but yeah its a VAG of some sort. also the stupid torque to yield axle bolt, aka the hemi(roid) bolt.
I dont remember the exact vehicle, jeep i think but i ordered 6 studs with top tier discount and it was almost 50 bucks because the customer almost shat....hell i almost shat.
Wait til they find out there are vehicles with only 4 bolts stock.
I had buddies ride on 4 lugs for years üòÇüòÇ
Yeah its silly. You gotta imagine most people that post on any sub/forum just regurgitate other info they read online, rarely actually have 1st hand experience with something.
In Canada, that's an A.
Might not be able to get the part same day and telling a customer they have to leave their car at the shop until they get it, with no other option is quite ass backwards. The fact they aren‚Äôt trying to force the customer to leave their car is actually a good sign of a trust worthy shop. 
Now the customer (op) has all the ability to shop prices or go back to the people who messed it up. Shop did nothing wrong letting them leave
And batteries!
And the hub bearing isn't that expensive, or hard to replace along with 5 new wheel bolts. I've driven with 4 wheel bolts in my own car, probably wouldn't recommend it to a customer though.
4/5 is ok, you are not driving a race car or off road rally car.
Are they paying for the hub assembly? Why not just remove the broken lug?

Let them taxi/uber you home.
Absolutely fucking not
well if they fucked it up have them fix it but you can defenetly drive on 4/5 for now at least i would
You'll make it home, but they're probably going to over-torque the rest of the bolts and create even more headaches. They should be able to extract that bolt and fix it. No excuse for sending you out the door like this. I'd never had done that to a customer.
I used to work in a tire shop. This actually is okay, as long as you have 4 studs left, it‚Äôs fine.

But it doesn‚Äôt matter that the last shop overnighted the lug nut, usually the shop that breaks it is the one that pays to have it replaced.
They don't give a stick about you and your safety. This shop and the one that doesn't know how to use a torque wrench should not work in this industry.
What a mechanic would theoretically/hypothetically be ok with on their own vehicle, is much different than what a customer would feel comfortable with.  I don‚Äôt blame you for being apprehensive.

What happens when your wheel zips off on the freeway & kills a motorcyclist or something?

Not worth the risk in my opinion.
They're screwing with you.  They can pound that post out with a pneumatic hammer drill, and put a new one on in about an hour, maybe two if they're greedy.

edit: Didn't notice in the pick, but it almost looks like they tried to drill that post out.  If so, then it looks like they damaged the rotor.
Nope, you can get that stud out and put a new one in most of the time. And hell no that‚Äôs not fine. And it shouldn‚Äôt even take a while if you did the whole assembly they are easy as shit to find unless you‚Äôre driving a lambo
Lmao what? They could just drill it out i assume this is close to closing time and they dont wanna do it at that exact moment. Sounds like they‚Äôre just lame. I‚Äôd take the car down to a parts store, grab a replacement lug nut, and then roll into any other shop and tell them you need it drilled out and replaced and you have the lug nut
Bro I'd be fucking livid. Make them fix it. If they broke one they probably stretched all the others and ruined the threads.
Do not ever go to those utter morons again. No semi conscious mechanic would ever say that.

They just need to get a kit to get a broken bolt out. Any self respecting shop should already have it.

They are cheaping out and half assing so many things I would platform my car somewhere else and have them repair it.
99.999% chance You will be fine driving 20 miles home. Like you‚Äôre probably more likely to die in an unrelated car crash than because ur wheel falls off or something from this. Would I do it forever? Probably not. Is it very likely probably totally fine, yes.

I‚Äôd just drive it home
They are right, 4 out of 5 will be fine for that journey. Take a wheel brace and check they are okay every few miles to give you confidence if you prefer.
It's fine for a while. If you're able to leave it there great, but if you're stranded, or want to seek recompense from the prior shop that cross threaded the bolt (assuming it was a shop) then it's perfectly safe to drive it there.
Ive had buddies drive on 4 lugs for years cause they were broke or lazy to order new ones. Youll be fine. Just make sure the others are properly tightened. Yeah i get it you have 5 lugs and theres only 4. Get it in writing or something from them then. Or document it like you are and if something happens that can be blamed to the missing lug then hey new car for you. 

But honestly youll be fine. Im not a mechanic but ive worked on my own motorcycles, cars, and company trucks and semis because I taught myself. 20 miles drive is nothing. Like i said ive had buddies who rode 4 lugs for years and they didnt drive ‚Äúnormally‚Äù
Well, until a few years ago, nascar‚Äôs would only put on 3/5 lug nuts per wheel to make faster pit stops. Then proceeded to RACE!!! A 20 mile drive home with 4/5 would be fine
Worse than Walmart (unless you find a store that ignores their own corporate standards ‚Äî not that hard to do).  When I was getting started I was at Walmart and we knew how to use a torque wrench there.  Even had a chart with specs for just about everything.  Audi in particular specified no tightening with an impact whatsoever, which I applied to all European cars with bolts.

If someone screwed up like with OP‚Äôs car, the store would pay to have the car towed to an actual mechanic to be fixed correctly on Walmart‚Äôs dime ‚Äî we knew our limits.  Never once did we have a wheel come off since you were required to have a coworker go behind you and check your work.
I‚Äôd drive it. Till I can fix it. But those other lugs are stretched and should be replaced too. A drill and an easy out probably won‚Äôt work. If it broke off due to too much torque on the one? The threads are mangled. My guess. A new O‚ÄôRiley hub is probably $100.00
I‚Äôd drive it. The odds I get plowed by a semi and die are significantly higher than the odds that using 4 lug nuts instead of 5 results in any real issues. Especially over a short drive
Thanks for being honest
Then I would just tell him to replace the wheel bearing and the hub
That calliper looks untouched tbh. I think they‚Äôre bullshitting about trying to remove the rotor
Well they straight up lied, or there horrible mechanics
I‚Äôm going cross threaded
? Yeah? You still need a drill to run that, hence my joke of a mythical drill.
So by your math, a ram 3500 would be fine running 4 lugnuts since the engineers built in a 2x clamping force factor?
100 divided by 5 is 20. Missing one is 20% bro.
Lol i just assumed that it would be 20% because 1 lugnut is missing out of the 5 that are supposed to be there. Regardless, i had a friend that did this and his wheel came off after 3 days
Everytime I rotate my eifes tires on her damn 2013 forte I break at least 1 from 2 tires. I've gotten it down now to wear it only takes about an hour each tire. I've done plenty worse repairs than this. I would say maybe a 3 or 4 outta 10 on difficulty depending on your knowledge I suppose.
They're lug studs. Proper name.
Wheel bolts are stupid as hell. Change a whole hub because a monkey put the wheel on with an impact!? Fuckin Germans.
I‚Äôm happy now lol
Unfortunately it doesn't always sort by what's *really* best.  it will sort by "comment Redditors in the sub agree with the most" and that can be VERY different lol.

Example:  <politician a> sucks, <politician b> is the real deal!
While yes you could be correct but these mom an pop mechanic shops or tire shops 9/10 have some 18 - 23 yr old worker who gets trigger happy with the air gun and most likely torqued down WAY to much on this on nut OR instead of hand threading it put it in the end of the gun and hoped for the best. Now someone experienced like you or I, I agree this wouldn't be the case and yes anything man made can and WILL fail at some point on its own, but I believe in these instances it's mostly human error like cross threading that will do it.
It‚Äôs a threaded hole for a lug bolt, not a wheel stud. You can‚Äôt just ‚Äúpound it out‚Äù. They‚Äôre likely gonna need a new hub. And most stereotypes are rooted in at least some truth. Most ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù shops I‚Äôve had experience with are exactly what the previous commenter said. Maybe 1 or 2 people there know what they‚Äôre doing, the rest are young beginner mechanics who either don‚Äôt know the correct way to do things or just don‚Äôt care because they‚Äôre just working a job for beer money or to get through school. Last one I went to didn‚Äôt have a torque wrench in sight. Did everything with regular ratchets and an air impact. 

Most times, things like wheel bolts/studs don‚Äôt ‚Äújust break‚Äù. Whoever put it in last either over torqued or cross threaded, which is pure negligence and lack of care. If you want the stereotypes to disappear, most independent shops need to step up their game.
What kind of dumbass puts anti-seize on a lug nut stud?  That's like the one place every single person knows not to put anti seize. 

Oh.... You.
If you use anti-seizure on the nuts you will seriously affect the torque required!
The supplied torque figures are for dry nuts/bolts.. if you lubricate them the standard torque setting will stretch the bolts because all the force will go into the bolts, rather than be shared with the friction of the wheel face and threads.

This is why head bolt/stud torque figures are specified with either dry or lubricated, it really makes a difference to the clamping force and bolt thread stress figures.
Are you saying you have a show car, that has broken studs on the regular?
I like what askcarsales does, you can‚Äôt even make a top level comment unless you‚Äôre proven to be a salesman
Interesting. I've snapped 2 on tightening and they did not make it down to the rim. YMMV
[removed]
Lug studs are just knurled bolts. You don't need to tap anything, just hammer them out and put a new one in. So I'm in agreeance with him, you're completely right except for the part where you say the hub has to be replaced. 

For a DIYer this can be a bitch. For a shop, it's not a very hard job and even tho it's not the fault of the person who removed it. They should accept responsibility for it and replace it, as it's not that hard. If they didn't want to mess with it, they could've denied doing the work once they realized it wasn't gonna come off. But they used 3 different methods of removal, at that point they were completely aware that it was going to break off.

Edit: ran my mouth without realizing these aren't lug studs, but lug bolts. I still think you could save that hub but yea... disregard my response lol.
This guy knows.
Ahh, ok... Thanks!

To be clear, the "Master Mechanic" label I used for myself was in jest. I'm just a monkey with a few wrenches.
Get outta here with that. That is absurd! All my cars that have needed (Subaru, Toyota, ford, Mazda, Infiniti) have always been no more than a few bucks a pop. Crazy.
Wait until they find out there are vehicles with only 3 lug nuts
Yeah, but those provide an even clamping load, while OP's situation results in an asymmetry. 

It's still fine for a bit, but it's not the same as a factory 4 lug setup.
I don't really mean the solution was to hold the car hostage. I meant that a garage should be equipped to deal with this on the spot. Now if something really wild happens and the hub gets damaged while extracting the hub bolt, then fine. That is unlucky
The hub bearing on my f350 is $267 for OEM....

*Edit 339+ tax now. They've gone up since I got one
I don't know why they need the entire hub assembly but it isn't their fault so customer is paying for whatever the repair is going to be.  I've replaced tons of lugs, not hard and shouldn't require the entire hub.
They drilled off-center on the bolt trying to extract it looks like. I'd bet they need to replace the rotor as well now. Which is probably why they're trying to pass the buck and do shoddy work.

My guess would be this is a chain tire shop rather than a reputable mechanic and they have to answer to the bean counters
That's why you show them before you break it. No ducking way am I paying for this if I've done everything correctly and it wasn't my fault. The shop sounds like they've done everything properly as far as I'm concerned.
It doesn‚Äôt. Having 4/5 bolts won‚Äôt just cause your wheel to randomly fly off. Why on earth would that be the case. Wheels and those bolts are engineered with large safety factors. It‚Äôs likely you could have 1 or 2 bolts and the wheel still ain‚Äôt gonna fly off. The bolts are strong enough.
I don't think those are studs - that's an Audi and they use wheel bolts. This car will need a new hub, wheel bearing and 5 new wheel bolts.
You do not understand what is happening here, and you shouldn't be commenting if you don't know why you are wrong.
Right? This is childs play, they're definitely screwing with him.
Any other so would then proceed to laugh at how you think you know what you're talking about.
They didn't break it, and you have no idea what you're talking about. At least read the post and look at the picture before you start throwing a tantrum.
They are 339 for my vehicle. + sales tax
Hubs and bearings are not cheap
Starting the bolts with an impact gun is a good way to ruin a hub.
Apologies, i misread that. But they should definitely try reverse drill bits...
If it normally has 5, then yes absolutely.
Ah fuck I read it wrong
I don't disagree that it definitely could come off lol.

I could be wrong but I'd say 80% of your wheel is being held on. It might not be as linear as that though.
If that happened your friend fucked up. 4/5 lug nuts will provide plenty of force to clamp the wheel to the hub. Hell, tons of cars only ever have 4 lug nuts (now there is something to be said for even spacing, but with only 1 missing it‚Äôs really not going to make much difference) they will be fine
Ok but your paragraph fix has nothing to do with this style hub as there are no studs to knock out lmao
Hi happy, I'm dad
Happy now.
Do not rely on this lasting.  The other 4 are probably stressed unless the shop replaced the bolts.  I own a parts store.  I see this often.  My son in law is also a mechanic.  This occurs from over torqued nuts.  The correct way is to use a torque wrench and torque to manufacturers' recommendation.  My brother was moving cross country, and his wife had 3 of 5 break on one wheel as she was towing a trailer on the interstate.  Luckily, she was able to stop before losing control.
[removed]
Okay smart ass, it‚Äôs a German car. Got me. Know why they have mandated wheel bolts rather than studs Germany? Because you can change these out easily compared to wheel studs. It enough of a safety that it‚Äôs a rule in its origin.

I tell you my experience as a dealer tech. I was super keen and learned lots. I became their head guy before I was a journeymen. I felt like I have it (Vw at least) all figured out until I went to a reputable independent shop and realized how wrong I was. I didn‚Äôt know shit beside special tools, software updates, recalls and guided fault  finding on dealer scan tools. Now, 20 years later I notice this trend in the trade. The only techs that stayed behind at the dealer weren‚Äôt good enough or brave enough to leave their comfy lazy situation at the dealer. It was the bums that stayed. I go back to say hi and they all are complaining about pay and diagnosis jobs they can‚Äôt figure out. Bitching about who got to do what PDI. Maybe your market is different for you but there is a clear distinction around these parts. Dealer tech stay because then need someone to hold their hand. Flat rate is the devil and does not incentivize tech to do a proper job. Dealer tech count minutes of every hour. Small shops owners  just need you to fix it right the first time. Facts.
Not exactly what I learned in metallurgy but the old saying is dry or die. There a list of factors to consider here but maybe this will be to nuanced to consider on a wheel rotation or whatever.

What I was taught was:
When a bolt is lubricated - less torque is required to achieve bolt axial load or tension. Reduction of torques for lubricated vs. dry bolts must be considered because Higher torque loads shorten the service length of fasteners. 

Maybe what the op is experiencing?
I agree
No. It has happened. The car hardly sees the road but the wheels come off a lot. Point is it‚Äôs a controlled situation, everything is correct and I still had one break. It‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs fault, shit happens. Just a bad part.
I had to scroll way to far to see this lol, and this is common knowledge for most tradesmen, a dozen ways to get that out but welding a nut on is the easiest, don't even need that much weld, quick tac with stick
ill have to give that a shot, sounds solid af
This guy mechanics, this is one of the quickest ways to extract a broken bolt.
Wait til they find out I only have 2 nuts... Wait...
Look at the picture, it's a lug stud, usually found in Chryslers or German vehicles.
On some trucks I‚Äôve dealt with it‚Äôs an assembly that can‚Äôt be taken apart but for most cars you can just hit it out and put a new one in
Shady stuff. You're right, I didn't even zoom in.
Ehh, just into the rotor. The pain in the ass part will be starting a new hole. Should remove the rotor, grind flat and should be able to just tap it out of the hub.
I've been trying to answer the many incorrect responses in this thread civilly but your smug incorrectness is pushing the limits.
It's possible impact wasn't in reverse and they were in fact tightening the fuck out of it initially üòÇ
Your only need to be worried when you're missing adjacent lug nuts. 1 lug nut is never going to be remotely safe.
They're not, don't start thinking you know about cars.
Explain.exe
Try Rockauto.com. Pretty sure you at least half that.
Yeah, he doesn‚Äôt really have many choices
It normally has 8. Its a 1 ton
Idk man I just made a guess saying that, but wanted to make the person rationalizing driving like this jog their mind a little with the risk of it. I mean if youre just driving a mile or two everytime you drive, maybe it wouldnt be bad. But going from just replacing a hub to having major damage and a tow instead just seems way too much of an unreasonable risk. Plus you can use your breaks very well when your 2,000 lb car is dragging itself in the direction of the misisng wheel lol
Oh man I feel dumb! I literally looked at the damn picture and saw the broken stud and was like " I know this one!!!!" Hahahaha didnt even bother putting 2 and 2 together that the rest are threaded out! Smoke another one Ryan! Lmfao
How's it not though? They drilled the bolt soooo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But it's a stereotype for a reason. Now I know that it isn't 100% of the case for shops but I've been to and heard so many horror stories from people I've helped about those same shops you so adamantly defending. I never said ALL shops are like that but you and I both know they are out there.. and even then it doesn't mean it's a bad shop just someone new got trigger happy or someone experienced in a rush.. it happens. So hop off the high horse and getting offended at a opinion üôÑ
And here is a wheel with technically ONE BIG lugnut... https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQTzZUXjjqCtCkdq7bB6CddP6dq82ld39DPqQ&usqp=CAU

They're lug bolts, not studs, and the bolt is broken off inside the hub so the only option is to replace the hub cause I don't how feasible it is to try to drill and tap it
He's not right, everyone in this thread is wrong. Go to what is now the top post for the actual answer.
Either you replied to the wrong comment or you're bonkers.....

They clearly snapped off a lug bolt and tried to drill it out (probably to get an easy out into it or to otherwise be able to extract it) and drilled off center and got the rotor. There's clearly a drill mark in the photo and it's not shallow. If I was a mechanic and it was my customer, I'd recommend rotor replacement because thinner metal can lead to cracks, especially around something like lug bolts/studs.

The rest is all my opinion on why the shop is telling OP they'll be fine.
Look up lug stud. When they cross threaded it they damaged the threads inside the hub. It's not going to be able to be rethreaded in any way that is more cost effective than replacing the hub, or more safe than it is right now. 

Ask yourself: "what happened to all the other studs?"
After they sent me CLEARLY defective PS hoses and wanted more to ship them back than they would have refunded, fuck rock auto
Yes, but you'd be toeing the line.  (if talking about a truck, is it "towing the line"?)
You could prolly run it. I wouldn‚Äôt tho. But I‚Äôd sure as shit run it with 7 or even 6 if they weren‚Äôt adjacent.
Oh fuck I read your comment wrong.
2000 pound car? It's gotta be at least 3500 unless it's a smart car
Yeah reading through your fix you obviously know what you're talking about. I was also just confused lmao
So does Lance Armstrong!
Not feasible at all.
Why wouldn't it be feasible to drill and tap it?
Gotcha.
Nah you‚Äôre absolutely right. Thats my bad
Never had a problem with them. But, I don‚Äôt blame you.
Yeah dude that's friggin funny! Good thing he didnt take my advice and go out there with a hammer n punch set hahah that really would messed his day up
You'd have to get an oversized lug bolt since it won't be the same size and you may even have to drill the hole in the wheel larger to get it to fit
I mean... there are many approaches to getting a stuck bolt out, and not all of them end with a bigger hole than you started with.  A cobalt bit through the center of the bolt, followed by progressively larger bits until all that's left are threads, followed by a tap the same size as the original often works.
As long as it's not been cross threaded and everything goes to plan that could work, pretty high chance of it being a waste of time though
Or you could even hit it dead center with a slightly smaller (like 1/64") bit and tap it. They also make reverse drill bits for this sort of dilemma, which is worth a shot
Why are suppressor covers so expensive?
Some exhaust header wrap, Nomex Multicam fabric, little stainless tie wire, 45 minutes of arts and crafts and boom custom cover. Just a YHM T3 in there couldn‚Äôt justify spending 1/4 of the cost of it on a cover
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting hate. There is zero reason they should be 200-300 dollars.
Half the people with the suppressor covers have them there to keep their suppressor warm while it sits in the cold safe awaiting another Reddit picture
Becuase they know the NFA crowd has $$ to spend ü•≤
Fram oil filter $10. a tube of silicone $5. a can of spray foam $2.  public range fudds reaction. Priceless.

Idk I met a guy in a DMZ lobby though that talked me through how he made one that performs better than BPG's.

I'm inclined to believe everything I hear in a call of duty lobby.
Just let them breathe like the good lord intended them to ü§£
This should be something everyone gets onboard with instead of bashing. TBH most of our group are using BPG covers and it‚Äôs a pain in the ass at times and then realize the price of trying to purchase one for another suppressor. 

Make your own, research, cheaper, DIY, and gets the job done. Rinse and repeat for the next. ü§ôüèΩ
i use $5 ikea mitten and some duck tape
I'm currently prototyping one because my $250 cover doesn't mask the heat signature good enough, and I still get mirage on my thermal scope.
This is incredibly based. Take my upvote.
As a car guy myself. I've thought about this ALOT, there's no reason header wrap and stainless ties and some ingenuity can't achieve similar results
They look good man. Well done
Might end up doing something similar tbh. Just got my first can approved and it‚Äôs a nomad L Ti so it‚Äôs a big bitch. I‚Äôm not dropping $300 on that shit lol
Because people are willing to pay that much.
A lot of suppressors themselves in my opinion are overpriced, not even including the tax stamp. I‚Äôd be curious to see what kind of margins the more popular manufacturers have on their suppressors.
Armageddon Gear makes really good covers for lily like $80
I‚Äôm surprised that they don‚Äôt use the same set up, that we use on turbo blankets.
this should be a NFA pinned post
Mind if I ask for some links to the materials?
Dude this is AWESOME! I‚Äôm cheap (broke realistically) and buy YHM suppressors to stick on my poverty ponies, so this is right up my alley. 

Just bought all of the materials to do this myself. ü´°ü´°ü´°ü´°
How does your custom do at absorbing the mirage? Very nice work looks clean
Custom made suppressor cover. I‚Äôll take one of those.
Okay this is dope. 

How is this contraption all held together?

My idiot brain says this skill goes beyond just layering the materials and tying it together?

I want to make this myself now‚Ä¶
What‚Äôs the point of wrapping a suppressor? I genuinely don‚Äôt know. I feel like you‚Äôd want it to cool off faster since they get so hot
The same reason flashlights are: because.
I just rubber band a pot holder around mine
https://www.mechanix.com/us-en/sale-closeouts/SUP-CVR-05.html

Currently on sale for $11.99; there's a bag on their site too.
I tip my hat to you sir, well done! I will be doing some arts and crafts now too!
Most of them are mirage covers intended to reduce the heat mirage effect which is a big issue for long range precision guns. On a short carbine, it's more to protect from accidental burns. This isn't a bad idea. Just have to make sure the materials can handle the heat and is easy to remove/install if needed.
Kitchen mittens work well on the battlefield.
Because ppl that own NFA items are willing to pay a premium. At least on average
https://preview.redd.it/yrh3edb4cb6c1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd778226ab9d3ff9de36bca50cc1aea2e9749baa
Because they don‚Äôt look like that
I can actually get behind this. But does it crumble from the inside  when you take it off the suppressor?
The ones I have are under $100.
I always keep my salami unsheathed.
I‚Äôm glad I saw this post. I went to the range today with my shorty bolt action for the first time and shot about 20 rounds within about 5-10 min. Near the end the image was blurred and inconsistent. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what the deal was. 

I think I know my answer now. So how well does this actually work for heat mirage?
In 4 years of usmc infantry work. I never saw someone use cover for their suppressors.  Granted suppressors weren't standard issue.  But I worked with seals, green berets, ODA and delta.... all them special bois had suppressors and not one of them used a cover.
Why are suppressors expensive?
No real good answers but I also want to know why suppressor alignment rods are so expensive as well.
https://www.mechanix.com/us-en/closeouts-deals/SUP-CVR-05.html?cgid=closeouts-deals
The Rifles Only cover is excellent and fairly reasonably priced!
You didn‚Äôt call your final product something like **‚Äúour Class 1 Errant IR Spectral Emissions Suppression and Thermal Dissipation Mitigation Envelopment System Charlie Hotel Alpha Delta.‚Äù**

So you got no hope of selling it for the kind of money that all these other very obviously not-taking-advantage-of-their-market-and-their-clout companies are.
Idk but my BPG is permanently melted to one of my cans now. I can‚Äôt even take it off without totally messing the cover up. I guess it will just live on there until either the cover dies or the can dies.
Skins are always overpriced
Just use a fleshlight
Because the firearm industry is mostly about hyping up shit with a high cost, with quality supposedly reflecting that, instead of the opposite. Not all but most of these gucci brands will just overprice and expect people to assume it's a very high quality item just based on a number they pulled out of their ass. "We stitched a few steadily available and easily attainable mass produced fabrics together, tied wire around it and came up with a hype name, that's gonna be $300"
> Why are suppressor covers so expensive?

Because good ones aren't cheap and cheap ones aren't good. A lot of the crap ones get hot and melt pretty quick.

> Some exhaust header wrap, Nomex Multicam fabric, little stainless tie wire, 45 minutes of arts and crafts and boom custom cover.

Materials cost + labor/time cost + business markup + niche product/low volume = MSRP. You probably spent ~$25ish on materials, right? What's your time worth?

Let us know how your JoAnn's suppressor cover works!
You should be running a modtac suppressor shield anyways.

If you are going to run a cover  hit up u/SWaller89 for one of the best suppressor covers you can get. And it's reasonably priced too! Have 2 from him myself.
NFA shit is all artificially inflated because there's a $200 price floor to get in.
Great job! Take my up doot!
Burnproof gear is good stuff   Some of their rail wraps are under 100$. They on Amazon with 10% off coupon sometimes    Been wanting to try silencercos next ever since I watched the new Mission Impossible movie
Everything firearms related is overpriced because we are suckers for our toys.
I use bacon as my cover wrap. It's functional, smells delicious and is tasty!
So they don‚Äôt melt
Because people pay the exorbitant prices for them
I
Make a  ton of. Difference my gear and heat resistant materials that can handle extended intervals of high temps is expensive. Laminate (squadron) is pricey per yard and the heat resistant materials are essentially the same amount of $ per  foot.  And using Kevlar thread is very expensive for a 1/8lb spool you can buy 1 full lb of Tex70 bonded nylon. what I use for my covers is only the best material I can find
I got rid of MP5‚Äôs Peyronie's disease. But it cost me an arm and a leg.

Hell yeah, I made my own as well and has been holding up. How are you liking that style of heat wrap?

Mine is layer of welding blanket, aluminum heat shield, welding blanket, and then just 500D cordura.
Did you post this the first time with clamps instead of wire ties and have to get a bunch of fiberglass out your hands?
It's the AR15 covers that are the issue. No issue really with hunting rifles, because the temps don't get that crazy. I can't find one that will stand up to rapid fire on a 556 can. They all start melting/catching fire... put off a horrible chemical smell (lung cancer inc.)
Forty bucks and you can get the chonky manta rubber ribbed guard. It‚Äôs awesome and I can‚Äôt say enough good things after countless trash pile mag dumps
Is than an Alibaba surfire?
I paid like $75 for the Armageddon gear one, they're not that expensive compared to half the shit we spend money on.
Extortion
I can‚Äôt wait to see what the budget aka non rip off cover look like!
Becuase they know ots what we need.. and in the end of the day of we want it and or need it.. we pay it
Because people willing to buy useless shit tend to pay lots of money for said useless shit.  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs bidens fault
Yeah its so stupid. I just use a handguard wrap i got for free somewere and cut it down to size.
Wetworx has whole supressor cover, mit, and carry case on sale right now. Mechanix brand I believe.
Because morons will pay that much.
Jews
I had the same idea lol
It‚Äôs a market cost-benefit decision. Why do some people build their own houses but most don‚Äôt? Most lack the expertise and lack the time to learn and get experience. Thats fine.

Theyre expensive because consumers‚Äô preferences indicate that they are willing to pay a premium for the labor and quality craftsmenship of the product. If you were to go through the process of patenting your design, starting a business, and start selling them, you‚Äôd probably also then realize why theyre so expensive
Unless you‚Äôre shooting long range/precision with slow firing schedules and trying to mitigate mirage or signature while using a thermal, suppressor covers are dumb. All they do is trap heat. 

If you want to transport it after shooting and not burn holes in shit just get a Dillon Rifle Co Jalapeno. Fraction of the cost of most functional covers and fits on any rifle.

You know what‚Äôs crazy, I run my BPG mini 2 wrap every weekend just about. That fucker smokes every single time but still hasn‚Äôt shown signs of failing.
Because people are lazy
I see the reasons to use them but I don't think it's worth it unless you have the ability to get new suppressors easily. Like you're a cop or military. It greatly decreases the lifetime of the baffles by not letting as much heat escape.
Your safety wire looks pretty good. Do you work in aviation?
There was just a recent video post where I guy touched his can while hot. The actual materials aren‚Äôt that expensive.
I, too, have a a semi-circular
Because they're stupid.
I wouldn't use exhaust header wrap. Stuff will make you itch like fiberglass everytime you touch. Not to mention the amount of fibers that will FOREVER be coming off that stuff.
They don‚Äôt have to be, Mechanix one is $12 right now
Because they are 100% unnecessary unless your using thermal or higher magnification scope.
BFYTW
They‚Äôre fire regardant
I'll have to introduce you to my friend Ali, Ali Express
I bought a burn proof cover when I got my first can but ended up taking it off so essentially for myself it was a waste of money. If anyone is near the Green Bay area, I‚Äôd give it away. It got annoying taking the can on/off plus I just use it on my bolt guns so I‚Äôm not dealing with hot metal.
Made one from a silicon dish mat and muffler tape... It worked but I was happy when I won a replacement from an awesome company that supports shooting competitions. (Only 60 bucks custom made if you don't win one).

https://rngtactics.com/shop/ols/products/suppressor-sleeve-heat-shield
The Cole-Tac ones are not too bad. I prefer those.  I like the cordage they sew on the rear to keep the cover from walking off.  

I'll be completely honest....I mainly have them because they look cool.  I take mine off when I go to the range so they can cool quicker.
Because people are willing to pay a lot of money for gun shit. My Cole Tac was $80. Works perfect. I don't see why anybody would spend $200 to $300 on one
Why do people cover their suppressors?
Just use a sock
This post was helpful
I‚Äôve bought the crazy expensive and the Amazon specials and they all move around like crazy. I‚Äôd expect your wire tie special to move too w no chance to reset in the field.
How about an oven mitt from the Dollar Tree and some zip ties?
I agree but I just shoot without a cover and use Mechanix covers to transport. Never used them in the military and never had an issue, so I figure why start shelling out the clams now.
rockwool glued to a thin aluminum sheet works fine too. personally i would not use the kind of wrap you're using, i've worked with that stuff wrapping an exhaust and it sheds fibers constantly.

edit: forgot that supposedly you can use a high temp silicone spray to prevent this but i haven't tried it myself. i think the aluminum + rockwool solution may be a bit better since you can take it off when you want after fastening it on with lockwire, hose clamps, or metal zip ties. you could also use a copper sheet too which might look cool.
ColeTac HTP for $87 for those who are willing to spend a bit more for the convenience. 

HTP Suppressor Cover https://a.co/d/9iJeDHK
anyone try making one out of welders blanket and hi temp thread?
Oooooo, I like this. Definitely doing this when I eventually get a suppressor
Niche market and they know people will pay for it. I know a guy who keeps an oven mit with him when he shoots with his suppressor. LOL. I'd prolly do the same.
You happened to work on aircraft?
Hear me out! What about a welding blanket material so it won‚Äôt unravel, When you need to take it off. Harbor freight has some 4x6 for like 20 bux
They're expensive because people pay it...if they didn't sell any, they'd lower the price.
So they don't catch fire which honestly I am conflicted about. What if it's apocalypse times and I need a tiki torch to light my way
Because there are suckers born every minute.
I haven‚Äôt seen one that can hold up to any sort of spirited round count
They have meteorites in them.
Devour covers are like 50-80$
I imagine it‚Äôs an inflated price (much like the suppressors themselves) due to the suppressor being so high. They know that if you spend hundreds on a suppressor, you‚Äôll probably want to spend a few more to get a cover.
I need to know how this performs. I used to work on motorcycles and was wondering if exhaust wrap would do the trick. Same material they use for welding so you can lean your hand against whatever you are welding. Anyway let us know!
An IKEA dinner table is $200, a custom made table is $2000, you can eat your ramen noodle on both, both will do well for their purpose. But it's all about how you feel in that moment, if you're fine with the IKEA fuck whatever else people think, but that doesn't mean we can knock those who eat ramen on their custom dinning table bc as  I've said, it's all about what make you happy.
I don‚Äôt see the need for them. Mine is scratched and rattle canned just like the guns they go on. Gun snobs are the same guys that have 75k trucks but won‚Äôt put a load of firewood in the back.
Is there a guide on how to do this project? Specifically how to tie it securely?
Wekatech cover is $50, works well, and stays on better than any other brand I‚Äôve tried.
The gun culture is a fashion culture, and people get mad when you make your own clothes.
...wait...those are $2-300??

I own a small fabric/canvas/flag business. I'm going to start making suppressor covers for $100. I could make one in 20 min out of $3 of material.


Thank you!!
Maybe they‚Äôre jealous they spent that much and it doesn‚Äôt even match the gun paint schemeüòÇ
gun people especially get very upset when people criticize things they unreasonably spent a lot of money on
Companies know you‚Äôre spending 2 Ben‚Äôs on the Stamp plus cost of the whisper pickle‚Ä¶. They know contextually you‚Äôve got the disposable money. 

Like many things in life something made specifically for an niche application have a premium cost tho the crafty individual as shown in the post can repurpose items that have the same functionality for pennies on the dollar
Because if you have a suppressor you most likely have a decent chunk of disposable income or at least are willing to spend a lot on guns.

Edit: just to be clear I‚Äôm not defending price gouging, just what companies use to base their prices.
Where are you buying $200-300 covers???
The market says what the market says.
Agreed. I mean, riflesonly HAD covers are like 100 bucks, super high quality, stay on well when attached correctly, and come in enough colors and sizes for most builds. 200+ seems obnoxious
Because the firearms hobby is full of fools that love to be parted from their dollars.
Shoot I'm looking for something to make it cool so it doesn't highlight in my thermal scope
REMOVE YOUR CAMERAS FROM MY SAFE NOW
Goddamn right!
Exactly. Too bad for them, I spend my money on more NFA shit instead of overpriced suppressor covers, and will continue with that planü§£
This is beautiful and hilarious.
Holy shit that‚Äôs brilliant, I wish there were lots of old fudds where I live, I would totally do that.
Malicious compliance.

I love this.
I made one of these in high school but for a very different reason
That fuckin' rules, broüèÜ
I should do this.
I deadass thought you were using a fleshlight lmao
What‚Äôs the silicone and spray foam for
You must believe your mom is quite the promiscuous woman then
Breath and wreck your pants when your not paying attention and drop it in the sling
Tell that to my missing fingerprints.
Yea I got at least 3 more to do after how well this one tuned out, wouldn‚Äôt want to drop a grand on BPG
I'm not sure that you'll ever entirely be able to hide that from a thermal scope.
Wonder how much a wrap with some Mylar would help to reflect the heat signature inward? Looks like the melting point is pretty high and those emergency blankets are dirt cheap
Yeah, they gotcha for the can and the tax stamp. Same with NVGs. The mount is like $500‚Ä¶ for a 2 ounce piece of milled metal.
This is a YHM T3, I‚Äôm happy with the performance for the price, $500. I‚Äôm sure the initial investment for a couple lathes and laser welders is unreal for the volume they can sell.
>Armageddon

yes this. I've got two for my SF cans. One high temp and a regular one. Also have the koozie covers too. Why, because they are friggin cool. LOL
What‚Äôs the setup consist of?
eBay. Exhaust header wrap and nomex fabric. Used tear mender to do the edges but you don‚Äôt need to and that stainless wire is eBay or harbor freight actually has it too

https://preview.redd.it/2x8s72xzf56c1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c5193c8b67decb9724818eed3281cd34613532f
Just a Eotech and it‚Äôs been decently breezy when I‚Äôve been out. It‚Äôs got 3 wraps of that exhaust wrap so after a full mag at a moderate pace it‚Äôs just warm to the touch.
I used some Tear Mender which is fabric glue instead of sewing then glued the seam where it comes together then some light gauge wire around the end so it doesn‚Äôt slide

https://preview.redd.it/rp14a5q7h56c1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edfc572220ce242afd307e05a93cee5d1cedc769
This is on a 12.5 set up for night vision so if I drop it in the sling I don‚Äôt want a hot suppressor resting on my leg. I‚Äôll throw one on a long range bolt gun to cut the mirage. On calm days the heat coming off the can makes it hard to see past a couple hundred yards
Fiberglass heat shield, CF Fire blanket, leather, CF cord stitched everything together with SS wire. Made 3 for 40 coins give or take
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want to take it off too many times cause it frays at the ends but that piece I heated glowing red looks and feels exactly the same and stayed flexible
It slows  the time till you get mirage, eventually with enough rounds you will no matter what. I put about 20 rounds through it fairly fast and it was just warm to the touch
Considering SOCOM commissioned the SURG upper someone must be concerned about hot cans. Did the special bois have to buy their own pants, and gun cases, and back seats
Master carr I bought 6 foot of several calibers and cut them to length for 3 people. Total cost was about 30 a person shipped for 4 calibers
Maybe $3 in materials. Works good probably put 50 rounds through the gun today including 20 at a faster pace. Barely warm on the outside and never moved. But yea I hear you, definitely not universal fit and doesn‚Äôt really come off
Don't forget the Gucci tax. And Instagram influencer promotion fees. And I want a private jet fee too. Oh, and taxes n shit.
this \^\^\^\^\^\^.  custom made, super quick turnaround, crazy attention to detail; awesome to work with.
It‚Äôs fine, yours definitely looks more like the purchased ones. Think I‚Äôll go more that route for my all titanium can and get some of that carbon felt blanket
Nope
Suppose that would mostly be the Kevlar or Nomex thread that is touching the can. Nice thing about this design is that only the basalt wrap is touching the can and that didn‚Äôt off gas much of anything in seeing how it held up to heat. It‚Äôs got 3 layers before the nomex cover so that should never get super hot

https://preview.redd.it/c7x5prv2rb6c1.jpeg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3391503639319e8735f19075944d3677854c75da
Funny, my experience has been the opposite. After 10 mags (or 300 rds) of semi auto target shooting through my AR-15, I can just barely detect the mirage in my scope. After 20 rounds of 30-06 through my bolt action hunting rifle, the mirage is so bad I have to keep waving around the muzzle and hope that when I get back on target, I can fire off a shot before the mirage appears again in 2-3 seconds. They both have 25x scopes on them and are using the same dedicated suppressor.

The only real difference between them is the caliber; 30-06 is a way hotter round. Also, that one's a bolt action, so the gas can't escape anywhere but out the muzzle.
Those obese suck massive balls apparently. Melt quickly
Yea trap heat away from your leg if you use a sling how it‚Äôs intended
His cloth is rated to 1800¬∞.
Worked at a gas turbine this fall, had to lock wire all the bolts in the turbine enclosure and exhaust duct. Fun times. Millwrights were surprised lowly boilermakers could handle itüòÇ
It‚Äôs the same stuff all major suppressor wrap companies use and it‚Äôs tightly covered by Nomex. There isn‚Äôt really any shedding when I pull the can off. I‚Äôm a welder, I‚Äôm used to rolling around in fire blanket all day at work anyway
Beware. It melts along the stiching and sticks to cans pretty easily. Otherwise nice for slow fire or bolt action and fits the YHM T2 perfectly.
You‚Äôve never used a sling for its intended purpose on an AR? The can gets really close to your leg if not touching. 12.5 barrel and it touches my knee.
This is on a 12.5‚Äù AR so if you drop it in the sling the can is touching your knee. At night, in winter I‚Äôd rather not melt a nice spot in some pants. On long range bolt guns it cuts the mirage down
It‚Äôs wired so the cover is smaller than the OD of the can so it really doesn‚Äôt slide around. It‚Äôs tight enough you can unscrew the HUB mount and it doesn‚Äôt spin. You can get that stainless lock wire stupid tight. Why wouldn‚Äôt I be able to slide it back on if it happened to slip

https://preview.redd.it/zf0ye7xqd66c1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9178541ecc8a359ae75c37f75707e44b8325334e
Might get some carbon felt blanket for a cover on my bolt action, but once the nomex is over the wrap it doesn‚Äôt really shed anymore. The cut end is towards the middle of the can and the edges are pretty tough. I‚Äôm a welder and roll around in fire blanket at work anyway, that stuff doesn‚Äôt bother you after a while
I am a welder so believe me I thought about it. If you buy some I‚Äôd  try the black carbon felt blanket and you can buy Nomex or Kevlar thread. Not sure why I went the exhaust wrap route considering I have some of the white fire blanket in my garage. I think you can get the 2‚Äù stuff tighter on the can. You‚Äôd also have to fold the fire blanket just right to keep all the fraying edges inward.
Works as intended. Ran a couple mags thru it the other day and the cover was just warm to the touch. That wrap is the same material most suppressor cover companies use just in sheet form
Has nothing to do with scratches and everything to do with use case. It‚Äôs set up as a night vision gun. Usually your focus will be set pretty far so if something went wrong on your rifle you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see that close. Might as well train for worst case scenario which means grab your sidearm, now your can is resting against your knee hanging in the sling. It‚Äôs also convenient. Can throw a couple mags thru it and right in a case or in the backseat
Not really. If you sort by time there‚Äôs a couple recent ones people made that would be easy enough and lace up like the commercially available ones so you could take them off. This one pretty much has to stay on
Not even $50, they are $24 and I'm more impressed with the Wekatech cover than I am with my Armageddon Gear cover.
Is it just a silicon tube that you cut down to length?  Not dismissing it, just curious. Anything you don't like about it?
Thanks, just ya good laugh looked up Wekatech, forgot I wasn‚Äôt in Kansas anymore ‚Äú‚Ç° 12.700‚Äù
It's so annoying how true that is. I blame Instagram.
need some beta testers?
Pm me with your opening product. You will make money from this.
I‚Äôm excited for this, make sure to post a link!
I‚Äôd be down for trying one or two out for an Omega 36m and an Omega 9k! Hit us all up, dunno how this subreddit feels about marketing/product development posting
I‚Äôll spend the money on ammo and give you feedback if you ship me some.
Yeah I‚Äôll beta test too..
I‚Äôm interested üëçüèª
Mate, you just got yourself a crap tonne of testers to choose from and an instant product success if it 1, can take the heat & 2, will stay fastened to the can.

Cheers Mate, put me down for one that fits the Rugged Obsidian 9.
Man, I would love to try one as well.
Hate to be that guy but dm me if you want product testers. I do reviews on YouTube.
Making these still?
Are you still doing this?
I understand why something like the liberty defense cover is expensive, custom made with more expensive composite materials. Other than that, very real
How has this setup been holding up for you after all this time?
Charging what people are willing to pay is not price gouging.  People will pay a lot for the fashion that other people have.
This has been going on in the general aviation world for the last 50 years‚Ä¶
Though some of us save up for a good bit to get a can & more likely than not, it will be the only one or maybe one of only a few.

And that's the boomer mentality that propagates the idea that "the market is always right". There's making a sustainable profit then there is greed.
\^\^\^This. I started with a Weka cover, still too much thermal bleed. Titanium cans tend to heat up way faster. I ended up putting an Armageddon Gear cover over my weka tech cove, slows the thermal bleed way down, even if i get some bleed its a mild glow instead of a fireball at the bottom of my scope
Being able to throw it in the safe hot without having to worry about it melting any surfaces in the safe is a solid perk.  But switching between hosts basically requires one after a single mag with rifle caliber ammunition.

The silicone is for the suppressor sleeve so I can actually shoot it without melting, and the spray foam is so that the oil filter slides tightly over the silicone sleeve and centers it so all the bullets go out the same hole.
According to COD lobbies, I‚Äôm also black apparently
Suddenly I really need a Huxwrx can so it can breathe and not melt my pubes to my scrotum
Skill issue
Yeah it took me 2 burns within a 5 minute period to justify picking up a cover
Damn you must be runnin and gunnin lol
Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I feel like when holding a firearm‚Ä¶ especially when at the range‚Ä¶ there should be never be a point where you aren‚Äôt paying attention. 

Example: if you‚Äôre paying attention to the muzzle‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll never burn your leg.

That said, I do love arts and crafts and making something is always cooler than buying something.
I can definitely see it melting the sling if you aren't careful.  One must take sufficient beer breaks before switching host guns üòÅüç∫
Arisaka makes a light mount for suppressors to prevent shadow. I mount mine on the left side of the rifle as a right handed shooter for this exact reason.
Missing fingerprints could also make things interesting for Your next NFA approval
You've inspired me I might have to get the sewing machine out and try this with some sheet material.

I'm thinking something like this [high temp fabric](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/heat-wrap/maximum-temperature~1500~1999~f-3/0) used for stuff like boilers/ refineries/ welding. Which I could probably sew onto a cover and have a great, and removable, wrap.

Here are a few [ideas for thread](https://www.mcallistermills.com/high-temperature-sewing-threads) types that [might help anyone](https://wflake.com/high-temperature-sewing-thread/) wanting to pursue that idea. (And a third: [this is nomex thread](https://www.edthread.com/nomex)... who knew?!)

Sandwich it into that nomex and you've got a stew going.

Not a bad start; thanks for sharing the idea. I hope you don't stop here and make a 2.0
https://modalwork.com/products/m177-turbo-blanket. Basically lava rock that can take crazy high heat, within a special weave won‚Äôt disintegrate. The lava rock center keeps the heat on the turbo or in this case the can. The blanket keeps it together.

Could probably just use bailing or fencing wire, too.
So for protection against burning yourself and the mirage. I guess I haven‚Äôt ran into those with the one I have on my full size rifle. It‚Äôs my only one so far so I‚Äôm pretty new to the game. Does it hurt the suppressor at all?

I actually just put one in jail today for my kp9. I went with a B&t RQD 9mm (it comes with the 3 lug). If that sounds right. Got me wondering if I should wrap that to not burn myself
https://preview.redd.it/wn1b5kkscb6c1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8401e41bab199aa4dfcfc7fcd9a3aa763aea6249
You can‚Äôt just slide it off if that‚Äôs where you were going, but could easily unwind it and use again
Yeah I was gonna say normally you‚Äôd melt the ends to prevent fraying but not sure how you‚Äôd do it on this. Maybe stitch some Nomex fabric folded over the cut edges as a seam?
Can't you just melt the ends like with nylon strapping?

JK, I do them same thing...  :high\_five:
Obviosly hot cans are annoying,  but so does any hot barrel. In combat situations you don't necessarily want to cover the barrel because you need it to cool faster.   And then also sometimes you don't worry about how hot the suppressor gets.
[deleted]
So how much would you sell them for? If it takes 45 min to make, you can only make 9 per 8 hour day (less 30 min lunch break and 2 )x15 min breaks). Not counting time to ship or handle orders / customer service etc. How much do you need to sell them to male a decent living if you can only make 9 a day? And don't forget to take out 30% for taxes and such too.
I laser cut fabric and can sew so I guess it has that quality. Literally bought all the heat resistance stuff off Amazon. Was considering the wrap like what you have but I thought it might be too thick to sew.
They do indeed. But the mits and bags are nice. Cover sucks.
Nah‚Ä¶
Does it actually stay on? Mine is V2.0 and wayyy more wire to hold it on cause the first one would tent to slide after a mag or so
Bro I stare at a computer all day behind a desk. 

I'll still go out on a limb and say most deployed peeps that run cans also don't run a suppressor covers. 

I still standby they are almost complete unnecessary unless using a thermal or to mitigate heat mirage. 

Keep on training though, good on you!
So you haven‚Äôt used it yet apparently‚Ä¶
Awesome. Next project.
Link please
Any idea what the heat rating for these is? They're very vague on the website so I'm thinking just assume Manta temp numbers.
That‚Äôs pretty much it, though it has ventilation channels on the inner surface to allow some degree of airflow over the can. It may not keep the heat in quite as well as a thick layer of aramid fibers or whatever the expensive US brands use, but it performs like a silicone oven mitt (ie, pretty well) and in my experience is a lot slower to slip off than most of the fabric covers.
Even worse in person at times. I maybe in my mid 20s but I just miss the times where just having something like a suppressor and a quad rail was the tits. Not people saying how the suppressor you own sucks and here‚Äôs 10 reasons why despite 9 being an opinion and why this suppressor is better and why ain‚Äôt you running MLOK? People arguing over which rail looks better and etc. as long as it ain‚Äôt junk then idgaf
It has existed in gun culture long before Instagram.  Though I have no doubt it made things worse.
Why did I just get a mental image of soyboys doing the testing? ü§£
I will. I also offer custom logos/lettering with my vinyl plotter.

I'm serious - you guys put this idea in my head, I had NO IDEA those things were so expensive. They don't need to be!

I'll be in touch guys - I'm saving this thread so I can find you two when I get this going.

I know all suppressors are different and there's no real "one size fits all," but are there some specific suppressors that people buy that would be more inclined to buy a cover for it?

Or are these all going to be made to order (which is how most of my stuff is)?
Edit: I‚Äôm putting this at the top because it‚Äôs pretty apparent y‚Äôall don‚Äôt pay attention to the entire comment. Read the whole damn thing, in the second edit it says the exact thing you‚Äôre commenting to say. 

It‚Äôs because they can. The majority of the people that buy suppressors (a wholly unnecessary firearms accessory that‚Äôs usually roundabout the same cost as a whole gun, plus a $200 stamp) can afford to pay a little extra for other things. 

Edit: I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt have a suppressor, I think everyone should. I‚Äôm just saying your gun works with or without one, so the suppressor and cover are more of a novelty than necessity. If you can afford to buy an expensive novelty that costs gun prices, most likely you can afford another novelty. On top of that, you‚Äôre waiting ~8 months for approval, so how many people buy the cover while they wait due to impatience for the can?
It‚Äôs fine. Haven‚Äôt shot that gun too much lately, summer is more prs and pistol but it still gets moved around in the safe and is always thrown in the backseat whenever it does go out.
Yes that‚Äôs how the market works, if people will pay the price, then that‚Äôs what the price is. For necessary goods there are structures in place to regulate prices.

For non-necessary niche goods like suppressor covers? If people pay $200-300 or $1000 or $1M then that‚Äôs what they cost. Don‚Äôt buy them or sell your own if you don‚Äôt like it.
And what is the mentality of thinking they owe it to you to make them cheaper? Entitled?
No, it‚Äôs basic economics where greed is good.

This is a niche product not necessary for a functioning society. A perfect example where market forces set the price. Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt buy it or undercut the scant competition with your own product.
Lol
So this is why people run 12" risers...
So what is this supposed to look like?  I've never seen an orange suppressor before.
*breathes* gets called racial slur

I'm not entirely sure this is what you're saying and maybe it's a meme, but if you're saying the huxwrx cans don't heat up as much as other cans, allow me to retort. There is so much more surface contact with the gasses they get hot very quickly. Took my flow to a sage rifle class and while other people were taking theirs off with their hands mine was still sizzling my palm meat.
No kidding. That‚Äôs great some people don‚Äôt get burned. I‚Äôm handling mine hot routinely at the range moving from host to host.
Never done a cool guy move like dropping your rifle to hang on the sling so you can draw your pistol and post it all on the gram, eh?
Got a sling on any ARs? If you‚Äôve never used it what‚Äôs the point of carrying extra weight. Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs a couple thousand yards to any property

It happens, it hurts and burns. They also stay hot for a pretty long time depending on material. I‚Äôve seen and heard about plenty of dudes burning their hands thinking it‚Äôs good to go, or place it down somewhere on something that can melt and make a mess of their can. Paying attention or not shit happens and burns suck. But clearly you‚Äôre not playing cool man at the range going for super dynamic secondary deployment enough haha
Spoken like someone that's never done a rifle to pistol transition
Good thing SS keeps them handy!
I‚Äôd even look at this for a removable wrap. I‚Äôve used this stuff at work and it‚Äôs probably the best fire blanket. Doesn‚Äôt really fray or shed and would sew just like any other felt or batting. I got some Nomex thread coming you can get it on eBay dirt cheap but that one I just used tear mender so see how long it lasts.

9 mm never really gets crazy hot especially if you‚Äôre shooting subs. I got a 8.5‚Äù 9mm with the B&T RBS SQD?, after 20 rounds it‚Äôs hot but not take your prints off instantly hot so I‚Äôll never wrap that. If you‚Äôre not mag dumping all the time it won‚Äôt hurt the can more than avg.
Slick
Well hopefully I‚Äôm never in a real combat situation but when I‚Äôm larping with my buddies shooting under NODs I‚Äôd rather not risk melting a hole in some Sitka pants. Shouldn‚Äôt guys on here be happy people are out training and using their stuff instead of just having it in a safe?
That wrap is rated to 1800¬∞ plus. Plenty of high end exhaust is made of Inconel and runs way hotter than a couple mag dumps would get a can. Who does mag dumps anyway?
https://preview.redd.it/scfig7b8656c1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=778d48560cdfb5516a08b87fa0348355fe125176
They‚Äôre pretty much one off since you the can owner has to wrap the can then wire it. Pretty sure I could sell the whole kit for $30, exhaust wrap, Nomex and wire and still make a killing. If I sold it to a friend i shoot with I‚Äôd do it for $40. $320 for a Liberty Defense made with essentially the same materials is out of control. And yea to make them user friendly you have to add straps and buckles and other stuff but still $300?
It stayed ok for me. I just sinched a little more narrow than the back end (near mount), so that it would be impossible for the cover to slide forward.
Shot a couple mags with it on yesterday. Worked fine
https://www.wekatech.com/
Great Question, I second this! What is the heat / use limit for weka moa covers?
Does it mitigate heat mirage when looking through a scope?
Looks a lot like the Bowers supcov on the inside. Cool!
Right on, thanks.
I still come from the school of thought that made shooting popular and not gatekept: if you can shoot well with it, it ain't junk. All that Gucci gear for the 'gram is only as good as the person using it.
Brand-whoring has always been a thing, it‚Äôs just become more common to see because of social media‚Äôs increasing popularity. 

Go look at the boomers in the reloading community and the Dillon fanboys specifically, if you want an example.
Put me down for 1 for a ThunderBeast ultra 9 in .308.  I‚Äôll always support small business first!
Black multicam for a sandman s. Take my money.
The main two reasons are a) that nobody like you came along before and b) working with material that can stand multiple 475-degree cycles without melting or burning is not easy. 

As everybody else with cheap cover dreams said, put me on your beta tester list. I've got a variety of suppressors to test with, and will happily run a handful of cycles to test. 

Make sure you test the thing in an oven before sending it to folks though; people will be \*pissed\* if they have to scrape their cans to get a dead cover off.
Add me to your list. Want to get some custom ones for the defense tech startup I work for.
All suppressors are prone to heating. Start making whatever cover for the suppressor you have. I‚Äôd need a sandman-s, sandman-k, and helios cover. All different sizes. 

Do you make canvas for directors chairs? I‚Äôll PM you because I have a custom design I have in mind

Edit: check pm/ pm me please!
Put me down for 2 and PM me for specifics
The materials need to be able to handle extremely high temperatures and not burst into flame

I'd also like to be informed when this is a thing.
I‚Äôm down! Lmk. Sandman-S, Sandman-K, Wolfman, Odessa, Sierra 5 (I know).
I would also like a pm when this becomes available
I‚Äôm down to buy one and try it out too
Outstanding, looking forward to getting with you on a couple of orders.

To add to your comment:

There were \~700,000 suppressors sold in 2022.    That doubled the number sold in 2019.   

Suppressors  themselves are already a very niche product.  Suppressor covers are a very niche product for a very niche product...
That's exactly why I don't own any suppressor covers.
You can only gas mine if you‚Äôre the little spoon tonight :)
As is good go spread the word of proper sling technique, it will be faster to use the support hand to bring the rifle down, twist clockwise, and use your magazine well as a toggle against your body, keeps you from clocking your jimmies and from spicy suppressor burns.

I don‚Äôt play cool man anywhere. Lol. I try and I fail. I know where I stand lol
Spoken like someone who‚Äôs never done a rifle to pistol transition and burned his leg*
And yea for some other guns I‚Äôd like a more removable wrap but this one will pretty much live on this gun.
See this is how good things happen. I like where this is going.
They both get hot, get shit done, more quiet then you‚Äôd expect.

I shoot 8.5in 300BLK paired with Omega36M. After a few rounds she still cool. 5.56?!....only takes a few rounds and it's scorching. I thought about buying me some welding gloves to remove lol. 

I haven't had it hanging from a sling yet. The 36m is recessed into the handguard on my 300blk. Lines up right on the end of my handguard on 5.56.

I may try this crafting though I know it probably one fit on my 300BLK
I guess I‚Äôll have to decide when she gets out of jail and see how hot she gets
No...
What's the company on that one? That cheap usually means cheap garbage crapnfrom China. Usually it's at least 1$ a foot for DEI titanium.
[deleted]
Love these. They even have small channels to aid with heat. If you look down the can, you can see light coming through the little channels. If you get it too hot, it cracks and flakes off rather than melting.
Ah, they're basically one size fit all. Maling them in batches, assembly line style, saves a lot of time.
Mine do
Agreed. I‚Äôve seen people do better with a M&P Sport than some with a DDM4. Both were safe and cool people but the dude with the M&P sport and just pouches on his belt just retained info and performed better with what he had VS Mr. Call of Duty. Im all for having good gear that‚Äôll last but I‚Äôm also a product of being what you got if it‚Äôs all you got. I can kinda say the same when I was younger and did Project Appleseed how I‚Äôd do really damn well with a stock 10/22 vs some guy with some tricked out one with Voltquartsen parts and cried when his rifle got dirty
In for this. YHM Resonator R2 size plz
Same!!! I can send you dimensions for my cans if needed

>I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt have a suppressor, I think everyone should. 

Did you read?

I don‚Äôt go to public ranges, anyway. I have land. Yeah, some of my rifles have muzzle brakes. But they‚Äôre my distance guns, the ones I wouldn‚Äôt suppress anyway, and they‚Äôre all larger calibers.
Everyone should be using a muzzle brake, unless your gun is over gassed AF, or your using a suppressor.
People being anxious to get their item ends up buying related items while they wait. Like the checkout line at the store, it‚Äôs surrounded by stuff while you wait to pay. There‚Äôs a reason they do that, it‚Äôs because it works.
I didn‚Äôt use enough crayon, I guess. 

Oh well. Good thing we don‚Äôt come to Reddit for intelligent debate.
>I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt have a suppressor, I think everyone should. 

It‚Äôs there, read past the part you don‚Äôt like. 

How is any of what I said wrong? It‚Äôs the same concept as the checkout lane at a store. It‚Äôs surrounded by items so you‚Äôll grab a few more things while you wait. They do that because it‚Äôs proven to work.
Idk that I'd call them a very niche product with those kind sod numbers... That's more suppressors sold than Ford sold of all F-series trucks in 2022
It seems people are increasingly having weird and strong opinions about prices for products not important for society to function.
I wouldn't call those numbers niche.

Nice thanks so much!
Is that wrap itchy?  I was thinking of using the non-itch stuff like [this](https://exhaustwrap.online/products/silica-exhaust-wrap?variant=13050754302010).
Probably reeeeal hot if she‚Äôs been in jail for awhile.
that's true and i thought the same but this also might be a distributor trying to dump product bc the aftermarket demand is down. +1 to just getting DEI though for real and OP this is awesome.
Not sure?? There weren‚Äôt any tags on it. It‚Äôs a fiber woven into a strip, can‚Äôt imagine there‚Äôs actually a whole lot of difference. I‚Äôm guessing it all sheds on the ends when you cut it
https://preview.redd.it/mb35t3p3956c1.jpeg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48974eff2d27bb69de38668e99ac914cc20f0fc9

Oh no look at it melt. This must be one of those low temp torches
Just bought one. Thanks guys.
Two sizes.
Make that 2, and one for a VOX S
Same here
Please PM me specific dimensions. We can work something out - Everybody in this thread is getting a "I gave you the idea" discount.
I‚Äôll comment on what I know well, which is mainly the AR-15 platform. 

Almost all AR-15‚Äôs out of the box are indeed over gassed AF but even then, there is still very little recoil. The only time a muzzle brake/comp is justified in my opinion is if you are using it for precision matches and the like. Muzzle brakes are so concussive and just unpleasant for everyone around you. However, I can understand the desire for one on bigger calibers.

Don‚Äôt be that guy at the range.
Fuck no. Totally unnecessary with 5.56 or 300 blk unless you're shooting comps
They are so Niche that a lot of people don't even know that you can legally own one.        And some of those people are even in the gun community...
i would use the silica stuff. i've worked with the regular fiberglass wraps and unless they're wet, they shed fibers constantly. when they're dry they also have a tendency to catch on things which will cause a substantial portion of the weave to come undone.
Yea it sheds fibers when you‚Äôre wrapping the can that are itchy. Once the fabric cover is on you shouldn‚Äôt really get it on you anymore. I never saw that white stuff when I was looking. It is way more expensive though. The stuff I bought was $17
Aftermarket demand is never down.
I've deal with it when building racecars and such. It's Nota fun time after working with it.
Fucking roasted
‚ÄúBut but but it didn‚Äôt cost more than a tax stamp so it must be terrible quality!!!!‚Äù
Well if this ain‚Äôt a fucking mushroom stamp/Trojan war helmet down my face. 

Take my upvote before I get flaccid.
Literally also buying one right now. Thank you internet friends.
I am that guy at the range, you should be wearing hearing protection. If a guy in the next lane can shoot his M82A1 with no issues I can shoot my Ar15 with a muzzle brake. I gotta say your coming off as a giant pussy right now.
At least I'm not the only one out here eating popcorn enjoying the chaos
Says the guy using a muzzle brake to mitigate .223 recoil‚Ä¶

You do you though, I can‚Äôt stop you from using one.

He employed the scientific method. He posited a hypothesis and then recorded the results.

You got any extra low temp torches?
TommyBuilt T7 after RMA (Part 3)
This is a follow up video after I sent the gun in for an RMA. Please keep the comments civil, I‚Äôm simply here to share the information. I made a full YouTube video on this, if you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôll leave it in the comments. If not, no problem! If you have one and it works great, I‚Äôm happy for you. My experience was not the same. The gun is actually completely broken now and won‚Äôt work with the ammo it used to work with prior to sending it in. Thank you to this subreddit and it‚Äôs mods for allowing me to share this information. üôèüèª

Holy hell üòÇ
‚ÄúSimply put to share information‚Äù adds hilariously timed music üòÇ
Kinda funny and sad that my trailer park mp7, a cp33/FT7, has given me less problems than what the TP7s have been giving people. I seriously think I have had maybe a couple of feeding issues from when I loaded the magazine wrong. I‚Äôve only had to send in the bolt to keltec once the buffer got chewed up bad enough, and that was maybe after 4Kish rounds. 

I hope TB gets the issues resolved. It‚Äôs a cool gun.
Watched this morning. Nauseating.
I fully expected the firearm to finally work given the camera angle and filter and boy was I wrong ü§£
Take a look at the extractor retainer pin and see if it walked out.
I subscribed to your channel this morning.  Keep up the good content.  Sorry about the MP7
Firstly , fantastic video with the music. Secondly, this was after RMA ? I‚Äôm so sorry bro . Thirdly, any response from the manufacturer after the RMA failures ? Or do you not give a shit at this point ? Fourth, have you posted this to the H&K forum to watch the pearl clutching and purse swinging commence ? Thanks for sharing . I‚Äôm sorry for your purchase . I had a similar experience with a ‚Äú boutique ‚Äú manufacturer and it sucks . You spend your money , build this up to be a great thing in your head and when it finally arrives it‚Äôs a complete disappointment. It‚Äôs like waking up Easter morning to find the Easter bunny took a shit in your basket.
You look like healthy Post Malone. Cool gun.
Time for a refund or a replacement.
I got blocked for talking shit about this gun üòÇ
Personally, this would be my go-to shtf weapon of choice.  The enemy wouldn't dare shoot at me when they see me holding it .  I'm already out the fight.
The music üé∂ üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I had such hopes for these even with zero plans to buy one. Sorry it doesn't work bud.
4000 gun that no one can get to run. Very cool.
I‚Äôve followed this extremely close as this gun *was* at one point something I was very interested in (like a lot of us, I‚Äôm sure). It‚Äôs kinda hilarious watching even the TB simps on HK forum and some of the HK groups on Facebook start to become frustrated and turn on Tom. There are a handful of people that got theirs and their guns worked in the beginning but some of their guns have started to develop issues ranging from trigger issues like OPs, to cycling issues despite these people saying theirs worked before hand and now they magically do not. I‚Äôm glad I took a step back the day these first dropped and waited. I didn‚Äôt want to be a beta tester. 

I witnessed first hand the TBT experience back in the day with his UMPs he was making ‚Äúin house.‚Äù So I know your pain OP.
Hopefully this teaches yall a lesson:

**Stop being hypebeasts and buying into hype. Make a company earn your money instead of trying to be the first person to throw your card.** 

Would‚Äôve waited for another dummy to buy it first and test it out before I did.
This firearm is a piece of shit.
I do slinging as a hobby. Yes, that kind, David-and-Goliath style. Best guess is that I can accurately get 4-5 shots off per minute. 

Which means... that the oldest projectile weapon other that *the fucking spear* is more reliable and faster than the T7.
If only the krauts would sell us the real gun in the first place.
Ha Ha!!!!!  Fucking hilarious!!! love it!!!
Incredible video. Hats off.
A+ sound editing and an F in the chat for the T7.
That video edit is on point‚Ä¶ well played.

There are so many good sub guns out there. Just stick with something that works
Wow B&T price but this is what you get. A big nope for me.
I hope they eventually get it worked out and come out of this okay. I still really want one and tried to buy one at launch but boy am I glad I didn‚Äôt catch the drop here
What a joke. +/- $4k for a glorified .22 magnum that doesn‚Äôt run worth a shit.
So these are just trash then? Cause all I‚Äôm seeing is FTFs in every video I see‚Ä¶
that silence is sure deafening...
I'm gonna get a lot of hate but the MP7 platform is atrocious...
It looks like something highpoint would make
So if you‚Äôre a customer and the manufacturer has failed to fix your gun, what are your options? Refund? Replacement? Chargeback? RMA again?

What a shit show, especially if it‚Äôs a factory SBR.
The most expensive malfunction simulation training money can buy. Don't miss out on this amazing oppurtunity! /s
So thankful I didn‚Äôt get a lemon.
Jesus Christ I can't believe I was rooting for this thing back when I first saw it
This is tragic lmao
This reminds me of Garand thumbs video of the hi-point carbine. It kept jamming and messing up everytime he try to pull the trigger. Funny thing about it, anytime the carbine would mess up, the music in the video would completely stop, while he un-jammed it.
That‚Äôs just like a Lage M11 but bolt action.
This is sad, Tommy is a good dude and has been innovating and turning out good guns for years.  I hope this gets fixed
Junk. He couldn't get them right, they're cool to look at on the wall but thats it. I think he's on the verge of BK with this flop of a product. Wait for H&K to release them
Tommy seems to have the only working T7

The music had me dyn laughn
Welp.
I wish he didn't sell this before beta testing himself hababahba
Tommy built guns are crap.  A buddy of mine bought one, had to return it three times and finally got a completely different model.  Junk.
I got a buddy who‚Äôs had to RMA his Tommy G36 three separate times. Last time it came back with a bent rod.
And I just finished part 2 üò≠

Really sucks considering how reliable his ump and 36 conversions have been. But t
Damn, that‚Äôs tough
Still shocked that people still bought his shit after the G36 clone fiasco...
Glad I‚Äôm too poor for problems like this üòÇ
lol I watched your video last night. Sorry you gotta deal with this. I guess I lucked out that my order didn‚Äôt go through on this thing. 

Funny enough I been looking for a deal on a TP9 to fill that void like you mentioned.
I haven‚Äôt shot mine yet. I mostly got it to test fitment of some accessories, probably will sell it after I do measurements.
Updoots for the marpat top ü§òüèΩ
Do they not test fire if before returning it to customers?
dawg I was so fuckin excited for these things to be cool. This is a real disappointment. Got a chance to shoot a TommyBuilt (T?)36 and it was so much fun. I guess civ MP7 will always be a dream
So fucking glad I bought my rattler over the T7 now I think I‚Äôll save for a ps90 or tp9 while they continue to work out the kinks of the T7
Haaha
Did they not test fire these before sending them out?
As a TP9 owner, I support this message.
That thing is fucking lame.
Honestly don‚Äôt get the point of wanting any MP7 that isn‚Äôt full auto.
I‚Äôve seen to many YouTube videos of these having the same issues. I wanted one badly, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt buy one , especially for how much they‚Äôre asking. Hopefully they get these problems taken care of. I can‚Äôt believe that they let these out the door, I guessing no quality control at all.
Might be wrong, not super familiar with the platform so I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre some weird integrals that I can‚Äôt see, but the notion of you having such little faith that you didn‚Äôt even bother to throw a sight on it is so funny to me
For 3k? I‚Äôd be livid.
Piece of shit gun
I‚Äôm glad I took the money I had laid away for this abomination and spent it on a mr556
Hornady works fine here and in other videos.

I think we can all agree at this point that these things are pieces of shit
Should come with a rape whistle master key ü´£ü´†
yeah... not shocked.  the t36 has been an exploding pile of dogshit for years.  the ump was the same.
I watched this earlier today
BUT  Atleast his products are all consistently poop
This is fucking comedy bro
At that rate, you could get more done with a muzzleloader full of nickels
I remember a guy called me poor bc I said I was excited for the X5.7 by psa and he kept going on and on about how tommy was gonna do it ‚Äúproperly‚Äú and kept talking about tommy like he was prophet and that I will never get to experience his work bc I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo poor‚Äù. I hope the guy realizes how dumb he looks now lmao
I see Tommy‚Äôs now selling paper weights?
Pretty sure you could‚Äôve found one a lot cheaper though
Ugh, dude. I have watched all of your videos on this, and it's almost ragebait, at this point. I keep coming back, hoping to see that you got your system functioning @100%

And each time, it's *worse*. 

That fucking sucks. You're handling way better than I would.
Ole tommy got you fuckers so good.
üòÇüòÇ
Never seen a product from Tommy that was worth a shit. People need to stop giving that guy money
Whelp, I'm glad I didn't get one. I was mostly never enticed by them, as some people were by the mystique of the MP7, nor did I want to spend that much money on an MP7 clone without the HK roll mark on it. 

I'll be honest: I had a bit of FOMO when two of my friends got them, but that went away when both had issues with them.
I love this.
major oof
üòÇ
Dog shit
I‚Äôve been trying to commission him(TB) for years to convert a never fired SL8, it‚Äôs still in the bag collecting dust.
Honestly glad the shitshow of a launch fucked me out of buying one. I never envisioned some perfectly reliable clone of an MP7, but hoping it can get through a magazine never crossed my mind.
Tommy built in shambles
3 rounds dog...
Lol
Look like a POS to me
Dmanit I thought the mo expensive ALWAYS means the mo better!
This or a Zip22?
Mine got back from (first and hopefully last RMA for broken pin in bolt) today. Won‚Äôt be able to shoot it for a few days.

It‚Äôs crazy how they could ever have sent these out. Do they not test fire them?
Good to see you again Sgt.
This is an excellent edit
I'll never understand the allure certain weapons and semi-auto
Very expensive piece of crap
So this piece of shit is what I saw people playing like 8-10k for on GB? What the fuck
It‚Äôs still a knock off of a popular gun. Plus it‚Äôs a first gen I think so It‚Äôs bound to have issues
You're using it wrong! It's just supposed to look cool. Lol
Look on the bright side, you get to practice your malfunction drills.
CMMG makes a FourSix and I haven't read of any issues..
[deleted]
What a POS
What a POS!!!
FTE still there after rma?
how is this even being sold
Anyone used any of Dakota tactical‚Äôs products? 
Seems to have good quality guns from what I‚Äôve seen (as far as HK roller lock clones go). Must be better than Tommy built lol
I heard that the hk version has similar issues.
I bought an airsoft instead since I can pretty much do all the same things with it.
Need ID on the pants immediately. Kuiu Sierra?
Your supposed to throw it
Clearly a $3000 piece of shit
1000th upvote
This is wild.  I was constantly bugging Tom about this project over the past 2-3 years, and after I was finally able to order one from the first drop I was still bugging him until it shipped.  I was lucky enough to get one that has worked flawlessly through the 430 rounds I‚Äôve put through it so far (both suppressed and unsuppressed), and I wonder if he made sure to send me a good one just so he doesn‚Äôt have to deal with my annoying ass anymore.  I am sorry this happened to you, I would be pissed!
For everyone who thinks these bad reviews  are bad for Tommybuilt, these are selling on the secondary market between 7-10k. One just sold today for 11.5k. So even though I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs frustrating for an owner of a bad t7 just remember you‚Äôve still roughly doubled your investment. And remember don‚Äôt get a refund, make money.
Let hk forums tell it tommybuilt is the best thing out there ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Yikes. Sorry you‚Äôre having such issues boss. I‚Äôm very saddened to see people having such catastrophic issues. Sad to think, but this product sealed the deal for me and ever purchasing from this company. There‚Äôs no way these guns should be sent out without a proper test for function. To take 3500 from people and send them an untested, non functioning gun is an egregious error. He has yet to speak on this publicly as well. How?? Dude this clown of a company owner could‚Äôve put a PSA out saying hey, there‚Äôs issues, let‚Äôs figure this out. Whatever. nothing but radio silence. 
To see such failures, and ZEROOOO support is to be found for the public to see, TommyBuilt is 100000% out of my mind for EVER buying. I don‚Äôt care if this is first iteration. This gun is a dud and it‚Äôs yet to be addressed by him. Dude really shot himself in the foot on this one.
Where is Sirius Sirius at?
But do it take glock mags?
This is great. I still want one though
Welp, you keep fidgeting with it like your highschool girlfriends üò∫. Maybe lay off the caffeine.
Tommy Built (TB)? Todd Bailey (TB)? Is this just the latest iteration of Special Weapons, Bobcat Weapons, Coharie Arms? If it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs certainly the same situation. At least some of Todds later MP5 clones seemed to work pretty well.
The cuffed sleeves hurt my soul
TIMMAY
This is an insult to Timmmmaaayyyy
Hahaha
Bahahahahajahajaja
LIVIN A LIE
Damn near spit out my coffee
Does anyone know if the second run Tommy is releasing corrects all the issues the first run has
Rocks sure.  Even Random gravel from a slingshot is more deadly and reliable than this T7
B&T TP9. üòé
some just released another psa rock mp7 thing not long ago. im working on an mp7 shaped gun that has a mac9 upper inside it.
M11 with a lage upper and folding stock or brace
What I am most annoyed about is the overpriced accessories I bought just to use the thing. Amongst the ammo as well. The gun can be refunded or sold but I'll likely lose money on the other stuff.
Just watched your video man. This should not be happening to you. If Tommy doesn‚Äôt give you a refund I would sue him
Somebody has to so they can improve it
Gen 1 MPX owners in shambles
This is a code all consumers should live by but I get being excited for something, but with a hefty price tag these guns carry‚Ä¶caution really is key
I bought a first-wave Beretta ARX-100 and it remains awesome. I guess a 500-year-old gun company has figured out not to use their customers as beta testers.
[deleted]
The g36 was great for a first batch, the issue was the alphabet agency targeting small manufacturers that they could bully.
That's another thing that speaks loudly to me is that he has yet to publicly address the issues on his social media to give people the warm and fuzzy that he knows about the problem and is working on a solution...
Yeah, I'd say it's pretty safe to be in front of this gun.
He's only silent to the general public. He calls people who are public about the whole ordeal idiots on his private Facebook group, so all his Stans can defend him in the comments with their weird parasocial relationships.
Well, not really *silence* per se. 

He kinda mocks the people who are complaining if you know where to look‚Ä¶
He did try to get in front of it on various social media. Viewing the toxic white knighting was hilarious. All the claims of ‚Äúrma and you‚Äôre good‚Äù and now that rma is showing various examples aren‚Äôt fixed? Yea Tommy bit off way more than they can do. 

They have since left all the groups I viewed them in, the sticking up for the company is DEAD, and their reputation has went into the dumpster.  Don‚Äôt release a half baked product and maybe it would have made the company rather than break it.
I would love to hear his thoughts honestly lol
I call him Sirhan Sirhan
Until recently, with Black Ops Defense, Tommy was one of the few well-known guys doing conversions for SL8s, USCs, and MRs to their "correct" forms. I assume that because Tommy's track record, for the most part, was pretty good with conversions (outside of the T36 issues) and the hype surrounding his MP7 project. People didn't expect to see this many issues.
Haha I figured a little comedic relief was necessary glad you enjoyed it.
I really don't see any possible way that you could. If I didn't send it in to the manufacturer and tried to fix it myself thats one thing. But after the RMA and it works worse than before lol there's really no excuse IMO.
Haha sharing information with a splash of comedic relief.
Respectfully, I appreciate the help but at this point I am getting rid of the gun. I know there is a solution, but I don't believe, for the price, I should be the one trying to find it days after it left the manufactures hands for a 2nd time. And judging by the other YT vids out with others having completely different issues I am confident that this thing will just break again with another issue after I spend the time fixing this one. That's not a gun I am interested in owning at this current time.
Thank you! I appreciate the support and plan to much more! Hopefully more positive videos.
Thank you! And yes this is out of the box after I received it back from TB for the RMA. I haven't bothered to talk to him yet. The only conversation we will be having is for a refund if I can‚Äôt sell it (I've already had offers even with the issues). I have not posted it yet but feel free to share it there! I know about the forums I am just not a part of them. Just send me the link if you do I would love to see the comments. I only shared it here because this is the original place I shared the issues so I figured I owed this sub a one last follow up post to close things out. And thats a perfect reference ü§£ in this case though that bunny then took the basket back and returned it with an even bigger pile of poop in it unfortunately.
ü§£ü§£ Catch me on Soundcloud for that üî• mixtape
Refund ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Tommy spent that money already that‚Äôs why he is quiet, he trying to get as many suckers as he can to drop 4k before he stops making them and lays low for awhile.
ü§£üòÖ
But thats the entire facade that TBT had built up around their company, unless you‚Äôre really deep into the HK community and do a bunch of research, his company portrays itself as a boutique manufacturer making these guns you cant get anywhere else and they‚Äôre so high quality they do limited, numbered edition runs, and the price seems to reinforce that.

But it seems the opposite is true.
If its good enough to kill a giant! Two biblical wars!!
I thought you posted on ig about having one secured‚Ä¶ did that fall through?
Lawsuit
I was told he did but I don's see how that happened unless it was like 3rds and he said its good to go. Out of the box I got 5rds in and it had a FTF. Then later on it broke completely.
Would you say that the parts falling off your gun gave you a feeling of buying a quality firearm?
There's such drastic inconsistencies in the tolerances/ fitment of these guns that some work just fine, others don't work at all. There's no one answer when it comes to ammo, unfortunately. Mine hasn't worked on it under any circumstances. Brand new, suppressed/ unsuppressed. RMA'd came back shot 3rds, then FTF, and still didn't work with it.
I was super excited for the PSA one but my issue with it is the tilt barrel.
Lol I heard the same we prolly heard from the same guy
My biggest aversion to PDWs is just the lack of full-auto in the civilian offerings. The whole shtick of a PDW their compact profile with the ability to dump out a lot of pistol rounds quickly and controlably. Without the heightened fire rate, it's just a bulky pistol with a bad trigger.

Now once the NFA gets struck down and real PDWs hit the market, we can talk.
It does the same thing on an empty chamber the bolt gets stuck. And don't worry lol I won't be shooting it anytime soon. It doesn't even if I wanted to. üôèüèª

When we sold my girlfriends 5 days ago with a stock and grip all BNIB in RAL8K it only sold for 6.2k at auction with the starting bid being the price we paid. Still not a loss but definitely not double our investment.
Yea, it's probably just user error ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
JIMMAY!
Maybe it's just a TurdyBuilt then.
Why would anyone even risk it
Why even bother, it's so absurdly expensive it's just not worth the risk
I dont see how he could even sell a second run , who in their right minds would buy one of these at this point?
Extremely doubtful considering he cant fix the initial batch as shown above.
If you ask him. He says yes. And if you return your gen1 for rma he will fix and return.
Or just wait for the PSA x5.7 to come out next year and skip the printed chassis.
This. I just wish the mags were more durable.
Cost
PSA announced the X57 at shotshow. It was/is meant to launch by early 2025. 

I spoke to some employees during a different trade show, and the lead on the project left, and was replaced‚Ä¶ they said there were a few hiccups but it looks like it‚Äôs still on track for Q1 release.
Lol we‚Äôve been working on the same thing. It‚Äôs a really good idea.
Brownsbrush on google.
Will that be jUsT aS gOoD for malfunction drills?

Edit: Chill guys, I'm sarcastically asking of 3d printed shells will be just as good as the T7 is only good for malfunction drills.
Oh there's definitely some idiots in the HK subs, or on GAFS, that will suck those accessories right up, if you sell.
Yeah for sure man. The whole situation sucks. I watched your full video this morning. I can tell you're just over it. I would be too, at this point.
The crazy thing is you could sell it in this condition, fully disclose everything wrong with it, and probably still sell it for over retail. There are idiots like me out there that would buy it to tear apart, fix, then never shoot because I‚Äôm a hoarder not a shooter.
Just wait until HK releases the SP7, hopefully in our lifetimes. Or wait like a day before (if) Tommy takes preorders for the next batch and then go put the accessories all on GAFS. Some sucker might believe all the issues are fixed.
He‚Äôs gonna get a refund‚Ä¶
Did they have issues?
If everyone did that 1) companies would go under and 2) we would never get gen2/second batch.
For sure they‚Äôve built good guns, I‚Äôve thought about having them do a ump for me.
Oh we already know he addressed it once :) ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it Don‚Äôt buy one‚Äù
Concur, and he‚Äôs already got everyone‚Äôs email that signed up for his stock notifications
The click v. boom ratio
I can sum it up here for you ‚Äú your ruining tommys name‚Äù ‚Äú your a uneducated piece of shit‚Äù ‚Äú take this post down its all a lie‚Äù ‚Äú i love toms cock in my mouth‚Äù
That fair, I should‚Äôve specified to the MP7 project. I‚Äôve never heard of anyone that has a good experience with it is all I‚Äôm saying.
I have always read good things about Tommybuilt on all of the forums. It sucks that these Guns are not working but he can either make it right and save his rep or he can be a shitty Guy and not make it right. I would be just as upset as OP if I dropped this kind of coin and my gun didn‚Äôt work. Maybe it will be made right and OP will be happy in the future. I certainly can‚Äôt fault him for originally trusting Tom as I have always read good reviews of him for the last 20 years or so years.
I would have to agree.
Did they not at least test fire it after *fixing* it?
To say ‚Äúyup it‚Äôs good‚Äù twice is sort of ridiculous.
Thanks for the info bro. Respect to the woodland MARPAT blouse . I wear one to work everyday . Someone posted your video on the HK subreddit which is what I meant to say vs. Forum . The consensus is with you . Hey , at least you have the TP9 , what a sweet rig , and much cheaper to shoot . Hopefully you can recoup your moneys . Good luck and god speed Sir.
Certainly does a number on a watermelon or my windows.
Parts falling off the gun? Not sure what you mean.
That's what I don't get. Even if this gun ran perfectly... it would still be a shitty gun that runs expensive ammo that's sucks ass from a ballistics perspective. Ian from Forgotten weapons often makes the point that super rare firearm designs are often the worse possible ones because if they were *good* they would be popular.
Yeah practically its usage is low but hey, I own a sbr‚Äôed PS90 because I like it in video games. I guess its the same thing for a decent chunk of people here.
Good work. Thanks
Wow that‚Äôs a good price. I wish I would have bid. And the one that sold this morning was the same set up you sold. Ral t7, 1x 30rd mag, backpack, stock kit and grip for 11525 + 100 shipping + tax
It's definitely not Tegridy Built.
Because they did the first time or missed out. It‚Äôs like someone said about LAW folding adapters- there‚Äôs two people, those who want one and those selling theirs on GAFS.
I agree
Exactly! If it was chambered in 9mm troubleshooting this would be easier in my opinionn
Exactly! Every video out is nothing but a bad review. Tommy seems to have the only working T7
This was on my list, I'm definitely not interested anymore
I agree. Before the T7 dropped I rarely saw Tommy say ‚Äúexpect issues on a first gen‚Äù but when everyone got non functional T7‚Äôs Tommy wants to throw around the whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt expect perfection‚Äù
Ok that‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm a bit concerned because the OP here sent his in to be fixed and it‚Äôs not.
Like the one in the video?
[deleted]
I haven‚Äôt tested any of the ones I own yet, but I‚Äôve heard the KCI mags are gtg and better than OEM mags
There was a 3D printed version floating around r/fosscad a while back. Not sure if it was ever finished, but rumor was the developer got scooped up by PSA for the X57
im a noob using blender so hopefully i can remix enough peoples parts to get it close and have someone smart actually texture it and make it look good.
Its not gunna be just as good but i want a  gun thats like the mp7 that shoots 9mm that will only cost me like $200 to make so ya i hope it works fine when i finally finish it. Im a noob so its gunna take a but for me to actually get it looking good.
I hope so. And the worst part is hearing the people after you got reliable versions and your stuck with a lemon
You meant to preface with ‚Äúcompanies that release objectively broken products‚Äù would have those things happen to them
Precisely, even if he sent it via email and didn't post it on social media it would be a better look than ignoring it all together IMO.
He got ratioed.
Yeah, unfortunately, Tommy released these, and they all sold out instantly. He also shipped them out in a batch, so people got theirs around the same time. By then, when review and range reports came out, it was too late to do anything about it outside of hoping you didn't get a lemon, or hopefully didn't get around engraving your Form 1 yet so you can try to resell it to another poor sap.
His TG36 guns were always a toss-up in terms of quality, too. But people will simp hard for clones that HK will never offer.
In OP's video he got an email from Tommy saying he tested several different ammunition and magazine types and it had no malfunctions.

Side note: you can visibly see how defeated and frustrated OP is. Really sucks.
Thank you sir! And hell yea, been a while since I wore them but figured I would break them out for some vids. Love the TP9! And I appreciate it, same to you!
Thats gotta be an interesting story there..
Sorry, i thought you had made that video, in the original video on that channel the nose cap yeets itself off the gun after firing.
That's wild! I should've sold it wherever that was for sale lol.
Certainly could be Towelie built, wanna get‚Ä¶..
I've never felt so called out
Lol yup I ended up selling my LAW. Not a great idea when running the rifle suppressed. If fucks up all the harmonics of tuning the gun
It's supposed to be an MP7. If it's going to be in anything other than 4.7mm, it's 5.7mm
Total sarcasm
Exactly
I'd love some. Where did you find them?
The one that's a chassis for the Rock was just released July 21st and from what I remember they were contacted by PSA just to basically make sure they weren't gonna be stepping on each other's toes design wise but I could be remembering wrong. I think there is a 9mm one and another model as well but idk what's all involved with them.
Here yall go

I did have a flake of excess poly in my original t36, but that was an easy fix. My replacement tg36 receiver has been solid. I‚Äôm hoping he goes back to g36 production, but with how these guys are having issues that Tommy couldn‚Äôt replicate test firing I doubt he will.
Well I don‚Äôt know enough to call anyone a liar and I don‚Äôt have a dog in the fight, but that is hard to believe it only malfunctions when the OP holds it. There is a lot of ground in between ‚Äúno malfunctions‚Äù and what we are seeing here. 

Op have you tried asking the gun to run nicely?
Unskilled teen with a homemade sling + rock the size of a baseball + *really* bad aim. 

Thankfully, we were getting rid of the shed anyways.
Yeah these prices fluctuate a lot. I like your videos. They seem genuine and honest. Good jobüëçüèª
Don't forget to bring a towel‚òùüèΩ
They got me too, I was just lucky enough to fiddle with one on the same build I was projecting over at lgs and changed my mind.
I get it now. Thanks
Exactly what my joke was. Glad it got downvoted.
[deleted]
Tommy not being able to replicate these issues with his own test firing is frankly a hall of fame winning load of bullshit
That gun.. it‚Äôs got no Tegridy!
What is the issue with the law folder? I know the knock offs like Sylvan Arms are garbage quality, but the LAW is well built and really just meant for storage purposes, imho. Am I missing something? I think people had some weird expectations for the purpose and intent. The fact that the only major benefit is shortened length for storage makes the price point a no go for most.
Awesome, thanks!
That‚Äôs a bit too harsh of a take TBH, I‚Äôm curious if the OP sent his magazines in to be test fired with. That‚Äôs the nice part of 36 ownership, the 36 pmags are probably the single best pmags in existence.
They are not a great idea if you are running suppressed
Why's this?
The added weight of the LAW affects the bolt carrier group and you have to re-tune your gun with a differ buffer spring if you are using a fixed gas block. If you are using an adjustable gas block that can help the situation. LAW sells different pieces that fits in between the LAW and the bolt carrier group to help with this and lighten it up.
PPE
Am I protected enough? 

Sanitary welds at a brewery. Costume day. Had to break out my armor since I finally finished my kit. 
Just don't short out through your armor ü§£
That should keep you safe from attacks by ogres and imps while the gloves keep you save from the welding.
At first glance, this worried me üòÖ
When Barca crosses the Alps but the exhaust pipes for the hog have to get done first.

It‚Äôs TIG welding. As long as your skin is covered and you‚Äôre not overheating in that armor you should be good
Ayo what‚Äôs king theoden of the riddermark doin in the shop
Turn out the lights and you have a free disco ball!

Knight in shining armor is soo pick me lol. Happy Halloween
you need to cover those forearms. Extend the sleeves and tuck them under the gloves
I have seen the metal part of a belt in someone belly I can't imagine an arc strike with the armor
I love it! Happy Halloween
And yet there's still skin exposed...
Now that dude is hard as fuck
Awesome, are you sure about this being just a Halloween thing......... I mean, if you think about it, maybe we should make this regular clothing again
Because fuck everyone else's eyes in the shop
That is so goddang cool. Nice work!
This is awesome, but I really wouldn‚Äôt want to risk getting sparks or slag on such a beautiful suit of mail.
Those are some nice tool drawers

Hard work when you start at brewery but need to protect Gondor at 6.
Won‚Äôt protect him from the Angry Pixies though!
Gotta chime in on this, you can nuke your face with light reflected under the hood. Learned this from welding with a dark blue uniform with a hivis stripe 2" under the collar.
Where was Gondor when the last pipe broke!?
Real Ron Burgundy vibes. 

"Hey everybody! Come and see how good i look!"
If there's sparks, I'm doing something wrong!

Can‚Äôt believe this is happening to me
Day 4, where can
good shitpost.  im not a moderator, but i approve.
Dear Senator, please make the ATF work weekends and make the post office deliver on Sunday.
My first can was well over 400 days the 2 most recent were 76 and I was completely blown away with joy so it's all about perspective.
"puke then post on the wrong thread" ü§£ü§£ü§£
Got my first can back last week. Exactly 137 days
For real. 99 days on my last felt like hitting it big when my first took ten months
My first was 14 months. My second third and fourth were 353, 361 and 363. I only mention that because I am a jealous bitch that it's only like 10 days now.
Man my first can was 331 days and most recent at the beginning of this year I was tickled shitless when it was approved in 39.
Now that approvals are going through quickly, I‚Äôve been excited for my first can. The wait issues now are for back orders or necessary attachments being sold out.
My wife can tell whenever I buy cans now because she sees me checking my email every 30 minutes.¬†
445 days for my first can. That was pain.
It's never not based to bitch about the Government curtailing you and your fellow citizens rights. 

Spam those motherfuckers all you want lads. Waste some of the their time...fuck knows we pay too goddamn much for it.
glad i waited to get cans. i have 5 now and the longest i‚Äôve ever waited is 6 days. yay me
"back in the day..."
My LGS keeps telling me, this time it‚Äôll be fast. 

I have a trust and they‚Äôre never fast, never have been. I know this guy well at this point and he still says this to me with no hint of sarcasm. 

I‚Äôm just over here trying not to be (more) deaf.
Bro, I just picked up my can after 469 days. Wasn't even my first one, I don't wanna hear none of this shit from folks about having to wait 2 weeks lol.
Just got my first can back... Applied June of '22.  üòí
_Trust boys at 270 days be like_

#huh?
4 month approval. Just waiting on Capital Armory cleo notification hold.
The post in wrong thread got me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I got my first can in 2008. By the time I got the call saying it was good to go, I had forgotten that I got it.. lolol
First took 360 days, second took 10 months, and my most recent was right around 70 days. People complaining about waiting less than a month are dumb. Obviously I wish we had zero wait, but that‚Äôs not the reality we live in
I‚Äôve been waiting since early January on a suppressor, individual no trust. About to sit down this Saturday and start emailing as this sun recommends. It‚Äôs my first can too
I knew I was going to have to wait forever before, now there‚Äôs potential to get it quick and it‚Äôs driving me nuts.
Got 2 cans approved recently. 40 hours exactly
My first can was 377 days, the second was 250. Working on can 3 now
New NFA customers are hilarious, 48 hours after approval is when they start texting/calling/emailing asking if their silencer has been approved yet
I waited 320 days for my first. A month later I waited 3 days.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I was approved day 351, get swol.
dis is a massive cope
The more things change. The more they stay the same.
The disparity in approval time is wild. Is it associated with the state you‚Äôre in? Any correlations?
Email your senator every time it takes longer than 24 hours. In fact, email your senator every time you have to do NFA paperwork. Drive them crazy until they get it through their heads that they should do something about the overreach of the NFA.
My only can was 14months before I contacted my congressman office.  How times have changed
My first form 4 was 40-something hours. Same with my first form 1. Also within two days of each other. I will never complain about wait times even if I catch a vintage time at some point.
Painfully accurate. I felt a bit ashamed when the emailed me back saying everything was green on their end and proceeded to wait another 90 days
I emailed my senator before my backordered can was even made
I‚Äôm 12 weeks in on individual efile. I feel this.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
The amount of people that call with this exact attitude.
The BATF shouldn't even exist in the first place, much less place an undue burden on constitutional rights. Emailing people after the first 24 hours is perfectly acceptable.
Just picked up my fifth can yesterday after a day wait üòÇ

My first two I submitted 11/30/23 and they got approved 8/2/24. They where on a trust, bought another one on an individual form 4 and it was submitted 7/26/24 and I‚Äôm still waiting on it
I own 5 SBRS & 5 cans, decided to do my first real trust and even got a UPIN, still waiting on a 4/16 certification for my Knights can.
Been waiting 114 days for a efile trust form 4
My 1st can took 187 days back in 2023.  Second can took 48 hours in 2024!  Hopefully the next one is as quick
What is the fastest route trust or individual?
I certified on 8/27 and it‚Äôs driving me crazy lol got me talking about ‚Äúbabe if the ATF don‚Äôt approve we‚Äôre going to Europe when I get the refund‚Äù lol
72 days and counting. üò≠
Mine took 2 days.
Nah, it‚Äôs valid harassing public servants and 3 letter cucks
I have three cans, and within a week of submission, I start my email trails. It doesn't hurt my feelings if I am impatient. All my cans have been under 30 days on Trust and UPIN, so it must work a little.
Mods approve as well
Dear senator. Please abolish the ATF
Ok but I did get three approvals yesterday, on a Sunday
The post office does deliver packages on sundays
The ATF works on weekends, and the USPS delivers on Sundays. The USPS will also deliver cans to your door without a signature (even though it states one is required).
Trust I‚Äôd imagine?
Right? For my first stamp I went to Kinko's and paid out the nose for the fingerprints. Took fifteen months to get it. Second and third, I bought a kit online and did my own prints. Took a year. Fourth, fifth and sixth were eForms, and they took eight months. 

Now I see folks getting them back before their muzzle devices arrive in the mail, and I'm all out of stuff to buy. Might get another rimfire can just to see what it feels like these days.
I think they're getting longer again or I'm unlucky
I'm currently on the start of week 3 waiting for my second second NFA item and still haven't even gotten a shipping notification yet. I waited a bit longer for my first stamp.
Just add an alert, custom alert for said email addy. Like ‚Äúwanna be a balla shot calla‚Äù
This is like elephant pregnancy time vs human reproduction.
Submit your tax stamp and a Congressional inquiry on the same day. Normalize harassing the ATF until they're abolished, or at least until stamps are a same day ordeal like they should be.
You‚Äôre not wrong. But perfection shouldn‚Äôt be the enemy of progress. 

And some peeps just need to chill.
Fuck yeah. You hit the nail right on the head.
faulty logic.  even if you had to wait a year, if you bought them 5 years ago you would have already had it in hand 4 years.
Kids these days......
That‚Äôs friggin terrible. I feel like I‚Äôd forget I even had a can at that point.
Dumb, everyone, and I mean literally everyone, should be bitching that it takes anything more than going to your gun store and walking out the door with it.
But it is the reality now‚Ä¶
you should have started your email campaign like 5 months ago.  youre way past average.
just do it.  the best time to buy a can is yesterday.  the second best time is today.  the longer you wait to buy it, the longer it will be before you have it.
I would like to fight you now
Crazy, I am on week 2 and getting antsy lol¬†
You shouldn‚Äôt even need to ask permission it‚Äôs an accessory not a firearm (I also think you shouldn‚Äôt need permission to buy a gun but that‚Äôs a different can of worms.) ¬†I‚Äôd start emailing immediately after submitting the form 4
I imagine the data dude here could answer that. u/Rev686 is that you?
Actually, LynchMob_Lerry‚Äôs approval tracker is going to be the proper document for that. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsR8JOt8fcKIAbuv6ParmYTfSsUHwk3mEhVt0encK6g/htmlview#gid=381216475

My indirect observations, is that the state you live in doesn‚Äôt seem to matter much. Being plugged in to some of the local shops here, the wait times are like anywhere else. Hours/days to weeks, with a wild disparity. A buddy bought his first can hearing that all the wait times were dropping and it took him around 100 days.
This is the way
atf claims 41 days.  start emailing people.  regardless of the meme, youre way past average.
Call? We got a fed boi? üëÄ
They don‚Äôt make any sense this is my third NFA item i certified last week on Wednesday or something like that
Maybe because people shouldn‚Äôt have to *wait*‚Ä¶
Seems like individual
And TSA
My last approval was 01:13 (am) Eastern on a Sunday
Yep
My last seven trust approvals, with two year exemption, were approved in 8 through 15 days
Jevons paradox in action:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons\_paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

>In economics, the Jevons paradox (/Ààd í…õv…ônz/; sometimes Jevons effect) occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced.
I think so too. I averaged 3-5 days to get approved and now I‚Äôm on week 3 waiting for my latest can.
The shop I went to just had a dude get his 48 hours after certification. I certified on Sept 3rd so tomorrow is a week and I‚Äôm getting antsy lol
20 inch rims on the Impala, mmmmm yes.¬†
If you let off the gas you just create openings.
What made it easier was I bought it before deploying for 9 months, but I was fully expecting to be able to pick it up when we got back. Joke was on me of course as I ended up finishing the rest of my enlistment before being able to free it lmao
Yeah I know, tbh I was kinda down bad on cash so I wasn‚Äôt too worried. I got an Alaskan 360 to I could suppress my 9mm, as well as 5.56 and a potential 300blk, but I didn‚Äôt have the cash for the ammo as well as a piston, booster and new muzzle devices.

On a side note, do you know who all I should email? I can search the format for the emails on here, I know my congressional rep first, but after that I‚Äôm lost.
I totally agree and have already got one coming. I‚Äôm saying I knew I was going to be waiting last time so I just submitted and tried not to think about it. This time I‚Äôm checking my email every day waiting for the eforms approval.
üòÇ must have been lucky.
Damn did you do it as a trust or individual?
You can do that, but there's nothing dealers can do to speed the process along.
Are there any correlations at all or does it seem to be totally random? Like I wonder if being associated with a different alphabet agency or having done several FBI background checks speeds up the process.
They days have changed a bunch from when I purchased. 30, 60, 69, now 41. Emails have done nothing with generic responses if any. Phone call is just that it‚Äôs pending and processed in order they are received.
Username checks out.
Lol, fucccc no FFL/SOT submit Lotz of form 4s and people call and now have the same attitude like where gun...... They call and are like, "Where tax stamp ü§£ it's like bruh....... chilll the fuc out, it's been 2 days. Socks thr turn around times aren't as fast. This meme is sooooo accurate tho.
Sure but it‚Äôs been the status quo for 90 years.
fun fact, to meet the letter of the law, airports don't need tsa and all the crap.  to meet the letter of the law, a simple metal detector and bag x-ray, run by private security, is all that is required.
Damn, clutch reddit post
Good to know. Still waiting on my Form 4 from the first week of August.

https://preview.redd.it/vz3dqz7lwvnd1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5dfd1e4df32a2ef0c723a0e951327937854317
Yep same but 2nd week
house rep, both senators, FBI, and ATF.  id start with ATF on the off chance you were approved but not notified.
Gotcha
Individual¬†
It‚Äôs not the dealer you email it‚Äôs the ATF, congressman, senator. ¬†There‚Äôs some cheats posted around on how to get it done sooner¬†
Again, completely subjective, but I would almost bet it comes down to how each individual worker moves through their pile and gets to the NICS Proceed email. 

I *knocks on wood* always get an immediate proceed when I buy a firearm. Despite security clearances, and all the other gun store tropes. My fastest return was on the front end of the drop in wait times and was 61 days. My others have been 260 days ‚Äî‚Äî>13 months. 

My wait is/was probably determined largely by when my NICS check is submitted. 

As far as the process getting faster the background checks you‚Äôve done, I doubt it. Having worked in a gun store, some folks get delayed EVERY SINGLE TIME. Regular buyers would come in, pay for the item, submit the 4473 and would say, I‚Äôll see you in 3 days. 

I honestly think it‚Äôs simple bureaucratic inefficiency.
contact both your state senators and your house rep.  it varies from rep to rep, but thats who will get results for you, if anyone can.
Hang in there, hombre ü§†
Doesn‚Äôt make it right
Don‚Äôt get me started.
I fly on little bush planes and turbo props and they don‚Äôt have anything besides a scale, but when a jet lands, they bring in the actual security with the scanners and stuff.
Private security is more
Responsible than non responsible
Government run entity unfortunately.
Weird. Did you do it through your silencershop account?
Have not reached out to senators but the representative is worthless since they aren‚Äôt running for re election. I‚Äôll look into senators. I figured Kansas would be faster
Just email the senators from their contact forms or call to harass their staff for a call back??
Lol, sure will. Seeing silencers leave their jail cell is almost about my favorite things to see.
Lol, that‚Äôs not the argument. The point is, expect to wait.
[deleted]
I got it through capital armory. Certified the form 4 exactly 15 days ago now. ¬†ü•≤
Id Start with the standard contact form.
*No*
No there‚Äôs like 3-12 people on there as well. Heck even the Saab 2000 turboprops didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt require any security at the Anchorage airport. Downstairs out of security.
That could be the difference. I transfer all my suppressors to a store that has a silencer shop kiosk. So when we do the form, its all electronic with my silencershop account.
Hope it comes in soon though!
Capitol armory is pretty straight forward they use an EFT for prints and submit the form 4 for you then ship to your door. ¬†I always get a delay for firearms purchases so that might be why also. ¬†Time to start emailing the atf lol. Although the sticky spreadsheet shows for the last 30 days the average approval time is still in the 20+ day mark so idk
Now on day 22 still no approval üò≠ lol
Sounds similar to the one time I bought from silencer central. Shipped right to my door from them and it took a lot longer. I was cool with it though because I financed the can, so i needed 4 months to pay it off anyways.
Start counting weeks instead. Smaller number üòÇ
Aww man I hope that‚Äôs not how it ends up ü§£
How do I clean the metal dust off these magnets?
Just kidding! Happy 4th of July you fucking ball bags!
Compressed air. **outside**
I just wipe 90% of it off with my glove and push the rest to the face not being used
That‚Äôs the thing, you don‚Äôt lol 

But for real compressed air outside
You‚Äôre going to need a stronger magnet that will pull it off that magnet.
Just use an old bit of cloth/rag, you‚Äôll never keep them totally spotless in a workshop.

Haha just seen your comment under the picture, üé± üíº
Flick it off with a wire brush.
Put a bag over another magnet. Use ur gloved hand to slide stuff from one magnet to the other.

Pull bag away from the magnet to make all the shavings pull away entirely from the second magnet.

Now all the shavings should fall to the floor, use a magnet to pick them up.
I lick mine off works well usually
Exchange them at harbor freight
Just use a brush. Idk if I'd want that shit blowing around with an air compressor - knowing my luck, it'll somehow get in my eyes.
Just heat them up a bunch eventually the dust will fall right off
Awwww, getting fuzz on your parts is part of growing up
Throw them in the fucking trash
A brass brush works pretty good
Turn it off. Once the dust falls off, turn it back on.
Use a bigger magnet but cover it with a plastic bag, then pull the bag out, the shavings will fall off.
Wire brush into the bin
I just wipe em on my pants most times
You wipe it with your ball sack. Works great!
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Hot glue.
If you‚Äôre a journeyman, grab ahold of your apprentice and wipe it on them and then berate them because they should have already cleaned it.
Air compressor. Just make sure you do it in a safe place
Find a tinner and ask him for a roll of "gumby." It's what I use. I guess you could also use silly puddy.  A guy I used to know would wrap tape backwards around his hand and wipe it off.
A bigger magnet
Somebody else's bigger, even stronger magnet
Wipe it off with your bare hands.
I would suggest air outside with PPE but that is  no fun. I'm now recommending licking it. Report back with taste please. My guess is blue raspberry.
Funnily enough I cleaned mine off earlier today, just hit it with compressed air from the air blower. Cleaned it up nicely!
One good method for cleaning magnets is just some simple duct tape. It‚Äôs one of the best things for getting all the little metal particles off
Wire brush homie
Fire
Bruh just get a air hose at your work and put a nozzle on that bitch and blow it dineeeeee
Freeze it.
Use a bigger metal dust grabbing magnet to clean the welding magnet. Then get a slightly bigger magnet to clean the cleaning magnet.
Torch
Air hose
That's the neat part! You don't!!!
Finger
Just turn the magnet off and it will just fall off üëç
What a massive upvote
Wipe it off with an ungloved hand
Have you tried putting it in a bowl of rice
The best way I know is compressed air
This is how I've always done it, [Wranglerstar](https://youtube.com/shorts/3mwapIGEpYw?si=znzw8vb_Y-Mm24Cz) has a video.
Melt candle wax onto it and let it harden
If you‚Äôre able to re-magnetize them, I heard that dropping a magnet makes it lose its magnetism. Idk how much though. 
Oh wait, I just remembered, a dumbass quote: ‚Äúmagnets, you throw a cuppa water at them boom, magnets busted‚Äù
The best way is to never use them
Tell it politely, but firmly, to leave.
Use a bigger and more attractive magnet.
Bigger magnets
The good ole lick n' spit.
A more powerful magnet, and to clean that one: a even more powerful magnet... It is turtles all the way down.


On a serious note, a toothbrush will do.
Do you have some more magnets?
Tongue it
Get a bigger magnet to pull them off. Then throw that one away.
Uhhh bigger magnet obviously, must be purchased from acme&co..
If anyone tells you use a wire brush don‚Äôt listen, nothing gets it cleaner than compressed air. FACTS
Compressed air for the win!! And then I recommend one of the magnets with the pull cord / on and off switch to pick off the floor and dispose of in trash
Blow it with an air gun, wear mask and glasses
Have you tried turning them off and then back on?
Playdough
Upvote!!
bigger magnet.
Duct tape takes it right off.
120psi
Blow gun and some safety squints
Heavy duty duct tape
A stronger magnet.
Can only be removed with your mom's tongue.
Air compressor
With a stronger magnet
They made upvotes into a real thing
Pantyhose
Wire brush
Wire brush my dude
Obviously just hit it a blowtorch until it demagnetizes, wipe it off, purchase a \~$4000 powered magnetizer, put it in, and push the button. It's not that hard.

Throw it on the ground angrily. Nah jk air compressor works wonders.
Thumb gum.
Real answer. i brush 90 % off with my gloved hand then take it outside and blow the rest off.  Like new
I just use a vacuum. no need to spread it all outside
To pull anything off a magnet, simply wire up an electromagnet. Simple.
Always wrap magnets in some "thin" cloth. before hand. Then when the metal pieces are stuck to the magnet you can just pull the cloth off and the pieces come with it leaving the magnet clean.
Put a *very* strong magnet in the bottom of a bucket, hold the entire bucket near whatever you need to get the dust of off. Dust will get stuck to the bottom of the bucket, then you hold the bucket over the trash can as you lift the magnet off the bottom of the bucket to drop the dust.
I get most off with gloves and if I need it really clean I put liquid latex on them and then peel it off. I buy a small bottle every Halloween at Walmart. Works great for earbud cases too.
Seriously, a good sticky tape is great for removing metal dust from magnets. Brush or otherwise pull off any metal that you can then use tape to get the rest of. Wrap the magnet in a bag or a single layer of packaging tape afterwards to make future cleaning easier.

Just turn the magnet off and they will fall. Beat way to do this is to heat it up with torch to a temp over 300¬∞C
Hit it with the torch.
Duct tape
Heat them?! It'll fall right off!!
Vacuum then air compressor for less mess.
Metal brush are highly recommended for that task!
Just wipe it with a rag
Wire brush over the trash can.
I either use a compressed air hose outside, or you can use a wire brush and wipe it really fast. Works pretty good
With a torch
Straight into Boston harbor. Didn‚Äôt we fight a war with England so this we didn‚Äôt have to clean our magnets anymore.
Have another one to pull it off :) #clever

Turn the magnet off
Snort it
Wax is the only thing I have found that takes it all off
I slip a zip lock bag (or some other baggy) over the strongest magnet I have, and use that to clean the filings off other magnets.  Then flip the baggy inside out and it has all the filings in it.
Yep compressed air!!!
first lower your expectations for when you consider these to be "clean"

I use leather gloves and pinch it off. It gets the majority. I wonder if flex tape would grab all those filings.
To the people saying compressed air, I don't want to be a safety sammy but you shouldn't ever use compressed air to remove toxic particles
With a rag. When clean use blue tap over your magnets. When done peel the tape ,no more filings on your magnets

Snark aside - I use a brass brush to clean those magnets.   
I also do it over the dust collector - while wearing respirator, goggles and ear protection.
You need a bigger magnet. Stronger than that magnet..
I don't recommend this but wiping it vigorously with your hand will get most of it off

I would suggest another way but . You can just chuck it off with your hand. Wearing gloves though.

I agree with the top comment about the compressed air, but I've also found a thick grip of paper towels and a touch of rubbing acetone takes it right off
With a bigger more powerful magnet. 
Lol. 

As others have said. Compressed air. Wear glasses.
How long you had those magnets? I've got a pair in my box that I bought well over a decade ago, from TSC. As a non-professional welder, with most of my projects being of a smaller scale, they don't get much use, although I've got a project I plan on building this weekend what they may work for, bit likely not(I'm building a 3/4t pneumatic shop press, and the framework is an upper 6" C-channel plate 4.5" long, with 1/4"x4"x\~24" vertical legs(with 11/16" hex  welded to the center for X/Y strength, Z strength from the plate is well over the cylinders output.) Given the orientation of the C-channel, the only welds these magnets would be useful for is those on the legs to baseplate.

Stronger magnet. Slap em together and make bang
You don't
Get a pressure washer, mount it to something, and go to town. It will get a lot of it off, so when you do take it inside to blow it with air, it won't be as hazardous.

What you are looking for is the Curie Temperature.
Or heat that magnet enough so it loses its magnetic properties. Once cooled down, your magnet should get its properties back again.
Be careful not to heat it too much tho, as it will remove its strengh permanently (or at least, until you magnetize it again).

I use an oxy/fuel torch with cutting tip to blast it off. Iron loses some of its magnetism when it's heated making it easy to blast off with the cutting oxygen. Don't heat the crap out of the magnet.

My go to trick is to turn a Ziploc bag inside out, put the stronger magnet inside and remove the shavings. Remove them from the stronger magnet by pulling the bag off, turning it right side in. 

Then sprinkle on your friends tools.
Its magnets all the way down
Industrial magnets can be turned 'off' by rotating a lever. They use permanent magnets which are aligned in such a way that in one orientation the magnetic flux aligns and attracts strongly, turning it aligned then in such a way that they fight each other, cancelling it out.
Put a plastic bag around it first or buy a very powerful magnet with an off switch
I posted a serious answer. I don't understand the reason you had to write just kidding

Heck, if they were heavily shaded it could even work for welding
The answer is yes. I had screws put in my foot and the surgeon told me never to get an MRI because it would rip them out of the bone.
Not with Tig. I've sunburnt myself through a flannel shirt before.
Uhhh, I have screws and staples in my left elbow.  I've had several MRI's since that surgery.  The screws and staples are still there.

Wear helmets (friendly reminder)
Took my girlfriend up snowboarding for her second time today. She caught her back edge on the bunny hill and whiplashed her head into the ground. 

This resulted in a concussion, severely bruised tail bone, a ride down from Ski Patrol, and a hospital visit. All of this even though she was wearing a helmet.

The doctor (who also snowboards I might add) said without a helmet this likely would have resulted in a cerebral hemorrhage. 

Despite this, once she's healed up, she wants to get back on the mountain and keep learning!

Stay safe out there fellas.
Shit, I thought your photo was a body bag. I'm glad to hear all is well ü´∂
Back in the mid to late 2000‚Äôs no one was wearing helmets. I had terrible head collision one day while falling backwards on a front board. From that point on I always wear one.
Good to hear she will be okay. Glad she was wearing the helmet.
Glad she‚Äôs okay! Stay safe out there. 

One of my best friends bit off a little more than he could chew last winter and ended up taking a nasty fall on the hill. Even with the helmet, he was in a coma for 2 weeks, had a cerebral hemorrhage, and even had his heart stop briefly.. but, he‚Äôs alive. Doc said if not for the helmet, it would‚Äôve been curtains.

For anyone reading, spend the money and buy a good helmet! Hope everyone has a safe season on the slopes!
Helmets are a must!  I have worn one snowboarding for 35+ years and will until my last run. 
Glad your GF is going to be ok and that she isn't dissuaded by this. 

As an aside, anybody know what kind of HH pants they all seem to be wearing?
New helmets are so much warmer and more comfortable than a hat.
A helmet has quite literally saved my life on multiple occasions both at work and during recreational activities. I will always wear a brain bucket doing anything remotely dangerous. I‚Äôm already 3 or 4 concussions deep I don‚Äôt need any moreüòÇ. 

Spend the money and buy a good helmet.
The one time I forgot my helmet at home by the door I had my first accident at the mountain. I got really lucky but needless to say I now pack my helmet before everything else.
I didn‚Äôt ride for 22 years. I never wore a helmet. That said before I even strapped my new board on my feet to ride the first time again after all those years‚Ä¶I bought and wore a helmet. Glad I did too. Similar incident with greater speed and I broke both wrists and arms last February. Can‚Äôt wait to get back to riding.

You don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt lose cool points for wearing a helmet.
Not a snowboarder, this just popped up in my feed but as a skateboarder I am so happy to see helmets get cool. I also thought this was a body bag post so I'm glad to hear she's okay, even happier to hear she wants to keep riding. Good luck.
Last year in whistler some guy came way too fast over some moguls on chunkys choice (a black diamond) and he absolutely yard saled. Like full rag doll 8 or 9 times. Smashed goggles and smoked his head. Got up in a daze but would‚Äôve probably been dead without a helmet. Absolutely brutal crash he was out cold for a bit. Did not want help and kept skiing down a minute later at extremely high speed
My one and only helicopter ride was due to not wearing a helmet, and I don‚Äôt even get the pleasure of remembering it. I was in a coma for 22 hours.

Waking up with a tube in your throat isn‚Äôt cool. Nor is not wearing a helmet. 

This was in 2002. I wear a helmet now.
Absolutely yes. Last year we were in Whistler. My 8yo son and I going down some slightly icy blues. Came upon a woman who was off her skis, on the side of a run, just wandering around, slurring her speech. I thought she was hammered at first. Until she turned and we saw the back of her head was covered in blood. Another skier stayed with her while we raced to the next chair to call ski patrol.

I have no idea what happened to her.

But still, 10 months later, he‚Äôll occasionally wake up with nightmares about the sight of her head. While I completely hope she fully recovered I‚Äôm still pissed at her for not wearing a helmet and subjecting my son to that.
I had my first ride down today, also in PC at woodies hahahah. Safe healing!
Keystone? I think I passed you all today, and there was another one downed further down the hill as well.
I had the exact same thing happen, but thankfully was all okay. Caught my heal edge while facing up the hill and came slamming down hard on the back of my head. 100% got a concussion from it since i was extremely dizzy and was seeing stars everywhere right after, but that was it. Definitely should get a helmet if you haven‚Äôt yet
Brain bucket.  So necessary.   Work in icu.  And see this shit. It‚Äôs fucking awful.   You‚Äôre free to ride w/o but understand the increased danger.   You can be the best rider on earth and some dipshit can take you out too.
I whiplashed into the snow once and even with a helmet got a minor concussion. Without one, it would have been a proper TBI. The helmet actually deformed absorbing the impact and Smith (the manufacturer) gave me a 30% off discount on a new one. 

10000% agree with the op, please always wear a helmet.  I see so many park rats doing insane jumps with just a beanie on and it makes my stomach churn.
Bro I am so glad she is okay. I had a similar accident wearing a helmet that nearly resulted in a brain bleed as well. My gf was torn up about it. I can only imagine what you and my gf must have felt in those situations. Y‚Äôall be safe please
üëç on wearing a helmet. Got my concussion like 20 years ago snowboarding. Thankfully I just started wearing helmets back then. Shits scary AF. still to this day all I remember is going down on the red sled huffing oxygen, getting an MRI, and puking on the ride home. Then went to school the next morning lol. Glad she's OK
Always have a helmet on now days I've had one too many cuncuhies for my liking.
Glad she‚Äôs doing good! I‚Äôve always worn a helmet but I never thought it was that important until I clipped an edge and slammed my head into the ground. Couldn‚Äôt remember the 5 hours after that and needed an implant in my eye socket after I blew out an orbital.
i still dont understand why people dont wear helmets.  you may think you have the best control, but ive seen idiots just bash into people and wreck them.  you cant control others.  am i saying live in fear no, but why risk it...
The worst fall I ever had was in a beginner area and it really rung my bell, horrifies me seeing people off piste without a helmet
I had multiple concussions snowboarding in my teens and 20s.  Nobody wore helmets back in the day.  Some were pretty bad. I wonder what it may have done to my concentration and focus years later.
So glad to hear she‚Äôs ok and still wants to ride! Stay safe this season üôèüèº
Good vibes for a speedy recovery to the young lady!
I'm glad she's ok- I caught an edge a few years back and knocked myself out. When I came to, I didn't remember what trail I was on and didn't remember falling. Cracked my helmet too. If I wasn't wearing a helmet- I probably wouldn't be writing this now. Wear the helmet.
Thank god she‚Äôs okay, hopefully moving forward will bring better days  üòÖ
Omg. I wish her a fast recovery.
I like the ‚ÄúMeowdy üê±ü§†‚Äù shoulder patch on the ski patrol there, need one. Like a cat-tour-of-duty war shield but for bunny hill rescues. Hope your gf heals up!
How often should we be replacing our helmets?
So happy to hear she‚Äôll be ok. So glad she was wearing a helmet. Unfortunately there are still many who are just too cool for helmets and don‚Äôt feel they need it and get offended when told about wearing one. Let‚Äôs hope those people  never have a bad fall.
good to hear that she will recover and even better to hear shes still keen on snowboarding :) all the best
No kidding. I got a bad concussion from catching an edge at 17. I lost 2 weeks of memory. Headaches and fatigue for a while afterwards. I was also wearing a helmet at the time. It's scary to think what would have happened without it.
Glad your gf is ok!
This last weekend I caught an edge and was going pretty fast, fell backwards with no time to react and head hit first, pretty bad whip lash where the next day the front of my neck was sore.  

Luckily I was wearing a helmet walked away no injury
Look into a MIPS helmet / multi impact protection system ‚Ä¶ see the ski patrol on the right? His helmet has a yellow sticker that says mips
Glad to hear she will be ok..scary stuff. Was the helmet she was wearing a MIPS helmet?
Woke up in the ER at Mammoth in April without a clue how I got there. Apparently I was found down on the slopes knocked out after maybe catching an edge or something. Helmet cracked seriously. Can‚Äôt imagine if that had been my head. Concussion and a week or two of headaches and feeling out of it but would have been so much worse.
My first lift with a helmet a big piece of ice dislodged and smacked me hard on the bean. Would have been a short day without the helmet, I'm pretty sure it would have been a concussion at least.
Holy shit. Hope she's okay.
WAVECELL ALL THE WAY
Yep and if u get in a bad wipe out n helmet takes a hit. It's time for a new one.
In my 35 years of riding I have worn a helmet for roughly 30 of them (what year did the Red MT-1 come out, that was my first helmet). I started wearing one after took a dead branch hidden behind small live one to the top of my head. It knocked me on my butt but luckily the dead branch broke away and it only left a small laceration. In the 30ish years of wearing a helmet the worst I‚Äôve experienced was only 3 occurrences where I had my bell rung but no concussion (2 of them were head whips from falling heel side). To me that is a fair trade for wearing one. Additionally, my helmet keeps my head warmer than any beanie and the sound system is way better than the Sports Walkman earphones I was wearing when that branch clocked me. üòÉüëç
I‚Äôm an ortho/trauma nurse and I used to work with a doc that was also I snowboarder. I mentioned that I rode a race setup from time to time. We joked about how park riders generally come to us and we usually have send the racers to neuro. ‚úåÔ∏èüòÅ
I came undone in the park a few years ago, ended up shattering my helmet, knocking myself out and having concussions symptoms for more than a week due to how much I battered my brain. (Had scans multiple times over the course of the week to keep on top of it). 
Would absolutely not be here if I wasn't wearing one.
Did exactly the same thing on a flat my first day out this year, broke my helmet too. Still have numbness on my ass cheek a month later. The doctors seemed annoyed when my gf finally convinced me to go in to ER a couple days after. 

My physio was the most concerned person after my woman lmao.
More important to say that you should learn basics of carving at least, taking some lessons‚Ä¶ particularly if it is your first time :/
Literally same thing happened to my GF, helmet-edge-concussion. Scary to think about what could happen without one
I never used to wear a helmet until I caught an edge on ice and came round 10 mins later with a patch of blood next to me.
I feel like the worst falls are sometimes honestly just the simple edge catch going slowly on firm snow (cracked my wrist the same way), if you stack it on a steeper incline or a jump the momentum carried forward takes always a lot of the impact
I also received a severe concussion with a helmet on. Doc said if i wasn‚Äôt wearing it I would be dead. I don‚Äôt snowboard with anyone who won‚Äôt wear a helmet
Thanks for the PSA but anyone not wearing a helmet in 2023 isn‚Äôt wearing because they are unaware of the risk, they think it looks cool or some dumb shit. Skateboarders are far worse, 90% of them don‚Äôt wear helmets and are riding around on cement.
I cracked a helmet when I messed up the landing of a jump as a teenager. I was really happy it was the helmet, and not my head!
I ride goofy and when I was riding perpendicular to the mountain following the run I fucked up a left turn to head down towards the lifts. Caught my toe edge and whiplashed my face and chest into the ground and slammed my forehead into the mountain. My feet then full skorpion‚Äôd over my head and I slid a solid 20 yards down the slope on my butt. I had a helmet on and went for concussion protocol and was completely fine. Wear your helmets yall
I'll never ride without a helmet. I had a bad situation when I was in Tremblant, riding their natural half pipe. I caught my heel edge, slammed backwards, and whipped the back of my head off a rock. I was wearing a helmet, thankfully, but the helmet split in half. I don't remember much of the incident. I just remember waking up at the bottom of the mountain with a bunch of people standing over me. 

They must have medical facilities there, because I remember being checked out by a doctor, but we didn't leave the resort. They said I'd have died without the helmet.
Shattered my collarbone back in 2017. Caught my edge and went flying and straight into the ground. Didn‚Äôt realize it at first, but my helmet had a massive dent in it. No concussion, but my helmet probably saved me from having a worse injury. Whoever says helmets aren‚Äôt cool, are idiots. Wear one and you‚Äôre the coolest fucker on the slopes
lol this happened to me on Saturday on skis, although probably more minor. Since I hit my head next investment is the best helmet money can buy.
Thought I was starting my week with a body bag photo and story üíÄüíÄüíÄ glad to hear she‚Äôs alright man lol
I‚Äôm glad your gf is alright.  I noticed the Park City jacket and i was there yesterday too!  There was some kid who got seriously injured on the kicker ramp yesterday.
Speedy recovery for your girlfriend OP! Good on her for not getting scared and wanting to quit!
Have a Friend who hit his head. No helmet and became a whole different person. Also he can‚Äôt Watch movies or move to fast because he will get sick and throw up. Love your helmet can‚Äôt see how someone choose not to because he want to look cool.
Shout out to park city ski patrol!
Liam Neesom's wife died bonking her helmetless head skiing.  And I think it was a bunny hill since she was taking lessons.  Doesn't take much to cause massive head trauma.
Get her a new helmet before she goes again. The one she wore is compromised. Doesn‚Äôt take much to damage a helmet and make them much less protective. A fall like that and that helmet is not going to help much. Not enough people understand this.
yep, good on ya, similar early season slam for a friend of a friend I know, no helmet, airlifted, still in ICU going on a month now.
My worst fall was going over the front of the board making a heel side turn. Was moving pretty quick and slingshotted head and shoulder first down the mountain. Couldn‚Äôt believe the impact, had an open cut on my nose from where my goggle smashed into my face.. luckily I was wearing a helmet but I still blacked out for a few seconds
As a kid, I was learning to snowboard after already learning how to ski. My parents insisted I wear a helmet. I felt dorky because none of my friends did and I never wore one skiing so why would I need one? One day, I was going down the bunny hill and fell. I slid on my back, head first, into the lifts. They were J bars. An empty one was swinging and as I slid into the line of lifts head first, it swung square into my head. The bar bounced right of my helmet and I was completely fine. It would‚Äôve been a different story if I didn‚Äôt have that helmet. Definitely changed my opinion on helmets after that.
Retired ski patroller here. Trust me: Always always always wear your helmet. No matter how experienced you are all it takes is one rock or a little patch of ice to send you head first into a boulder along the edge of the trail. No one wants to extricate you from a gully, upside down because it was too warm for your helmet or you were born on skis
Newbie to snowboarding here. Had only been boarding about 5 times. I was getting off the lift, and my friend and I fell right after getting off. The lift hit me right in the back of the head. Luckily I had a helmet on. Never taking off for any reason.
My wife was struggling at the end of a day last year at Vail as we tried to get down the catwalks to the bottom. Got VERY near the base area, went to turn down the next catwalk, she hit some ice and quickly caught her heels and slammer her head.

Instantly she's like "I'm okay, I think, but I'm definitely done. How can I get down?"

Luckily patrol was nearby doing a sweep and we were able to get her a ride down on the snowmobile. By the time we were at the bottom, she was feeling mostly better, but I shudder to think how much damage she would've done with that fall if she hadn't had a helmet on.
I got rammed (by a two-planker, just because everyone always assumes it was a snowboarder) into the woods in 2004. Hit a couple rocks on the way down. 

Thankfully had a helmet on, so escaped with a bad concussion, 11 days of total amnesia, and sixish months of short-term memory issues. 

Without that helmet I‚Äôd be dead, or worse a vegetable. 

Helmets forever.
i yard-saled catching a back edge back in like 1998-99 and it rang by bell pretty good.  i was like 12 so i bounced back fine.  i didn't start snowboarding again until 2018-19 and started right off with a helmet because i don't feel like dying.
Always wore a helmet, still managed to break my neck.. (literally) at least i didnt get a concussion lol‚Ä¶
Don‚Äôt forget to replace the helmet!
When I quit snowboarding 12 years ago you would only see helmets on little kids learning to ski.  Coming back to the sport this season and now EVERYONE has one and I'm really really happy to see it.
Fuck yeah man. I'm glad she wants to keep going at it. Stay safe out there.
I fell so hard, catching an edge on an iced over run last year that I cracked my helmet. Even with it on, it was the worst concussion I‚Äôve ever had. Enough to scare my husband into finally wearing one (he never once in his 25+ years boarding until then).
I never wore a helmet growing up and never fell on my head.  The one year I bought a helmet is the same year I fell 40 feet on ice and cracked my helmet and was concuss.  I‚Äôm so thankful to have a helmet every time I ride now.  It‚Äôs great to see more pros wear helmets when riding park.  Big Bear CA used to frown on helmets but now every top boarder has one.
Me and my brothers all bought helmets last time we went riding. I‚Äôve been riding without a helmet for years up until this point. A friend called us out and we decided to hold each other accountable and just spend the money to be safe. Also had a lot of close calls riding in the trees last season. Stay safe everyone!
Whiplash is no joke, please Remember constantly check on your girlfriend even months later . Whiplash + concussion together are both very commmon and the symptoms sort of lend themselves to one another. 
A small hit to the head at this point will probably feel extremely jarring
Lots of comments from people who have had 1 close call and sensibly won‚Äôt take the risk any more. Hopefully some will read these and just wear a helmet without having that close call first.

Yeah sure you might look like a loser and your mates might tease you but you‚Äôll be an alive loser which is infinitely cooler than one that‚Äôs had their head caved in.
Can I ask what symptoms she had that made you call ski patrol? Did she get knocked out? I did this exact thing at Breck in March, and after sitting there and getting it together for a few I rode to the end of the run and that ended my trip on day 1 of a 4 day trip. I never got it checked out but always wondered if I should, def had whiplash but I worried about a concussion as well. I guess there may not be much you can do for that but rest anyway which is what I did.
I had a very similar experience going too fast and clipped the top of a tree (early season) and had severe whiplash and concussion. If I didn‚Äôt have a helmet it would have been so much worse. Always wear your helmet of you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre a kook
I started learning how to snowboard and didn't wear a helmet for the first 3 times. Then one day in a thrift shop I saw a helmet for 5 bucks and said "ehhh, why not." I went out again and decided to get a little more confidence in my riding skills. Went off course and saw this small hill, I was going to ride the top and go back to the main and all of a sudden my board flew out under me and fell backwards and smacked my head pretty hard. Looked where my head was and it was just sharp rocks. My head hurt for a good while after that but man, if I didn't have that helmet, I don't know what would've happened but I was so happy I got one. Who cares about your cool hats and stocking caps, wear a helmet and spend the extra money, or find a cool one at a thrift shop.
I managed to do this yesterday as well. It was my yearly reminder to keep wearing my helmet. I very rarely catch my back edge anymore, but we have shit snow up here in the PNW and it just happened. Walked away with a minor concussion and a sore back/neck from the whiplash.

Wear your helmets folks. It could save your life.
Noticed a crack in my helmet recently, just ordered a new one!
Yup! Years ago I was riding an easy ass catwalk and caught my edge and knocked myself out cold. Helmets are the way. Good thing is, I took a few years off and helmets used to be pretty rare and uncool but now they seem to be the norm.
Rite of passage, I guess.

Speedy recovery and fresh pow!
I think I‚Äôm on borrowed time, 43yo non-helmet skier, I‚Äôm thinking of going helmet for the ear buds and GoPro mount
Started snowboarding in 2004, it was noticeable you looked out of place wearing a helmet, in 2009 I caught a heel and properly whacked my head, went down the mountain and purchased a helmet there and then. I would say in the past 5 years it‚Äôs so noticeable the change and go so far to say you look out of place not wearing a helmet these days.
Reminder to be safe in general. 6th day learning for me and I fractured my humerus bone.

Be careful out there! Have fun!
It‚Äôs the easy or transition slopes when you lose your focus, start chatting, check your phone and suddenly catch an edge. Happened to me at Keystone a few years ago.. my helmet got shattered and I got a concussion and I don‚Äôt want to even think about the outcome if I didn‚Äôt wear one.
I do not like this thread lol. All these stories‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll continue being the slow carver.
Good application of icing your injury to reduce inflammation.
Glad to hear she is okay! Helmets >>>
I was cruising pretty fast once and somehow I ended up facing up hill and airborn on my snowboard. This is northeast skiing so anything could have caused it but I slammed my head so hard when I came down. Didn‚Äôt even hurt. People came up freaking out and I am certain I would have long lasting brain damage if I didn‚Äôt have my lid on
First time I went boarding I caught an edge and the metal edge of the board came all the way up and hit me under the eye. Black eye and laceration, 1/4‚Äù higher and I probably wouldn‚Äôt have an eyeü•∂
Been wearing one ever since I learned 12 years ago, when a guy teaching me said his buddy died from hitting his head without a helmet. Shit scarred me but worked in making me wear one no matter what I‚Äôm doing on the mountain. You just never know
Wear a helmet because it'll be embarrassing when your ass has to be saved by a bunch of skiers
I'll never NOT wear a helmet on the mountain. As a beginner you fall enough for it to be useful, and when you start getting better falls haver higher consequences.
I will NEVER understand why people don‚Äôt wear helmets.

I‚Äôve only needed my helmet once, caught my front edge and slammed head first onto a solid pack of snow. Without my helmet I more than likely would‚Äôve lost consciousness and suffered some really bad head trauma
I started wearing one a few years ago after riding for 20 years without one right after I get married again.

Some people are worth living for
I didn't wear a helmet and woke up in a hospital. Even with a helmet it's dangerous, glad ur gf is okay. Nobody on the slopes should be without a helmet, it's so reckless like smoking in restaurants.
I remember I used to not wear a helmet. Then one time I caught an edge going Mach 6 at a shitty resort (solitude) I was visiting because family was in town. Couldn‚Äôt remember what happened. Just kept asking if I had a helmet on and what resort I crashed at for hours at the hospital. Major memory issues for a while. Luckily I was wearing a helmet when I crashed or else I probably would be a vegetable right now.
 I‚Äôm brand new to snowboarding. I‚Äôve been twice so far. Caught a heel edge last weekend Anne I‚Äôm convinced that if I wasn‚Äôt wearing a helmet I might have dropped snowboarding that very moment. It shook me pretty bad
Fuckin hell I thought this was a damn body bag
Fianc√© convinced me to get a helmet last year for the first time in 15 years of boarding. I broke that helmet last season pretty convinced I would have been a vegetable without it. Gonna wear a helmet from now on.
Helmets look way cooler than brain damage! I‚Äôve had a few falls which would have been fatal
And buckle them! Forgot to do mine this weekend hit my head and it went flying off :)
I wore a helmet in all my competitions. Still managed to suffer my worst concussion with one and never wore one prior. üôÉ  strap the lid down. But also it doesn't save you.
Great reminder that even if you get picked on for wearing one, it only takes one bad edge catch to remind you why you‚Äôre right.
If you don't have a helmet you might as well be in jeans. Glad she's mostly ok!
Didn't used to wear a helmet. Started snowboarding in 2013. Id go up once or twice a year so didn't seem important as I didn't hit the park or planned to get do anything crazy. I will also admit I just didn't understand the dangers of the mountain. Fast forward to 3 years ago, I buy a board and I'm riding a bit more. 6 or 7 trips a year, so started getting better and trying to improve my riding. Luckily when I bought the board I also decided to just buy a helmet. I was riding and about to go through a tunnel, pretty steep before the tunnel so alot of people brake alot and it was pretty much just ice, lost control and slammed the back of my head into the boulder walls surrounding the tunnel prior to entering. Helmet fine, im fine but it was such a smack I always wonder what woulda happened if I didn't just get a helmet before that trip. Anyway, get a helmet. Things like this, catching an edge or even someone slamming into u out of control make it worth it.
I used to be one of those cool kids who wouldn't wear a helmet. After the distinct "PING" sound that comes with a hard hit to the head a few times, I decided that living the rest of my life intellectually disabled didn't sound fun. It took me way too long to come to that obvious conclusion. I'm glad helmets are more common now, though. It reverses a lot of the peer pressure
I went up after I got my first board (second time snowboarding) and just needed a helmet because mine was still coming in the mail. I went to rent one and pay with card because I didn‚Äôt have cash. My card kept declining even though I had over $500 in my account. I eventually had no choice because the atm wasn‚Äôt working either. 

I was just thinking if I die or get seriously injured today there has to be something my family can do. Who knows, but I was fine luckily cause I took it easy.
I once went snow tubing at a local resort. I wasn't wearing a helmet. I crashed head to head into a 7 year old who was wearing a helmet. He cried. I didn't. Helmets are overrated. /s
[deleted]
After Schumacher in 2012, I just decided id stay away from slopes in genera. But then again the jokes on me now anyway cause I got hit by a car in 2016 and can barely walk... so...
"Took my girlfriend snowboarding for her second time today" 

... AT PARK City... 

But yeah, a call to action on Reddit should compensate for your decision to put her in that situation.
Well that'll probably the last time she wants to go
Helmet shmelmet
Bruh "all of this even though she was wearing a helmet".

Why do people think that a helmet is just a magical shield against any kind of injury?
No
Have only rode with a helmet like 2 times and I usually get 100 days or more a season, been wearing one more this season though, had some close calls
Thanks mom
Riding since about 92 or so‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt worn one ever, but my harder riding days are well behind me, so I‚Äôm gonna keep doing what I‚Äôve been doing.  Prayers for a speedy recovery though!
the psa should be "don't be a dumb and toss a beginner above their ability and have a qualified person teach them"
ah here we are back with the wear a helmet posts. thought the hypocrisy was gone
Soft
Lol

Need a helmet for your 3 too
Done the same and thank god i had a helmet on. I caught an edge and cracked my head on pure ice on the last run of the day. I was so fucked up, and we had to drive home that day as well. Didn't end up going to the Drs, but probably should have considering the helmet was cracked lol
I never ride without a helmet. Got 13 years experience and can ride comfortably down almost anything and still don't risk it.
It's also important to learn how to fall, pick the head up when landing on your back
aren't helmets mandatory on every hill nowadays? workers won't even let you on a lift unless you have a helmet on here
Always wear one since I watched my cousin do the same thing and smash his head into solid ice. Had a trip to the hospital and had short term memory loss for a couple days, kept repeating he didn‚Äôt know where he was.
Used to ride without a helmet and caught my back edge once and did the same thing. Hit my head so hard everything went yellow. Haven‚Äôt ridden without one since.
Wear MIPS certified helmets. Got a gnarly concussion with a POS RuRoc helmet and missed out on a whole day of skiing with the boys because of it
Not only wear, but correct fitting is critical.
Not trying to make things political.
But I was surprised when the mountain opened back up how many people wore masks but no helmet.
Wrist guards aren't a bad idea either. My Dad, when he was much younger, was learning to snowboard and was doing pretty well, then he caught his front edge and went down on his wrists. Broke one of them really bad, ended up with pins in his wrist and hand connecting an external carbon fiber rod to keep everything in place. Wrist guards wouldn't have completely protected him, but it probably would have meant only a cast or even just a sprain instead of an extreme wrist surgery.
‚ÄúBrain bucket‚Äù
Holy fuck is she fucking dead?!
Ok y‚Äôall are scaring me. Maybe I will try skiing instead
About to go snowboarding for the first time as well.

What the fuck?  Didn‚Äôt know personal injury was an expectation of the activity.  Since I see kids and older adults also partaking.  If it‚Äôs really a risky sport, I‚Äôm going to 100% buy some wristguards and knee pads as well then.
Me too, it took me too long to notice she wasn‚Äôt on the sled yet. I thought the grey blanket was covering a body üò±
I saw one my first time to Whistler-Blackcomb. It was a 3 hour body retrieval
I literally said out loud, ‚ÄúJesus fuckin‚Äô Christ is that a dead guy??‚Äù
Plot twist: That's OP's body bag. He took that photo from *beyond the graaaaave*
I'm not seeing any shoes. Just saying...
[deleted]
I started riding in 1996 and haven‚Äôt ridden without a helmet since probably 2004. First day out with a helmet, I caught my heel edge, hit my bun, and it barely hurt at all. I was sold.
I remember those days. Seems so weird now. Also, no one wore bike helmets either. Glad I have never gotten concussed.
I got knocked out at whistler in 1999 when i caught an edge at speed. Woke up to my uncle, who had been in front of me before the crash, shaking me awake. Rode the lift back down with a concussion. Bought my first helmet shortly after. They were NOT stylish back then. People would make fun of my helmet on the lift from about 00-05. Then the helmets got cooler or people got smarter. Seems most people wear them now. I look at anyone without out one as foolish. Still waiting for the pros in snowboard videos to start wearing them.
[deleted]
nobody wears helmets in copper park but man i always have to wear a bucket in central park that shit gets icey and those features are massive
You're allowed to take it off sometimes, nerd
Get a new helmet after a smack too
I learned to snowboard in park city in 2002. Hit my head a LOT. No one wore helmets. My dad still talks about it.
My experience is completely opposite.  I worked on a mountain for years in the mid-2000s to mid-2010s and you‚Äôd get mocked for NOT wearing a helmet.
Yep.  Moved to Steamboat in 2000 right after college for a season and nobody wore them.  Moved away from the mountains after that season for work and didn‚Äôt ski at all until my sister moved to Jackson around 2007/8.  Took the tram up as my first ride up the hill with some of her crew and felt like a fish out of water with at least 70% of the passengers wearing helmets.  I‚Äôm wondering what the hell I‚Äôm about to have to ski to get down this mountain thinking that was the reason so many had helmets on.  Turns out, I was out of touch with the new reality and people had gotten a lot smarter in my absence.
I'm glad as well, I appreciate your sentiment.

Time to buy a new one for her since this one is toast.
Not sure what resort this is but all Vail owned resorts use HH gear for staff, and I believe it is a model specifically sold as uniforms. It‚Äôs probably based on a consumer model but with cheaper materials. You might be able to find the model name with some googling
I suck but can get through a day with mostly only 1-2 falls. Always wearing a helmet. 

My brain is too important to not keep it safe!
Try searching for bibs. I think they're bibs.
Yea I‚Äôve definitely had a few falls where I was completely fine afterward but would‚Äôve probably gotten a concussion if I didn‚Äôt have a helmet on.
The vail HH uniform is just a shell. I have some insulated northface gear that is much better!
I'm pretty sure they are Helly Hansen's Pilsner pants. Which I don't think are sold anymore. Might be hard to find a pair of them.
Those are called the Pilsner pant. Just part of the HH Patrol kit. Source- am ski patroller with those pants in my locker.
Not sure specifically but you can‚Äôt go wrong with HH
Also most of the new helmets are MIPS which might give you extra brain protection. Totally worth investing in.
and honestly much more stylish than they used to be. I love my helmet, it's cozy AF
Yep, I love having my headphones in the healmet too. No reason not to wear it
I like to wear a hat under my helmet
This guy concussions
I pack my gloves, balaclava, and spare lens inside my helmet. I take a trip out to the car with board under one arm and boots in the other hand. I take another trip with the jacket, helmet, and water bottle. I'm good to go after that.
Don't worry, barely any of the people on this sub are snowboarders.
Thanks for the kind words! I used to skate for many years, I wouldn't get back into it again without wearing a helmet.
Helmets have been popular for snow sports for a long time, like over 20 years. Skaters are still very anti-helmet or any other safety gear unless they‚Äôre vert riders.
Look at the bright side, you‚Äôll never need to convince your son to wear a helmet?
No, this was at Park City, Utah
Any doctor dealing with head/brain injuries sees patients whose lives have been permanently altered by far less dangerous activities than snowboarding every single day. Skill level is irrelevant here, a chance accident affects all of us equally.
Good hell..... Glad you recovered from that! Stay safe out there.
Technically, after a single fall. Realistically, I replace mine every 3-5 years depending on how many hits it has taken.
I don't see any certification stickers on it, so I'm going to say no.
She's doing much better, just resting now.
That's exactly what she was trying to learn when this happened. She was learning her toe edge (she's already pretty good on her heels).
Thank you! Once she heals up, first priority is a new helmet for her and impact shorts so she's less prone to get injured again.
For real, they were amazing and so positive. Vail needs to pay these guys way more than they do.
Absolutely, new helmet is already on the way.

She can't board again for at least two weeks though (doctor's orders).
I hope your friend heals up.... It's scary how fragile the brain really is.
Absolutely, that helmet is toast.
She didn't respond to me for about 30 seconds after she crashed, just looked completely dazed. When she did start responding, she didn't know where she was and was getting short term memory questions wrong (what day is it, what resort are we at, what did you eat for breakfast, etc).
Do it! When I first got mine, I was surprised at how comfortable and warm it was, way warmer than any beanie I've used.
Can I ask how? I‚Äôm starting lessons soon üò≠
All she was doing was practicing her toe edge, barely going walking speed. Accidents can happen at any speed and any skill level.

Stay safe out there!
cringy....
Don‚Äôt hate on solitude honeycomb is the shit
Solitude is not shitty at all
This is a good point. Right before the run where she fell, I looked her over and noticed her helmet strap was unbuckled. Extremely glad I did that now in hindsight.
You always this douchey?

She wasn't renting, she was using my spare gear. No one cares about karma points, but I DO care about putting out a message of safety based on today's events.

Also, you'd be surprised. Plenty of newbies out on the bunny slopes that aren't wearing helmets.
Did you not read that she was on the bunny hill? This would have been the same outcome regardless of the resort.
I think the point is that if it's bad with a helmet, it would be far worse without. This is proven time and time again in like literally every sport that uses them. It's not a magical shield, but it's a reliable way to mitigate severe injury and sports where impact is a serious risk should use them. 

The only exceptions are sports like American football, where helmets end up possibly being worse due to enabling people to feel less afraid of using their head in ways they would otherwise avoid. That said, the benefit of mitigating head trauma is still there, so long as you're not going head first as a battering ram
What an idiot lmao
Sounds like the standard caught heel edge to slapping back of the head on the snow resulting in concussion‚Ä¶ helmet helps protect against that.
Ditto
OP said this happened on the bunny slope. There‚Äôs literally nothing lower on the difficulty scale. 

And besides that, you can still easily catch an edge under the supervision of a certified instructor
Unless you have more knowledge of the situation than the rest of us, it seems to me like you're making assumptions and too quickly jumping to judgement.
Your fat will cushion the blow
You're either being over the top rude, or a jerk, or otherwise breaking our rules.
Having your corpse blocking the run ruins the riding experience for others, have some respect champ
Not required by law or policy anywhere in the US or Canada that I‚Äôm aware of. But here in Canada I‚Äôd say 99% of people wear helmets.
No, she's recovering now. Without the helmet, it would have been much worse.
I want to hear the story, but I also live in Vancouver and don't want to be terrified every time I go to Whistler
I remember feeling like the helmet change happened over night. One season nobody wore helmets, and then the next season I showed up on the mountain and damn near everyone had one. I felt like I had missed the memo or something. It took me several more years to get it though. I finally started wearing a helmet when my son became old enough to start boarding. I wanted him to wear a helmet and figured I needed to set a good example.
I started riding around like 2006 and never wore one until probably 10 years later. Also rode BMX for most of that time without one. 

The one thing that eventually got me to wear one was when I found out they were putting speakers in the ear pads. Thought that sounded pretty cool and got a Bern helmet with speakers built in for Christmas. It is a great compromise of still being able to hear your surroundings while listening to music. Especially now that everything is bluetooth. 

Now I always wear one. Snowboard helmets are pretty comfortable. But I would highly recommend going to a local shop (or multiple) and trying on helmets in person. Each brand makes helmets that are shaped a little differently. Some fit your head shape better than others. 

I was in the market for an MTB helmet like 1 year ago and went to a bike shop that had like 15 different options. Tried on a couple, then I put on the Fox helmet and instantly it felt way better than anything else. It has a BOA style tightener on the back to fine tune how tight you want it. But before even touching that it was snug on my head without being uncomfortable at all. 

If you see this and think buying a helmet is a good idea, it is. But it's the kind of thing you should avoid buying online if you can help it. An uncomfortable helmet that flops around everywhere is going to annoy you, making you want to take it off. But a good, properly fitting helmet doesn't get in your way at all. You can almost forget you're wearing it.
My worst fall was going over the front of the board making a heel side turn. Was moving pretty quick and slingshotted head and shoulder first down the mountain. Couldn‚Äôt believe the impact, had an open cut on my nose from where my goggle smashed into my face.. luckily I was wearing a helmet but I still blacked out for a few seconds
Yep, I started snowboarding in 95 and literally nobody wore a helmet. I went to college in 99 and was broke after college, so I didn‚Äôt snowboard once for about 6-7 years. When I finally started riding again, everyone was wearing a helmet.
20 years ago, when I was a rookie snowboarder, I remember skidding a toe turn when my board suddenly stopped skidding and I went over backwards. I remember looking down as I went over and seeing a pair of skis against my heel edge. Then I hit the ground, and saw stars. That was the last time I snowboarded without a helmet.
I am pretty sure I got concussed and shouldn‚Äôt have driven home, but I did. also, I live on the east coast so it‚Äôs just all ice so it feels like hitting concrete
Lmao yeah you would get called ‚Äúgay‚Äù for wearing one.
[deleted]
You should email the helmet company she was wearing. They love hearing that shit, might get yourself a discount on a new helmet.
Also consider buying impact shorts. Everyone I know wears them and they really protect your tailbone too. 

Glad she‚Äôs eager to get back on the slopes!
You can only buy these if your resort contacts Helly Hansen themselves. They don‚Äôt sell these uniforms to regular consumers.
Thank you!
yeah, looks like it.
100% true for me as well!
I'm open to suggestions if you have a link!
Rats!  Thanks anyway
 Can they be found anymore?  I've looked everywhere.  

Thank you, by the way!
Looking at the entry cost to start snowboarding again... Not happening any time soon.
MIPS is a must.
And they integrate with your goggles. Anyone that doesn‚Äôt wear a Helmet is a jerry in my eyes
Most definitely fam.
In the same fashion, I tie my boots and helmet to the snowboard bindings before going out and loading the car.
Definitely, have you look into a duffel bag? it would save you one trip. I got a 30 dollar one from Amazon that has a compartment for boots and a helmet.
We had 2 down at keystone today, needing the same thing. Pretty wild, glad everyone is okay! Best wishes
Ohh

If helmets help, why aren't they regulated?
This research explored associations between helmet use and head injuries in snowsports by investigating reported snowsport injuries in Western Canada from 2008-2009 to 2012-2013. The key finding was that increased helmet use (from 69% to 80%) was not associated with a reduction in reported head injuries. Over the study period, the average rate of reported head injuries was 0.2/1000 skier visits, with a statistically significant variation (P < 0.001). The line of best fit showed an non-significant upward trend (P = 0.13). Lacerations were the only subcategory of head injuries that decreased significantly with helmet use. A higher proportion of people who reported a head injury were wearing a helmet than for injuries other than to the head. Skiers were more likely to report a head injury when wearing a helmet than snowboarders (P < 0.001 cf. P = 0.22). There were significant differences in characteristics of helmet and non-helmet wearers. Helmet wearers were more likely to be: young adults (P < 0.001); beginner/novices (P = 0.004); and snowboarders (P < 0.001), but helmet wearing was not associated with gender (P = 0.191). Further research is needed to explore the possible reasons for the failure of helmets to reduce head injuries, for example, increased reporting of head injuries and increased risk-taking combined with over-rating of the helmets' protection.

Nah, ur the idiot.
Thanks for proving my point.
Nah, he/she already decided they're not wearing a helmet and now needs a justification why it's okay for them. They do not want to feel like they're making the wrong choices.
"Took my girlfriend up snowboarding for her second time today."
Post nut shame?

I went to whistler one time when I was like 9. I‚Äôll never forget the absolute fear seeing over the edges of some of those runs‚Ä¶
Someone went down the crevice of that big rock off the right side of the showcase t-bar. Don‚Äôt think they knew the terrain based off the tracks
Def feel the same. In 2000 no helmets unless you were on the race team (skier here in peace, just like lurking).

Then one season, saw a few casual helmets sprinkled, mainly people just learning.

Then BAM. 75% of the mountain.

Then out of nowhere it‚Äôs like 95% of the mountain.

‚Ä¶.

You know‚Ä¶

Typing this out. The popularity of the park has a direct correlation I‚Äôd wager.
Where I live at least my generation all had helmets on from when we started (I am 28, skiing since 1997). By about 2007-2009ish I would say 90% of people were wearing helmets at Alberta mountains I ski, and 99% of people between ages like 2-20. I think helmets being comfortable and normal plus more research about concussions coming out kind of made it a no brainer for most folks.
Snowboarding is definitely a pursuit where the helmet seems to augment more than hinder. 

I‚Äôve always found it more comfortable than a hat. Except for thise rare late season bluebird days it doesn‚Äôt overheat. It somehow keeps me warm without getting itchy. 

It helps to secure goggles. 

You are dressed in big puffy clothes anyway so you dont look like a bubble head. 

I wear my helmet skating the parks, bombing hills, mountain biking, biking in traffic because it makes sense. i have too much to lose, but it always feels like an inconvenience there.

Snowboarding is the one pursuit where i feel like i wear the helmet for comfort.
I honestly prefer wearing a helmet. It keeps my head warmer, doesn‚Äôt move as much as a beanie, holds my goggles in place.
Ouch! Much respect to east coasters and their ice. ‚úåÔ∏è
Oh I should do this too. hadn't considered this. do you know of people who've had success with this?
Oh man, 100% wish I did. 

After the third day of my first week my tailbone was hurting so much that I couldn't sit down properly and had to sleep on my belly. The next day I landed dead center on literal ice. Some of the worst pain I've ever felt
I snowboarded for the first time last year. Bought a $10 pair of these off Amazon. Best $10 I ever spent. I fell so many damn times, mostly backwards. They saved my ass. Also bought a pair of knee pads with the same special impact material. Also a good purchase.
This. Do it, especially if she's learning and falling a lot. Currently dealing with a fractured tailbone from a very hard fall last season. Literally the worst pain of my life, could barely move for days. Better now but it's something I'm probably going to have to deal with for the rest of my life.
I wasn‚Äôt sure. The Patagonia gear we had pre-Vail was just consumer models with logos slapped on
Good luck in the search! I was a liftie for a bit and we had Patagonia uniforms before Vail bought the resort and the HH stuff is so much warmer.
https://www.thenorthface.com/en-us/mens/mens-bottoms/mens-pants-c224219/mens-freedom-insulated-pants-pNF0A5ABU?color=I0D
They still make them, we get them every year. I don‚Äôt think they are part of their standard catalog though. May just be a HH mountain ops thing.
You missed out on the great bankruptcy of the house last year that was selling every  thing for 70 percent off
I mean as long as you don‚Äôt want this years stuff there‚Äôs still lots of gear out there for a reasonable price. Mind you that‚Äôs still relative I guess as snow gear is expensive in general.
3 or 4? Those are rookie numbers lol

Jk, but I wish I only had 3 or 4
I've been doing this for years and haven't had an issue. My buddy has a huge IKEA bag that he uses, and offered me a spare one. I may take him up on it.
Much appreciated! She's getting much needed rest right now.
What brands are best these days? I need to replace mine.
Are you arguing that helmets... *don't* help prevent head injuries?
Buddy you should learn what research actually means before you copy and paste stuff to win an internet argument. But you probably wouldn‚Äôt know how to think critically after all the concussions. I‚Äôm not even gonna explain that one in little words for you
wearing or not wearing a helmet is not the issue... somebody put another person into a situation above their ability and luckily they had a protection. But the situation could've been avoidable.
I see what point you're trying to make, despite your poor execution. It is obviously important that beginners receive proper instruction and stay in areas appropriate for their riding ability. But, I fail to see what evidence you are using to judge this situation. Do you know OPs riding experience and whether or not they can give good instruction to a beginner? Are you somehow aware of the girlfriend's riding ability following their first day of instruction and that it was too low for the bunny hill to be suitable? 

Your reply to another comment where you say that the helmet is not important in this situation tells me that it is you who lacks expertise and wisdom. No matter what skill level you are, not wearing a helmet to protect your only damn brain is stupid.
They were on the bunny hill‚Ä¶
Idc about your life lol just don‚Äôt block the run with your corpse and/or chunks of skull
I remember helmet sales sky rocketing after Sonny bono died skiiing
Schumacher effect
That was the big moment for me, when I realized I never had to deal with adjusting my hat and goggles again. The helmet is warmer and easier to manage by far.
Lol I live in Philly so I can't even enjoy New England without having to go a min of 4 and half hours to get to like Stratton or Mount Snow. In addition,  after having made a few trips to Colorado I can't even get myself to go to the Pocono's. I did get the Ikon pass though so I need to make a few trips to Blue Mountain in Allentown, PA or get to Windham so that I can get my money's worth in addition to a New England get away.
Wow. I was a liftee at Baker and they essentially just gave us branded plastic bags as jackets
Thanks!!!  

Yeah, I've had Burton, Arteryx, North Face, Mountain Hardwear and really old HH and for sure HH was the best quality and warmth that I've worn...but again, they were super old. 

So far, I'm not coming up with much but someone else said it was HH Pilsner pant so I'm following that lead.
Thank you!
They‚Äôre back now
lol hey I‚Äôm only counting the ones that sent me to the hospital, I‚Äôve gotten my bell rung more times than I can remember‚Ä¶ Oh wait a minute ü§£


But hey fuck it I‚Äôm still gonna send it, Life is too boring to do it any other way
A little pricey but things like a Burton Gig bag or Dakine Boot Locker work great for stashing boots and all the gear. I have an older Burton bag (Rider 2.0 73L) and basically carries everything I need including some spare binding parts and laces and whatnot. Just grab the bag and go. Never have to second guess if I have everything or not.
I think anything that a board shop would sell will be good enough. Just get something with MIPS and you will be fine. Anon has some kind of other technology in some of their helmets if you really want to shell out for it.
Answer my question.
Hey look another moron, can't even make a point. Jog on you tard.
ü§°üëûüëû
I've actually have instructed for about a decade in the past. And one of the biggest things you don't do is "teach" your loved ones. It normally doesn't work out for multiple reasons. We've been told the person has only two days into the activity and it doesn't matter that they were on the bunny slope. Its still steep enough to gather tons of speed and get out of control which the person did and resulted in a concussion or a potential "cerebral hemorrhage".

You're talking the comment out of context. Helmet or not the person was injured from their lack of ability.
"likely would have resulted in a cerebral hemorrhage."
and the persons "instructor" took them above their ability.
and there is the magic carpet
[deleted]
This also makes me think of the lag from larger resorts and their adoption, and smaller mountains later adoption of helmets.
Sunny, and that Kennedy guy. That did it.
The Patagonia stuff got wet so fast, it made working a pow day miserable, so I feel your pain.
I currently rock some 686 bibs that I like more than any other pants or bibs I‚Äôve had
Oh rad
Wavecell, it's a MIPS competitor. Similar stuff in the high end cycling world. I want an Anon helmet but the price tag on them is kinda nuts. Probably just going to get another Smith this season, or maybe an Oakley on sale.
I don't understand what your question is, "regulated" is super open and broad. Helmets are held to standards for most sports, helmets for street are at bare minimum DOT or higher (Like Snell M, K and SA ratings). Helmets for snow sports have similar ratings though I'm not as familiar with them, but I know Snell has one, there's an ASTM rating, among others. There is a reason why every governing body of sports with impacts *requires* helmets, to include snow sports. I take my car to track days, the absolute minimum they require for a street prepped car is a motorcycle rated helmet but a karting or better, SA rated helmet is preferred if not required. 

Helmets are proven to mitigate injury, as mentioned by OP the fucking doctor agrees that without a helmet it could have easily been a cerebral hemorrhage. Like, if you don't like a helmet and don't want to wear one by all means that's your prerogative. But they're proven to work, that's why stuff where you're likely to hit your head requires them.
For what it's worth, she was practicing toe edge and barely going walking speed. This entirely had to do with the way she landed.
Bad falls can happen anywhere and anytime. All it takes is catching an edge and being in a bad position. Again, they were on the bunny hill
Old bones are more brittle too, if one of your skull shards gouges out the bottom of my board I‚Äôm suing your family for a new one >:‚Äã(
Right on.  I'm open to whatever, got a link?
Helmet wearing, was once enforced in ski resorts.

It no longer is.

Ski resorts very specifically removed the requirement for patrons to wear helmets while skiing and snowboarding within resort boundaries.

Why?

You spout all this shit like "they are designed like X to Y standards" and "oh a doctor said the helmet helped". I mean if you were actually right, then wouldn't everywhere enforce helmet wearing?
[deleted]
I can‚Äôt remember what the model name is at the moment

Just looking at the website I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the gore-tex stretch dispatch bibs
I really don't think that it was widely enforced because helmet wearing is pretty new to be as widespread as it is, you can find plenty of proof of that watching old videos. No one I know who's been riding a long time (And I ride with someone regularly who's been riding as long as I've been alive) has ever mentioned helmets being required and was following the "old ways" of not wearing one until last season because she finally felt out of place not wearing one. Resorts are under zero obligation to force anyone to wear any safety equipment, and why would they when it's free and arguably more money to just let people take it at their own risk? After all, it's not a sport free of injury and is very much an "at your own risk" sport. You sign a blanket waiver whenever you're getting a ticket or pass absolving the resorts of any liability of injury not otherwise directly caused by them. You're an adult, you're allowed to make your own decisions for personal safety. But being a helmet denier is just stupid.

Helmets are proven to work consistently in every sport that uses them, including governing bodies of snow sports. It's not some scheme to get people to buy things they don't need. I assure you the Air Force doesn't make me wear a helmet for fun, no one wants to wear an HGU-55/P less than the people wearing them, they fucking suck. But does the AF want a pilot or crewmember to slam their head against something in turbulence and be out cold? Absolutely fucking not. The stakes might be lower in snowboarding *but the risks are still there*. Hitting your head against things is bad, mitigating how badly you hit your head can be the difference between braindead (or just dead) and a concussion and some lost brain function. Of course more commonly the difference is between a concussion and just a minor head injury/no injury at all, but if you think concussions aren't that big a deal, talk to someone who's been hit in the head a few times. Many of them, one of my best friends included, have serious frustration about the fact they simply cannot do things like they used to be able to do. Imagine being an engineering major and then getting a couple concussions and having once simple math be difficult for you
Hey I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got plenty of boards lol
>I really don't think that it was widely enforced because helmet wearing is pretty new to be as widespread as it is

Bro are you serious?

I think this is one of the worst replies I've ever read.

You make some of the most oblivious statements I have ever seen.

YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION. AND CANT. CLEARLY. THIS IS IDIOTIC.

You just keep typing shit over and over, but you can't answer a simple question.

I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHY **YOU** THINK HELMETS ARE SAFE.

I am asking you. Plain and simple, why did resorts all over the world start enforcing helmet wearing decades ago, and promptly STOP.
I don't know why *some* resorts that may have required helmet wearing decided they didn't care anymore. Probably because, as I mentioned before, it's cheaper to just let people do whatever the fuck they want because the resort isn't liable if someone slams their head into the ground. 

The fact you're asserting that helmets *must not be safe because someone got injured wearing them* is idiotic. We have tons of evidence to prove they improve safety, and is evident by the widespread requirement to wear them in any impact based activities. I'm starting to think the concussions added up for you big dawg, you might be 30 something but you argue like a 12 year old. Show some hard evidence that helmets are no better than nothing, then your argument might hold some merit
New OCL account
Hey yall. Looks like I can finally post in here and I just wanted to pop in here and introduce myself. 

My name is Dakota and I'm going to be using this account to help take some of the load off Andrew and his 24/7 reddit presence lol. Fear not, he will still be active on reddit, I'm just here to help.


Little about me, my main reddit is 
u/dakotastomm so you may have seen my posts in the other nfa/suppressor subreddits in the past. Andrew brought me on the otter gang back in May, and I've been learning the ropes here at OCL. I've been a 07/02 ffl sot since 2018 so l'm not new to the industry

Going forward, you can use this account to tag me in OCL issues or even just regular posts. You can message direct for questions or comments, and I'll try  to answer them as I can. As always, don't hesitate to reach out directly at info@ottercreeklabs.com

Anyways, I look forward to interacting with you all.

P.S. here's a behind the scenes Pic of some infinity testing. 
How many otters do you currently employ?

Y‚Äôall are making it really difficult to not buy OCL cans‚Ä¶ time to build a new host I guess.
Yay! Another person to harass!
Go away
Ah, so we can annoy you with timeline questions instead of Andrew.

When is FlowCM5?

Where Polo restock backorder?

When infinity?

üòÇüòÇüòÇ /s
While everyone is asking for new products, I‚Äôll throw my hat in. Any hope for the OCL shotgun can? I know Andrew has mentioned it in the past. Would be awesome to have a 12 gauge can that actually sounds great and is reasonable in weight and dimensions.
Welcome to the Thunderdome.... I mean Reddit, Dakota!   - Chase
Is the AK can still an idea that is floating around or has that been mostly put on the back burner?
When do y‚Äôall anticipate the infinity being released?

I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs completed, but not into production yet.
Mmm forbidden popsicle.
Welcome! Love my polo k and Titanium!
So now we have big dog water dachshund and b-team broski bearded beaver?
OCL is the best can company out there and ill stand by that.
Excuse my ignorance if I missed it elsewhere (I probably did) but when can we start hounding our local dealer about snatching one of these Infinity glowsticks...my dopamine system needs a hit rarely provided by non NFA purchases.
Will the hub ops reflex adapter be restocked?
Any idea if we‚Äôll get a lithium 45 soon?
Welcome sir- big fan of OCL

what's your most and least favorite Non-OCL can in the industry
Your name is really familiar. Did I buy a PTR C93 from you?

Love my Polonium btw, glad to have you here.
We meet at the Ohio Silencer fest. Thought you and the whole OCL gang were some cool dudes. 

Now for business‚Ä¶ where them tootsies pics at?
Welcome! Can‚Äôt wait for my Polo-30 to come in then start the halfway home count down.

Waiiiit there‚Äôs a flow cm5?????? Or am I a retard
I would like a .410 can available in the US also.
Thanks chase ü´° it can be rough out there for sure haha
Still in prototyping stages, but I think Andrew said after the infinity is released that's what we will be focused on afterwards
It‚Äôs up next. We want to get infinity launched first then the AK can should happen pretty fast. Because the AK can is just essentially an infinity that‚Äôs 2 inches shorter with a bigger bore
It‚Äôs going into production this week. When we designed the infinity we designed it to be a machined and welded suppressor. Then once we finished we realized how big of a pain it was going to be to make thousands of them. So we decided to take the exact same design and just print it instead of machine it. These last weeks we‚Äôve been testing the printed version to ensure no unexpected changes happened from the machined version. Literally identical just ones machined and ones printed. 

We‚Äôve came to the conclusion there‚Äôs no difference and feel comfortable moving forward with start production so that‚Äôs happening now
Also, will it be hub compatible (1.375x24) as well?

We are currently in the final stages of prototyping. The goal is to have the design finished and ready for full-scale production by the end of the year.
Yes.
We did a small run, keep an eye out on IG in the neex week or so to see how you'll be able to get one.
I've been a big fan of Dead Air in the past, with the wolfman being my favorite modular 9mm suppressor. Although in recent times, dead air qc has really dropped off. I love our Lithium, too and I actually shoot it more now. As for least favorite can, I don't think I really have one. I also don't want to step on any toes lol
I did sell a ptr c93 a few months back, so more than likely!
Knee replacement metal. Good for bolt guns, subsonic 300 blk, 9mm and 22lr only IMO
A Polo 30 is on my list of parts to purchase .
Just so happens about 5 minutes after I posted that, I received a call from my FFL saying it‚Äôs in!
It‚Äôs a pain in the ass and maybe the biggest waste of money I‚Äôve ever spent money on. I try and tell everyone I talk to DONT buy one
Unfortunately we hand trace those. So you wouldn't be able to get a massive one engraved :(
Oof. The new plastic injection molded toob clamps imo are mich better than the older 3d printed ones and grip the can much better. I'm not sure if we're ever gonna sell them separately, but shoot us an email and they may be able get you one of the new clamps, assuming we have enough to go around.
That is to be determined lol. Andrew and I seem to have similar humor but I also ain't trying to taint the brand lol
Rad! I love my titanium. Fantastic can. You'll love it!
Also who‚Äôs your favorite OCL Dealer?
More than likely! Andrew, Uncle Andrew, and me were there. That was my first uspsa match too
That would an Andrew question. We ship out all cans with a sticker pack, so your dealer probably yanked them for themselves. That's a common issue we run into
Perfect! Only pre-reqs we have is having a beard and a beer gut. See you then!
Remember that scene in A Christmas Story where they dare him to lick the flag pole? I got a dare for ya
Lithium 9 on mp5k slaps. /see what I did there/

I believe so, shoot us an email info@ottercreeklabs.com and they can get you a better answer.
That was before my time, but I believe the Uranium 7.62 is going to be the Ak can
We just got done sending some out, I think they went to silencer shop. Probably be a while on the next run, they're not a big mover for us and the 6.5 cans are the more unpopular ones we make.
The ocm5 trainer? I don't think those are on the docket any time soon unfortunately.
That's what the infinity role is going to be. Will be a 30 cal can optimized for 5.56 use. At the current moment (it may change in the future, it will ship with a 5.56 solid end cap, and a vented and unvented 30 cal end cap
Good! Just got them finished this week. We‚Äôll do an announcement on it end of this week or beginning of next week
Every Friday at quitting time he does, as a little reward. It gives me something to look forward to.

New to NFA items. Who is Kevin?
Like you guys have HR...
‚ÄúOh boy! Did you see the boobies on the new secretary?‚Äù
Is there ever going to be a OCM5-30?
While we're here annoying you about timelines...

Is there a way I can get notified when the HUB Reflex Adapter is back in stock, and is there an ETA on those?
Lithium 9? Thanks
I personally don't know if it is going to be an actual product sometime in the distant future but Andrew was doing his redneck wizardry on @otter_dump (instagram) and put a shrunken down proto infinity baffle stack in the OCM5 and said it worked surprisingly well.

Ever since then I have wanted want and will forever remind the OCL team I do in hopes it does become reality. 

u/OCL_Dakota or u/ottergang_ky do you care to comment for us few that want this niche product?
Rock on. Thanks man!
Awesome. Looking forward to it!
Interesting development, I (maybe ignorantly) frowned upon printed cans due to warranty / serviceability concerns. Is there a way to repair printed cans if you get a baffle strike? I understand with the infinity replaceable endcaps that addresses potential end-cap strikes.
IN718 and similar alloys are a pain to machine. At some point the excessive machining time required makes it worthwhile to 3D print it via DMLS and then perform the minor final machining (I.e. threads, etc) on this 3D printed part to ‚Äúclean it up‚Äù.
Yes it will be hub compatible. Final stages of prototyping, hope to have full scale production on it by the end of the year.
Yes
No dildo is forbidden if you are brave enough.
I‚Äôm free to beta test things if it involves shooting that gun. No payment necessary
üòÇ 

Soon we‚Äôre making more now but it‚Äôll be a few weeks
I think you were giving up your FFL at the time. I glad to see things are going well!
Buddy of mine has one and we can‚Äôt get the damn thing to cycle. Not sure if it‚Äôs been over engineered with the gas options or if we‚Äôre just bozos who can‚Äôt properly assemble and load linked ammunition. Likely somewhere in between but we can‚Äôt get it to cycle mag fed either. 

What do you put through it unsuppressed?
Group of buddies and I, including one that‚Äôs an SOT are looking at crowd funding a semiauto M249 and converting it. Twice as expensive, but probably the way to go.
Dang. Guess they'll need yours as a reference.
Well I actually broke one of the black plastic ones already that day. So I switched to the one in the video. I was able to get it off by heating it with a torch eventually. Just saying wrench flats or something to be able to bite onto would be a substantial help.
You said at least 7 racial slurs today that I counted idk how HR hasn‚Äôt fired you yet tbh

Hello Kyle. 

Love you too üòò. 

Top Gun Range Houston is def my fav ü´¢
Yep!! That was the crew
Dang. Asked Andrew in a reply to a comment on my post the other day and didn‚Äôt hear back. Oh well, no worries. I‚Äôll keep an eye on the site for them. 

I don‚Äôt think the dealer swiped the ones that should have been in the box though. The box was pretty beat up.  The only thing in it was the tube clamp, foam and suppressor. Which reminds me. Y‚Äôall have a PDF of the instructions on the site?
Should I bring my tools?


(it‚Äôs an old Jerky Boys reference, I‚Äôm old)
Dunno why, but this comment is the only one of yours I read with a strong dip lip accent.
I just might for that 10 guage that you guys posted last night!
That's hot
This is amazing. Thank you.
Are you saying SS may have them back in stock any day or I probably missed it? I‚Äôll be patient either way lol.

Thanks man.
[Otter Creek Labs OCM5 - Silencer Shop](https://www.silencershop.com/otter-creek-labs-ocm5.html)
Oh ok cool, thanks for the info. will definitely keep an eye out for that release!
Do it next week, that's when I get my commission check.
And on Mon morning instead of beer cans it's back to just cans üòÅ
I‚Äôll twirl anything you want at any time for one of those OCL hats ü§£ it‚Äôll go good with my mullet.
What happens in that box?..no the blue one. Looks like a sandblaster but says precision welding.

He is the alpha and omega of engineering. Nobody, I repeat nobody outside Q is a real engineer, the very best anyone else can be is one of _those other guys_ .
Plot twist: Dakota is the new secretary.
I think there are plans to do one, but not in the near future.
I think Andrew said in a different post they're in production currently,  and should be in stock in a few weeks. As for in stock notifications, that would be a website thing. I haven't checked the web page, but there should be a "sign up to be notified when in stock button"
Instock at hansohn brothers.
U/fiveriversdefense has one and says he likes it. Not many in public hands. One or two at dealers and one somewhere I can‚Äôt talk about. Feedback has been positive. I‚Äôd like it to be a product one day maybe
ü•π
I agree it‚Äôs annoying and other companies have to replace the can or say they totally definitely fixed the can and definitely did not print another one and put the same SN on it lmao.

But we made it to be easily warrantied because it was a concern of mine too. The seralized portion will be the rear, just like a polonium or any current tubeless suppressor is made. If damage occurs the rear can be cut off and a new printed body put on and welded.

In this picture I‚Äôve censored some of the design I don‚Äôt want people to see but this is one we‚Äôve printed, destroyed, cut off and are getting ready to weld a new core on. So it‚Äôs fully fixable just like a polonium or something is

Yea each baffle had a 1 hour machine time. 7 baffles per can + the tube. We could have machined 1 infinity per day per machine. It just wasn‚Äôt practical
*1Guy1Jar has entered the chat...*
In my defense, I gave no eta. So could it be tomorrow? Sure. Sometime in the next year? More than likely.
Finished building a mk12ish clone like 2 days before seeing the first post about it. So I'm hyped.
I assume you have some kind of private production schedule, like on a software platform. You should make Dakota study this. 

Just giving out my daily unsolicited advice :)

Edit: you could even have a flag to note whether the particular item is cleared for public knowledge. So he could know if it‚Äôs ok to mention a real timeline, or just give a vague ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. 

Edit2: I design Salesforce solutions and hate that I love that shit
Yessir that was me!
I hate wrench flats on cans because I‚Äôve seen people round them off or fuck them up. 

Then they‚Äôre on the blast chamber so you can‚Äôt really fix them and can‚Äôt replace them. 

Not putting wrench flats on things isn‚Äôt a lazy or cost savings thing I just believe it‚Äôs a bad idea to have them there. I‚Äôm anti wrench flats on suppressors gang
I thought it was closer to 10 tbh
I thought that's what he said when I first saw it...
It‚Äôs between them and GA Firing line

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*
More than likely they went to dealers who had them back ordered. To be sure you get put in a que for one, have your local silencer shop dealer back order one.
This one specifically
Gotcha, I saw you had said nocm5 lol. We are doing a batch of ocm5s now, some are at paint currently so should ship out to SS in a few weeks. If you haven't already, I'd get one on back order as that would be the best way to make sure you get your hands on one.
They're available on the website so go get ya one lol
That's where the little elves live who run the cnc welders. I'm just there for moral support
Ah that guy. Yeah he sounds like a prick from what I‚Äôve seen
Dakota obviously has great cans

I‚Äôll see my way out
Would LOVE to see one with the Palmetto 110

If there is, I sure don't see it  
Thanks for the "few weeks" timeline. I no longer have to mash refresh on the page for a little while anyway
Slick, this addresses my concerns, appreciate the response!
Oh hell yeah!
You being transparent about this stuff consistently is why I'm waiting for this can instead of ordering something else.
All things aside I wish more business owners were as normal as you.
Ouch

Reddit just waiting for you to give out an ETA. Shit gonna be screenshotted so fast. Lol it‚Äôs good to have you.
I just press the start button on the welder. Amd occasionally burn myself on freshly welded cans. If there's a schedule, Idk about it lol
Well I still need to replace the cracked stock but it tuns great. Super pleased with it!
I went to GA firing line a couple months ago, didn‚Äôt even realize they had OCL cans‚Ä¶ might have to swing by there sometime then
Sig hail . Did I say it right?
Is it faster to have my dealer back order rather than me backordering on SS?
Yeah I have fat fingers, but I went ahead and got on the list from SS just now. Thanks for your speedy replies.
My man! I saw a pic on IG before but didn‚Äôt know they dropped. When I order one can you wear it while Andrew twirls your beard hair? ü§£
Beard isn‚Äôt grey enough for managing elves. Maybe the stress of being in your industry will change that rapidly.
He may have made some of the best products in the industry. But Jesus Christ is he a textbook narcissist
Haha dude that‚Äôd be me. And that‚Äôs why guys like us need someone like Andrew to give us a spreadsheet to reference. 

Congrats on the newish job and role
GA Firing Line is my least favorite. 

Don‚Äôt give those clowns any of your hard earned money.  Listen to Dakota and shop at Top Gun

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*
Yes I believe so. Although I'm not 100% sure on how silencer shop fulfills their back orders.
Any updates? I'm impatiently trying to be patient, but actively failing the task. Thanks
Make note in the order and Im sure we could make it happen üòÇ
LMAOO I thought you were being serious my bad. I live not too far from there so any dealer who might have OCL stuff in stock locally I‚Äôd like to shop at, I‚Äôll be sure to steer clear of those guys

This was my secondary, I miss that era of gaming.
How the hell did you take that photo in that setting.
Now someone give me the sauce on where to find a discontinued knoxx breacher grip lol.
Looks great! Bought a Jack AOW today. Stoked for it to get to my dealer. üî•üî•
Bf3 and 4... the good times that were had.
16 year old me is stoked
Literally the reason I bought my super shorty
You did great son. I'm also jelly as hell and have wanted one for years. There's a "deal" on broker for $3k, clearly a FB Marketplace baron that knows what he got.

What optic mount?
Mind if I ask what this is? Man, I love shorties, great looking shorty.
I missed the drop, any idea where to grab one
Is it cheaper to just buy the full size ( what model is this?) and just cutting it down?
Dead ass was looking to buy one but only one if not a bunch of Cans .
Damn looks like the serbu super shorty is a fuckin scam now lol
As someone who started his firearms collection because of the Battlefield franchise (BC2, to be exact), I just want to say that this is awesome.
What do u do with this? Home defense? I recognize that it‚Äôs a cool collector piece but also wondering what the effective range might be.
What was the process of swapping the grip out? I want a jack but I want the b&t grip, not the crap that comes on it.
Except that it‚Äôs a 590 and not a 870
Anything similar to BC1-BF4 will sell well. BC2 and BF3 were my favorites.
Take off the ar grip and weld on a pic rail up front. So much better with the b&t folder than any ar grip options I've found.
Honestly all I need to track down now is a knoxx breacher grip and it would be perfect. It's really not bad at all at 15, 25 I still need to try.
Thanks brother üôè
Sick,!
Damn I've always wanted to do something up in dazzle camo
Movie magic üé© ‚ú®Ô∏è
I'm still trying to find one in stock.
This is the jack from ptr. They're going for $700 boss
Just A pic rail
OP says "The Jack"   it's made by PTR, have just started slowly shipping them in the last month or so.
It's an 88. Depends on if the $200 tax stamp, plus the gun, plus all the work you would do on the pump, etc. Beats the $700 price plus $5 tax stamp from PTR.
This is cheap dude, $700
It is lol
Handjob distance
Aaccchhoooolyyyy
Well its an 88...
I was under the impression that serbu converted both 870 and 500s to super shorties
BF1 bea.
The grip makes it so spicy ü§å
Id like to see if cutting off 11 inches of barrel makes any difference. 

It would be cool to see these vangcomped too
Edit. Oops I should have known. 

Is that specific to the super shorty or will the current gen work?



Edit edit [holy crap. He KnOo0s wUt eeEEs GuT](https://www.ebay.com/itm/223468108467?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=MqH73HGCQIO&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=qmF4VahOSfK&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY)
Is this a WKUK reference?
Holy shit you're amazing how have I not heard of these?!
Good call yeah you are right, great paint job
What type of fore grip is that? Went onto their website, hopefully I make a future drop later in the year.
On gun broker they go like 2k for I believe surbu if it was 700$ would have gotten it . Your prob either talking back then or a steal bec they haven‚Äôt remade some from other brand I think  surbu makes them new but asking around 2k but im still on the look out
Wouldn‚Äôt it just be cheaper to defend yourself with a handjob??
Isn‚Äôt it a maverick based on the saftey and the endcap being more like a 500.
I got it right with a mossberg pattern at least
They did, 870 was BF4 and 500 was BF2042
no
Oh there is definitely fps loss and an opening of the shot pattern, no doubt. But at engagement distances intended for something this short, it's getting the job done if you catch my drift.
Small arms review/Jeff Zimba did a cool article where they cut a shotgun barrel down an inch at a time and did velocity and pattern testing. It may be available on their website.
They released at shot this year. I got an early copy since I know some people there. It's a solid setup.
B&T BT27
Brother it's not a serbu this is the new jack from PTR they're available now and $700 go get you one
I think it is. I get my mossberg models confused
Oh I misunderstood the complaint, I thought it was "that's not a real super shorty" not "wrong game scrub"
I read over the article but thats with standard buck. flight control would definitely change the pattern, which i would like to see the performance in something like this or the genesis 5 8nch barrel
You out here making my dreams affordable. 
You come through Marietta GA I buy you taco or burrito.

My favorite is when they look back at you and proceed to cut you off while looking at you. Of course it was my mistake assuming one doesn‚Äôt need to take up all 100 yards of the run.
You made me crack up before I realized how impressive this is.

Why we go here
I hear the oomph loompa song in my head watching this
Caught in the crossfire !
At what point do we just rename this sub "fuckskiiers"?

These dads are so happy üòÄ
Skiiers are the scooter kids at the skatepark. Just mountain riding and dodging skiiers is whatever but the worst is waiting in line to hit a feature and watch them chop up the ride up without even hitting the feature from chickening out last minute. Also, even when I see a really good skiier in the park, it just doesn't look cool, hence the scooter comparison. Like yeah you 450 onto the rail but damn it looks stupid on skiis.
Glad I'm not the only one. 

I've been trying so hard to avoid hitting people. Made it almost 4 years, but got some idiot a month back. He randomly thought the trees looked fun and completely cut across the entire run to duck in. Caught him at the edge of the trees as i kept moving further to avoid him. 

My response, "Are you okay?"

Him, "Yeah, but it could've been worse!"

Me thinking, "yeah, no shit, then look up the hill when you make a drastic 80 degree turn out of nowhere."

I typically hug the edge of groomed runs to avoid people anyways, so when someone cuts across the run into the trees, it leaves me not a lot of options.

Any group of Jerries at Heavenly on a steep groomed run they have no business being on

This is some illuminati shit. Careful out there guys
So are skiiers to snowboarders  like what scooters at the skatepark are to skaters and bmx riders?
It‚Äôs like space invaders
That one guy in the Orange and Blue is breaking formation!
Every goddamn skier must have a screen in their goggles giving the best route on how to cut everyone off behind them. The amount of times I‚Äôve been swerved straight into and yelled at because ‚Äúthe uphill rider is always at fault‚Äù is insane.

And they complain about snowboarders.
It's funny how they think they are being so cool.¬†
This is the kookiest shit i've ever seen.

As a skier I feel this way too!
It‚Äôs like a video game boss, you gotta learn the counters to their moves
Skier's fault
They all have matching suits and everything.. how adorable
The slow erratic slalom is the worst. The one where they go almost perpendicular to the run and just turn randomly.
Skiers are gay. Exhibit A:
I just don't fucking get it. I had one cut me off this weekend and they were really far away last I checked. It was also on my backside (I'm goofy)
It's so damn true.
üòÇ
Snowboarders have a blind spot!!!

These guys are as blind as can be.

Op has an excellent point.
Get some of those noise makers for deer and put them on your helmet. They emit a high-frequency noise only audible to skiers.
Looks like aliens flying in Galaga
they had a snowboard group this year too:)
It‚Äôs not downhill people‚Äôs job to let you pass and ultimately if you‚Äôre constantly getting stuck behind beaters then it‚Äôs on you for not being on harder terrain with fewer people ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
News flash- Turning is how you ski
That and their freaking obsession with the bar...or they freaking follow you way too close when you carve.
Accurate! Also, snowboarders anytime I'm trying to pass:

Hahaha this is rich coming from the people sitting on the slope....

I will happily continue to break towards you guys and shower you in snow.
My last trip there was a pow day on the day we left. 

The run is pretty empty and wide.  I'm making pretty big turns carrying a decent amount of speed behind this skiier that's doing basically the exact same thing.

But he's going just a bit slower than I want to go.

So I've basically been right behind this guy the entire run.  I see my chance up ahead, I'm just gonna do an extra wide carve to the left and bomb down to pass him.

Literally the exact same time I decide to carve far left, this dude is lock step and stays almost perfectly in front of me the whole turn. It was astounding.
Some are
And its actually an entertaining video üòÇ

As a skier, I 100% agree.
These guys are all personal friends of mine, but you're correct.
Never have I ever seen a skier check behind themselves
Is it though?
Why are they so opposed to short, controlled turns and predictable lines?! Does my head in.

Better comparison is fruit booters (roller bladers) in skate parks.

Wow I can jump in the air and spin or step 8 inches onto a curb too. Unless they are going huge on vert or doing serious 6+ stair rails it is laughable.

Luckily most of them have slunk back into whatever holes they spawned from..
You could instead maintain a speed where you're actually in control?
>But the strong majority ski like the goal is to fight gravity as much as humanly possible.

I literally had an epiphany last week about this:

**Skiers don't turn because they need to, they turn because they think it's what you're supposed to do.**

This is why they're so unpredictable, why they make moguls, why they do what you described: they've been taught that skiing is about slaloming for the sake of slaloming, so that's what they try to do, and when they're bad, they do it without any rhyme or reason, and obviously completely oblivious to the world around them. I suspect this starts with their education - you know, riding all in a line, following each other in a snake taking up the entire run? They never stop doing that, they just do it one-by-one.

Like, sure, there's a time and a place for turning for turning's sake, I've carved down plenty of green runs for the amusement, but skiing and snowboarding is meant to be about getting from point A to point B, not meandering around aimlessly.

And the weird thing about the fact that I only realized this now is that I skied for a decade and snowboarded for two - I've spent 30 years on the slopes, a third of it on skis, and I never really looked at just why the hell the people around me were doing what they were doing. Probably because the people I'm around were mostly racers, so the above doesn't apply.
Man I was just at Heavenly two weeks ago. Those catwalks to get across States suck. And yeah there were a ton of skiers making wide turns I did not feel comfortable at all trying to overtake.

Going through fresh pow in the trees was amazing though
I dunno, I saw a guy suck a dick this one time.

I don't think calling stuff you don't like gay, is cool.

It's not the end of the world, sure, you probably don't hate gay people, I just don't like it.

Do you have a video of that?!?
News flash you‚Äôre in the snowboarding sub.
Last week a dude got off the lift and immediately sat down to buckle in. Like he didn‚Äôt even get out of the way or anything.

Nope you wouldn‚Äôt have done anything
You're either being over the top rude, or a jerk, or otherwise breaking our rules.
It‚Äôs personal for you huh
Every. Fucking. Time.
Skiers are bitchdicks
It's quite endearingly naff
Now that‚Äôs some hot dogging right there‚Ä¶
Me in the park with a huge line of snowboarders behind me.
Sorry, the AIDS got him in 92
Hahahaha! This post! Your GIF! FUCK! üòÇü§£ And this is something that's exclusively an ‚Äúus‚Äù thing. 

I‚Äôm also active in the surfing sub, and you‚Äôd NEVER see a drunk stand up paddleboarder come in there to troll them. They don't get wind surfers shit posting or commenting and picking fights. Never happens. Wouldn't happen. 

Nor do I ever go into the skiing sub to troll. Here, it‚Äôs all day every day. You said it, revenge of the nerds.

Edit: BOY-OH-BOY. I‚Äôm getting hate mail from skiers. Surprise, surprise. Why are they even here reading this, SMFH??? üö®NERD ALERT!!!
Duct tape him to the flag pole
skiier checked behind me on a cat track, then proceeded to swerve into the trees and cut me off. beginner with no helmet no goggles just sunnies and a bald head. i dont know man. i dont think lots of these people are even real. just there to be obstacles
No.
Less impressive than synchronized swimming, but in the same vein. To have that many skiers stay in tempo is one thing, but to maintain distance like that is a job well done.
yeah
Roller bladers would usually have enough sense to get the fuck out of the way, scooter kids just hang out in the way
Go later at night.
My brother and I spent most of our teens at millenium park in Calgary as a fruit booter (him on a board) I can say most of the kids at the park, regardless of what they rode were a nightmare. Standing in the way. Cutting you off after calling next. Then running their mouth like they're tough shit for learning what swearing is. 

After 10 or 11pm when their parents pick them up, the park was much much more respectful and casual. 

Then the city ran train rails right through the middle of the park...
As a skier this reads like a copypasta. Especially that last paragraph. Hilarious
Ah yes, if your right beside another car on the freeway and they merge into you, you should have been maintaining as speed where you‚Äôre in control
I'm a literal magnet for people. I've ridden my entire life, get about 50 days a season, and am in complete control 100% of the time. I've had multiple people call me crazy, then ride with me and see what I'm talking about as some idiot randomly finds their way into my path. I'm like a target for heat seaking Jerry missiles.
Just admit you can‚Äôt carve bro. It‚Äôs way more fun than straightlining.

If skiing and snowboarding was about getting from A to B you‚Äôd stay at the end point ie the bottom of the mountain. You‚Äôd never hit park. You wouldn‚Äôt do any flat tricks. It would be incredibly dull.
Do you do everything on the hill because you need to?  Turning well is fun.
Actually, I think skiing and snowboarding is about having fun
I use this point of view anytime I ski or ride, especially in trees! It‚Äôs just so fun not turning, and I no longer get that pesky adrenaline boost from dancing with gravity as I sway back and forth! It‚Äôs so relaxing bombing down in a straight line, not thinking about jumps, moguls, parks, or other skiers and riders! I hate terrain and believe that every motion I make should be maximum efficiency, and that it‚Äôs a waste do do and activity for pleasure. In fact, I recently realized that I can escape the hustle and bustle of the slopes by just skiing cross country! This mindset truly changed my life!
It doesn't count if it‚Äôs just the tip.

You're either being over the top rude, or a jerk, or otherwise breaking our rules.
Are you a skier by any chance?
Why are you here?¬†
no... I was riding (he was skiing) with one of the guys in this video (I think this was his team), and he was telling me about the event. Sadly, I had to take off the morning of this event.
Ok, and? Doesn‚Äôt change how you ski
See, the downvotes prove the sub hates good ole legal behavior!
Well I wouldn‚Äôt have actually I was exaggerating that. But I was fucking pissed off that‚Äôs for sure.
Is this Hans' ex-wife?
I know it's a joke, but I do genuinely enjoy watching snowboarding but don't do it, hence subbing here. Ride park with a pretty even mix of skiers and snowboarders. Plus, the influence of snowboarding honestly saved skiing from lame bullshit like this continuing to be the mainstream.
I think it happens cuz good intentions bad skiers. Trying to look uphill, but head turn = skis turn.
Yeah all the bladers I've ridden with over the years have been cool and respectful. Do some crazy shit on rails too. Nothing like scooter kids.
I assure the content is original along with my vitriol. ;)
Hazards will exist, it‚Äôs your job to be able to stop, slow down, or turn on a dime if you go fast. Bad skiers and snowboards do things that could cause an accident, but I just stop, or turn and completely avoid an accident. Idk why y‚Äôall can‚Äôt comprehend this.
I knew that I shouldn't have ventured into the criminal's subreddit and expected anyone to have a single brain cell.
If everywhere you go smells like shit, check your shoes.

Should force this guy to ride telemark the rest of his life..
You're either being over the top rude, or a jerk, or otherwise breaking our rules.
No, I just happen to have friends who are gay. I just don't like them being collateral of comments like that. 

I just told you my opinion on that. You don't need to make a big deal out of it. If you see it differently than that's fine.
Cause I‚Äôm a snowboarder..? 

You‚Äôre free to think this is stupid, it‚Äôs just a bit telling that you see other people doing stuff you aren‚Äôt into and assume it‚Äôs because they think they‚Äôre cool.
I apologize if this post upset you, you should ski however you like. Don‚Äôt let a buncha criminals get you down!
[Target Fixation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_fixation)
This comment makes you highly suspect ü§£
Sometimes accidents are out of your control. I‚Äôm glad you have never been that kind of situation.
That‚Äôs why we commit to a life of crime
Lol, I'm a skier and this is my first time on /r/snowboarding. They're as inconsiderate online as they are on the slopes!
Understandable response, I've had friends who completely trust me doubt this until they ride with me for a few days. It's my curse ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I also have friends who are gay and they use the term as well. People are allowed to think and say what they want man. Also, this is reddit. Probably the worst place to hope people are politically correct.
Lol I aint upset im just telling you yall shouldnt get angry at skiers for‚Ä¶ skiing.
Hah naw I was usually on the BMX. Occasionally skated tho.
>People are allowed to think and say what they want man. 

I agree. That's why I told you what I thought about it. What you make of it is up to you.
Just messing with ya
Fair enough lol. Well, goodbye for now until we meet again ü§£
If I find any Tourists lost on my property, I swear I'm gonna..
See if they want to smoke a joint and point them in the right direction. Try to be nice today. If an asshole like me can pull it off, you fuckers will be fine. We are all just primates hooting at the bright ball in the sky.
[deleted]
Adopt the Maine attitude....Don't be afraid to call them names while helping undo whatever mess they get themselves into.
It isn't that hard to be nice, is it? And if they're true assholes, it will piss them off if you don't go down that path. Win/win.
Love the energy of this post. Kindness is free and this is a cool thing. And people get to see our beautiful state :)
Good to know Im not the only one who likes engaging with visitors to the state (I'm the type that invites them in for a cup of earl grey)
This is the energy VT needs
I honestly would be nice about it but nicely and firmly ask them to stay on the town road right-of-way to enjoy it. I want people to enjoy the eclipse and I could certainly put up with the road crowded and parked in for a few hours but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with total strangers wandering around deep in on my land either.
Amen, comrade
Well said, Slutty McFuckstick.
Just remember you'll need your night vision setup for the totality...
Well said stranger.
That‚Äôs cool, but always send them on the scenic route.
Well said. I'll be out there on the zero gravity chairs with beers and bones.
If I'm an out of stater and hike up there every other week or so three seasons out of four, that makes me a tourist?

Wish I got lost, haha! I'm genuinely sorry to have clogged your roads that bad, I was not expecting that for some reason. In 55 years, when there's an eclipse in my neck of the woods, feel free to swing through!
But‚Ä¶the dragon is going to eat the big fire in the sky.
I already shit in my catapult bowl and have it set to "detect whiteplate"
Idk what‚Äôs more cringey, the posts complaining about the tourists or the ones like this that serve no purpose other than to show how totally righteous and virtuous you are compared to those other mean people. 

How about this? We all just stop talking about the tourists and instead talk about this event.
Don‚Äôt encourage tourists to drive high please. They‚Äôre already crazy and stupid enough as it is
Ditto. I have pbrs‚Ä¶
Dude.....how many of us had exactly the same thought. I just like all of you so stinkin much!
I guess I‚Äôm a Mainer lol
That's just New England in general.
Be kind, but not necessarily nice.
Solid plan, signed, a Mainer.
Ahh the farmer fuckup.
Having just moved to Maine, this is very informative. Thank you. Now I know how to be lol
This is the way.

Yeah, it‚Äôs much nicer and they‚Äôll get some good photos to show their families.
I love this about New England, we note the scenic route when in most towns, it‚Äôs just the way.
That makes you an out of stater who should be living here.
Yes, the tens of thousands of people flooding into the state aren't interesting at all. Let's not talk about it.

Better yet, howsabout you scroll along? This is gonna be over soon, unlike the sandwich jokes.
I chuckled at this post and therefore it was worth posting :)

Also a very New Yorker thing to do
Some passive, with light hits of aggressive lol
You did! Thank you so much from all of us in r/connecticut!
or, directions by Foogle
You big mad huh? 

Where did I say we shouldn‚Äôt be talking about tourists? The problem is that this state full of emotionally stunted/sheltered folks can only agree with one end of the spectrum or the other: either ‚Äúthese tourists are awful!‚Äù Or the slightly more nuanced ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be nice to toursists and you should too!‚Äù

Like how about we just treat everyone with respect regardless of what their license plate says and talk about this awesome event rather than obsessing and bellyaching over the tourists sucking or being nice to the tourists. Like holy shit the fixation on the tourists from both sides is unhealthy af.
"How about this? We all just stop talking about the tourists..." 

"Where did I say we shouldn't be talking about tourists?" 

You're a special kind of guy, aren't you?
> How about this? We all just stop talking about the tourists

> Where did I say we shouldn‚Äôt be talking about tourists?

bud these were LESS than thirty minutes apart, maybe smoke less
Hey great job writing the exact same comment as someone else. Made you feel almost as special as me I bet

We absolutely SHOULD be talking about the tourists but since no one can handle it I suggest we just stop
The point is if you can‚Äôt talk about them without it causing you great emotional turmoil one way or another then maybe you should just avoid talking about them. We absolutely should be talking about the once in a lifetime event and the people visiting us but we shouldn‚Äôt make it such a goddamn thing that it isn‚Äôt.
I figured if I repeated the answer you might understand how stupid you sounded.

Been welding a lot of structural stainless at work lately. This is really good practice 
Amazing gold awsomeness love to see it
Chill man my girl is on this app
I'm digging what your tigging
I‚Äôm no where near this level yet but I‚Äôm getting there. Tig welding is like therapy for me. In comparison to our shop when it‚Äôs mostly standard mig and flux core or arc onsite, tig is like a breath of fresh air. Just zone out and find a rhythm.
Why tig?
i just felt my dick move

Now that the bump stock rule got over turned it wouldn‚Äôt be super hard to make a reciprocating/sliding mount for it that acts as a bump stock
imagine that on an actual hilux
Gun fires when trigger is pressed forward, gun cycles by barrel going back and forth.

I‚Äôm thinking you should connect some string that presses the trigger forward when the gun is in battery.

‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS A MACHINE GUN‚Äù
‚ÄúHah okay‚Äù
The lack of mountains and presence of rolling hills makes me feel this is more eastern Montana, like Bozeman area?
The suppressor for that probably costs more than my car
2 foot long suppressor good grief! Lol
If any gun needs a can it‚Äôs a ma deuce.
I want that Trijicon MGRS more than I want the semi-auto Ma Deuce
When the other automakers collapse, I want Toyota to bring in the Hilux so we can have proper Technicals
That's a thing of beauty!!! I've been around NFA weapons since before I joined the army.. and I always thought the mother of all was the Ma duce, with a can and scope..
Atleast you attached it to a Toyota Pickup!
It crazy cool that even with that big ass Suppressor after the bullets left the barrel there still echoing back due to how fast they traveling. If only it's full auto that'd be even better
How much we wanna bet that dude is from California?

It's like the bad ending of that famous "it's a machine gun" vid.
It is not wrong that you said that, it is wrong that you had to say that.

So is this at the ranch where Yellowstone is filmed in Darby? Or did someone call their ranch Dutton Ranch out near Bozeman lol. I grew up 20 minutes from Darby in Corvallis, but the video just looks more like Bozeman area to me.
Dammit. My comment is now invalid.

Seven trigger pulls, $35-ish. So, a couple of Big Macs and a large fry, based on the pictures of receipts I'm seeing. Relatively speaking, that's still pretty cheap for the amount of fun had.

On flat land in Ohioüò© Midwest ice skier. But when I had money I spent a week in steamboat loving it and then wife got me a father day present a few years ago and we spent some time at party city. A friend moved out to salt lake years ago and I should have gone with him. My niece did some work for the forest service in Idaho and I never got a chance to visit her üò©. Next place I going is Jackson. Having kids and going from 30-50 days in snow to 5-10 has severely hurt my endurance.

Steezy but I‚Äôd be scared they‚Äôd yank my pass. I‚Äôd also be scared to even send it haha
I've done it a few times, mostly in Japan but in the states a couple of times.

It is criminal in some places, almost all resorts will take your pass if they catch you and many will ban you for life.

Different chairs react differently, always inform a person if you are riding with them and make sure they are cool with it, don't 'bounce' off the chair but just drop as the biggest risk if you pick a decent landing is bouncing your chair companion off or bouncing the next chair down and knocking someone off.

That landing was pretty good, nice drop onto a slope, no hidden objects under the snow, good runway to take away momentum, no nearby trees or poles.
Almost anything goes at Boreal. I don‚Äôt see the problem.
Saw someone do that (was a skier!) and the cable bounced off the runners. Was in France about 20 years ago.
Boreal might as well be a California penitentiary
I take issue with jumping off lifts. Only because unweighting a lift suddenly can cause serious problems. I‚Äôm not a lift operator nor do I have technical knowledge of how lifts work. But I do know that the cable is under tension and a quick, unexpected, change in the weight can do a lot of harm. The example I always point to is the accident at Northstar on the T-Bar back in 07/08. I don‚Äôt remember all the details but someone(s) did something while riding that cause the cable to come out from under one of the wheels on a tower causing the cable to fly up several feet. This launched another t bar rider up into the air. That person died I believe. 

So while it may seem you‚Äôre only taking your own life into your hands when doing this, you could be endangering a lot more people.
Crime time.
Ski patrol wants a word, you're going straight to gnar jail
You can de-rope the entire lift like that. The bounce causes the cable to jump off the shiv wheels.
Someone who works at this mountain probably screenshotted your face and sent it to corporate already. Not that smart to do it, even dumber to brag.
Only if you get caught
200% criminal     You watched and enjoyed? Also a criminal.
As someone who used to work with ski patrol. Technically yes. 

I'm a little hazy on the details all these years later but if I remember right chair lifts are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and much like if you jumped out of a taxi or a bus while it is in motion there are issues with not exiting at the proper stop. Falls of over 16 feet or something also have to be reported. 

While it probably won't do any harm the lift is not designed to have 180 lbs unsprung in the middle of the lift. It could cause a Shockwave up the line that could oscillate just right to derail the lift. Or some 8 year old sees you doing it and tries themselves and falls neck first. 

It's one of those play stupid games win stupid prizes things. I don't think the reward is worth the risk of getting your pass pulled.
[deleted]
Laws differ depending where you are. But the issue as others have said is that the bounce can derail the cable and cause a situation where the lift needs to be evacuated because it won‚Äôt move any more. This means that one dipshit can ruin a lot of people‚Äôs day. At my ski area you will lose your pass and the owner will call the sheriff on you. Don‚Äôt do this. Thank you, from a ski patrol guy.
Goodbye pass
Probably breaking some kind of civil regulation at least. But more to the point it is really foolish. It puts people on the chair at risk and people riding down the slope. It is also a great way to seriously injure yourself. Please don't do this.
Most of all, it's stupid. We did this all the time, until one of us landed a bit wrong, and his knees struck him in the jaw. Lost 5 teeth, fractured jaw, serious concussion. Never been on a board since.
Used to be you could pop the chair behind you of sending innocent people either to the ground or sliding into those behind you either way people have been injured and died.  So hey if it ain‚Äôt my family who cares right
More Stupid than Criminal.
‚ÄúSecure the boarder!‚Äù
I‚Äôll look for a true crime podcast about this heinous act
Its not criminal, its Bor√©al
nice way to shatter your knee caps or get a lifetime ban.
It‚Äôs impressive
Smooth criminal
If you're going to do it anywhere that's where to do it. Have a feeling that's a lot bigger drop than it looks on video though!
The lifts often have signs on them naming the specific law you are breaking if you do it, but I can‚Äôt remember. Something to do with the railways act maybe? Big balls.
My friend‚Äôs dad took us snowboarding when we were in high school and he jumped of the lift like this. The ski patrol saw him and a chase ensued. Somehow he outran the ski patrol and got away. I always found it funny how he was the adult chaperone, yet he was the one breaking all the rules that day.
Lifelong boarder here - this is a jerk move for so many reasons. Also shit like this just strengthens the case/view snowboarders are dicks. 

Best case is this, worst case get hurt and cause a mess with the lift, possibly damage or partially de-rope the lift and fuck everyone‚Äôs day.
What's even the point of doing that? Just to flex?
Boreal is a second home to me. 

When I was on the team in high school we rode there every week for 4 years. 

The mountain is meh, but there‚Äôs an indoor foam pit and tramp you can play around with. I dialed in my back 3‚Äôs there.
Naaaa, just asinine.
Great way to lose your pass.
AND STUPID!
Smooth criminal
Straight to Facebook jail
The problem is if some overprotective parent sees that and goes to report it. Probably also stakes out the ski lift waiting for you to return, just so she/he can say point you out. Been there. Not fun.

Looked sick, though :)
not wearing a helmet and jumping off the lift. dude is cruising for some brain damage
Bros bringing the crime rates way up
NOT criminal(if you don't get caught).  However, Ski Patrol and lifties sure don't enjoy seeing that.
Its not criminal but u do have to get bare ass board spanked by ski patrol to get ur pass back
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù, as in they won‚Äôt press charges when caught, depending on if it‚Äôs PNW, Rockies, or Ice Coast, but the resort may have ban rules in place where your membership can be revoked. Epic I think has a stipulation of adhering to Vale Resorts‚Äô policies or risk nonrefunded loss of access.
The hands down probably should be
straight to jail!
Technically, yes
Illegal is a sick bird.
This is the smoothest I've ever seen this executed
I got kicked off the mountain for doing this but it was end of day anyway
What up Jake haha
I‚Äôve dropped a few times in Utah. Just don‚Äôt get caught.
Absolute thuggery.
That chair looks suspiciously like one in Japan bro.
Boreal? Nice!
No, but definitely will get kicked off the mountain for it. I got a red card or some shit at Northstar because I was sledding down my board.
I did this once and got my pass revoked. It was a night ski place and just kept skiing the rest of the night.
Vail jail
I honestly don't even get how people ride chair lifts without having safety bars. All the ones i have been on have had mandatory safety bars (the lift is stopped if someone doesn't put it down, and once it's down it locks so it only opens near the top station) and the emergency stops on those have been quite literally "stopped dead on its tracks" that without the roller coaster tier safety bars people would have slipped off from them.

Idk maybe america is less strict on those, but at least here in europe if someone fell off a chair lift, it would probably cause the whole resort to be shut down for safety inspection, so we just have mandatory safety bars
Smooth criminal, maybe
When I was a wee lad I went boarding with my dad and one of his hardcore employees ‚Äústone fabrication/crazy construction types‚Äù

He used to be a sponsored skater for what used to be EXIT ‚Äúreal world‚Äù that was pretty big in Oregon. This dude up on hood lit a cigarette after chugging a beer. Watched this guy intentionally slip out of the chair and dropped a good thirty or so feet onto the steep of a black diamond and zoomed all the way down at what looked like 1000 mph to this little boy at the time. 

Also saw a little kid on the express lift swinging his skis headed up with his dad two chairs in front of me. He then fell at one of the high points and dropped. Dad freaked out obviously. He was about to jump down. Luckily a bunch of people rallied on the run and checked on kiddo who was fine as he fell right at base of the pole where there was a ton of towed and fresh powder saving his ass. Who knows little kids are made of rubber but still.

If you see any younglings swinging on the lift yell at them please especially when at top of mountain on a cold icy day.
Smooth criminal
It can derail a chairlift.
Don't gaslight us. We saw him wear a snowboard.

Did he drop in that switch?!
About to meet some hoes at the lodge
The 2022-2023 insane snow year had the Heavenly gondola line so close to the snowpack in places that one could fairly easily grab and swing on the rails on the bottom of the cabins.

I never thought I'd do something like that in my life. But, when in Rome....
Have you seen movie "Frozen" (survival one)?
Not in Europe.
I did that one time with half the height and after hitting the snow my knee hurts roll down and smash my head. It was not cool ‚Ä¶ I stayed down for 5 mins before getting up feeling there are few neck bones in wrong position. I had imagined how I shouldve landed but will probably never try this shit again
Steezy, so no.
You guys arent tired of this lame criminal nonsense? Lol would love to see how most of you ride
It's a smooth criminal.
Felonious.
He‚Äôs on FBI‚Äôs top 10 now
Is anything criminal at boreal?
Yes you idiot.  It can cause the line to fail, breaking the chairlift for everyone else.
My knees ache just looking at this üò≠
got my passes pulled for this

Only the hat my bro, only the hat
Looks like 1.5 seconds. So 35-40 freedom units off the ground?  (1 second is 16 feet and 2 seconds is 64 feet)
Conversation was too annoying had to bail
it was smooth, bad idea though
He‚Äôs living every snowboarders dream
All about that ‚Äúyou crazy‚Äù
Sir! Keep ur WHOLE BODY in the ride at all times!
That smooth quarter pipe landing was absolutely criminal
Jumping off a chairlift can cause a derail.
Well well, look at the criminal doing the crimes.
Do it at a tower and you won‚Äôt bounce the rope.
Baby daddy!
I work patrol.  I don‚Äôt like this.  All fun and games until someone gets hurt or they compromise the lift (rare but can have a cable wheel issue).

It‚Äôs not worth it.
I'm sure it's frowned upon, but that was sick, especially landing on a drop like that!
I got ‚Äòbanned‚Äô from my mountain for this. Luckily they‚Äôre pretty off-grid and have no way of enforcing it üòÖ still a passholder each of the nearly 20 seasons since
Ive Always wanted to jump but never have. Ha
One of my personal favorite things‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt done it in about 5 yrs on account of the knees, but YES!
Losers in the comments. 

Most people literally making stuff up, or just flexing how big of a Karen they are
Depends on the resort, but I believe it will get you banded at most so probably. Sick landing though, so worth it!
Headwear is Criminal but you get a Kinco‚Äôs pardon.
One wanted to do this so many times. More balks than i
1000% criminal
Wear a helmet!!!
He‚Äôs a cowboy
Wants to be dead.

Lol
*un
At least you‚Äôre not scared to wear your sunglasses inside
There was so much pow on this one run in Japan that you could grab the chair as it went up in one spot and get some sick mini hot laps
I thought the big problem is bouncing the cable off the wheels, fucking up everyone‚Äôs day.
You never know who will see you do it and who they will tell. The 8 year old 4 chairs back might think it‚Äôs the greatest thing ever and accidentally tell someone important that ‚Äúthe guy over there with the purple coat and black hat did a cool jump off the chairlift‚Äù and ask if he‚Äôs allowed to try it
Spoken like a true bench jumper
I agree. Always scout first to be sure tho.
also no people around. nobody was cut off. nobody's run was 'ruined'. The guy didn't get in the way of anyone.  

still criminal, but smooth criminal for sure.
Ban for life?? Thats some heavy shit for a chair drop.
I was chatting with ski patrol about it, and they told me, basically it wouldn't be a huge deal if there wasn't a real risk of popping off the rollers and spending a few hours getting everyone else off the lift.
When I worked there in 2016, we had a great season. Never saw so much snow in my life. First time out west from ice coast, as an instructor. We stayed doing silly shit. After being East for 2 winters, I would kill to go work there again, just to be out west.

So cables aren‚Äôt made to withstand wind lifting the chairs up and down?
Damn I never even considered that possibility. That would be horrible.
Actually I heard it can cause the entire chairlift to spontaneously explode
Fucking 4 kids jump up and down on these, one adult hopping off isn‚Äôt going to do that
In addition if someone falls off the lift mid ride it can trigger an inspection that necessitate the lift closing to determine what happened and if the lift is still safe. I know there is an exception if it is during loading, but I have seen lift shut down due to a person falling off the lift.
I've always heard this, but could it possibly be true. Like, surely the force of heavy wind is greater than one person jumping off. The weight of a single person compared to the total load on the cable is so disproportionate.
Ya, that‚Äôs not true at all. And if it was, you have bigger problems being on that lift.
[deleted]
Even with someone else‚Äôs weight also on the seat?
Pretty sure he already got banned for breaking a handrail at the same resort.
[deleted]
Yeah. There is a reason you will get booted from a mountain for doing this. It puts the person doing it and others at needless risk.
How's he doing otherwise?
He outran the skiers on a snowboard? What kind of conditions were they?
I never thought about damaging the lift, would de-roping it be because of the bounce caused when he drops?
Some people didn‚Äôt get enough attention from their parents growing up so they seek attention anyway they can get it.
Looks like the lift is stopped.¬†
Sure beats horny jail. Do not get sent to horny jail.  The food is horrible.
Actually can be a real crime because of how chairlifts are regulated - they count as transportation devices and you're not exiting at a designated location. Something to that extent but that varies per state etc. Concept stand that the resort/state could make things really difficult beyond a ban if they wanted to.
On a sandwiched wood and ptex horse he rides.
Snitchhhh
I think those are because he‚Äôs scared lol
I remember going to ski to this small resort near my city, and there was one point off-piste where a lift was so low, 10yo me could get hit in the head by it.
Most places have top wheels now but yea otherwise my hometown hill had that happen
That can happen on older, smaller lifts but most 4+ person chairs weigh enough even with a person dropping and causing a bounce, they won't come off. I've heard of that happening maybe twice.

People falling off because of an unexpected bounce, gust of wind, or messing around happens almost every year.
I live within an hour of 8 (10 of you count a couple small ‚Äúhills) ski resorts in Utah. All of them will take your pass for the day if you intentionally jump off. Most of them will take your annual pass and a few will ban you for life. They don‚Äôt want the liability. If someone dies inbounds, despite all the disclosures, etc., they don‚Äôt want litigation as that could cost them tens of thousands in just legal fees. They also don‚Äôt want people who are willing to break these rules on their slopes, because they view them as being a liability- who will break whatever rule regardless of who it may affect‚Ä¶which could prove more costly in legal fees. It‚Äôs easier to just ban them than risk the cost of litigation. Source: my spouse is a snowboard instructor.
Why not? It adds completely unnecessary risks and not only for the person dropping. Resorts are more strict these days than 20 or 30 years ago.
Seems like that would be very difficult to do. Unless someone was like 600lbs. I‚Äôve jumped off a couple chairs and sometimes even swing or bounce the chairs lol
Been an avid snowboarder my whole life. I must head out west, its on my bucket list.
That was indeed a big winter. Were you here for the 22/23 season?
The only bummer here is being stuck at Boreal for a deep winter. Assuming you‚Äôre referring to the Boreal in Tahoe lol.
>¬†I‚Äôm not a lift operator nor do I have technical knowledge of how lifts work. But¬†

that's peak reddit right there
Not with the added weight of passengers. Thats why chairs get put on wind hold when it gets bad. The chairs will still blow around and may come off the track but there isn‚Äôt all the added weight and tension from passengers.
Ever heard of a wind hold?
If the cable snaps, it can sling someone into orbit.
It can, and will de-rope, especially the light double chairs. You can even sling a T bar off the sheaves very easily (but that has less consequences for anyone outside maint) 
Source: aerial tramway tech
It is likely not going to. But there is still a small chance that it could. Which is why it‚Äôs illegal and resorts get pretty salty about it.
Or stop trying to justify shit
There ya go, a plus one againüòÄ

Prob more to do with the massive legal culture in the U.S. and the fear of being sued. You‚Äôd have to imagine a tolerance engineered into lifts to factor in winds, people being dicks and so on. 

Was a very steezy drop. He looked like he knew what he was doing though.
life of crime, nothing to lose!
Based.
Works in a bank üòî
Yep he did.  This was like 20 years ago, so I can‚Äôt remember the conditions. They disappeared out of sight, since we were still on the lift, so I have no idea how long the patroller actually chased him for. He may of thought ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt worth it‚Äù, and bailed on the chase.
He is wanted, dead or alive.
I‚Äôm scared you‚Äôre on to me‚Ä¶
When Copper Mountain put in their buble chair a few years ago it would come within 6-7 feet of the ground if they had to stop it during the testing phase.  I was lapping the trees by the chair and had to dodge it once.

Eldora has the Corona chair that gets so low to the ground over a water pipe that I had to lift my skis up to not bonk someone in the head \[I'm tall\] last year.
A few of the lifts are like that at a different spots on a couple of different mountains around here, but inbounds.They're always roped off.

It gets tricky when you drop a glove right there.
From a business standpoint absolutely valid point.
Snowboarding is the embodiment of unnecessary risks. We do it cause its adventurous and fun despite them (of course still within reason). Chair drop in some fresh pow surely seems within reason to me haha. 
I get that they may ban you for a day or a week but this lifetime ban seems overkill. 
Anyways the resort can do what they want with you so pointless to argue of course.
Definitely won't regret it. I've traveled a bit in my time, and my favorite trip in general was my first time in real snow in Lake Tahoe. 

I know Tahoe isn't the holy Grail, but they had the second highest amount of snow in history the year I went. That stat was changed last year as 2022-2023 is now the second highest year, but still, nothing beats real powder.
Noooo. I was Bellayre. NY

That may be true but the cables will definitely be made to withstand a single change in tension due to the unpredictability of winds - source: engineer. Someone jumping off a lift causing a single change in tension is not going to cause a lot of harm as the comment above suggests.
Is that where they stop the lifts due to the wind and they lift up and down (quick and unexpected changes) in high winds?
Yes, that‚Äôs where the wind is blowing so hard it‚Äôs safer to expose a lift full of customers to hypothermia for several hours than to very slowly get them to the top.

Every time I get in a lift I‚Äôm prepared to spend a long time on it doing nothing.
MuRpH!! Don‚Äôt let meh leave MuRph!!!
That bounce would cause the cable to guillotine the entire earth population at once.
If one person falling off can derope the whole thing that's a huge safety flaw in general. Got any further sources or info on this?

How are these used everywhere around the world when they can be dropped by something as simple as a person falling off one chair?
Can you tell me about instances of this happening?
Do you know of any instances of it happening? Because that‚Äôs terrifying but I‚Äôve never heard of it
[deleted]
Fr, the guy did it properly, no damage done. Why are people complaining.
If he's still got his faculties, maybe he can return to snowboarding but not drop from chair lifts again?
![gif](giphy|iRp8JLRVgqFHy)
Yep, us folks in the biz call that "max headroom"
Tahoe in the 80s was great! I grew up going there every winter & summer (had a cabin up there).
>I don‚Äôt remember all the details but someone(s) did something

No one has to comment but with such *valuable conjecture* how could you not?

someone did something, guys. I'm not sure what, but it *was* something.
I‚Äôm not saying the cable will snap. If the cable is under tension, meaning it goes underneath the guide wheels on a lift town instead of over the top, and the cable is shifted out from under those wheels, it will shift up several feet very rapidly. This shift will cause a ripple effect down the line aggressively lifting up all the chairs connected to it.
Regulation is usually tied to injury and death right? 
So Yan was this ski lift manufacturer in America in the Wild West of lift building. He made lifts to criminally negligent that he defected to Mexico to avoid his liability. A lot of the lifts you see today that access sketchy terrain wouldn‚Äôt have been built if it wasn‚Äôt for that mad man.

https://www.coloradoskihistory.com/chairlift/yan1.html

A bunch of people died and tramway boards were introduced to try and get some regulation.

Still to this day you‚Äôll see full service brakes (not emergency or rollback) that are nothing more than a weight on the end of a lever

So to get back to the point, enough people have to die or get injured for more serious regulations to come in. Chairlifts are pretty reliable as long as you have good tension on the line, not crazy wind conditions and not sending constant bouncing through the line (this can occur from lots of things like motor failure, hitting e stops then immediately starting the lift and going to fast, multiple people jumping out of chairs.

Wind deropes lift

(Accidentally hit post, still editing)
49 Degrees North in Washington three years (I think. maybe four) ago. Double chair. Big pow day. Two guys jumped together. Haul rope de-railed but didn't fall off the tower. Rope broke a part or two as it moved off the shivs. Lift was broken and entire line had to be evac'd. Replacement part didn't arrive til summer so lift was shut down for the whole 2nd half of the season.   
That said, one dude off a much heavier quad chair probably isn't gonna derail.
I posted a comment above. I don‚Äôt know of any incidents on a chairlift but it did happen on a t bar at Northstar. The cable was shifted out from under one of the tower wheels and it caused the whole cable to shoot up several feet rapidly.
Cry more
the refusal to admit or care that your actions affect anyone else is really the majority of the problem
[deleted]
my home mountain still operates 3 riblets built/installed in 1966, with counterweight e-stops. this ancient technology creates multiple problems on an almost daily basis. this, along with the major wind we have (gusts up to 108mph at the summit last season), often puts the lifts on wind hold for the entire day. riders have all unloaded or had an evac before anything bad happened afaik (waiting to get an evac after sitting & freezing for hours still sucks), but these dinosaur lifts still exist on many mountains.

and you are absolutely correct- wind derailment is REAL.
I guess in a way, but in the modern era if something happens that kills people, and there were cases like you linked here, the owner of the lifts can get hit with heavy negligence charges.

Also in that last post wind was viewed as a possible factor, but that was never confirmed. There wasn't really much info on what caused that failure in the link.
Comparing that wind to this guy hopping off is wild. This looks more like a new Doppelmayr lift, not an old timey two seater like I grew up on.
[deleted]
Was it the fault of one of the riders?
there is no criteria. I have no power to gatekeep reddit.

I just think their comment is stupid.

if you don't like that opinion then *You don't have to read it. No one is forcing you. If it's shit content that no one wants to read, it'll be downvoted accordingly. I wasn't trying to mislead anyone. If this is what you wanna waste your time whining about, then I guess that's you. Have fun*
Most people on here wouldn‚Äôt get on a riblet if they knew how it‚Äôs attached to the line
A LOT Of lifts are much older than you think, ergo still suceptable to the issues. Even a modern one there's still nothing other than gravity holding the rope on the sheave, so de-roping is very much a thing and in recent history has still happened in the right conditions.
Yes. There was another person or two on another part of the T bar that did something that caused the cable to come out from under the tower wheel.
yes indeed. probably best they don't know.
Gravity and hydraulic tension
I know this was 5 days ago but you got any links or info about that? Tried finding a news article or something and couldn't
This is a good one for the people, the only thing keeping your haul line together is friction

Much like a finger trap (idk if I can say Chinese finger trap)
I‚Äôm coming up empty too which is odd. I was working as a coach and park crew at Northstar that winter. A friend was working lifts. I am positive it happened.

I'm just gonna assume every weld you did in between the first and last ones you posted were terrible so I don't feel so bad about my own welds.
Electrician here; how many welders does it take to screw in a light bulb? 5, one to screw it in and four to stand around talking about the last light bulb they screwed in.

It feels so good to look at that
Motherfucker that's a nice looking weld.

What is that part? What a treat for the eyes nice one there.
Mother of god. That has to be passivated right? Or is that your gas shielded ID?
You made me horny.
sexy, sexy
I‚Äôm crying, this is beautiful
Not a welder, but can appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship in another person‚Äôs profession! What really blows my mind is the absence of start/stop laps. Is this a continuous weld? Kings to you good sir!
I don't think this sub takes kindly to liars. A robot clearly did this. Or AI. 


Good job üòâ
Don‚Äôt forget to thank your machinist for making the flange and weld prepping the mechanical tubing ü§™
That looks amazing , i could never
Holy shit this is so good!
Cool.  The person who drew the P&ID for that super secret system sat at a desk and drew a dumb picture in autocad with little bowties for valves. That person could never weld like this.  He/she makes twice what you do. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre super sad about their shaky hands though.

Edit: üòò
So, you finished welding it at 9 am. And spent the rest of the day polishing it???
That is beautiful.  Makes me want to cry. üò¢
how do you make it all the way around without stopping to turn the part letting shit cool, or does that not matter? or is it in like some sort of super slow rotating lathe?
You did it wrong
Bloody gorgeous
How long does it take for a session like this? Looks amazing
I am just learning how to weld, this is fucking art! Absolutely beautiful!
Damn. Looks like shit
Turrible. Just turrible.
No one actually believes this is a hand weld right?
If it took you all day to figure out the settings, perhaps you should reconsider a job where you don't waste a bunch of time and money until the last task of the day.
Ah, but do you remember your first joint?

OP, if my best weld is half as good as your worst - I'd be happy. Fucking beautiful.
Yeah Im not sure if I have more arc time or standing around time at this point
Interesting
Autogenous or filler?
Thx for the details!  Can you describe the process you used to get those settings dialed in?  I could learn a thing or two from you.
Your civic duty

I already got people in here who want to fuck the weld, I don‚Äôt need to encourage them any further

üòî
Thanks player
Can‚Äôt really talk specifics but it‚Äôs for a high pressure sanitary setup in a cleanroom
You are looking at the weld face, it was a single pass with a pulse weld on the inside of the tube
üòÇ
It‚Äôs 1 continuous weld with only 1 start and stop that just not in the picture, but you can see the start stop in my last post
Little practice and anyone can
Thanks
That person actually makes like half.
Program me harder daddy
lol I‚Äôm 5 am to 3pm
It‚Äôs in a turn table and I have the settings set up so I can run the middle 80% of the weld mostly at full pedal. It‚Äôs turning at about .4rpm
This weld has a run time of about 2 minutes and 15 seconds or so, but with the pulse it keeps the temperature down so it won‚Äôt cook the alloy.
Just takes practice, thanks
I do but I guess I might be bias
Assuming you‚Äôre not a welder‚Ä¶ when you have the opportunity to run lots of consecutive welds on very expensive materiel, it‚Äôs always in your best interest to be your own critic and try to see what you can do to output the best welds consistently. When I lift the hood and see something less than I was hoping for, I get to run the same weld again on the next part and tweak the settings to see if it‚Äôs better. Company still makes their money, I‚Äôm fabricating parts all day, and at the end of the day my weld settings are dialed in for the size of material the next time I pick some up. Not sure what you are mad about?
oh yeah. I did it because the girl I liked smoked weed. Smoked so much I ended up greening out in front of her. She never saw me the same way again hahaha
Ooh, that‚Äôs a nice way to read it. I‚Äôd say ‚Äúcheerio‚Äù but then the original comment description would be of me.¬†
Same..

Charlie Hunham in ‚ÄúThe Gentleman‚Äù
Appreciate it, just takes practice I‚Äôve been in the trade for almost 10 years now
Non passivated food grade?  Because as a guy that builds water works fittings all day I'm curious on the settings side work looks decent
No filler for these
Well I‚Äôve been in the industry for almost 10 years so a good portion is just experience with knowing how the metal will melt, otherwise when I get a job with a bunch of identical welds I‚Äôll either reference previous settings I have written down for a similar size of material, or I go find a coworker who does.

From there I use those settings as a jumping off point to fit my weld style. For this one I mostly played with my turn table speed, amps, and getting the pulse balance where I like it.

For example I can do a weld, see how the color is, do I need to change the travel speed? The gas coverage? If those seem good I can concentrate on the bead profile. If I want a tighter bead I can just turn up the pulse frequency or drop my background amperage, and weld another one.

Key thing is once you get close to what you want, change only 1 setting at a time between welds to zero in on which setting will put it in the sweet spot. Again with experience you kind of already have a general idea of what settings will work as soon as you get the parts in front of you.

That's awesome!!!  Wtf does it mean?  Like I said...I have no clue on this subject.  It's just easy to appreciate when good work becomes art.
More or less the specificity I was hoping for üòÖ

I'm so curious what type of metals you're working with for filler and base, also what gases you are using. 

Rock on.
Not if that person is a process engineer.
oh good shit, ty :D
Thank you for the info!
Hand tig, straight fusion on a sanitary socket flange? I'm not a welder but I've seen hundreds of thousands on these and this would be among the best.
Wow!  Not sure how anyone can even respond with anything other than positive comments.  I think your work is so good! People are brutal.
I've been self teaching for about 6 months, and by self teaching I mean nagging two of my buddies, one who's a union welder and the other owns a performance shop and welds like a robot

I'm doing okay at stick and FC, but it's given me an incredible amount of respect for guys who do it well. I always thought "I have steady hands, I bet after a week I'll be stacking dimes" fast forward to a week later and I could barely strike an arc and when I could I'd lay down a squiggly line of birdshit. 

I'm gonna keep putting in time and effort, because I'd like to master it.
These are going into high pressure systems inside machines in a clean room, that‚Äôs all I can say.
Nice work. So many factors play into the width and consistency of that inside pen bead. Including the temp of the base metal. When I train new guys to run sanitary I will sometimes get someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in pulse, but those people never achieve any consistency.
Oh also, what is the wall thickness?
Helpful!  Thanks for taking the time.
Depending one what I‚Äôm making it will either be a helium test, hydro pressure test, or a vacuum drop test
Thanks, and im saying if you‚Äôre interested in the hobby you can go to harbor freight and get a basic set up for about $300 that you can plug into a 110v socket in your garage.
Mostly 304, 309, 311, 316-L, and 316 UHP for stainless steel.

Also do some 6xxx aluminum and titanium.

Things mostly just have matching fillers for the alloys

We use pure argon mostly
Half is accurate where I live.
Or is that an EVAC flange?
Yes, pulse welds and turn tables with some practice can put out clean work like this
Thanks, some people are just insecure
No one is born knowing how to weld, it‚Äôs a learned skill. We all more or less start with squiggly lines of birdshitüòÇ
I'm kinda surprised it's not done at higher feed  and power on a positioning table with a gas chaser attachment production rate on these should be a sinch that way ,we punch out fittings like that at about 5 mins a pop with good quality but passivation needing finish with standard mig and tig setups. get me gas chasers then i can't see why i couldn't crank these out in about  the same way all id need is the extra gas cover for the cooling in particular if I had a tig wire feeder üòú
You work for TSMC, don't you? That flange looks way too familiar.
Yeah pulse is a game changer for heat control. Especially on the thin stuff, some of our stuff goes down to .025‚Äùwall
2mm
That's a pretty cool idea.  

HF = Harbor Freight.  Got it.  

It's tempting but I think it'd be similar to when I went around soldering random pieces of metal to other random pieces of metal when I was 12.  Fun, but pointless.  

I work well with wood but I've never done anything (other than that childhood-soldering) with metal.  I've always been impressed by people who do.  Not often as impressed as I was with your work.  Amazing 'weld porn'.
I was making some space age assumptions based on that interesting and very consistent yellowish color. 

Nice work ü´°
My kid is interested in welding and auto mechanics. Which has the best potential for career and earning?
I mean I‚Äôm using a digital turn table with a tig welder, takes a little over 2 minutes per weld and there is no filler.
No but these flanges are ready made off the shelf items, they are pretty common in certain sanitary setups
Mechanic here, in my area (I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the same everywhere, but I can‚Äôt be for sure) people that only weld all day in a factory will make less than a dealer tech. Trades that require you to weld but aren‚Äôt soley welding like boilermakers, industrial maintained, and pipe fitters will make more than the vast majority of mechanics. There are some shop owners or crazy flat rate demons that can turn more hours, but those are the exceptions not the rule.
Yep, standard sizes and have high tolerance so they are pre fabbed.
Appreciate the response thanks. I feel like he‚Äôd be a solid millwright, he‚Äôs pretty good at a lot of hands on things. He just loves cars, and there‚Äôs something to be said for doing what you love.
Yeah we order these by the hundreds
Believe it or not, I don‚Äôt give a shit about LA.
Here‚Äôs a picture of a $9 beer at Stevens Pass instead. 
Not buying your Rainier before you hit the mountain, rookie mistake
Hard to tell who is at fault in this one
I miss the days of stevens pre vail. Used to have a whole set up in the upper lodge with microwaves and hot water for you to bring and heat your own food. And of course lift tickets were like $45. I miss 2008
What about your wife, is she steezy?
Little Vitamin R after a good run
Pro tip if you forget your beers they sell 6 packs at the deli by the highway in Skykomish. That way you can avoid going to the disgusting gas station accross the street that smells like piss and has flies everywhere.¬†
Man would I kill to get some Rainier out here on the east coast
Rainieeeeerrrrr
Paid $8 for a powerade at stevens üòî‚úåÔ∏è
What does this have to do with LA?
Stay old school cool; rock that Rainy.
Gotta have your dose of vitamin R
More like LA-hoo-sa-hers‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll see myself out
Thought I recognized that place. How‚Äôs the snow?
$9 Rainer???
I believe it lol.  I was at stevens yesterday.  Pro tip park in the upper lot and bring your own beers and a small grill
Good ol vitamin R should never be $9 üòÇ
How many hours is Stevens Pass from LA?
Paying $9 for a shit beer tells me you have more in common with LA than you care to admit.
The ultimate crime
Dude I live in LA and I don‚Äôt give a shit about it either. Happens.
My saddest day as a PNW native was the day I turned a Rainier can around and saw that it was bottled in California
Hey I know that place
Where is your weed?  Weed is required for all of age visitors at Stevens Pass. For criming purposes. Even tho it‚Äôs legal, ya know.
This post is lacking in criminal behavior
I knew that was stevens! Old home mtn!!
Recognized my second home without even reading the caption.
mmmm thas a good beer
SPKA!

When they come from your backpack they cost
Much less
I see Steven‚Äôs Pass, I upvote.
Pnw üíö
I paid $6 for 6pack of Rainier tall boys at dollar store
How do you know if someone is from LA?
Nobody does
Stevens Pass is rad
I paid 8$ for tea at snow summit üòî
I was in Seattle for work a couple weeks ago and jetted out to Stevens pass to check it out, loved it. Rainier beer is gross though.
This sub sucks.
Did anyone yell at you? I‚Äôve had some confusing encounters with stevens employees telling me not to drink beer
9 fucking dollars for a can of water??
Why is LA living in your head rent free??? Can someone from the Alps hold up their Pilsner Urquell and talk hella shit about the southland?! The further away, the more it still doesn‚Äôt make sense.
Rainier. It's the beer here.  Haven't seen one in a long time
Monday is about to be epic
You don‚Äôt even believe that
Stevens is where I learnt to ride :')
As I Canadian I have no idea what you are talking about‚Ä¶.
Ah a fan of the gold top. Always good even better after hitting the slopes.
I miss rainier so much üò¢
The fuck are they charging 9 bucks for a Rainier!?
Stevens Pass!
How many shits per mile?
Actually a good deal that would be like $20-30 at a big sports game or concert
Sure sure.. but.. how far away ARE you?
Is the backside open on weekends yet?
But everything's better in El Aye
Ayeeee my home mountain
Nice, Jer!
How true. Props to Stevens Pass.
Stevens!?

I love free basing dmt at that lodge, pulled so many sexy grandmas too that would buy me housing and beer, weed , Xanax etc
rainier is the most correct beer for certain areas
I‚Äôm miss WA.
Thought this was /r/Seattle for a minute
yuck rainier is the worst  
that shit always taste like warm piss, even if it's ice cold
Hahaha lmao. I don‚Äôt like Rainer
Wise words

Stevens is gonna be bananas next week
I've only been to Stevens once...
But I knew this was Stevens ü§ôüèº
Also... More snow coming!!! ü§òüèº
Damn Stevens used to be affordable and not like standing in line at the DMV‚Ä¶

Thanks, Vail!
Like the cherry?
i don ‚Äô t give a shit about corona
what a weird thing to say in a snowboarding subreddit
Oh looks like it's $9 beer night
Steven's Pass has happy "hour" tacos from 3:30-3:33 they cost $3.50 and they're surprisingly pretty good
More than a six pax of Renwah.
Fuck LA and SPKA
No one does
$9 for a beer?
Vitamin R for the win
Don‚Äôt give a shit about my money neither!
I‚Äôve never understood how mountain bars are still in business. Amazing, truly
Gotta get on that Costco 30 pack train to be ready to Jerry it properly.
which is only necessary if you forgot to pack a few tall boys into the snow under your front bumper
Yeah there‚Äôs a fuck ton of places along 2 to hit up. Ridiculous this guy is buying rains from vail.
Buying beer brewed near LA is the rookie mistake.
The skier
Vail obviously jeez... thats a 4$ beer at best, and only cause its a tawlly.
I love this sub!
Don‚Äôt forget the chowder bowls.
Every fucking god damn resort in the PNW was like this in 2008. Then lines. Boom.
I had a $300 student season pass for many years. 

FUCK VAIL
I‚Äôm so old I remember $10 Tuesday
Dude those were the days
Don't know how many hot pockets got nuked by me in that microwave.
Sounds like their lift maintenance crew is super green since the purchase. The experienced guys either left or were fired.
We gotta know OP
Nah she sleezy
Do her toes hang over too much?
Cringe
Rejuvenates the soul
I made the mistake of stopping at that gas station once to fill up and use the restroom. Never, ever again.
Be happy with yuengling if you have that
Narragansett is pretty similar.
Vitamin R, natty Bo‚Äôs, and lonestar‚Äôs are all the same beer with regional branding. It‚Äôs just pbr.

Yes I‚Äôve had all of them, Multiple times, it‚Äôs the same beer.
Drink a Natty Boh. They're pritty much the same.¬†
Beeeeeeeeeeeer
Haha if you‚Äôve been paying attention to r/snowboarding over the last week, there‚Äôs like 50 different posts ‚Äúbelieve it or not this is xyz miles from LA‚Äù
Bahaha
We about to get more next week ü´£
Edit: tickets are selling like crazy
That used to be a pro tip... Not so much anymore
Alot
20 hours north.¬†
Why?!ü§∑
Tacos and hiking.
Oh, they‚Äôll *tell* you they‚Äôre vegan!!
I know people who live there. 

You are right.
The last couple months supply of beer from Rainier tasted horrible and was brewed mainly in Colorado instead of California. The cans also had silver tops instead of gold ones.
Don‚Äôt give a shit about nuthin!!!!
Because it's a lifestyle not a hobby.
Most people can't handle riding all day. When I'm with my buddies we'll stop at the lodge for a mid day brew to rest. We'll grab a brew at the end of the day at the lodge bar too.

When I ride with people I don't push them to go more than they want, I go to spend the day with them. I go alone for my shred days. No alcohol and no rest on those days.
Because some ppl go up to socialize at the bar more than to shred. I go up to handle bidness, not sit in the chalet.
Higher elevation + tall boy, doesn‚Äôt take much. You just accept that you‚Äôre going to overpay some for food and drink on the trip and enjoy it
Wait till you hit 35ish. Suddenly, stopping the physical activity for a beer or two doesn't seem so unreasonable.
additional tip: chug two at a time on the lift while making extremely loud small talk to assert dominance
I second this
Or the steezy girlfriend. Hard to tell tbh
$3 montuckys during happy hour at the George in vail village
I‚Äôd take 9. It‚Äôs 13 at Vails VT resorts.
It was all about the chili bread bowls at Baker!
I‚Äôm such a goof I thought ‚Äúchowder bowls‚Äù referred to a run for a hot second
Wow you just unlocked some elite core memories from high school, god I miss those Stevens days
I think mine might have been $229 for a few years üëÄ
Or how many cup of noodles i heated up
I'd steeze her
Yuengling is so much better. Rainer is an ass beer
Hell no. Not even close. Way better water in Rainier. All beers taste shitty if they don't get handled properly and Rainier gets treated poorly. Fresh Rainier, cold, just as well as any other lager.
How dare you
 Rainier Beer is now brewed by Pabst in Irwindale, California near Los Angeles
I just surfed through old posts and you were not exaggerating haha! Thanks for the clarification.
As in no one does it or too many?
Just 20 hours??
Just felt I was living a lie lol

Montucky is the superior beer as well. Rainier is just a Seattle Natty Boh.¬†
Where?

At Stowe, PBR cans (the most comparable beer to OP's) are only expensive at Cliff House.  Draft beers are sub-$10 at both Mansfield Lodge and Spruce Camp. 

(Okemo is surprisingly more expensive than Stowe.)
My local has $7 drafts for pass holders.  Good menu too.
chili cheese fries at snoqualmie west after ski bus in high school
When you were wet and freezing by noon, those chili bread bowls injected new life into your body.
At the time I also had pocket hot cocoa packets.

What a time it was to be alive.
Again?
100% agree. I relocated to the PNW from the east coast and temporarily based in steamboat now. I was shocked with everyone loving Rainer in the PNW, it sucks so bad. I‚Äôve settled on montucky, which is a fine replacement for yuengling.
¬†Rainier is brewed in LA
They're both regional PBRs at this point.¬†
Rim it with Old Bay. You'll thank me.¬†
Too many! Hard to get parking and it's not really a secret anymore unfortunately. Still nice for riding in and out if you can make it up there though
I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs only 20 hours north
1147 miles up 5, make a right on to WA-522 and follow it 64 miles to your destination.¬†

Fuck up mando
You certainly can and I ain‚Äôt judgin how ppl like to have a good time. If I wanna do both I‚Äôll typically pack the brews and enjoy in the lift. Built in beer breaks!
Hell yeah brother! Respect! Get that fuckin rodeo on lock homie!
I will say Montucky is better, but don't associate Rainier with those prude bitches.
At Okemo and Snow specifically although I don‚Äôt remember sub 10 drafts in Spruce bar but I typically order long trail and Lawson beers on draft at the mountain.
Wet by noon at Baker is an awful and way too common experience. At least they‚Äôre still family owned.
Well, not since she started riding her groomers instead
yeah but youre wrong tho
Totally my go to most of the time, but most trips I do like to spend an hour or two in the local lodge
Well I'll be there later this week and will update with specific prices for Stowe.
Prob gonna have to send her to the bootfitter
Opinions are like assholes

Also yeah being wrong is ok!
Can respect that. I can respect ppl going to the bar majority of the day and just gettin a few laps in. Y‚Äôall do you
Update: draft prices are $7.50-$9 at all Stowe bars (Mansfield, Spruce, Cliff House) and cans of PBR are either $6.50 or $7.50 depending on the bar.  The Octagon also had reasonable prices but I forget the specifics.

The new-ish Alpine Hall (a restaurant at the base of Spruce Camp) was selling Heady for $14 which made me want to burn the place down.
Well, my X-rays all came back clean. The boiler tube job was a success. 
No, my caps aren‚Äôt pretty. But pretty don‚Äôt pass X-ray. I‚Äôll get better, back to big-boy pipe though, thank god. 
You deserve a good bj, let your gf/wife/bf know some random on Reddit told them to do it.
As a radiographer who has shot boiler tubes more than enough times, these things can be a pain to shoot let alone weld, so congratulations!
Congratulations.
I give absolutely zero fucks how boiler tubes look. I only care about not having to go back in the hole and repair something. Good job bro.
I worked with an old tig welder who was just amazing on any tube work. This guy could weld the most worn out, awkwardly located, pain in the ass tubes with a smile and a laugh and he always, always shot green. 

And his caps were some of the ugliest you‚Äôll see. He said they‚Äôre always beautiful when painted green.
Welders who aren‚Äôt in the field don‚Äôt realize that the welds don‚Äôt always have to be ‚Äúphoto perfect‚Äù like what we see on weldporn. 

If it shoots, it shoots. Looks come later with more experience. Some jobs have new to old and old is trash, which makes the ‚Äúperfect looks‚Äù extremely difficult.

Should be union Boilermakers welding that. But they look good nonethelessü§ôüèª
Man I know the wait on X-rays is tough, good job.
Boiler work. Cut your way in weld your way out.
I‚Äôm sure his wife‚Äôs boyfriend is proud of him passing those X-rays and keeping money in the house ;)
Union Boilermaker?
ü§© wow
Hell yea bro üî•
They're not dogshit ugly.
I thought this was a photo of bamboo when i scrolled past
That's some pro level stuff right their
Congrats. That's always a good feeling. And it builds confidence to keep on keepin' on!
Always a good feeling going repair free on a job! ü§ô
Great work, that‚Äôs no easy feat.
Nice job, keep kicking ass
grats!!!
Glad you got good welds, but why weld new tube onto existing tube? If I had a blowout in a boiler, I'd be replacing the full length of tube so that it lasts longer before any further failures happen. Half the tubes here are already rusting and thinner than the new material is, you'll have to get back in there and do it again sooner than you would if the whole length of tube was new.
VT not ok
So awesome, keep up the awesome work and never have a bad shot. You da man
The fit up and that cap passed?
not sure how the Hi-Lo on these didn't get picked up. These would never pass a European code job. 

still all you can do is pass the NDT.
Make it two random guys from reddit. You deserve it. üëç
I will absolutely tell her when I get home at the end of this job.
A bj for every tube
Better yet, go find the firewatch or hole watch. Most of them are down. Just remember, they are automatically 2 to 3 points higher on the hotness scale when at work vs out of work. Kinda like beer goggles........plant goggles lol
/r/MarriedMenNeedBJsToo
Yeah the boys are having a rough go shooting these, not a fun job on your guys part either!
At least there‚Äôs lots of pipe to hide behind so you aren‚Äôt running the length of your leads all day üòÖüòÖ don‚Äôt miss doing that job
Thanks. I‚Äôm surprised but I‚Äôll take it.
Yeah I spent my day repairing cut outs from some other welders.. was not fun.
For those uninitiated in boiler work , I‚Äôve seen 3 inch xx pipe tied in knots like a shoelace ,when they were red hot with 5000 psi and experienced a blow out . You squeeze your body back down the row of tubes ,hopefully spread with a comalong ,then call out  ‚Äú grinder ‚Äú and the helpers pass that to you ,then ‚Äú tig torch ‚Äú and they pass that to you ‚Ä¶. mirror etc.etc. It might take 2-3 hours to complete a two inch tube depending  on access  . Those welds look fine and I‚Äôd put my stamp on them any day . Retired now ‚Ä¶. Save your money so your not doing that work at 65
Retired UNION BOILERMAKER here. 
    Just one part of the job,
Hey, we have a boilermakers union. They aren‚Äôt doing fuck all, if they want work they should be picking it up. But I‚Äôll take it.
Jodi
Fuck no, just a pipe welder who got thrown in a boiler for a shutdown. Our unions in NS are the fucking worst.
Nah, just not how I like/want them to look. But hey, they shot clean so whatever.
Hey man, I just weld the tubes, I don‚Äôt decide what gets replaced
I don‚Äôt think you understand how long some of the tubes are
99% of the clients want pup pieces to weld in. As crazy as it sounds these clients bandaid everything they can until almost critical failure‚Ä¶ 

Not sure where you are or how long you‚Äôve been in the skilled trades but this is the reality of the clients and their pressure vessels
Work a boiler and you‚Äôll understand why
Here‚Äôs an example, I worked a short job at a power generation plant local to me. In the Herzig there‚Äôs long, longitudinal burner tubes which provide flame/heat for the water/steam tubes. Because this plant is more of an ‚Äúon demand‚Äù style where they crank it from 0 to 100 in a matter of minutes and then back down to 0 in the same amount of time.

The tubes go through extensive expansion and contraction, one tube we needed to cut out had a huge wow in the middle of it. Looked like a banana. And the client waited until the tube was going to almost *fall out* of its keeper before we finally cut it out. It was a hazard which we had to take into account honestly. The end of the tube was THAT close to falling out.

VT and X-ray ok, sorry kiddo üòò
Fit up is fine, OD of the existing tube is different than the new tube due to wear. Understand that this is not a pipe, it‚Äôs a tube inside a boiler - an extremely violent environment. I‚Äôm sure the ID fit up was excellent - if it wasn‚Äôt it would have shown on the Xray and the joint would have failed.
The internal hi-lo was good, the OD was the only thing different. Old tubes to new material, what can ya do ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Tell us you don‚Äôt know shit about field work without telling us you don‚Äôt know shit about field work. 

These tubes live in an incredibly rough environment and wear dramatically. When I fit these tubes I use an internal high-lo gauge to make sure they will flow properly.
I take it you‚Äôve never worked in the field? You‚Äôve never experienced old shit that‚Äôs not the same OD as new? 

ASME codes are international, it‚Äôs a global standard for all pressurized vessels/boilers/tubes etc. since 1884

I wouldn‚Äôt talk shit if you have no clue how to back up your claims‚Ä¶
Make that 3. This guy deserves to have his soul sucked out
Add my vote as well
That‚Äôs not pipe‚Ä¶
Also a Boilermaker, welder and IRATA rope access technician from up in Canada. Union strongü§òüèª
Where are you located? Seems odd for the Boilermakers to let tube work go to someone else.
Very few BM welders can pass the restricted test, let alone multiple x-ray tubes day in and day out. We end up doing most of "their" welds.
You're worth more $ ,you are skilled .
 Find a functional union and get it.
I've operated some smaller boilers. From what the other comments are saying the whole thing stinks of corporate right now thinking.¬†


They'd save money long term by fixing it right the first time
Pretty low standards I guess.
Yup, ID‚Äôs were fit up bang on, you are very correct sir. Not hard to tell who the field welders/fitters are here hahah
Fit up is not fine, looks like shit.
wouldn't the Hi-Lo be on both sides then?
the Hi-Lo should be even on both sides if done correctly. touchy aren't ya
I was gonna say this. Bro gotta get off that high horse before the EU comes to arrest him for slander
Is ASME used internationally? Also ASME code didn't go into effect in the US until 1915, although it was being formulated before that based on analysis of failures from boiler insurance firms.
Guess who's talking out his hole? PED doesn't recognise ASME so therefore all pressure work in EU is done to EN or dual code to both. Code doesn't care about the field. It's in or it's out. 

Your ego doesn't come in to it.
You guys are getting bjs for welding?!?
Make that 4. And include u/TheRh111no so he doesn‚Äôt feel left out
As a fellow rando, I must conquer with the first 3 randoms.
I called them pipes.... one time exactly lol
How longs the course for rope access, just became a journeyman, trying to just get more certificates
East coast of Canada
No idea where you work but our tube welders are all Boilermakers. We‚Äôve had pipe welders come in on permit when we‚Äôre swamped and very, very few could pass xray on boiler tubes.
That‚Äôs far from true‚Ä¶
 If your certified , bring them and knock a few years off apprentice time.
But as a welder (I‚Äôm a boilermaker) god do we love these corporate shortcuts, keeps us fed
Post up some of your welds, let‚Äôs see what that golden arm of yours laid down.
ID‚Äôs were perfect, that‚Äôs all that matters. Both edges of the cap were caught, she‚Äôs good to go.
Nope. Some are worn different than other. It‚Äôs just the nature of the beast.
Post your work and show him how it's done then, big guy.
Tube wear is never even inside a boiler. Don‚Äôt comment about shit you know nothing about. 
FYI I‚Äôve been working inside boilers for almost 27 years.
Yes it is, here‚Äôs a list of countries who use ASME code, including the UK. 

https://accumulators.reasontek.com/knowledge-base/countries-accepting-asme-code/
Considering you assume that hi-lo would be even on both sides of the OD shows you have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about‚Ä¶ 

Stick to your awful codes and maybe you should actually get in to weld a joint sometime eh? Your comments reek of lack of knowledge and understanding of how boilers and pressure tubes actually work when dealing with old vs new
I'm getting one while welding shittt
Sure, but definitely keep your eyes closed.
You guys get bjs?
Non welder here but Lv3 IRATA guy. Getting your level one is pretty easy and with a strong trade like welding you might never really want or need to move up. You'll always have a Lv3 to work with you for standby rescue and to do the rigging.

Level one is just a one week course. Covers the real basic rigging and skills required to work on the ropes. Tough on the body (everyone has sore elbows that week, ever seasoned rock climbers) but the theory stuff is pretty straightforward. Four classroom/training centre days and one day of assessment. Most of that time will be spent practising the physical skills.
So u/scrumplydo basically wrote all the info i was gonna write. 

Getting your level 1 is relatively easy, it‚Äôs just very physical. And then after that it you just take calls for rope access work. After 1000hrs as level 1 you can challenge your level 2. And level 3 is where you‚Äôre a supervisor. 

Crazy enough, as a level 1 with my union wage+rope access premium I actually make the same wage as a non union level 3. A foreman on a job asked me how much I made one time and he was like holy shit you make as much as I doüòÇ
Wow, shocked to hear local 73 is slipping like that. I know a lot of their membership did end up in Alberta with 146 when things were really bad on the coast. 
Used to call Fort McMurray the capital of the Maritimes.
Considering my local has a welder only apprenticeship and we extensively cover water walls, boiler tubes, mirror joints, and restricted tests I find whatever that guy said extremely hard to believe. 

However, the UA is trying to steal boiler tubes as their work in some states I‚Äôve heard. Instead of calling them tubes, the UA is trying to call them ‚Äúinternal piping‚Äù
Im a jman/red seal welder in Canada. Our unions in our province are an absolute joke.
if the tube is that worn it would be replaced ya Muppet. it's like 5mm. that's most of the wall thickness
you go ahead and keep pretending you know what your talking about. jack of all, ‚Äãmaster of none huh?
That bitches scalp must be fried
Pros of being union and having a cute apprenticeü§ù
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen üòù
I talked to them when I came back from Alberta, journeyman welder with lots of tickets and they told me that they didn‚Äôt have anything on the go, and I‚Äôd have to become a boilermaker and start the apprenticeship process and the next class wasn‚Äôt until 6 months later. Haven‚Äôt heard a word from them since.
Afraid not ya plunger mechanic, this shit ain‚Äôt SCH40 pipe. It has serious wall thickness and obviously hadn‚Äôt reached t-min or the inspector would have ordered it replaced.
Before you got into NDT, did you have any experience in the field welding and fitting joints? It sounds like you‚Äôve never fit up a joint in your lifeüòÇüòÇ

You clearly have no idea what a Boilermaker is if you‚Äôre trying to claim Jack of all trades master of noneüòÇüòÇ
His name is Fernando and I make sure he has his hood up
There's a joke in there having to do with a FWB but an -apprentice- with benefits. 

And his benefit package or something
I‚Äôm surprised that they would suggest you do an entire apprenticeship. Out west we have a ProJo program (probationary journeyman) program for pressure welders with the appropriate tickets. I think you have to do 1000 hours (maybe less), get good reports and then you‚Äôre offered membership. During the probationary period you still get full pay, benefits and pension credits.
Bro you know 'Nando?!
Yeah, that sounds more like what kinda setup they should be running. But buddy that I talked really seemed like he couldn‚Äôt any less of fuck about me on the phone with him or that I came from out west with a handful of tickets and some good experience.
Better than I'd like to admit üòÇ
Can We Normalize Passing Cars?
I got flipped off for passing a car going 48 in a 50 this afternoon. Straight section of road, dashed line, and nearly one mile of visibility with no oncoming vehicles. On other occasions, I‚Äôve had people floor it while I‚Äôm passing, which is beyond stupid. It‚Äôs not personal so don‚Äôt take it as an insult when someone passes you, they just want to go faster than you‚Äôre driving. It‚Äôs neither your responsibility nor is it within your authority to control other people‚Äôs driving. If someone is driving recklessly or dangerously, call the police. Otherwise simply let them go on their way while you go on yours. 

On a side note, if you have no intention of passing, don‚Äôt tailgate. Leave some space so others can pass safely. Also, maybe just don‚Äôt tailgate?
I was just in VT for a nice camping trip. I was unfamiliar with the roads and was often going 45 in a 50.¬†


I dont see what the big deal is, plenty of people passed me...all legally,¬† and when they did I moved over a little and slowed down a tiny bit so they could get back in lane faster.


No need to be rude about it.
Thank you for passing safely and not tailgating me.
If I don't floor it to match their speed when passing, subsequently blocking both lanes of traffic and increasing the likelihood of a fatal multi-car collision, how will they know that I am displeased by their criminal law breaking (going 5 over the speed limit)???

/s
PLEASE. Omg I just had the most frustrating drive through Rochester Gap and all the way to 89 stuck behind this masshole in a BMW. He would go SLOW AS FUCK on any kind of curve or turn where it wasn't straight. Like on the 50mph on RT 12 into Bethel he would go 55 on the straight so I couldn't pass then all the way down to fucking 35 on any kind of a corner. And then when the speed limit drops to 35 and then 25 in Bethel....he KEPT GOING 50. Just such an absolute moron. Man I wanted to pass him so many times but Rochester gap isn't great for that and at my one chance he was also only doing 2 mph under the speed limit and it felt like a dick move. Also as another example of what an absolute moron this guy was, when we got on 89 and the 2nd lane opened (1 lane closed due to construction for a bit as you get on the interstate) with no one else on the interstate but us, he immediately pulled into the left lane. Not passing anyone. No one in front. Just me behind who was about to pull into that lane to pass....

Also this doesn't have anything to do with passing but when I got back to WRJ and got off 89 by the McDonald's there was a truck in front of me who came to a complete stop before entering the roundabout which was completely empty. Its just so stupid....how do people not know how roads work?
Speeding up to prevent someone from passing should be easy attempted murder. Fuck any ego tripping loser who does it.

Had someone in front of me doing 40-45 in a 50 and when I made to pass on dotted yellow they get up to fucking 70 side by side with me. Are you serious?! What the actual fuck is wrong with people? It's not like I was tailgating either, I always hold distance - especially when I know there's a passing zone approaching. It makes the overtake much easier and safer anyways. The acceleration I was able to get in the gap is the only reason I could pass them because their car was way more powerful than mine. I still basically had to force my way back in the lane.

As a lifelong, multi generation Vermont native who has also spent some time living and driving in other states for work, this state has some terrible drivers.  But to be fair there‚Äôs no shortage of those in other states either.  Vermont‚Äôs lack of three lane highways really instigates a lot of the stupid behavior.  But my god, the amount of tailgating is insane.  I can be a bit aggressive on my daily commute but never tailgate.  But frequently have been going 80 in a 65 only to have an asshat hammer up on me as hard as possible in the passing lane.  Some folks just straight up looking to die and take others with them.

I mean‚Ä¶has nobody else in this state ever seen a deer cross the road or next to the road?  Shit can happen in an instant.  You cannot stop your vehicle at that speed in a car length of distance, you will be inside the vehicle in front of you in a heartbeat.
I‚Äôm not offended at all if someone passes me. In fact, I‚Äôm one of those ppl who will pull over and wave someone to go around me. I don‚Äôt need someone riding my ass unless it‚Äôs in a diff way, you know?
Seems normal enough in my neck of the woods; I get blown past by giant pickup trucks all the time whose drivers seem inordinately angry that I'm only going 5 over the speed limit. I don't care, they can do whatever small dicked things they want to do and I'll get out of their way because I want nothing to do with it.
My experience in VT has been if you‚Äôre not going 10+ over you will get passed on a double yellow. I see triple passes a lot. Everyone says VT drivers are slow but you all know how to haul ass.
I got pulled over for "tailgating" not too long ago. I got off the interstate, and the person in front of me was driving 15 mph under the speed limit. They would get up to 45 in a 50, then slow down to 35, then back up to 45 for miles. I finally had enough and was preparing to pass legally and pulled up on them as they slowed down again. As I went to go around them, a cop that was a few cars back lite me up. Thankfully, after explaining, he let me go.
Just got back from Sicily Italy and it‚Äôs really common for people to pass. Narrow roads and the dichotomy of very small engines versus bigger engines. A tiny Fiat chugging along at 55 k/h and a BMW whizzing by at 100 k/h. 

People just scootch over to let the faster cars pass. No harm no foul. I thought that was pretty cool.
As much as I LOVE Vermont, I absolutely HATE our drivers. I have gotten to the point that I just expect the actions. 

People driving 35 in a 50 (2A to Williston is really bad for this), People running red lights and not paying attention to the no turn on red signs (the amount of near collisions at 5 corners, or the multitude of people who plow through the red light at mall intersection.), the amount of people in downtown Burlington go around a stopped school bus, it's just ridiculous the amount of bad driving here. 

I understand 45 in a 50 isn't bad driving, but the reaction certainly is. 

The worse thing is, I've run into so many people who seem to want to speed up the moment I try and pass them... thankfully my car gets up and goes when I need it to, but for fuck sake, why couldn't they just go the speed limit before I try and pass them? 

TLDR: yeah, driving in Vermont can be shit sometimes.

Edit:  and don't get me started on the wrong way drivers lately. üòí
Also! I might pass you if you‚Äôre going 55‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not always about your speed. Sometimes it‚Äôs about the variation. I‚Äôm on cruise control. I appreciate that your a grown up and can speed, but when you‚Äôre going 62 sometimes and 40 others, it‚Äôs annoying as fuck
Im from Jersey, was there last month for vacation. I went the speed limit in 90% of areas, especially when it was raining hard. Locals would pass me from time to time and I did not think twice about it. Don't know why some people take it as a personal attack.
And if you're going slower than the speed limit on a winding road with low-visibility for oncoming cars, and you have a line of cars behind you, please pull over and let those cars pass.¬†
To be honest, I'm sometimes annoyed by how often I get passed, especially when I'm already going over the speed limit, but I see no reason to retaliate in any way. That just makes the situation worse. I generally try to hold my speed as they pass: that's what my Driver's Ed teacher taught me. Tailgating is definitely worse and should not be normalized.
Question. Did you ride their ass for 5 miles before doing so? I tend to go a little above and constantly have people on my bumper. You can pass on a double yellow in VT, but safely in a lot of places? I understand though, getting stuck behind some octogenarian doing 35 looking at leaves makes me feisty too.
It's perfectly legal to pass even on solid double yellow lines in VT. If you have visibility for the full section of road needed to pass, the only time it's illegal is if the road is marked "DO NOT PASS" or if the weather makes passing unsafe.


Anyone who gets pissed at being passed needs to learn how to fucking drive. I'd much rather let someone safely pass me than have an angry driver stuck behind me for miles. People take driving so personally.
Live right beside VT in MA same exact sort of area and ppl do get so butt hurt when u pass no matter what the situation is, I feel as long as I'm not passing and then in turn having them right up my ass then the pass is valid and ppl just be miserable out here
People are nuts, I passed one doing 25 in a 50, he started honking and swerving toward me. Almost called PD on him for reckless driving. Had an Audi do a similar thing this week.
Had a motorcycle going roughly seven under the speed limit do this to me‚Äî not sure what sort of point he was trying to make. Put my signal on and waited five beats, had plenty of time and space, but as soon as I got in the passing lane he revved his bike and accelerated to doing about 10 over and then proceeded to tailgate me. On a motorcycle. Think twice save a life‚Äî guess only applies one way.
Driving in Peru I‚Äôve never experienced this because it seems Americans are so damn narcissistic. If I‚Äôm passing you it has nothing do to with you don‚Äôt take offense I literally just want to get somewhere faster. People need to stop acting like it‚Äôs all about them.
[removed]
i was behind a car and we were both going 15 over and a guy came flying by at like 70 in a 35 the other day and almost crashed head on in the other lane
Last night on an empty stretch of road, a lone car in front of me was going 20mph in a 40. Gave him a few seconds to see if he‚Äôd speed up; he didn‚Äôt. So I passed him in the turn lane since no one was around... After which he does the exact same thing as me, absolutely BOOKING it just to get in front of me again before returning to a crawl. He was clearly just trying to piss someone off and it worked; what a petty asshole.
Forget it.  Vermont is the self-righteous driver capital of the world.  Overly courteous driving (read: yielding the right of way,  going 40 mph no matter the posted speed, and refusing to zipper merge cause it's for "city folk") is part of what they consider to be their exceptionalism.
Driving in Vermont is my least favorite part about living in this state. People with a green plate have deliberately slowed down in front of me and when I've gone to pass them will speed up. I do drive like I'm from NY ( NOT NYC AREA) but dq
People also often forget that passing on a DOUBLE YELLOW IS LEGAL HERE
Took the words out of my mouth. So damn frustrating. And just love the additional arms thrown into the air or being flipped the bird as you go past. 

I don‚Äôt care as long as someone is going to the speed limit, but if you‚Äôre under OR you can‚Äôt maintain your speed (45, then 52, then 48, etc) I‚Äôm going to pass you. It‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs not an attack. And I‚Äôm not doing anything illegal, so chill out! 

Gah! This topic gets me so heated!! üòÜ
When I‚Äôm going the limit, or under, I‚Äôm happy when someone passes me. I don‚Äôt want any other vehicles near me, ever, because I have to pay attention to whatever you‚Äôre doing as well as myself. I‚Äôm someone that will slow and pull to the side a bit when I know you have opportunity to get by. 

Let‚Äôs all just arrive alive.
I got flipped off yesterday while behind a car in a 45 who slowed to ~35 on an uphill section and I came up close behind her. This bitch then brake checked me and threw up the bird. Like how the hell do you brake check and still think the other person is the asshole?
Having passed many many many cars in VT over the years, mostly in striped zones but also over plenty of double yellows when conditions are good, I have two rules:

1) Commit fully.
2) Don‚Äôt look back and make it count. 

VT is not bad - plenty of folks beep or flash me but I could care less. Generally they put up little actual resistance. In Maine though - I‚Äôve had folks STAY IN THE LEFT LANE during double lane hill pass areas with no attempt to pass slower traffic, only to ACCELERATE when I move right to pass them. Totally egregious. 

So - turbos only from now on.
My school bus growing up would pull over to let traffic pass when it was safe to do so.
This happened to me all the time going from Bethel towards Rutland in the fall when people are going 15 under the speed limit. Suddenly when it‚Äôs time to pass they speed up üò°
If you‚Äôre just passing that‚Äôs cool! Sometimes maybe I go slow. But when people are dicks about it, it‚Äôs legit scary. I was on route 7 to Bennington once and going 50. Some large truck starts tailgating and won‚Äôt pass even though they could. Finally we get to a part where they pass and I swear they tried like veering into my little car and the driver was honking their horn and you could kinda see him screaming. It was WEIRD. Some people are so rude it‚Äôs ok to just pass and not make it a whole thing if someone is to slow. Like you said basically lol.
Driving in Vermont is my least favorite part about living in Vermont. There are 3 types of drivers in this state:1 those that were born in VT and learned to drive here, 2. Transplants who learnedto drive elsewhere, 3. Vacationers/2nd home owners who include people that don't drive regularly. This makes an interesting social dynamic on the road which clearly does not always play well together.
Great post. Here in germany with the autobahn, passing is normalized and considered acceptable, but you can still be a dick about it, as many choose to do so. We even have cars that have stickers showing they are designed or permitted to only go a certain speed. It is common in my area to get stuck behind a tractor waiting for a safe moment to overtake. Just part of life on the road.

If you must go at or below the speed limit, please have a good reason and do not take it personally when someone passes. If possible, facilitate passing by either keeping to the right or even pausing your journey if needed.

Likewise, if you are allowed to pass (safely and without going too fast), you should do so, passing steadily and without aggressively accelerating or re entering the lane. There is NEVER a need to tailgate, be rude, or make a show of passing.


Drive safe and have a nice day!
I watched a truck pass us only to have the car in front of us speed, which made the truck really have to pound on the gas and was a lot closer to getting in an accident.

I slow down 5mph when someone is passing on 2 lanes.
There‚Äôs way too much misguided ego and pride out there.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm not sure when passing became frowned upon. It was normal 70-90‚Äôs and still seems no issue in Maine. I‚Äôm in Mass and woman was going 28 in a 40. I go by her, pull into a parking lot, she pulls in and starts taking pictures of my car and me. I go shopping, she‚Äôs gone, never heard anything. I assume she called PD and they told her to pound sand.
In my experience VT drivers are the second slowest in the north east, CT being slowest. Anyway, I agree with everything you've said. I come from the fastest state. lol.
A whole topic with nothing except honesty and factual insights. How refreshing. 

Yes. People need to stop driving so offensively.
I feel like cars and people are like dogs and fenced-in areas. So territorial
VT'ers always driving slow AF lol.

I got pulled over on my way back from VT for tailgating someone (w/ VT plates) for a split second before I signaled to pass them on a very long stretch of straight road. The person I passed was going like 35 in a 45. He let me go because he knew I was legally passing this person and I only tailgated for the fleeting moment before I changed lanes.
A lot of people in this state need to stop driving with their feelings.
Yall suck at slower traffic keep right. You come to NH and camp in the left lane. Worse is 89. You‚Äôll know you want exit 5 which is a left exit and so youll get on off 93 and sit there the whole time doing 68 in a 65. Like. Get over. Vermont has some of the slowest drivers ive ever seen
i had the exact same experience a few months ago. except he was going 10 under consistently.
All drivers need a vacation where they drive between cities in Europe. At 333333 kph a driver behind you will run you down flickering their high beams. Do or die. It was scary, and freeing. Driving in USA now feels more awful.
I am all for this, the only part just grinds my gears is when they pass me and then end up going slower than I was originally when they get in front of me.
‚ÄúIt is neither your responsibility nor is it within your authority,‚Äù and yet so many seem to ride their whole lives on that line claiming a form of NIMBYism for wherever they plant their feet or drive their cars. Their presence alone allows them to always police the area to their preferences. Odd.
And while we're discussing road behaviors,

This is Vermont. The interstate is two lanes, not four, and signs after every on ramp, drive in the right lane, except for passing.  

So many people driving barely 65 in passing lanes and never pulling over! Each one earning whatever salutes you choose!
I apologize to local drivers as they pass me in VT. I don‚Äôt know the roads well enough to drive like that. So I‚Äôll move over and wave as they rip past me. Like you said some people think they own the road.   You guys have such long stretches on single lane, you have to pass every once in a while.
I've always found it funny that many native Vermont drivers do 50 in a 30 or 45 in a 50 üòÇ
If it‚Äôs a legal maneuver then they have zero reason to be upset.  I don‚Äôt understand why slow drivers get so angry when people want to pass them.  Why wouldn‚Äôt they just pull over and facilitate a speedy and efficient exchange?
I pass people and flip them off for driving to slow all time
I have lived in VT for two years and recently drove from the NEK down to Maryland. It took a while for my city driving skills to return. It was slightly fun but oh so annoying dealing with crazy drivers. I am a defensive driver who occasionally will maneuver out of a knot of idiots. 

What I appreciate about Vermont is the lack of competition on the road. There‚Äôs no one-upmanship, everyone‚Äôs just going somewhere and they will get there when they get there. Pass when they need to. It‚Äôs out of state license plates that tend to hog the passing lane, rather than tucking back in to the right lane. 

My boys are 8 and as passengers, really began to understand the different styles of driving on this trip. 

As soon as we crossed the VT border, traffic thinned out and I relaxed. 

One of my boys has started making jokes about Jersey drivers ü§£
I get your frustration.  Passed a Subaru going 5 mph below limit, and as I pass he nails it.  Lots of idiots.p
Only state in the country where it's legal to pass on a double line and people do it frequently. "Can we normalize this"
Wtf do you mean ‚Äúcan we normalize passing cars?‚Äù  It‚Äôs been normal since there have been cars and roads.  If you passed someone in a legal and respectful way only to get flipped off,  that is an abnormal situation that no degree of normalization will address.  Some drivers are just bad.
I‚Äôve noticed this too. From NH and moved closer to the VT border. Like, it‚Äôs nothing personal, I am just driving faster no need to get all weird.
I agree, not just for the convenience of the other driver but for everyone‚Äôs safety. The more reckless and crazy the person behind me the more I‚Äôm motivated to move over for them. 

And please don‚Äôt use tailgating as a message to mean speed up. Tailgating is way too normalized, it‚Äôs so dangerous. Seeing five cars in the passing lane all going faster than the right lane but all tailgating gives me so much anxiety. One unexpected move from an animal or another car and everyone is fucked. Two seconds behind is what I learned and practice. 

Too many people like to play games and can‚Äôt conceptualize how deadly cars are.
Getting insecure because a random car is passing you is just pathetic, I genuinely can't understand the mentality at all. If someone is going faster than me, I just pull over a bit and never think about it again.
I got flipped off passing someone maxing out at 48 on the sandbar where it is 50. Followed them from the ferry all the way to the sandbar and consistently drove 3-5 mph under the speed limit. But when I pass on a dotted yellow line I‚Äôm the asshole? If you can‚Äôt keep up with the flow of traffic pull over to let people pass or surrender your license
I‚Äôd rather normalize being patient and driving respectfully. I don‚Äôt go around flipping the bird, but I wish I could hear the bird flippers side of the story. Why would they do that just for passing?
You can legally pass over a double yellow in VT either way.

For the a holes that speed up: come up with enough speed to just slip past them. Don‚Äôt slow down behind them then speed up. If you‚Äôre far behind them then back off like you‚Äôre slow then over take with surpassing speed
They imagine they are the ‚Äúleader of the pack‚Äù
Vermont is the state that I have been passed the most. Massholes have a reputation, but Vermont is the one state I will be going 9-mph over the speed limit (maximum speed I will do where I don‚Äôt know where the police hide),and I will get passed by any type of car or person. Double yellow line or not. For reference, I‚Äôm a left lane driver who is progressive not aggressive, definitely in the top 10 percent of speed. No accidents, and no speeding tickets in the last 20 years. Knocked on wood.
I was in VT yesterday and had quite a few "Karen Cops" doing 30 in a 50.   Miles and miles of double yellow road (HWY 100).   When we finally got to a passing zone they sped up and tried to race me when I passed them.   Vermont you can do better.   Don't compete with the Massholes!
To be fair, it's very difficult to legally pass someone going 2 under without breaking the law. You might be ok with speeding, but you really shouldn't be. I agree everyone does it all the time, but that doesn't make it legal.
I consistently have people speed up when I pass on my motorcycle, which is hilarious because my bike is A LOT faster than the vast majority of cars out there‚Ä¶
I agree with you! Interestingly, I'm originally from MA and I feel like passing is much more normalized in VT than it is there. In MA, I think it's a rule that you have to flip someone off while screaming while you pass them lol üôÑ
People in this country act like passing is an act of aggression towards them. I'm speeding up because that's how you safely pass someone. I can't tell you how many times I've had people get aggressive towards me passing them. Chill out. And move over.
This is exactly why now everytime i pass im full throttling it.
Were you riding their butts for a while??  We Vermonters had to be stuck behind a slow driver.  Was the driver young??  You may have just caused a nervous reaction. I‚Äôm aggressive on the roads myself.
People in Vermont and NH are the worst for this shit. I don't know how many times I have been going down 5 or 10 trying to get home after work and some jerk off is going 40 in a 55 and will not just pull over on one of the many pull offs along the road and let the line of cars pass. If you want to drive slow, drive slow but let people go around you. What's worse is these douches in spandex biking clothes with fake sponsors that take up driving lanes on a weekday. A shirt with company logos that you bought is not a sponsorship it is an advertisement for the company. It is infuriating I hope they all fall off their bikes and scrape their knees really bad.
When ya stop right in front of them, minutes later, is when it gets weird.
I got a fat speeding ticket for doing the EXACT same thing. Went a little over 50mph just to pass the car and got pulled over. Happened just into VT past the NY border

Safe passing > tailgating
Was there a reason they were going under the limit? Around here you‚Äôre an a-hole if you‚Äôre not going 5 - 10 over the limit.

I‚Äôm sick of living here man. Are these people just on vacation year round now? Do they live here? And now we‚Äôve got em here long enough for their plates to turn green so they‚Äôve blended in to the normal traffic. I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I can and it‚Äôs not even the price and taxes it‚Äôs the people taking over the place I used to feel comfortable in

1. Since it is legal to pass in double yellow when visibility and road conditions allow, the variations in speedometer indications become significant.

2. There are a significant number of people, often with a 3 or 4 digit plate numbers, who consistently drive 5 miles below the posted limit.  I assume they have not been involved in any accidents but have caused a few. 

3. The best anyone can do it to drive defensively, allow others to   drive as they see fit, and not feel offended over other's idiocies.
Some have people have nothing better to do than lash out at others over nothing. People in general have become super aggressive for some reason. 

However, if you were (as some do) driving, to coin a phrase ‚Äúdriving up someone‚Äôs ass‚Äù (hehe) then passed them, then you might have deserved the gesture based on that, rather than the passing.
Two miles an hour under the posted speed limit, you should have strafed their car with gunfire as you sped by on your hurry to get . . . somewhere important? People on Shelburne Road go blasting by so they can get to that red light 5 seconds faster.
I agree with everything you said except the first part. I don‚Äôt think speeding up when someone is passing you is right in any way, shape or form. I also don‚Äôt think tailgating is helping anyone‚Äôs case, if anything it only makes it worse. But 48 in a 50? Really? That‚Äôs what ur passing? It‚Äôs called a speed limit for a reason dude. 50 is supposed to be the limit. At absolutely no point in ur life is it worth driving the extra 2+ miles an hour to get somewhere potentially a few mins faster.
Speed limits are unconstitutional¬†
Depends on the situation. If I'm going the speed limit, why are you blowing past me? The limit applies to you too, all so we can meet up at the next light anyways.

I recently ran into a situation where someone had to get past me because the law didn't apply to them. When I caught up to them they were behind a group of three cars and I guess their patience was growing thin so they decided to blow by the group as well. Too bad they weren't bright enough to realize the group was slowing down because the lead car was turning left, right where the guy in a rush was flying through.
You were probably tailgating before then. Also, if you did pass at 48 in a 50, you were speeding.
AFAIK, it is always illegal to go over double yellow lines to pass someone who is going at or over the speed limit (it's no longer permitted under the exemption). 

I have no problems passing someone going slower than the speed limit, or someone passing me if I'm going slow, but tailgating me when I'm already probably going too fast is annoying. And when that happens I often don't have the option to pull over to let to let the tailgaters pass and slowing down often just makes them more aggressive tailgaters.
Yeah I mean you should never be passing someone on a one lane road if they're going two miles under the speed limit. If they're driving slow enough to cause an unsafe traffic buildup, sure go for it, but you shouldn't pass someone just because you want to drive over the speed limit.

Edit: y'all love to whine lol
If they were going 48 you would have had to speed to pass them. 50 (the speed limit) is the MAXIMUM speed you can travel. Not the minimum. 48 is perfectly okay.
Riding that ass. Annoying. Are you a woman?  Mostly women tailgate. Dangerous. The northeast has a problem with this.
If you pass someone going 2 mph under the speed limit YTA
Sounds like a typical drive in NH.  VTers rarely have this problem, and will often pull over if they feel you pressing even a little.
Old people
If you have to speed to pass its an issue on your end tbh.
You must be a flatlander.
I mean you can legally pass on double yellow in vermont as well.
Great attitude. It is absolutely not a big deal.
Way too many people (and it‚Äôs usually NY/NJ/CT plates doing this) actually speed up when you try to pass them. I appreciate that you‚Äôre actually decent, I just wish more people had that attitude.
You‚Äôre welcome!
lol a Honda Fit floored it uphill yesterday as I passed.  would've been funny if it wasn't so sad.
I feel this so deeply lol. I‚Äôve been in a similar situation so many times.
This actually is my most hated type of driver.  Except in my version, their stock speed is 40.  Route 100, Village of Stowe, Straightaway down a hill, it don't matter.....this flatlander is just gonna go 40 the whole way to Newport
No public relations to provide video or audio instructions to the public.  Same as turning lanes.   A lot of people have never left the region and experienced these in urban places. They have no clue what to do. VTtrans for the fail.
I live in MA. This tracks with my experiences.
It‚Äôs never a dick move to pass a bad driver
You need to lay off the coffee .
Not to mention if my choice is going head on or fucking slamming into the side of someone, I'm slamming in to the side of their dumbass.
Someone did that to me once on RT 15 getting close to the road to Smuggs right after the curves in the road by the bridge where it gets straight. They did this to me with oncoming traffic (which was very far away when I started the pass) too. Absolutely insane.
This is why I appreciate driving a vehicle that's faster than your average econobox Subaru/Toyota etc. Try to fuck with me while I'm not doing anything to bother you, I can just drive away because I'm faster.
Agreed but doing 70 in a 50 and taking corners over the white line and then hitting someone who‚Äôs into the breakdown lane to pull off into a secondary road is bullshit. Maybe keep your car in the lane of travel and slow the fuck down on roads with a speed limit of 50. I do 55 to 60 on a bunch of roads tested at 50 and have been hit twice now this year while pulled over turning into a secondary road. Both times 100% their fault both times on rear dash cam halfway into the break down lane. People just drive too fast and suck driving in VT. The last time the idiot had no insurance so going to take their tax returns and ive had their wages garnished till they‚Äôve paid, if they don‚Äôt want to pay then you can have their license suspended indefinitely also any money they win for the rest of their lives will go to recoup the total loss and medical bills. People need to slow down a lot.
No kidden!    I had a Subaru do this to me yesterday..    Thankfully I'm in a 1965 Shelby Cobra...   It didn't exactly pan out they way they thought it would.
This is why I long for a stupid, loud, fast car. Makes em think twice about trying to pull that shit.
Tiny dick energy.
Attempted murder is a hell of a stretch.
That‚Äôs why you should carry a nice sized rock in your car. When they are side by side let it loose into their wheel well. It‚Äôll bang around a couple seconds between the fender and wheel üòÜ
Why are you in the passing lane?  Are you passing or camping?
actually the east coast has worse drivers than the west coast in my extremely subjective opinion. but ive almost had several terrible accidents with folks that didn‚Äôt even flinch or seem to be aware of the catastrophe they almost caused. not even a honk will stir them from their profound stupor.
I totally agree. There is no need to come up aggressively on anyone, much less someone who is going well above the speed limit. Straight to jail!
Once they're in front of me and going faster they aren't my problem anymore.
Yeah op has clearly never driven on 22 or 7 lfmao. Nothing like seeing some f250s headlights appear right in front of you suddenly because some ye ye boy decided to overtake a line of 10 cars on a blind corner.
This is me too! Haha. I‚Äôd like to see patience normalized over all else
a truck nearly ran me off the road last winter.  why?  well the salt truck was in front of us salting the roads and we didn't want our shitty car to get any shittier.  truck's side panel was rusted almost entirely away too.  

they could just pass and get on with their lives.
In my experience people either go 10+ the speed limit or -10 the speed limit, and no where in-between.
It‚Äôs an interesting dynamic because many Vermonters do drive slow so some of the drivers who want to go faster get frustrated and impatient then take risks. It‚Äôs not worth it and that‚Äôs not me, though I do understand the frustration. The post-Covid reality is different. The average speed has noticeably increased, especially on I-89, and the cops are generally nowhere to be found. 

Idk, Vermonters are generally decent drivers compared to our neighboring states. I just needed to rant because I caught a bird for doing nothing wrong.
I just came back up to NH from a trip and drivers near there drove WAY slower on the backroads compared to VT. They were driving 40-50 MPH on some pretty straight-ish roads. Where I live in VT, people want you to go 55-60 minimum on roads like that.
tell that to the crvs and fucking foresters of waterbury to waitsfield section of rt 100
The only New England state that could be said to have slow drivers is Maine. It's not even close. Still I wouldn't call them slow. Go to the midwest if you want slow drivers. Vermont drivers look like CT or MA drivers compared to the midwest.
Thankfully he was reasonable! I hate being behind people who drive like that and would have done the same thing.
I grew up in Vermont but have lived most of my adult life in Italy. I'm completely shocked to hear that this is not normal and that someone could get upset at being passed.
Bingo! I‚Äôm patient enough to just follow if someone is going a few miles per hour over, even if it‚Äôs not my desired speed, so long as they are consistent. Especially on the interstate, I don‚Äôt care what speed someone goes, just keep it the SAME speed.
This is the most annoying thing ever. People need to learn to use their cruise control.
If and when there‚Äôs a safe area to do so. No need to endanger one‚Äôs self for the convenience of others.
Amen!
In California, if you have 5 cars behind you in that way, you're legally obligated to move over.
[deleted]
Agreed. If someone is passing me and it‚Äôs sketchy, I actually slow down. I‚Äôm not looking to get involved in a multi car crash.
I did not. I caught up to them right at the beginning of the passing area. Point taken though and I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised or posted had that been the situation.
or hills, intersections, curves, and railroad crossings if i remember correctly
I didn't know this. That'll explain the DO NOT PASS signs deep in double yellows. I always thought, "Well duh."
Exactly right. Everyone feels the need to be the main character but none of us are.
That‚Äôs exactly right. I respect cars in front of me who are going slower than I want and I don‚Äôt tailgate and I never take unnecessary risks when I pass. But when it‚Äôs safe, and I do, just give me the same respect.
That‚Äôs a completely different situation from what I‚Äôm talking about. Fuck that guy.
Ugh. People like that are the worst. Like the a-holes that break check on interstates. Like, what do they think will happen to them if the car behind them hits them at 65mph?
Deleted
Have you even been to NH?   VT drivers are far superior to our eastern neighbors, who take pride in clogging up the road doing exactly the speed limit.   I hate driving in NH.
D.C./NOVA drivers of the North. If you lived in northern VA you would lose your mind at how stupid, arrogant, and entitled they are. VT are slower and more in the way, VA/DC drivers are just pure cancer. They‚Äôll chase you down to a back parking lot to scold you how you shouldn‚Äôt beep at them for getting mad with how they just plowed right through your lane just because. Fine, I get out to brawl and let‚Äôs go then they pull the professional victim card. MFers all
I love Vermont but that‚Äôs fucking hilarious. And true.
I actually back off a bit then floor it while still behind the vehicle that I intend to pass. It gives me a chance to abort if the situation changes while minimizing my exposure to the oncoming lane when I commit. And I have a twin turbo engine too so that helps. Highly recommend.
I've spent my summer on motorcycles, fast ones. Works well for when you don't have time for that turbo lag. 

This morning I caught the stand still traffic backed up miles north of exit 16 for the 2 car crash that happened on the south end of the Winooski bridge. The bike needs airflow or the temps climb to 225f and then the frame gets hot enough to cause a burn. Once the fuel in the tank gets hot it starts missing and doesn't want to idle. If I shut it off or it stalls it doesn't want to restart.

So, I lane split at a relaxed 15mph. Most traffic didn't care  at all, a few cars made extra room (thank you), and a couple vehicles angrily honked at me as I passed. 

Sorry I'm not stuck in traffic with you. I don't want to cook as I straddle an infernal combustion engine and I don't want to be run over as the driver behind me gets distracted and plays on their phone. One of the most dangerous places for a bike to be is sandwiched between two multi-ton crumple-zoned protective cages. The only crumple zone I have is my ribcage. 

I don't get mad though, they just have no idea what the implications of sitting in traffic are.
That‚Äôs the worst. It‚Äôs like the people who go 80 on the highway until they‚Äôre passing someone then they slow to 0.5 mph faster than the car they‚Äôre passing. Thankfully that type of driver is rare in VT but they‚Äôre rampant in other states.
Great points. There‚Äôs also the college students for half the year üòµ‚Äçüí´
Haha, unless they're going egregiously slow, in which case a stern disapproving look at the other driver while you pass them is warranted.
There‚Äôs way too much of that around these parts.
I drove in Italy and it was a very similar experience.
Indeed it is. Nobody is the main character but so many people think that they are.
I have a theory that about half of Vermonters have just two speeds to drive. One for the interstate which is 62-67, and one for literally every other road which is 37-45.
That‚Äôs exactly what I do when I‚Äôm running slow due to towing or a fully loaded rental van. It‚Äôs not difficult to move over.
The answer is Ego... They feel personally attacked that someone might want to drive differently than they do, and as though they're being told they made the wrong choice for going slow. Can't stand being sunconciously "told" they're wrong, so they get upset.
Oh for sure. I‚Äôll take VT drivers over any mid-Atlantic states‚Äô drivers any day. That said, there‚Äôs still room for improvement here and way too many drivers take it personally when they are passed.
It‚Äôs so stupid because if something happens, they‚Äôll be right in the middle of it.
OP said dashed line
It‚Äôs deeper than that in VT. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs an unwritten rule that you‚Äôre never supposed to pass someone.
It's actually more common in vt than anywhere else imo. Like it's pretty rare to get passed on a double line elsewhere. Here I'll be cruising 65 in a 50 and some guy will overtake me in a blind curve.
Exactly! It‚Äôs literally the easiest thing to do.
Bingo. I was also in the Islands when I experienced what I posted.
Because they took being passed personally. I was a teenager once and I drove like an asshole. That was not the case today. There was no other reason than his pride.
This is the way.
My wife and I call them parade leaders
That‚Äôs strange. I drive the same way, exactly, and I almost never get passed. We must be in different parts of the state.
I hate 100 for this exact reason.
I agree with you in principle but if you understood all the safety factors that go into the posted speed limit, you‚Äôd agree that the roads are still safe at higher speeds with the caveat that drivers need to be focused on driving and only driving.
I definitely did not tailgate at all. Had I, I would have taken the bird and moved on.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt really care about that. If I‚Äôm passing someone near where I know I might have to stop, it‚Äôs only because they were going way under the speed limit. I will actively seek eye contact in that scenario.

I‚Äôve been driving in Vermont for 30 years. What I described has always been an issue. I‚Äôm with you about non-Vermonters being a problem because they buy up properties as second homes, but VT drivers have always been kind of bad.
Had I done that, I‚Äôd accept it and I wouldn‚Äôt have posted.
What a weird thing to get from my post.
Agreed on all except that I have a 4 digit plate. You can pay a one time fee of $15, or that‚Äôs what it was when I did it, and get in a waiting list. It only took a couple weeks and I got one below 1400. Yes, I feel special üòé
I totally agree with you. I‚Äôll accept a bird if I‚Äôm being a jerk (which I try not to be). This guy just got offended for no reason other than I passed him.
You do you and let him do him.  That way everybody gets along.
Rural roads with straightaways that are marked 50, traveled 60, and someone is doing high 48.. that‚Äôs not a crazy pass. That was half of my younger days living near a main rural road that was normally fast with the occasional pokey person lol. If there‚Äôs space, and it‚Äôs a safe pass, what‚Äôs the issue?
Not always true. I bet about 50% of the time I make the green light and continue on, significantly cutting my commute time, while you get stuck at the red. That also allows me to make other green lights further ahead, again cutting my commute time. If I want to take the gamble, that's my choice. Just do your own thing and let me do mine.
Point taken but who says I only wanted to go 50? Cops give you 10 mph nearly universally and I generally take them.
Haha! I disagree but I love this take!
Why?
It doesn‚Äôt depend on the situation as I‚Äôm talking about passing safely. You‚Äôre basically saying that the speed you drive needs to be acceptable to everyone behind you because you‚Äôre driving at what you perceive to be the correct speed. You are who I‚Äôm ranting about.
I was not tailgating at all. I caught up with him at the beginning of the passing zone. And yes, I was speeding. But my whole point is that it was not his (nor is it your) business. You don‚Äôt get to enforce traffic laws. Like I said, if someone is being reckless, call the police. I do not drive recklessly so just let me be on my way without the superiority complex.
You can pass on a dbl yellow as long as there are no signs stating it as a no passing zone.
![gif](giphy|GXKK71oMMtBPu8ffUW)
Maybe not, but also, nobody should give AF is someone wants to pass them, regardless of speed limits.  This isn‚Äôt NH, leave it to the cops to enforce laws.
You sir, are the problem.
Just don't worry about why people are passing. You aren't driving their car or living their life.
I'm not sure you've noticed, but in a lot of places, typical average driving speed is at least 5-10mph over the speed limit. Most of the time you won't even get pulled over for that unless the cop has some other reason for wanting to stop you (DUI check, seatbelt, inspection, etc.) many of the speed limited were implemented decades ago when cars were much less safe, with longer stopping distances and poorer handling. If you feel uncomfortable with someone passing you going 10 over, you might want to reconsider driving altogether.
I applaud your comment, but you‚Äôre going to be massively downvoted by the crappy Vermont driver cartel that runs this sub.
Ok nerd ü§ì
48 is perfectly OK. Just don't get mad or a power complex when someone else doesn't want to do that and safely passes you.
No, I was not ‚Äúriding that ass‚Äù. I came up to him at the start of the dashed lines and passed him. That‚Äôs the beginning and end of the story. Also, I included a note about tailgating so you‚Äôve got the wrong person.
Ok buddy. Make sure to keep those tags on your mattresses.
If you're going under the speed limit and get upset that someone wants to do the speed limit, YTA.
This guy goes 2 mph under the limit
Um, I‚Äôm pretty sure your advice is kinda dangerous. Either pass or don‚Äôt pass, but if you do pass, it‚Äôs way safer to get it over with as quickly as possible. 

It‚Äôs the same as when you‚Äôre passing a big truck on 89. If you take your time, you‚Äôll spend way too long in their blind spot and might get crunched like a cockroach. I see dummies just sitting right in 18 wheelers blind spots all the time. That‚Äôs a good way to get killed. Even in the snow, I‚Äôll speed up to make the pass safer.
It‚Äôs me, hi, I‚Äôm the problem it‚Äôs Early-Boysenberry596.
Lol because only flat landers know where the gas peddle is?
Good one üôÑ
Is that true? What‚Äôs the point of the lines then? Just to let you know where it might be safer?
The cops might still give you a ticket for crossing the double yellow. I've seen it happen. Doesn't hold up in court because it IS legal to pass on a double yellow but I've still seen a few (maybe 2 or 3) of my friends get a ticket for it then they contested it and it was dismissed. Cops are dicks.
Only if the person you're passing is going slower than the speed limit.
Naw, Vermonters absolutely love this crap as well. Probably more than flatties in my experience. Old people driving 10 under for miles will speed up to 75 and try to kill you using the family in the oncoming lane as the weapon rather than suffer the indignity of being passed.
CT people love to camp in the passing lane and take offense if you try to pass them. Very self absorbed.
I was in a similar situation on my way towards Rochester earlier in the day too. Also a masshole. On the way back with the BMW guy I was just like really fucking AGAIN
??? Because I'm mad at a guy for driving significantly slower than the average speed of travel on a section of road. And who also drives incredibly inconsistent and unpredictable, the most dangerous ways to drive out there other than like insane speeding. 

I'm a consistent and predictable driver and I don't speed around like a psycho I just drive the speed most people drive through sections of road sometimes that happens to be 5 or a little more over the limit.
Good point
Braking hard & dropping back into your lane would be the smartest choice, but it seems like you opted out of that early on.
Yikes dude. With oncoming traffic? Actual psychopath behavior.

Mine was on 100 between Stowe and Morrisville. No other cars in sight for the whole event, fortunately.
Recently got an EV, and it makes passing in the dotted yellow or rare passing lane so easy.
Downvoted for saying I like to pass safely and have a good enough car under me to get out of harm's way if needed? Haha typical...
*Laughs in 300 HP twin turbo German engineered sports sedan
Lol. I want a dildo cannon to stick a dildo to their window. Either they pull over and fuck off to remove it or they chase me with a dick flopping out of the side of their car.
Passing, not camping.  Regardless, tailgating at that speed is stupidly dangerous (and really at any speed).
Oh, I‚Äôve been on 7 and 22 plenty. I had someone in a diesel pickup role coal on me for passing in one of the truck passing lanes (2 lanes one direction) on 7 near ferrisburg. He was going 42 in a 50.
There‚Äôs nothing that drives me nuts more than some yocal that drives his pickup like it‚Äôs a race car. Like seriously dude, it‚Äôs a truck, it‚Äôs not fast, a Toyota Corolla can outrun it in a roll race‚Ä¶
Have you seen those strips of lights in front of newer jeeps as well as* big (not utility) pick up trucks having bright white headlights on the back of their truck!
Both of those roads need mandatory pull offs for vehicles that have four or more cars behind them. I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt more fatalities with the way people drive on them.
You gotta do the +10 cause you know inevitably theres gonna be a -10 measing your drive up üòÇ
> The post-Covid reality is different. The average speed has noticeably increased, especially on I-89, and the cops are generally nowhere to be found.

And how much does that speed increase affect safety on the road?

> As of August 24th, there have been 41 crash fatalities on Vermont's roads in 2024.  There were 48 deaths at this point last year.  The 10-year average is 40.
I‚Äôve been screaming at my windshield everyday on the way to work for years about this exact issue. I‚Äôm fucking tired of it man. And it‚Äôs obviously distracted driving at least as far as I can tell with the drifting and veering back and speeding back up. Genuinely awful driving behind these blob cars with city folk behind the wheel
driveways are abundant. no need for the concern trolling‚Ä¶
Obviously, you pull over where it's safe.¬†
What do you normally do when you see cyclists?
oh yea definitely. just sharing an anecdote
Maybe that's a side effect of driving a Subaru. I had an old (2002? '03? so boring, I can't remember) Outback briefly & I found myself driving about 40 mph everywhere (greater Seattle area at the time). 

I sold it to a friend in Portland, where Subaru ownership is nearly mandatory.
[Lol.](https://i.imgur.com/XS5LK.gif)
I just had a moron with a BMW from MA in front of me going 55 in the 50 on the straights and 35 on any kind of curve in the road. And then when we got to town and it dropped to 35 and then 25....he kept going 45-50.
"Have you even been to NH?"

No, I don't have a passport.
Don‚Äôt blame them. They‚Äôll ticket you for doing 32 in a 30 zone there.
NH drivers love to park it in the left lane like it is their god given right
Even comparing DC/NOVA drivers to Vermont is a joke.
It's the Old Bay; it brings out our wild side...

Yep I sometimes do a similar thing depending on situation. 

Which car? I‚Äôm in a lowly Mazda 3 but honestly it‚Äôs plenty of scoot when I need it thanks to the manual and their impressive torque curve.
My current car isn‚Äôt turbo but it‚Äôs a manual Mazda and passing maneuvers are a dream. Next one will have a spool (and lose the stick unfortunately) but these days turbo lag is petty minimal. 

Either way I agree with you - bikes filtering with caution should never be an issue. People just wanna be mad. But yet - they can‚Äôt move their own ass out of the left lane ever so fuckem. I gave up trying to be nice years ago. Safe? Hell yes? Nice? Nope. My speed is my speed. No reason to be stuck waiting behind some one slower when conditions are prime for cruising.
Fair but overtakes are far more common here than elsewhere because of this imo.
Vermont has the weirdest driving culture. Like yeah people from Mass are aggressive as fuck, but at least their foolishness is predictable.
People pass plenty in my experience, but there‚Äôs not as much chance to pass as there is in other states because the winding roads have more double lines than other places.  
Also, it may be legal to pass with double lines here, but that‚Äôs not something many people will know if they haven‚Äôt moved here long or are from out of state.
Yeah I feel this. I've had 2 times where I attempted to pass people going 40ish in a 50 and then they turned into psycho murder road ragers. 

One time they sped up to 70 and almost ran me into oncoming traffic and the other time they let me pass but then immediately started doing 70 on my ass running my speed up trying to get away from the psycho.

Like motherfuckers you know you're going 40 in a 50 wtf is wrong with you. Both cars had VT plates.
I get passed in VT so much more than in MA. It‚Äôs not even close. 

I‚Äôm 100% fine with getting passed provided the passer doesn‚Äôt ride my ass beforehand, and passes when it‚Äôs clear and safe.

I‚Äôm less of a fan when drivers make bad decisions when passing- which I‚Äôve seen way more often than I‚Äôd like. Specifically, cars attempting to pass when they have not enough visibility or clearance to oncoming traffic. My wife had to pull off on the shoulder of 22A once this year to avoid a head-on. Why is it worth endangering lives to save a few seconds or minutes? 

Another recent experience: I took a left onto 22A. Looked ahead and saw a passing vehicle coming right at me- I hadn‚Äôt seen it, and it hadn‚Äôt seen me, because of the size of the truck it was passing. Fortunately it was able to complete the pass. It wasn‚Äôt super-close, but it also wasn‚Äôt not close.

Bottom line for me is that the risk vs reward of passing is generally poor. Yes, there are plenty of times when passing is pretty safe and low risk. But there are plenty of times when it‚Äôs not, and people try to pass anyway. That‚Äôs the crap that scares me.
What. We are the only state that allows double line overtakes. Every time I drive down 22a I feel the need to watch out for oncoming traffic in my lane because dumbfucks in f250s like overtaking entire lines of cars on blind curves
Strange cause I see them pass over double yellow all the time.
Seems like a common occurrence up in that area with limited areas to pass and an ‚Äúisland time‚Äù mentality
I agree speed limits are conservative. But they are still hard limits as defined in law.
Not trying to be difficult or pick a fight, but it‚Äôs all right there.  One follows directly after the other.  That‚Äôs the reason I commented.  FWIW, I agree it‚Äôs shitty for someone to flip you (or anyone) off for passing, but if they were going 48 mph in a 50 mph limit, is it really necessary to pass them for that extra 2 mph?
While I agree...pass when able and safely...ive seen alot of the opposite since covid lockdowns came off.

The pavement princesses making unsafe situations in a speeding ball of steel, that can easily take out everything around it if something were to happen..all so you can make it to work 30 seconds faster...is my problem.

Suddenly, peoples "problems" become others with possible manglement or death for what? Getting to work 5 minutes earlier?
That's a curious notion. What I perceive to be the correct speed is the posted speed. If the correct speed was different, it would be posted, you weren't aware of that? When you pass me and blow down the road, and I see you sitting on the side of the road a minute later with flashing lights on you, was your perceived speed still correct?
But you posted it making it our business. If you can‚Äôt accept comments, then you shouldn‚Äôt post.

Was it at night, were you in a big truck with high beams on? Do you have blinding white halogen lights?
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúenforcing the laws‚Äù to go the speed limit.

It‚Äôs following the laws.

All the rest is just opinion on driving.

Please try to understand that distinction.
I've been pulled over on Moscow road for going 7 over before. If you see a green plate speeding and then they suddenly start following the rules in a certain town. I'd highly reccomended not passing them. Certain towns don't f around.  Those are honestly the areas I get overtaken the most.
Driving Cartels run most of Reddit for some reason.

Since when did sitting in traffic and crying about people going 48 on a 50 become ‚Äúculture‚Äù?
amiwrongtho
If you're going 48 in a 50...and there's a double yellow line beside you...you CAN'T be "safely passed".

They'd have to speed, and cross the double yellow to pass you. That's not safe. Where did you get your license lol
You speeding to pass and getting flipped off makes me the problem?
Vermonters don‚Äôt pass vermonters.
It's a bit vague, yeah. The law basically says "when deemed safe" you're allowed to. I think it's because there's so much farm equipment on the roads.
recommend passing zone.  yes likely safer 

but absolutely is true.
As far as I can tell, the lines on VT 14, 15, and 16 have no correlation whatsoever with safe or unsafe passing zones.  I suspect that the guy on the line painting truck just switched from double yellow to single dashed yellow whenever he was running low on paint.
Yes in VT it is legal to pass on a double yellow line. The dotted yellow line is to let you know where it is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to pass
Been driving in Vermont especially the NEK for over 30 years now. At some point prolly about 20 years ago the state got rid of a lot of dotted lines.  
There's one place on my daily drive that I had to agree with [them.You](http://them.You) had a split second to size up the situation and floor it if you wanted to make sure.I did it often enough I was confident in my decision. Now I'm retired so in no hurry to get anywhere. Still mumble under my breath at people who drive 35 in a 50.
The big difference is if your in an accident and your over a double yellow it's always your fault no matter what
It has origins surrounding farm equipment. But as written applies universally. Only caveat is if you try it and fuck up you‚Äôre going to be held fully responsible.
Yep. Plus, you're still not allowed to pass in certain areas. Curves, hills, too close to an intersection. 

I've gotten a ticket for this in VT before. I figured he was gonna pop me for speeding during the pass, but it was the passing laws for some reason.
Yes, exactly. The double yellows are a ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù not to pass.
Lumpy, it's a jk - ask Wally or the Beaver..
In the middle of winter with no leaves on the trees visibility might be drastically longer than in the height of summer when leaves and foliage block a long view.
That's always the condition of passing whether it's double yellow or not. Passing is not an acceptable reason to exceed the speed limit in the eyes of the law.
I live in a 35 zone that turns to a 50 about a mile up. Quite often I'll pull off my road and follow a car going 45 in the 35 but when we get to the 50, they drop to 40. This happens enough to where I've noticed it and it's always strange to me. Someone will speed in a residential zone where it's arguably more dangerous but then grandpa it in the 50 zone..
Yup. Funny how one guy's speed matching turns into another's race.¬†


¬†I suppose after they passed someone, that they would let the same car pass them as well...because the other guy is now in more of a hurry..
Yeah dude it was fucking close. When they sped up they closed the gap with the car in front of them as well so I almost couldn't fit in but luckily I forced my way in front of the psycho and dodged the oncoming car.
I'll admit, they're super fun to drive. I'm just not quite there yet. I like being able to take longer trips without stopping. EVs are great for people who don't take long trips or have a second gas or hybrid vehicle.
Is the acceleration that much quicker? Don‚Äôt know anything about cars but tempted by EVs for all the usual reasons. I always assumed EV would be a slow poke compared to the usual gas guzzler.
This sub downvotes very quickly. Other subs downvote when a person is acting like a jerk, not expressing an opinion. I got downvoted for asking if EVs accelerate quickly. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Maybe we should just jump off and go read a book.
Lots of EVs, even the vanilla ones, are like 300 HP+ and the electric motors have God's own torque curve.  My wife's bland base model EV blows the doors off of my teutonic twin turbo.  She doesn't ask to drive mine anymore.
I don't have quite 300, but I've stripped a lot of weight. It's surprising how much quicker you'll be without seats and a spare tire!
>300 HP

Just like a V6 Camry. How special for you.
N54?
Let's get you in touch with a patent lawyer.  This is too much talent to waste.
Lolol
I mean I agree it drives me nuts.

>it‚Äôs a truck, it‚Äôs not fast,

I disagree with that. A lot of Trucks are quick in a straight line. A base model f150 is as fast as most sporty compacts to 60. I think having so much power is why people are driving them so fast.
Oh yeah that's how I recognize a brodozer. Tbh when I see a wall of light come up behind me at night I just pull off to the side. Even if I am going 15 over.
I‚Äôm not sure. Speed is often a factor in crashes but I think distracted driving is still the top issue by a lot.
That‚Äôs so few! I lived near Atlanta for a bit and watched the live tally they‚Äôd display on the highway signs exceed 1000 usually by this time of year.
Yeah, the drivers here have definitely gotten worse recently but what I described is pure Vermont.
[deleted]
If I can‚Äôt give them 4-6‚Äô, I will not pass them until I can safely. I‚Äôll stay behind them as long as it takes.
Some cop pulls you over like 10 miles away and gives you a ticket from an airplane
That‚Äôs fine, but still
No excuse to cruise the left lane while doing exactly the speed limit with other cars doing the same in any other lane‚Ä¶.i can count on getting stacked up behind one of these characters anytime I‚Äôm on an interstate and it‚Äôs almost always a NH plate.   Meanwhile VT drivers are doing 80 in the far right lane‚Ä¶
NH has the most aggressive and pervasive cops in the nation. I got pulled over at 1:00am at the bottom of a hill by a cop who said I was going 33 in a 30. Sorry that gravity exists officer!
It‚Äôs infuriating.  Like they‚Äôre self imposed cops‚Ä¶‚Äùnot on my watch, we‚Äôre all going the speed limit like god intended‚Äù
That's CT people in my experience. However NH people have some aversion to using turn signals, I hate it. Assholes in CT and MA will cut you off and weave throughout all the lanes and still signal. ü§£
I have an older BMW 5 series. I love it but it‚Äôs in the shop quite often. I was actually eyeing the newer Mazda 3‚Äôs with AWD recently. The current generation has only a slightly longer 0-60 time compared to my Beemer. Still well under 6 seconds which is all the power I‚Äôd ever need.
I typically drive 8-10 over (no tickets in over 20 years because 99% of cops give you 10 mph) unless I‚Äôm in a construction zone, neighborhood, or in busy traffic so I pass a fair amount of cars given that Vermonters are generally slower than that. I‚Äôve had countless situations where people got personally offended. One lady actually followed me to my destination after I passed her then bitched me out for the car that passed her AFTER me. She tried to claim that it was my fault for being the first to pass her. My original point stands. Go about your day and let others go about theirs.
100%

I live near VT and would rather deal with MA than VT drivers. MA will at least speed up when they cut you off or predictably challenge you at *every* merge.

A VT driver will stop for ten minutes in the middle of the lane on a blind corner with their Volvo to randomly pick up trash then get mad you when you‚Äôre sick of being blocked by them for a few minutes or road rage with you because you interrupted the beer they were drinking by getting mad at them from swerving lanes.

Cut you off and go slow. Another day pass you on a blind corner forcing a motorcycle and student driver car off the road.

Go ten under the speed limit on small back roads. Go 80mph in a 40 on the same back roads. Holy shit VT

All of these I experienced. Reckless good ol boys or entitled and dumb.

I am a CDL driver and will deal with a dick MA Beamer over a VT Volvo driver any day lol
Fair points for sure. But still, when you get passed, let it go, right?
It‚Äôs crazy isn‚Äôt it? Vermonters are generally so chill but something about being passed unleashed something so dark lol.
Yup, what you‚Äôre describing is absolutely true and I 100% don‚Äôt condone or practice that kind of driving. I‚Äôm more talking about safe passes and people taking them personally.
That‚Äôs wild but not my point. I‚Äôm not saying to normalize driving like a maniac and being unsafe. I‚Äôm just saying let it go when someone passes you.
PA does too. People are also assholes there about it.
Which is completely legal.
Also correct but they are rarely enforced as an absolute limit. Cops will give you 10 mph 99+% of the time on highways. That grace window seems to be approaching 15 mph on I-89 over the last few years but I‚Äôm not going to test it.
Who said that I only wanted to go 2 mph faster? üòè
Well aren‚Äôt you just a good little law abiding citizen. Speed limits are designed for the worst drivers with the lowest reaction time. Again, just let people do their thing. If you see them in a ditch, you can laugh on your way by. It‚Äôs still not your business to try to get others to drive the speed you want them to so my original post was directed at you.
So just pull over / slow down a little so someone can pass you. What's the issue?
Stowe is an exception. Same with Shelburne.
It‚Äôs not new really in terms of behavior on the road. The social media side is obviously newish.

Fundamentally it‚Äôs about people thinking that their time is more valuable than anyone else‚Äôs and that others need to accommodate them in the name of ‚Äúcourtesy.‚Äù

Well no. Courtesy is a favor. A boon. They don‚Äôt get it just because they want to break the speed limit and they forgot to set an alarm clock.

A lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on mine.

I tend to drive a bit over the limit, but when I come up to someone driving more slowly, I certainly don‚Äôt see it as an entitlement on my part that should do anything at all.
Yes
I'm not sure what you're reading, but they said they were on a clear, straight section of road with dashed lines and a mile of visibility.
"Where did you learn to read? lol"
What's the logic here?
If Vermonters don‚Äôt want to get passed by Vermonters, then they need to drive faster.
Meaning. Don‚Äôt pass where it tells you not to, or if it‚Äôs not safe. Basically the zones, school zone, crossing zone, intersections. There‚Äôs yellow signs saying ‚Äúnot safe to pass‚Äù 

It‚Äôs definitely a farm law, but it works for slow grandma‚Äôs and oblivious drivers too.
That's so funny, I've lived in VT my entire life thinking in the back of my head I was somehow breaking the law passing tractors.  Huge blow to my ego lol
There is a specific law about farm vehicles. There is another statute that clearly allows passing on a double yellow as long as it is not within a certain distance of a curve and it is safe to do so.
New Hampshire has this as well, but specifies 200ft of forward visibility if passing on double yellow.
Genuine question- Does that count in towns and passing via the other lane‚Äôs turning lane? Saw a Subaru pass someone in Shelburne village right next to Flying Pig Bookstore and no one seemed to care. The passing laws in Vermont confuse me to no end.
They repaved VT 18 a few years back and I'm pretty sure they painted the passing lanes starting from the wrong direction.

They ground the lines off and painted new lines right after they were done.
Right, but you also have to survive the head on collision for anything to come of that
You would anyways, dashed or not if you head on and your in the wrong lane ur fucked
Years ago I was pulled over outside of Morrisville for passing on a dotted line. The old man had been doing 25 in a 35 and was barely accelerating when the speed zone jumped to 50. So I pulled out to pass him, in a passing zone. As I came abreast of him a cop came around the corner in the incoming lane. I had plenty of time but I stomped it any way. The cop had his blue lights on almost as fast as he saw me so I had to pull over almost immediately after passing the old man. The cop came up and asked why I was passing to which I told him the old man was traveling drastically under the speed limit. The cop then told me he was going to have to write me up because if it was anybody else instead of a cop it would have been a very dangerous situation.
I told him yup, I 'll be seeing you in court for this one. 

He wrote me a warning.
yeah in practice its far safer to speed up and slow down.
I'd love to see where that is in writing.
Apparently there are a lot of smooth-brains here that disagree with me. Down vote away, ya cunts.
If they're going to hold that speed and not slow down after, yeah, go ahead and pass me after but the problem is they were consistently going under the speed limit before and only decided to change their speed out of childish spite. But keep going off on your holier than thou bullshit.
Imagine risking everyone's life because you want to match stupidity levels with the guy willing to push you like that. Let that guy have his thrill boner, just stay behind him, don't match his near triple digit speeds to save yourself 3 minutes
We just bailed on the second ICE and now have two EVs. We go on frequent trips long trips, sometimes to places without much infrastructure (I‚Äôm looking at you, Adirondack Park!) and that didn‚Äôt stop us from going all in on EV. They totally rock.
I was in the same boat, realized that the pee/stretch stops every 3 or so hours made the switch to EV easy.
You could look into a plug-in hybrid. We replaced my wife's last car with a full EV and I really love it, but I also love to drive into the middle of nowhere in the winter so having two full EVs isn't really practical yet. I ended up going with a plug-in hybrid and it's basically all the advantages of the EV but also with the ability to use the gas engine when needed. Only real downside is that you need to be ok with plugging the thing in every night if you want the EV benefits.
Depends. Off the line EV‚Äôs are quick as they have basically 100% torque available immediately. EV‚Äôs top out fast though, ICE cars, specifically those with similar power outputs to the EV, generally have better top end and will do better at higher speeds and rolling starts.
Yes, it really is that much quicker.
Yes, very much so. My wife has a VW ID.4, which is basically a soccer mom compact SUV, and its 0-60 time is comparable to a Porsche 911 Carrera.
Electric motors generally have waaaay more torque than gas engines.  They also have programmable torque so you don't just spin the tires.  The downside is they tend to go through rubber a lot quicker and their top speed is by and large much lower than gas powered cars.
I want an Ionic 5 N real bad for that reason. Supercar performance for $70k? Sign me up!
300hp? Try [835hp with 900 pounds of torque](https://youtu.be/YN5rQG-0Mx4?feature=shared) for less than $100k.
This is the way
Aw, what‚Äôs wrong buddy? Show me on this doll where the BMW hurt you. I was making a joke, chill lol. We were talking about having enough power to pass safely and while my car isn‚Äôt the fastest one out there, it‚Äôs certainly no Camry either.
Yessir! In an e60 which I absolutely love. When it‚Äôs not leaking oil lol. The final of the three notoriously bad gaskets is scheduled for replacement in 2 weeks so hopefully I‚Äôll be on a good run soon.
0 to 60 they do ok, it‚Äôs past 60 where they fall on their face. No truck will do past 105 mph unless you remove the governor. And even if you do remove the restriction they‚Äôre still slow to accelerate past those speeds as weight, gearing and aero start making a big difference. Most econoboxes will accelerate quicker at higher speeds, let alone a hot hatch which will accelerate a lot quicker at higher speeds then even a tuned/bolt on mods truck will do, gas or diesel‚Ä¶ 

Trucks aren‚Äôt race cars, and they aren‚Äôt fast. Quick and fast are 2 different things‚Ä¶
I think I should do this because nighttime driving is already a little difficult for me and I'm in a pretty low car so when a truck is tailing me..oh god
would be interesting to know per capita/per road usage stats!
A very Vermont observation for sure
"don't be a complete and utter moron" is not that big a concern.

as someone who never tailgates (even if it wasn't a dickhead move, I'm not gonna tailgate because I prioritize safety too much) but frequently passes (only ever on double yellows, essentially, unless they're going 20+ under), someone pulling to the side and not pulling off far enough is extremely rare. If someone pulls over at all, it's almost always either in a passing zone (so it doesn't matter if they're not completely off the road) or into a driveway of some sort where they're not on the road at all.

Yes, it happens rarely, but it's really uncommon, and the tone of your comment makes it seem like it's happening all the time. Pull the fuck over as soon as you can. It's selfish to hold others up.
Yeah, they are shitty drivers, I agree.
Live free or die!
Ah nice. Definitely test out the new Mazda3 turbo awd. It‚Äôs pretty damn slick and will be a welcome reprieve after dealing with Bavarian maintenance worries for so long. You don‚Äôt even need to run premium (but you still can!) 

I‚Äôd be in one in a heartbeat if they put a stick in it. But I‚Äôm entering my SUV era with a new kiddo so the CX-50 turbo is in my future instead. 

Plan B is just to own a Miata as my second vehicle. Someday‚Ä¶
That would be the normal thing to do.
It's just insane. The pass ends the situation. Like you're stuck behind a guy and maybe a bit closer then they'd like so they feel anxiety and you're pissed at them and the whole situation can be remedied and put in the past by you passing. I'm ending the situation by making the pass. Why are you trying to continue it??
Sure. But not really the point, is it. You're mad at people who are upset you are making them less safe by your actions. You are breaking the law. The excuses you make are fine for what they are, but you're the one breaking the law, and it is reasonable for people to dislike that.
Either you did or you went through the trouble of posting because someone got pissed off at you for wanting to break the law in which case you have little to complain about.  Which is it?  üòè No matter your intention - Drive safe!
You posted an opinion. I posted an opposing one with an anecdotal story. Hardly a rant btw. I don't flip people off or go into fits of rage when they pass. I just pointed out that you don't happen to be the one guy the law cedes to because you think you know best. The person in my story was almost hospital bound because of an impatient driver that thought he knew best because it appeared 'safe'. Countless others have not fared better. Grow up. Everyone deserves to get home in one piece. The road isn't your playground. If you're going to get upset over an opposing point, the internet may not be for you.
But where's the power and control in that?  /s
It‚Äôs not my responsibility to pull over if I‚Äôm not impeding traffic.

It‚Äôs also not my responsibility to facilitate you breaking the speed limit laws.

However it is your responsibility to follow the speed limit and drive safely.
Also Danville lol
I think the most wild change, is for almost 50 years people drove slowly for fun just to have a joy ride.¬†

¬†Families in the 1930s - 1970s would go out for a drive and just enjoy the day and enjoy the ride.¬†

¬†Now most drivers are angry, hate driving, and in some cases use their vehicle to bully other road users.¬†

Most of these slower drivers shouldn‚Äôt be battered with hate because they‚Äôre driving the speed limit or 5 below the speed limit, they are probably just enjoying the experience.
Oh okay word they'd still have to speed tho lol
Oh yeah I pass way more slow old people and oblivious people than farmers üòÖ
Hills and curves too
The passing laws are damn near non existent. If you successfully pass them you've basically passed them as per the law. You won't know until it's too late if it was unsafe to pass. If you successfully pass them where it was obviously unsafe to pass, you made it so no harm no foul
I would say that applies to any traffic violation regardless of the color and texture of the road lines
There is no exception to the speed limit for passing. The speed limit still applies.
PHEV is honestly the way to go right now. Typically loads of power when you want it, city ranges  from 20-50 mi on electric, and they do well in the winter because of the curb weight and low center of gravity.
I use my ev/hv for 3 to 4 days before plugging in.  I also drive quite a bit of distance hauls.  I have learned that staying off interstates, save both gas and battery usage.
I feel like quick acceleration is just more valuable in general driving. I'm not going 120mph unless I'm outrunning a nuclear blast so what happens up in that range isn't to interesting.
I"m thinking either an i4 M50 or Taycan next, for that reason.  A CPO one will probably be affordable-ish.
Very nice! I've got 210k on my 335i.  They're great engines, just high maintenance.
I gotta say though, they may start stock with "only" a 12 second quarter mile, but the 10 speed 5.0 AWD f150s are absolute monsters with forced induction and are currently one of the fastest street platforms. 

Trucks aren't slow anymore, and it's pretty terrifying...
Have you ever driven a truck before? My Tacoma can easily top 115 if I wanted to, stock with no modifications.
Are you stupid?????
[deleted]
Congrats on the kid! Mine is 7 now and was very life altering including trading my beloved Honda Ridgeline (I didn‚Äôt care about the ‚Äútruck guys‚Äù stigmatizing it at all, that is a great truck) for a Pilot, which is, um, practical. 

I‚Äôm going to try to get another 50k out of the 535 because it‚Äôs just too fun and is an absolute tank in the snow but the 3 is high on the list for my next one. 

My realistic dream car is a convertible MX-5 with a manual transmission. Maybe after my kid goes off to college.
Because punishing you was what they wanted and you ended it.
Your anecdote seems to fall into the reckless and dangerous category that I said should be reported to the police. I do not drive recklessly nor do I condone that behavior. I don‚Äôt judge anyone for driving at whatever safe speed they are comfortable with. My entire point was don‚Äôt judge me for passing as it is not personal. Your tone came across as judgmental which is why I said that you are the intended audience. If I misunderstood your tone then I apologize.
So if you see someone who wants to get around you, they can legally pass you, and it's safe to do so... You just, what, would prefer that the person passes you in the other lane instead of moving over a few feet and basically taking your foot off the gas for 5-10 seconds? 

It's just being polite and effectively slows you down only for a few seconds while you also now gain a person in front of you who will be going faster than the speed limit (aka cop bait). 

Sounds to me like you're private policing the roads.
What?

How often are you getting pulled over by those... Danville Police?
Different laws.
And the difference between an EV and ICE won't make much difference in relation to outrunning the speed of sound :)
Now you‚Äôre talking!
The limiting factor for most full-size trucks isn't power, it's their driveshaft. Building a driveshaft that's light, balanced, and durable in the length required for a 12' wheelbase is expensive and often requires a multi-piece driveshaft. For this reason most of them won't survive very long beyond 100-115ish mph which is why the trucks come speed governed and fitted with S-rated or lower tires. Even the 700hp RAM TRX is limited to 118.
They run 15 second 1/4 miles stock, not 12. If you actually break down the acceleration, the 60‚Äô to first 1/8th is quick, it‚Äôs the back 1/8th where they fall on their face. Again, weight, aero, gearing start to play their part. Which is why in a 80 mph roll, a regular n/a 2.0L Toyota Corolla or 2.5L Mazda 3 will outrun any of them despite having a major power deficit. They weigh a lot less and are far more aerodynamic. It‚Äôs also why cars like the Fusion Sport 2.7TT or Taurus SHO are SO much faster than the trucks despite having the same engine‚Ä¶
And my daily driver Mazda 3 AWD will do 134 governed, and do 60-100+ rolls faster than your truck, and it‚Äôs still a slow economy car. My FBO/tuned Speed6 will do 165, before it was tuned it‚Äôd do 154 governed‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôll do 60-100+ way faster than even a tuned/deleted diesel‚Ä¶ trucks are slow compared to any hot hatch, let alone an actual sports car‚Ä¶
Ya I think the dude might be dumb  spewing off false facts like that
Enlighten how?
perhaps you aren't leaving enough space and you're making the people in front of you uncomfortable
Thanks! Same dream car haha‚Ä¶. well actually the dream dream is a 911 GT3 but barring some stroke of genius or luck I‚Äôll be happy with a current gen Miata RF manual once MY kid goes off to college. Long ways off haha. 

No shame in the Pilot - and yes my dad and several friends have Ridgelines and love them.
If they want to pass me idc.

Go nuts.

But I‚Äôm not going to pull over just because you want to speed.

And usually I‚Äôm going 5-10 over anyway.

That‚Äôs not policing, however badly you want it to be.

You want to overtake? Overtake.

Don‚Äôt involve me in your bullsh*t.
Yeah, they definitely need some upgrades but the platform is super impressive. A couple grand on a 1000hp rated driveshaft seems to not be a big deterrant. I am not a truck person but I do like horsepower and boy are those Midnight Performance Houston F150s crazy
You are right that it isn't 12, not sure where I saw that but Car and Driver says 14 at 98mph. Still pretty fast for what it is.
I‚Äôm not dumb, all modern American trucks are governed. Dodges are governed at 105, Fords are governed at 100, Chevy‚Äôs are governed at 112 (except the 6.2 which is 114). They‚Äôre all slow‚Ä¶
"Pull over" aka move a few feet to the side and take your foot off the gas. It's not saying come to a complete stop. It's called "being considerate."
For sure. I had a 2019 with just the standard 2.7 ecoboost and having not driven a truck since the early 2000s I was shocked at how quick it was off the line. Luckily the average impolite truck driver on the road is more likely to spend their money on Chinese off-road lights and cheap spacer lifts than a custom driveshaft that can hold 1000hp.
No.

Don‚Äôt involve me in your bullsh*t.
Welcome to the Internet. I was sharing my opinion and you are welcome to have yours. No reason to be a weirdo about it.
The long dark skinned one she told you not to worry about just got out of jail.
Also got batch approved today for a AUG machine gun (Qualified reg sear pack), Tec9 machine gun (BG reg open bolt), Colt 6945SCW SBR, Colt M5SCW SBR, US Army integrally suppressed Ruger Mark-1. Got two more suppressor just submitted pending. Approval time range for the entire batch was 61days as the oldest and 9days as the soonest. All submitted individual, ss kiosk with the exception of the 6945SCW which was individual eform. Needless to say it's been like Christmas today.

Now show us your 110
Here are the other guns I got to take home today. Aug MG, Tec9 MG, 6945SCW, M5SCW and a 1954 us Army integrally suppressed ruger mk1, with a bolt lock. Out of all the much more expensive guns, the ruger was by far the favorite at the lgs. People could not put it down. I'm going to try it out this weekend. Never shot one that had a bolt lock.
I think your whole life is like Christmas lol

Can a gtr really reach 220??? Crazy car
Chair leg batons were the best. We had a local cabinet guy that would drill round 5/8th hole in the center chuck with a Bridgeport center chuck and about a 5-6 inch deep hole with #6 or #8 duck pellets and then epoxy them shut. The no power Taser in my eyes!

I just got my first rejection at 133 days. I'm with you.
Man, I love Kevin Hart!
It's a military contract deployment package I got custom ordered by Reed Knight himself. He wanted to buy a 1 of 1 transferable grenade launcher for his museum from my buddy, so I got him to include a real m110. He did not want to at first, but eventually made it happen 8 months later. All the serialized paperwork including targets and suppressor were manufactured 11months ago. It is a silly rare KA prefix SN which designates it's a contract gun either for international militaries or US LE.
I assume you sell Colombian primo? Lol. üòÇ

Any way we could get some pics of the inside of that Ruger?  I am only familiar with the TBA bolt lock design, so I'm curious how else people have done it.
More than makes up for smol pp
Yes Sir! I've been going to GA Firing line since they were called Nicks Guns back in the early 2000s. Great guys and customer base. It is therapeutic just to swing by every once in a while.
I thought that was firing line lol
Did you even read the list of his other approvals? My man has ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù money and decided to dabble in NFA.
Read the cheesy ass bio
Does this suppressor actually suck and I‚Äôve been creaming over it for no reason for years???
I agree! Easily the best LGS.
I agree. I bought 3 of them over the past 10 years. I could not be happier with it. Mine latest one is a mere 850whp at 3650lbs (Half tank), which is good for mid 9s and drives like stock. The latest one is a Nimso track edition. Vert rare, as they only made 28 of them, 4 in white. Its essentially a Nismo minus the front and rear bumper/wing. Has the Nismo engine with GT3 turbos and ceramic brakes stock, along with all the nismo CF body parts and suspension. Very reliable, never had a single issue after years of beating on them. I'm debating whether to go for 1100 whp, but I'm already at the brink of awd traction for street tires. As is, its a handful for the mountain roads. I have to turn it down to 650whp and even that my knuckles are white when taking it through the twisties.

Gotta be
I agree. Here is a up close of the welds. As someone with a BS in mechanical engineering, I don't understand the assembly/weldment. If there were drawings with exploded views or even just the individual components, I'm sure all the unusual welds would make much more sense.

https://preview.redd.it/jlbcaej7b19d1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54073cfae50811f7ecaf8506269ea2ba2ad941eb
Kac things. Probably because it's not made like the cans you're used to today. It has a tube with stamped baffles inside, vs cans like the polonium that are machined baffles that make up both the od and baffle. In some ways it's a glorified freeze plug can. It's also a reflex can where the rear half/expansion chamber is welded to the front half/baffle stack instead of being a one piece tube with a pressed in muzzle support. Why, kac things. 

For nearly 3 grand it's fucking ridiculous but hey, it's just kac things. [This one isn't fully welded](https://charliescustomclones.com/knights-armament-m110-suppressor-kac-in-black/)
Lol if Ted has a BS in mechanical engineering (as op mentioned above) I'll eat my undies
Damn that‚Äôs such shit. I‚Äôve never been rejected but I did realize I had a mistake after I sent the paperwork and $200 before they could reject it and sent another copy with another $200 and never got my original $200 back. Not surprisingly. But that‚Äôs my fault. I waited 11 months for my can and almost 12 for the SBR.

Holy shit
How much did he charge you for it if you don‚Äôt mind my asking?
MK19?
Curious on what grenade launcher your buddy had
Is there any difference between this and the other M110 deployment kits that have been  been around?  Just wondering if Trey included any cool shit
Stopppp it, my dick can only get so hard
Holy fuck
I'm not sure what that costs for you. 

But I can't wait for you to shoot it and find out they're usually 3-5 MOA guns.
Lol safe assumption. This is by far the coolest post I've come across.
Man that‚Äôs such a cool gun, would love to see video of it

I bought 3 more AUGs last week that are inbound. They are semi-auto, but with the transferable sear pack, I can move it around easily. I got a black Aug, a mud Aug, a 20" machinegun barrel and a 14.5" barrel with surefire warcomp to run a RC2. The third Aug is what I am most excited about. It is a one of 300 that were imported briefly before the ATF pulled the import license plug on. The A1 is unfired from 1985, so I don't care to beat on that if I don't need too. So my plan is to put the sear pack in the 9mm Aug. I got several SMGs with a double pushpin MP5A4 being my current favorite. However I think the 9mm Aug has a real good chance at becoming my favorite. Here is a pic of the actual 9mm aug I bought. Also just got in a Eotech xps3 for it.

That place is nice as shit but it takes way too long to get down there from north because of the traffic.
I don‚Äôt doubt it lol. Just based on that photo and his caption, dude has to have some serious dough
No it doesn‚Äôt suck it just doesn‚Äôt excite me. That‚Äôs all I mean lol
It doesn‚Äôt suck. No sir, not at all. I have 5 of them‚Ä¶and three of the new ones. Ridiculously sublime, they are.

An M110? I think I saw one in Dallas last week for 25K ish
Congratulations. Fuck you.
Fuck congratulations you
They've been around for awhile at around 20k. It's an M110 deployment kit.
Edit: with suppressor it's closer to 30k
You really can't wait for someone's disappointment? 
I reserve that for my enemies man not random people on the Internet showing us their cool collection 
Don't be a hater
Man, you supposed be super rich. May I know the price of that machine gun
Thanks.  I was just curious about the mechanical aspect of how other people have done the work.  I have a TBA MKIII that I like quite a bit, but it is a pretty invasive modification / not easy to have done for other people I know who might be interested.
Tsunemi Ooyama also built mine!
That‚Äôs sweet, I watched Cicio kick ass at TX2K this year and you‚Äôre pretty local to me. Small world. They make great stuff. Their R8 is bonkers
Thanks! I don't regret the hp as it is now, but there is a risk I might regret it at over 1000whp. Right now with 850whp it will spin all 4 tires at anything under 60mph. It is perfectly reliable right now and feels and acts like stock. I built it for mountain climb events which I wanted instant spool and manageable power. It needed to be beat on for 5+ minutes at a time, not just a 1/4mile pass and cool down. No over heating issues at this current level, but I fear at 1100ish, it would have those finicky traits like you mentioned. Misc warning lights popping on, overheating etc.. I could be wrong, but even if it would be reliable at 1100whp, I could not handle it. That kind of power is for straightline drag/roll racing on drag radials.  

GT350 is a sick car. I have been looking to pick up an additional NA car for the mountains and have the GT350R on my short list. I know those coyote engines can put down some serious hp boosted, but I would leave it NA. Id try to get 550+whp NA and call it the day. That's more than enough for the mountains.

This is not Xmas table. This is thanksgiving dining room table.
One can only get so erect!!
There‚Äôs always someone with more. It‚Äôs just how things go.
What is the scope? I thought it was a Schmitt and Binder, but admittedly I don't know much about it because it's way beyond what I could afford.
Not one with literally everything down to the factory test targets and built in 2023. This is worth double that easily I‚Äôd guess.
Everyone's a critic.
Nice! Judging by my 568whp bone stock baseline dyno, I think Tsunemi made them the best!

The Gen 2 voodoo in the 350‚Äôs is a beast. My 350R made 489 WHP stock.

Goddamn if that thing isn't hot.
Oh bby

Gimmie Dat
Yup, I was in line for coffee and a young dude was quizzing me about what I did etc while I waited the other day. Someone always has more, it‚Äôs just life. Learning to be happy is key although a M110 suppressed would probably help. Hahaha.
Leupold Mk4 LR/T. Honestly not the best scope on the block any more but they kept using them due to various contracts. IIRC they are moving to MK5HD scopes on some of them.
Ah I see, that explains the downvotes. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
A cool guide of films and TV series set in chronological order.
Most of these are simply period pieces or are based on true events, but some are obviously more fictionalized like Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones or James Bond and were included simply because I enjoy them and I thought they fit nicely.
I don‚Äôt know why but Creed III being at the end made me laugh really hard
I think the real question is what year will it be before I finish watching all of these?
Blazing Saddles was made in 1874? Mel Brooks was older than I thought.
Can I offer a piece of constructive criticism? The movies that span years/decades should be listed in the time they predominately take place. For example, Atonement would probably fit better if listed in the 30s or 40s when the majority of the action happens.

A request for an additional movie to add to the list is Last of the Mohicans.
blade runner 2049
Mate let's leave some space for older classics too :

[Spartacus ](https://letterboxd.com/film/spartacus/)

[Scaramouche ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scaramouche_1923)
Superbad was late 90s?
How can you forget the movie 10.000 BC
You forgot to add all the star wars movies to the start of the list.

They happened a long time ago.
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but Outlaw King is set after Braveheart, no?
i was expeting back to the future in parts
Add Enemy at the gates?
I'm sure a bunch of people will flood this thread saying "YOU KNOW MANY OF THESE FILMS AREN'T HISTORICAL" but I think this is a cool list because it could be used as a good starting point if someone wants to make a smaller subset of more historically accurate content.
Mad Men should be here too
Boardwalk Empire
Drive to survive being there cracked me up
Band of Brothers and The Pacific but not Generation Kill?
What about Alexander?
Whoa whoa whoa‚Ä¶ Gladiator 2?!?
Gangs of New York?
The Pillars of the Earth could be included, set in the 12th century. I haven't actually seen the show but the book is great.
Oof, you have some terrible war movies like Midway 2019 and Hacksaw Ridge but no "Paths of Glory", no "Schindlers List", no "Come and See". I recommend those 1000 times over
Deadwood (2004) 1870‚Äôs
I read ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äù as ‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù and had questions.
I feel like Gettysburg should be on here. Great movie that is historically accurate.
You have the Other Boleyn Girl but you don‚Äôt include Elizabeth? add the Tudors as well. 

Glory?

Amistad?

What the hell was the criteria for this? It‚Äôs a hodgepodge of movie and tv and biopic and fiction. Maybe you should have separated this into several lists or stuck to one piece of media per decade to make it more concise.
A few to consider adding:
- The HBO series Rome
- The movie Horario Hornblower, as well as the
- British series of movies
- The British series Sharpe with Sean Bean
- The Brad Pit movie A River Runs Through It.
You forgot Zulu
I dont agree with including tv series and some of the movies are questionable but otherwise a cool concept
I would add Tudor series in here; and The Borgia
Saving this for my next hyperfixation.
Blazing Saddles was *way* ahead of its time
You need scifi stretching off into the future, but then star wars would be first cos its set ‚Äúa long time ago‚Äù
Did anyone see the movie 1917 and then look at year it took place? Me either‚Ä¶
Why no cabaret for the late 20s early 30s? :[
We are going from Troy to Drive to Survive? Lol I love it. Add in the future. Get some 12 monkeys and fifth element.
This list is missing the most important historical movie of all time‚Ä¶ Forrest Gump
I know it doesn't make sense but WWII should be:

* The Darkest Hour
* The Kings Speech
* Dunkirk

It gives more context to the times. A bit more gravitas to what happened a Dunkirk a bit more gravitas and severity of the situation. Argue if you will but learning about Churchill's rise leads to a better understanding about how The King's Speech resonated.


Just my thoughts.

Fuck

PSA: HEY ALL! I just wanted to thank everyone for the overwhelming support, ideas, criticisms, and even the people who came here just to shit on this list. I have been adding a lot of your recommendations today - some good classics will be added, along with correcting some dates, some great recs (many of which I haven‚Äôt even seen but will be adding anyway). Also, because we‚Äôve come this far, I intend on adding the Harry Potter franchise, the Jurassic park franchise, and a futuristic timeline. Still trying to work out a futuristic timeline where things don‚Äôt contradict one another (for example I don‚Äôt want to do the planet of the apes movies even tho I love them because that kinda eliminates the possibility of any future human stories) , but at the moment I‚Äôm thinking of Avatar, The Hunger Games, and Dune, possibly finding a way to slip alien movies in there??? Any recs or ideas are welcome for this part or the list as a whole.

Never thought I'd see the day where Band of Brothers was in the same list with Drive to Survive.
Boardwalk empire is a worthwhile addition
I believe the only thing that's missing from this list is Generation Kill - 2008 (2003).
Nice work..can't wait to see everyone pick it apart.
But seriously good job
Uh, this obviously isn‚Äôt complete. They forgot the Land Before Time movies.
Missing 2001: A Space Odyssey.
  
That‚Äôs a pretty easy one to set on the timeline.
Umm, where is Monty python and the holy grail?
Lol Pirates of the Caribbean in the mix, stopped reading this list there
TIL Blazing Saddles released in 1874
Where's Mad Men?
Why no Spartacus?!?!?
Blazing saddles was released in 1874?
>Blazing Saddles (1874)

I don't think that's quite right. In fairly confident that movie was not made in the 1800s.

Also, why stop at 2025? We've got movies and TV shows set in the future
Cool guide - Pearl Harbor would be a good add
Missing The Tudors
Yes it may be fiction but how in the hell is the Patriot staring Mel Gibson not there for the 1770s-82?!?! That movies a fucking classic and the antagonist is by far one of the more chilling and cold hearted villains you'll see in any movie (by way of a few people he kills and esp. the "church" scene
How can you put the breakfast club but not ferris Buellers day off?
Would be nice to have Spartacus and Ben Hur in there.
This is great! You should keep it going every year, reposting with a new entry. Do you have an excel or PDF we can download? 

Surprised no movie/show illustrating the impact of COVID. Although, I tip the hat to Drive to Survive summing up the last few years. I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
I dunno why you‚Äôre getting shit on so hard. Sure, some movies and series could have been swapped but I think it‚Äôs a cool guide. Good job.
Inglorious bastard between saving private Ryan and band of brothers made me chuckle
I‚Äôm glad they put 2019 next to Rocketman or i would have thought it was the masterpiece with Harland Williams.
You can't miss out Sharpe.
No Dazed and Confused
I love the list, thanks!

And seeing Talladega Nights on the list with everything else made me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Didn‚Äôt expect to be disappointed/angry that this list didn‚Äôt end with the newer Planet of the Apes movies. üòî
Where's quest for fire?
What about Year One and Passion of the Christ! lol
I figured this would end in the year 10,000 AD or something with Dune/Dune: Part 2.

Also DTS being on the list is hilarious to me.
Incase you were wondering, my back of the napkin math comes out to about a months time to watch every movie on this list (at 2.5 hours per movie)((that‚Äôs not counting the individual episodes for each show, so maybe a little over a month))
Forgot Idiocracy‚Ä¶
The Current Universe Cinematic Universe
How did Oppenheimer get missed? Or did I miss it?
No love for Gandhi 1982? I‚Äôm sad
Creed 3, but no Zulu.  Huh.
Please, oh please, let‚Äôs build on this! 

Open source style‚Ä¶
Nice might have to give this a go
How do they not have Tudors on the list?!?!
For A Few Dollars More & Fistful of Dollars don't take place after The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Blondie kills Angel Eyes in GBU.
The Knick 1900
Very disappointed the sopranos isn‚Äôt included
Man how the hell has there been no films made about the Eastern Romans in the 5th/6th/7th c.?  There‚Äôs some awesome material there.
Wait‚Ä¶ Gladiator 2 has finally been produced? I guess it can no longer be called [the strangest sequel never made](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180810-gladiator-2-was-written-and-its-mad).
Outlaw King should be after Braveheart as they talk about William Wallace's death early on in the movie and you see parts of his body
Come back when the naked gun franchise is on the list.

Or better yet, do one that's exclusively comedy movies
Cool
Honourary mention: 10,000 BC - 10,000 BC
Cool
disappointed to not see Quest for Fire
I‚Äôll give this a shot. I‚Äôve watched a lot of them already but it‚Äôs a cool idea
Needs Munich: The Edge of War and The Imitation Game for your WWII collection
I wish there was a show set in the Byzantine empire around 1000 AD
Year One should start the list off. 

Or Star Wars.
Same list for futuristic movies would be cool
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a prequel?
Missing Star Wars 52,082,195 BC
Needs Passion of the Christ and Shogun.
 The 1940s - present time is basically peak cinema üòÇ
I always wanted to find a list like this for ww2
Dune. Something like the year 11,000.
I'm kinda surprised Boardwalk Empire isn't there along with Peaky Blinders and there's no The Sopranos. That show is peak 90's.
Gangs of New York is a must add to this list.
You missed iclaudius it‚Äôs great and Waterloo what‚Äôs also great both free on YouTube
‚ÄòBack to the Future‚Äô trilogy sprinkled through 1885, 1955, 1985, and 2015.
no Amadeus?
65 should be number 1, Adam Driver shooting dinosaurs!!!
Apocalypto (2006)
I'd suggest adding The Terror, season 1, released in 2018, covering a failed British expedition to the Arctic between 1845-1848.
With such wide ranges I‚Äôm surprised the Jurassic Park series doesn‚Äôt bookend this chart.
Super bad is not late 90s it‚Äôs early 2000s
Superbad def not late 1990s. Dogshit analysis.
....... superbad takes place in the year it came out.
 It's just based on the late 90s antics of Seth and Evan
> Superbad - Late 1990s

Is that real? Like I know it was based on the writer's personal experience but it felt very 2007 when it came out.
Superbad was not set in the late 90s. They were using Motorola flip phones in the movie
Barry Lyndon not being included is nonsense
Black Sails should be listed instead of (or at least in addition to) Pirates of the Caribbean. More historically accurate (obvs) and better in general.
If you don‚Äôt have the time to watch all these movies; you can just watch History of the World pt. 1
What about lord of the rings?
Why would you even put dts??
First off, great list, good work. It‚Äôs a liiiiiittle Eurocentric. I know film itself is, but surely something happened in Africa between Casablanca and black hawk down. I also hate Indiana jones and the crystal skull. I‚Äôm fine with some of the entries being dramatized but that film is not for me.
What an awful arbitrary list. Congratulations.
Throwing six seasons of a reality show in among this list seems odd.
Someone is going to content farm the f out of this, op I hope you somehow still get credit
Rabbit Proof Fence(2002), 1932 

Faraway Downs (miniseries recut of ‚ÄòAustralia‚Äô), 1939-1942

Yellowstone: 1884 

Yellowstone: 1923
Pompeii (2014)?!?!
Straight out of Compton should be listed as from 86' to 96'.
Dazed and Confused (1976ish?). The Big Lebowski (early ‚Äò80s)
Ya, I think you guys can skip "The Harder They Fall (2021)"
No Sopranos or Many Saints of Newark?
You forgot Spartacus from Starz
No Pearl Harbor?!
Where do you put back to the future?
Missed opportunity to not have quest for fire on this list, and I would‚Äôve chuckled if 10000 BC was there too
Bruce Lee‚Äôs show ‚ÄúWarrior ‚Äú and the AMC show ‚ÄúHell on Wheels‚Äù should have been included.
What about Boyhood (2014) - covers a period 2002-13 - quiet an epic achievement of film making and story telling!
1995 gets Tommy Boy? 

Not Terminator 2, Hackers, American history X, 8 mile? Tommy Boy...
Boardwalk Empire with Steve Buscemi, depicting the American Prohibition Era is a must.
Blazing Saddles (1874)-------------1874
Breaking Bad needs to be included
Ah man I was hoping to see Deer Hunter on there‚Ä¶
You did a good job on the list.  Ignore the trolls.
Dazed and Confused
Needs Back to the Future.
Reign
I‚Äôm honestly surprised this, nor any of the comments mention M*A*S*H*. Probably one of the most defining TV shows if the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs
I find it amusing when Chernobyl was happening NWA was also blowing up the streets.
I read through probably a couple hundred comments and not one mention of Tombstone.

You're no daisy. You're no daisy at all!
No SOA?
So black people just showed up in 1820?
Superbad for the 1990s makes no sense.
Superbad is in the wrong order you twat that was not a movie about the late 90s tf
Now do one with sci-fi movies of actual dates and dates of the script
Battlestar Galactica (reboot) should be on this list‚Ä¶.right after the Star Wars movies.
Weird decision to use the most recent adaptation of the great Gatsby. The 1974 version is by far more superior imo.
I just finished Collecting this whole list on my Hard Disk(viz. 700GB) with Folder *"Cinematic Historical Timeline"* .

Anyone wants anything from it DM me, i''ll share a link.  
Data-Hoarder-Thanks!!! u/ciapigeon

*P.S. Less Gladiator II (2024) Not Yet Released*
Damn. One Holocaust film! No Schindler‚Äôs List?!
Great list. Fun read. Few suggestions: 13 Days ('62), born on the fourth of July or platoon or coming home. Did I miss Nixon?  Thank you!
Should have included 1883 and 1923 which are Yellowstone shows
Dune? Year 10,191
No breaking bad :(
Where is Jurassic Park and why is Troy first?
Okay, now post a list of all movies.
[deleted]
no star trek, star wars, 2001 space odyssey, blade runner etc. . . too bad
No way blazing saddles came out in 1874
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but no room for I, Claudius?
Blade Runner
Maaa
Maan, what happened in 1944-45? Shit's popping off.
Corrrr
Our flag means death, red dwarf, avenue 6, black sails, so many missing
What?  No Flinstones?
Today I watched Support Your Local Sheriff. That's not on the list? 

:-)
Outlaw king takes place after the death of William Wallace
Gotta start with Year One
BIG MISS - 10 Commandments, Charlton Heston

And just for humor, History of the World part 2, Mel Brooks
10000 bc?
What about Star Wars? In a distant place a Loooong Tume ago
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer is not on this chronological list
I accidentally read that Toy Story was set in 1250 BC
Nothing filmable happened between 200 and 793.
But how long would it actually take to watch this from beginning to end.
Braveheart should be before outlaw king.
No Michiel de Ruyter aka The Admiral???! The 1600‚Äôs list is lackluster tbh
2001 and 2010 were a missed opportunity.
Why the fuck is drive to survive on this list?
But why?
What is the biggest gap without a film/series?
I think outlaw king and braveheart need to be swapped. The end of braveheart basically happens in the first 1/4 of outlaw king
Judas and the Black Messiah couldn‚Äôt make the list? Book of Clarence?
Where's Forest Gump?
Terrible, just Terrible 

No tombstone but blazing saddles?
I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think Blazing Saddles was made in 1874
How could you leave out apocalypto?
Where is Boogie Nights
3 kingdoms? we dont like china but its history is a masterpiece
Need to add ‚Äú1941‚Äù

Great list!
Bro how you gonna have Band of Brothers & The Pacific but not Generation Kill?
Man Blazing Saddles was way ahead of its time for being made in 1874
Missing 1923 to represent the year of 1923
Little disappointed to not see *The 13th Warrior* on this list (set in 922 AD, according to google).
We really need some more ancient (x BC) historically accurate stuff. Would love to see more of the bronze age.
mfw no Pearl Harbor
No Das Boot? Was hoping to see it here knowing that it was one of the best movies depicting life in a U-Boat during World War 2. I recommend watching the Director's Cut due to a lot of other scenes exploring more about the characters. There's also a TV Series set a few months after the movie.
not having of mice and men in the 1930s era of movies is a sin
I must confess I was expecting 1984 in the list
if the criterion collection is the fine dining of cinema, this is the regurgitated gas station dumpster value meal menu
Great list, might consider adding few to the list

Franklin on Apple TV
Beautiful Mind
Miracle on Ice (US Ice hockey team from 1980)
But why no M*A*S*H. Great list!
I have an addition for your list: Robin Hood. As there are lots of versions of Robin Hood to choose from, the one that I highly recommend is [Robin of Sherwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_of_Sherwood).
No one has any problems with the Pirates of the Caribbean inserted in as historically accurate?
This list is wrong without Gangs of New York
ah yes, the period between 2018 and 2023 when nothing of historical consequence happened besides car racing...
Dances with Wolves? The Last of the Mohicans? What was the source data for creating your list?
The Last Kingdom FTW
Lameahhhhh
No boardwalk empire for 1920s prohibition and after the Great War in America is disappointing
Missing The Flintstones. List sucks.
Add Spartacus, Elizabeth Taylor‚Äôs Cleopatra, I Claudius, and Quo Vadis
So no movies about cavemen like 10000BC or that one with ringo starr?
I'm really glad the Last Kingdom made the list
I accidentally read troy as tron and thought "wtf, tron isn't set in the past, where did I miss that?!"
Duudeee... You are mising movie Mongol... Genghis Khan is¬†the only historic figure who introduced man-made global cooling.
Outlaw king definitely doesn't take place before Braveheart. The whole point of the movie is the Scottish rebellion under Robert the Bruce after the death of William Wallace!
Use Black Sails instead of pirates of the Caribbean. It‚Äôs much more pirate savvy and era appropriate.
The Last Kingdom is one of my favorite shows.
One Million Years BC
Incomplete. Missing Contact (1997)
Ugh so much rocky.
The Running Man takes place in the futuristic year of 2025.
Where‚Äôs the big Lebowski?
Wow they really filmed Blazing Saddles in 1874! Who knew?!
Wall Street takes place in 1985, but there's a reference to the Challenger disaster, which happened in 1986.
No ‚ÄúGangs of New York‚Äù?!
Good list, missed hell on wheels though
Cool. Now do it forward.
Another cool guide saved into the UNKNOWNNNNNNN
What about Game of Thrones?
Why don‚Äôt they organize movie sections at Blockbuster like this?
First Gatsby is superior to the 2013 version
‚ÄúThe woman king‚Äù 

How can anyone recommend this garbage?
I didn't see Amadeus listed.
No Boardwalk Empire?
So mad ‚Äú2012‚Äù did not make the list
No terminator. Bullshit.
You forgot

Idiocracy (2006) - 2505
Amadeus: 1774-1823
The list should start with Star Wars.
Quest for Fire!  We need some pre-history in this list.
Hehe can we have Star Wars first as it‚Äôs set ‚Äòa long time ago‚Äô
Terminator 2012!
Boardwalk Empire 1920s
Isn't Outlaw King supposed to be after Braveheart?
First Man (2018) would be a great addition to the space race.
The whole Tudor era came down to a shit Natalie Portman nonsense and one more irrelevant movie? Get fucked
Put a War and Peace in there my dude
I don't think suprerbad was late 90s. The first scene they were taking about which porn site to sign up for with their parents credit card. Plus I'm pretty sure the mclovin fake ID is up to them times. An they are playing a Playstation!
Missing Last of the Mohicans
Isn't this just a list... how is this a guide?
You missed Star Wars as maybe the first one in the list. "A long time ago," after all, is the very first thing you see in Star Wars.
Surprised to not see Apocalypto on here
A whole lot of war stuff but missing all of M*A*S*H!  Good for the 50s
Sopranos???
Just a recommendation, but ‚ÄúGreen Book‚Äù (2018) takes place in 1962 and it‚Äôs about a black pianist and his driver traveling through the southeast of America. Honestly one of the best movies I‚Äôve ever watched +it‚Äôs based of a true story!
How is Rob Roy not on this last?
Il Gatopardo is *chefs kiss

the quality and types of films across this sample is wild
Better get started if I want to finish before I die.
Yeah but where does Game of Thrones fit in here?
Where do you put Back to the Future
Was waiting for Oppenheimer but maybe that‚Äôs a little too ‚Äúadhd fixation‚Äù to be here
Blazing Saddles release date being 1874 üòÇüòÇ
Where is the Matrix ?
It isn't really a coolguide if more than half the stuff on it is objectively terrible viewing
Please add each episode of Doctor Who with an identifiable year / decade / obvious time period.
üòÇ
(/s for those who need it)
You forgot to start off with all the Star Wars movies üòú
What were the selection criteria? I mean there are obviously more shows than this

Is it just stuff tuff you've seen and liked?
Katyn (2007) belongs in 1940 or 1941

Soviets commit the atrocity in 1940, Germans discover it while invading the USSR in 1941

\[Film\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy%C5%84\_(film)

 \[Atrocity\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn\_massacre)
[Empire of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun_(film))
No "The Patriot" from 2000? What the !!!!
Gladiator 2 in 2024? WTF did I miss
This is really cool! Thanks!
What about [The Untouchables: 1930‚Äôs Al Capone being brought to justice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Untouchables_(film))
Erin Brokovich could be a good one to include.
I wanna add 1813-1827 

Bridgerton
Nothing from around the year zero?  No movies about Jesus?  At least throw in Last Temptation...
The very first in the chronological order should be Star Wars.
Wow blaving saddles was a present day kinda movie? Mel brooks must be so old!
2001 A. Space Odyssey 


2010. ?
Who saw this and immediately googled Gladiator 2?
What a perfectly bizarre list of things

Finally, the Real Life Cinematic Universe
You lost me when you went with Lincoln over Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
can we have a link to the spreadsheet?
Bladerunner (2019)

Bladerunner (2044)

Dredd (2080)

Dune (10,191)

Could be on there.. (not sure the criteria for making it on this list)
Cool list ... I'm missing 1984, 2001 and 2010. Not sure were to put them though üòâ
10, 191 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ DUNE
October sky, Miracle and Rudy
Where‚Äôs Dune?
Kinda sad to see the Sopranos missing
Love Siege of Jadotville great film about a bit of history that isn‚Äôt talked about much
Don't know if someone already mentioned these but for around the 1750s you could add the series Outlander.
End of the 19th century you could add "Anne with an E" as well.

Just to add some extra watching hours xD
Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe Europe 

Asia

Europe Europe Europe‚Ä¶ lol
How can you forget Ennemy at the Gates! The best movie about Stalingrad in my opinion.
I know you probably don't care but I'm going to be following this and watch everyone of these over the next few years. This is amazing, thanks you.
You missed all seasons of Bridgerton
Others that can be added historically and not:
Life is Beautiful
OJ Simpson movie
Thirteen Lives

Grease
Heathers
Fresh Prince of Bel Air
Saved by the bell
Mean Girls
Reservoir Dogs
Euphoria

There‚Äôs plenty more but these have time era specific themes.

Edit: you already have reservoir dogs.
Would have loved some fast and furious years
Start with Quest for Fire
They only left 10000 bc out because it wasn't called 1000 bce
What titles did you watch out of these? I'm looking for some quick reviews.
Nice list, but can‚Äôt believe you skipped over 500 years from 200 AD, let‚Äôs plug in Quest for the Holy Grail to fill the gap
I would include Shardlake on HULU (just premiered May 1, 2024). It's a "muder mystery" set in a 1536 England abbey, during the time of Henry VIII's Reformation and subsequent closure of the (formerly) Catholic monasteries.
The list gets a bit more rediculous as it goes on... Pirates of the caribean the full series in particular as the first wtf is doing here in.
This is an incredible list. Thank you.
Why is drive to survive here It feels so out of place!
I would like to add The Lion Kind, I'm A Legend and Moana:)
There‚Äôs a lot of great movies missing that could still be placed in there lol like Lawless üëÄ
Boardwalk Empire seems to never get the recognition it deserves. I feel like it‚Äôs always left out/forgotten about.
Ironclad (2011) should be in your list as well
You also forgot Hidalgo and Apocalypto.
Early 2000‚Äôs should have the sopranos in it
Quest for fire should be number 1 or 10,000 BC üòÇ
If you look into Asian history you can plug your early dark ages gap somewhat. King Arthur attempts to do post Roman Britain 4-5 C CE
Passion of the Christ.
How could you leave off The Borgias AND Black sails? What do you have against the letter B?
Would have though passion of the Christ would be on here
Exodus of gods and men.
The list is highly west- centric. The colonized world does not feature and there are hardly films spotlighting the 21st century in worlds other than Europe and America.
Blazing Saddles was made in 1974, not 1874. Shit had me trippin üíÄ
Am I blind? I can't find Schindler's List.
Braveheart is not 1314, that's the battle of Bannockburn which was during the second war of Scottish independence when Robert the Bruce was king. Braveheart was about William Wallace during the first war for Scottish independence which took place roughly 2 decades prior.

Source: I'm making a video game set in this time period r/redrampant
Black sails (series) and Cold Mountain need places on the list too!
That's an extremely arbitrary selection of movies.
Where‚Äôs Year One?
Where is 1959 Ben-Hur you monster?
Isn't Outlaw King set after the death of William Wallace, which is what Braveheart was about?
Where does Outlander fit in here?
1899!
Im sorry but you forget hitler rising of the evil or in german hitler aufstieg des b√∂sen
I would add the patriot for 1776 and more important to me specifically would be the mini series From the Earth to the Moon set in the late 50s to the mid 70s about the Apollo program.
What about Dances with Wolves (1990) and Last of the Mohicans (1992)?
Shouldnt it start with Star Wars or a bbc documentation about the big bang?
Katy≈Ñ massacre happened in 1940 not 1945
I wonder why there's a whole page of 1939-1945? ü§î
I, Claudius not on the list? RIP
I‚Äôll need to come back and review this‚Ä¶
For science
this is a lot. A LOT
Should include: The Passion of the Christ, as the 1st movie on that list
Pearl Harbor?!
Got Apollo 13, but sleeping on From The Earth To The Moon - a fantastic series with production values equal to Band of Brothers.
There are a few I am missing and having trouble to insert here. Especially Yellowstone and it‚Äòs prequels.
Lol I was struggling to put stuff at the end but it got great reviews and it goes with all the other rocky movies I have listed (haven‚Äôt seen it yet tho)
Is it possible to summon r/theydidthemath?
HAHA good catch!! My bad
What are you kidding me? This is 1874, *you* could sue *HER*!!
The reason I decided to set movies in the year they end is to prevent things from getting repetitive and to allow for flashbacks throughout this list, so that when a movie ends you know it‚Äôs caught up to the time period of what is to follow.
Last of the Mohicans is an amazing film and it perfectly encapsulates the issues surrounding the French and Indian War. I show it to my history students every year. It's a timeless classic.
I was just thinking, why did they stop at 2025. There are future ones too..
I think we are more likely on the ‚ÄúIdiocracy‚Äù timeline
I think ur right. I haven‚Äôt seen most of these but I do like the idea. Some of the ones I haven‚Äôt seen on this list I included based just on their reviews
Apocalypto and Aguirre would be nice to mix things up
I was looking for this comment. Great List.
GLORY set in 1963 
Civil War movie
Ten Commandments too please
Definitely not. Type of cell phones are an easy time marker
Year One should be in there.
And put the 1981 classic ‚ÄúCaveman‚Äù staring Ringo Starr, Dennis Quaid, Barbara Bach and Shelly Long at the top of that list.      
     
It‚Äôs takes place  "One Zillion BC ‚Äì October 9th".       
     
I doubt there‚Äôs a film set earlier than that!
IIRC, Episode IV is set in 1798. [Yes, really.](https://starwarsfanworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWTG56LegendsV1.pdf)

> For years, fans have been debating just how long ago ‚Äúa long time ago‚Äù might be. Nevermind that it is all ‚Äúin a galaxy far, far away,‚Äù fans still would like to think that there is some way to equate Star Wars dates to our own. Originally, George Lucas‚Äô first story synopsis for the saga set the tale in the 33rd century, which is in our far future. Given that the story was later changed to take place ‚Äúa long time ago,‚Äù the original date must be thrown out.

> Ever since then, we have simply been left with the belief that ‚Äúa long time ago in a galaxy far, far away‚Äù is just a different way of saying ‚Äúonce upon a time.‚Äù For those who are curious, though, 
there have been two stories printed (and two other roundabout attempts) that have managed to equate Star Wars dates to our own. They are, however, stories that are considered Infinities (N-Canon), rather than anything C-Canon (part of the Legends Continuity). For the sake of argument, though, here‚Äôs the lowdown on both.

> The first attempt at this kind of conversion came in a Star Wars and Indiana Jones crossover story in the Star Wars Tales anthology comic book series.

> In Star Wars Tales #19 (and later, reprinted, in the Star Wars Fan Club Special 2008), there is a story called Into the Great Unknown. In the story, Han Solo and Chewbacca are aboard the Millennium Falcon, when they are attacked by Imperials. They are forced to leap to hyperspace blind and end up in our solar system, where they crash on Earth. Once there, Han is killed by Native Americans and the mourning Chewbacca is believed to be a sasquatch (perhaps the Sasquatch, AKA ‚ÄúBigfoot‚Äù). Over a century later, the wreckage of the Falcon and Han‚Äôs remains are found by the intrepid American archaeologist Indiana Jones.

> We can infer a few dates from this, if we are so inclined (and since I was bored when updating the timeline at some point, apparently I was so inclined, or this wouldn‚Äôt be here, right?). We can infer all of the following:

> First, Han makes mention of America‚Äôs forest (probably in Humboldt County, California, or somewhere close) as looking like Endor, which puts the story firmly after Han‚Äôs first encounter 
with the forest moon in Return of the Jedi. Since the Empire seems to still be going after them, we can also assume that the story is set before the events of Vision of the Future, when the treaty with the Imperial Remnant is signed. Since Han also mentions that he always figured Chewie would be killed saving Han or his kids, we have to conclude that the tale takes place sometime between 9 (more likely 11) ABY and 19 ABY.

> Second, the Indiana Jones portion of the tale, when he finds the wreckage, can also be dated. I had once believed that it must take place somewhere around 1935, due to the fact that Short 
Round, the little kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which takes place in 1935, is with him in this story but not in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1936). However, reader Avery Goodman 
pointed out two things to me: first, Indy refers to Atlantis technology, placing this story after Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis; and, second, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis has 
been set as taking place in May 1939 by Indiana Jones: The Ultimate Guide. Thus, I am agreeing with Avery in placing Into the Unknown in 1939.

> Third, the story tells us that the Indy segment is 126 years after the Han and Chewie segment.

> So, if we assume a date of 1939 for the Indiana Jones segment, then the Star Wars segment takes place in 1813. If we then split the difference of the date for the Star Wars segment to be 15 
ABY (halfway between Empire‚Äôs End and Vision of the Future), then A New Hope must take place (using how similar Earth and Star Wars years are in length) around 1798.

So Episode IV is after Pride and Prejudice, before Master and Commander. Star Wars Episode III takes place in 1770, probably before Portrait of a Lady on Fire.
In a galaxy far, far away...
Correct
Rough Riders, the way back, We were soldiers, jarhead,
Yeah I tried to make it clear to those people that some of these are wildly dramatized historical events and some of them are entirely fictional, however, they all at least have a background of a real world/time period in some way shape or form and that‚Äôs really the whole point.
was searching for this comment, it most definitely should
Lmao dude just gave up and got really into F1
The great? I haven‚Äôt seen it - is it any good and when would it take place do you know?
Yeah it‚Äôs coming soon
Should definitely be on this list. Needs to be right after Lincoln for the DDL double header.
Yeah idk how this was left off.
Tora! Tora! Tora!
Also weird to do the recent All Quiet on the Western Front, it wasn't bad, but the 1930 version is so much better
Came here to mention Hell on Wheels. But the list absolutely should have Deadwood too
Gods and Generals too
Now we shall see how professors fight!
Exactly my thoughts. There is no criteria. It‚Äôs just a list seemingly of all movies OP has seen listed in chronological sequence.

Cool guide? Uhhhhh‚Ä¶ok‚Ä¶
Or maybe...Just take this as a fun list of good shows and movies set throughout history and isn't meant to be a comprehensive list by any means because then it would just be too damn long?
since its made by one person, others can try to make their own instead of bitching that their favourite movie isn't included.
Rome is like the 4th thing on there‚Ä¶
Yeah I was looking for The Crown
+1 for Sharpe and Hornblower. Excellent the both of them.
This is mine at the moment lol
HAHAHA
Vikings is amazing! The newest version kind of sucks, but the original with Ragnar is fantastic!
First 4 seasons are very good then it then it becomes 'Sex and the City' who bangs who crap.
I have yet to see it, but I heard it was great.
That‚Äôs absolutely something that should be talked about more. There aren‚Äôt a lot of good or realistic movies depicting ancient times and the few that are all take place in Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece.

I will say, the Woman King is one of the movies I included on this list, which is based on a true story and takes place in the African Kingdom of Dahomey, might help scratch this itch for historical black stories outside of slavery and the civil rights movement.
1885, 1955, 1985, 2015
Damn I had to scroll far for it
This needs more exposure!
Ice Age am I right?
This has been the best criticism I have received yet lol
Thanks!!
lol I love anything racing related and I wanted something set in each of the last few years
My wishlist has to be a movie set in 
Ancient Babylon
Would love to see someone come up with some sort of cohesive order for them.

Like the purge movies, somehow into mad max, into Dune
it's actually 10000 years since the butlerian jihad and the establishment of the space guild, which was itself around 10k years following our present era, so it's more 20k years in the future
Don‚Äôt hold your breath. On top of the many recs listed, I intend on adding the Jurassic park and the Harry Potter franchises. The most unrealistic part of the Harry Potter movies isn‚Äôt even the magic, it‚Äôs the fact that it takes place in the 90s and not once in any of the films does anyone mention Michael Jordan or the Chicago Bulls.
Yeah working on a new one now and all of black sails takes place right before all of POTC
I love that franchise so if you could give me a logical explanation for when it would take place I‚Äôd greatly appreciate that. Maybe like tens of thousands of years after dune, once most of the human population has died out but some parts of earth heal (like the shire) and some go to shit and new humanoid species emerge???
Funny enough, I really want to include Star Wars because time period is simply a long time ago in a galaxy far far away and I absolutely love that franchise (I have an extremely in depth watchlist for that as well but you‚Äôd think I‚Äôm crazy if I showed it to you)
I think one or two people in the comments did the math - about a month if it was just the movies. Everything, I‚Äôd estimate that adds about a month. (This would be non stop watching)
Was currently watching it anyway, already included a lot of adjacent stuff (Schumacher, Ferrari, rush) and wanted something to fill in the past few years
You dare not include 10,000 BC?
Missing Gangs of New York
Children of Men takes place in 2027 and is such a good movie
I'm just laughing at the thought of someone watching these in order as their only form of history knowledge and how warped their worldview would be.
Gladiator 2... Wtf??
[deleted]
Not gonna lie, I was half expecting Idiocracy to be last on the list.
You forgot gangs of newyork!! 1863
Dune is set in 10191, and should probably be at the end‚Ä¶
Why the spaghetti western knockoffs of the samurai films Yojimbo (Fist Full of Dollars) and Sanjuro (For a Few Dollars More) over the movies they knocked off?
Dune. It plays in the year 10,000 or something.
It's only 405h of watch time if we assume an avg length of 1.5h for each of the 270 entries.

The avg American watches 28h of tv a week. Per google.

So, the average American could watch the whole list in 15 weeks.

Edit: I've just been notified that I missed the seasons label on some. I counted 37 seasons at 10 eps per, 45 min avg run time. That's 277 more hours than originally estimated.

For 682 total hours. Or 24 weeks for the avg American to watch it all.
But Saving Private Ryan ends in the 90s!
That‚Äôs a good rationale. I‚Äôm strongly debating watching through this list
It is a good approach mostly, but I suggest adjusting on a case by case basis. For instance, 99% of Band of Brothers e.1 takes place before June 1944. It takes you through the training and development of characters before the Dday landings (June 6, 1944). Where it is situated on the list makes it seem as if it's about the D-day landings.
Yea, like RoboCop.
You forgot:

Alpha (20,000 years ago)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(2018_film)

Waterloo (1814-1815)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_(1970_film)

The Patriot (1776-1781)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Patriot_(2000_film)

And Cinderella Man (~1935)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_Man
> ‚Ä¶you guys have MySpace?
It's fairly decent. It mainly covers his life from about 336 to 323bc with some flashbacks to earlier years.

And there's also the series Domina, that pretty much follows where ROME is stops and shows the ascension of Augustus.
Another classic. I'm surprised Pearl Harbor 2001 isnt on this list...
Isn't the new All Quiet.... Set in 1918 too. I thought it goes up to the armistice. 

Also Battle of Britain (1969) is an excellent one for it's aerial scenes alone.
Better than a lot of "cool guides" posted on this sub.
THIRTEENTH!!!!
Well a lot of our history depends entirely on it being recorded. The only reason we know of events such as the siege of Troy are from the iliad - a poem/chant which was memorized and recited before the invention of the written word. The civilisations we know most about are those who invented writing and used it to record their histories. Unfortunately, there was very little recorded by early lower African civilisations, and most did not have a system of writing until European colonization.
The Amistad
Apocalypto was a huge miss too.
Or the quest for fire
Or Ice Age?
Gotta start with Year One. Actually you should just that one either way.
Yeah honestly stopped reading when it didn't start with that...
And Glory and Gettysburg. Shit, let's throw Ken Burns' Civil War documentary in there while we're at it.
HAHAHA yeah I would say they should definitely not use this list as an excuse to doze off in history class, however, I will say a lot (not all) of the movies I included because I believe they are ‚Äúimportant‚Äù to watch - whether it‚Äôs important in the sense like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just good to watch that movie because it‚Äôs really funny and culturally relevant‚Äù or important in the sense that it gives you a better, deeper understanding of the world.
Yeah it‚Äôs set only a few years later and coming out soon
Yeah I couldn‚Äôt decide between hunger games, maze runner, a zombie apocalypse, max max, or the purge. I didn‚Äôt do all of them because obviously they would contradict each other.
I watched all of Game of Thrones in less than 6 days.

(Put me in the screenshot)
They aren't all movies, though; a lot of those entries are entire seasons.
Good to know! Thank u
or waterworld.
Thank you! Are these any good I haven‚Äôt seen any of them
Patriot being left off was wild for me
> the Woman King is one of the movies I included on this list, which is based on a true story

That's a bit of a stretch, because as far as I know, the Dahomey actually fought to KEEP slavery, not abandon it. But yeah, African history (and mythology) is such a vast pool of unused potential in Hollywood.
And Passion of the Christ
[removed]
Such a classic. It should be taught in kindergarten
Please have mercy and set the only copy alight
Ahem, you forgot a couple of movies set past the year 10,000
Bladerunner and 2049? Cmooon man..
Tons of these films contradict each other already, honestly, from different actors playing the same roles to things like tarentino films changing history. If we're playing loosey goosey with literal events just do future films too, regardless of their association with each other, any film with a labeled earth date. Minority Report, Blade Runner, Hunger Games, do em all. End with Dune Pt 2 haha
Holy fuck.
Got through the first 5 seasons in 3 days, while dying of boredom in kuwait
I‚Äôll do ya better- 3 days, heavily depressed during covid üëçüèº
Thank you for that. I've updated my post to reflect the new times.
I'm technically correct but joking around -- SPR definitely belongs all the other WWII films! 

But yeah the film opens in the (then) present day, followed by one loooong flashback, with the final scene back to present for like 1 minute.
Dune would be the very last one as I'm pretty sure that's the furthest set into the future any movie is set.

Edit - Actually The Time Machine would probably be last.
I haven't seen Alpha but love the idea of it, Waterloo is the best Napoleonic film imo, the Patriot has a bunch of inaccuracies but its a fun flick, and Cinderella Man is my fave sports docu film.
I kind of want to see the list after all these suggestions!
Platoon - 1967

Dances With Wolves - 1860s

The Alamo (2004 version) - 1836
You serious?
And before. I.e. 10,000 BC
Depression + a Work from Home Job with 10 hour shifts = a season and a half a day.

I genuinely could not look away. Everytime I was ready to go to bed some crazy shit happened in the last few minutes of the episode and I had to watch the next one.

It's funny since after reading the books the show is genuinely unwatchable.
Yeah, Rae Dawn Chong running around in nothing but body paint and teaching some Neanderthal guy the missionary position isn‚Äôt really elementary school material.
I was sick and couldn't sleep and ended up watching like 4 seasons back to back lol
Me with Breaking Bad. Started watching 2 days before my uni exams... I did not go into those exams well rested.
This is how we exchange our tanks. 
So Im made to take pur tanks to get exchanged at airgas about two blocks from the body shop I work for. I'm sure this isn't how they're meant to be transported. 
No seat belts!?  This is madness!
I had kids so they are in the back to hold them tight better than seat belts or straps
You doing this in your own car?
in my local welder shop. there is a newspaper cutout of a guy who got obliterated after he transported one of these cylinders in his trunk. Driving around it just exploded. 2 dead. happened in the 70's.
Jesus fucking christ, dont do this!
Yeah, that is 100% wrong. I don't remember if it applies to oxygen, but acetalyne tanks shouldn't be laid on their side bc of the solvent in them. 

You should definitely talk to someone about proper transportation. If anyone there has a truck, chain/ratchet strap them to the back of the cab/front of the bed. It would be better than sideways in your car.
Cool gunship
Firefighter here, fuck you
Jesus dudeüò≠
I work for Airgas and at my store they wouldn‚Äôt let you load cylinders in your car
For some gasses (argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide), you can get away with this. For others (namely acetylene), this is a really bad idea. 

The reason is that acetylene is incredibly unstable in a purely gaseous form. A cylinder that's full of acetylene gas would be too dangerous to use because a good shock could cause thermal runaway and a big ol' fireball. For safety, the acetylene in the tank is instead dissolved in acetone or DMF and the cylinder is full of a porous medium.

If you don't have the cylinder in the upright position or, say, shake it up a bunch and don't let it settle, you might end up sucking acetone instead of acetylene out of the tank.
I don't know how your gas supplier lets you leave the parking lot. I guess it's as they say, it's not who you know, it's how you know them.
I do the same with argon, minus the one on the seat. That‚Äôs too dodgy for me üòÜ

Only ever done one bottle a time though and I wouldn‚Äôt like to see what could happen in a bad enough accident!
I was told it was to avoid all of the run around and my first thought was then why not get them all delivered? But I might be wrong, maybe that's why I'm just an employee and don't own/run a body shop lol
So I used to carry CO2 when I serviced soda fountains. We were not permitted to carry the tanks in the cab of our vehicles because a leaking valve could slowly fill the car with something other than air and suffocate us. Something to consider. Maybe leave the windows down.
Yo all jokes aside, seriously dont transport acetylene or propane tanks on their sides, thats more dangerous than people think.
Well that's super dumb
Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶..   transporting them for work - OSHA violation.   Transporting them like this for any reason - DOT violation, and trust me, the DOT has more teeth than OSHA and they love to bite!    

I‚Äôm sure there are other violations in this picture but I‚Äôve hit the two big ones.    DOT fines **go to the driver**.   The company will likely get one as well, but the driver gets their own.   I had to impress this on my techs when I transferred and took over anther office.    I was explaining the mandatory paperwork requirement for hazmat (pressurized cylinders) and the proper way to store and transport and that the fine is issued to the driver.    One of my most vocal techs that didn‚Äôt want to be bothered with it said ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll just quit if I get ticked for this‚Äù.   I nicely explained, ‚ÄúGreat, then you‚Äôll have a $5k fine and no job.   But I‚Äôll save you that problem and fire you the first time I do a spot inspection and you haven‚Äôt done your paperwork before leaving the yard‚Äù
You really should not lay acetylene tanks down. If you do they need to be upright for hours before you use them. You'll end up with liquid getting into your regulator and hose. Not only will your torch refuse to cut like that, it can blow up. 

If you don't believe me, look it up. This isn't like propane tanks that they want the pressure relief valve at the top, it's dangerous to the user.
The gas shop wouldn't let you load them in the vehicle.  Every  shop I've ever been in has before and after pics like these.
OP takes smoke breaks sitting on propane cylinders
That illegal where I live. You're not allowed to transport them inside passenger vehicles. I wouldn't drive that. That's not safe in the slightest.
Do Not lay an acetylene tank horizontally !
I have done this BS in a pinch with CO2 or N2 tanks, but yeah, you probably should not do that.  And if you do, you certainly should seatbelt/brace/strap that one on the seat before a hard brake makes for a bad day.
Would I do this for my own tanks? Sure. Maybe with some kind of securement. 

Would I do it for a company I work for in my own car? Absolutely not.
Way To Die #406: Weld-Done
Woaaaah a corolla with broadside cannons?!
Unleash broadsides!
This looks about right. The hardware store I work at exchanges tanks my favorite are the guys with them just rolling around in the back of their pickup. The ones I dislike are the ones with the raised trucks that just stand there and don't help, they always make a comment about a hurt back or shoulder, while I hurt my back/shoulder getting their tanks out/in their dumb truck.
I work at a gas supply store we would tell you to come back in a truck, and when you left call you a dumb ass
Refuse that shit. If something goes wrong you will fucking die. Your boss will get fined and then replace you with some other idiot.

Call osha and get your bosses head smashed instead, thats the right thing to do üëç
Tell me youre underpaid without telling me your underpaid.
Why is everyone freaking out?¬†
I‚Äôm scared
My refill place would refuse service.
If you work for yourself and its a short trip go for it.  If you work for someone else then don't do this.   

The Acetylene is a NO NO to lay down since there is fluid in there.  If you transport it like this you must let it sit upright for a given amount of time to let the acetylene settle back down before using.  You don't want liquid acetylene in your regulator, hoses or worse squirting out your tip while cutting/brazing.

The other tanks that hold gas don't care what way is up or down.
I like to put my tanks in the step of the van sliding door so they fall out when you open the door.
Your boss is a piece of shit for this.¬† Like¬† truly a greedy bag of dicks.


You *can* transport them like this, but when the day comes for it to go wrong, your boss isn't the one who's getting scraped from the wreckage.¬† I hope he loses his dick in a horrific accident and has to spend the rest of his life pissing in a bag.¬† That's the level of disrespect he's showing you right now.
The airgas back home has a poster that shows the aftermath of a similar scenario pretty vividly. Someone is gonna be famous and not in a good way! They‚Äôre gonna name a safely school after them.
Yeah, no
Does airgas allow this? I assume they have a don‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell policy.
Damn the shop I work at just has a milk/argon man come by on a route to all of the other shops with a massive flat bed truck with tons of empty and all tanks
I used to work for Airgas. Company policy states they shouldn't allow transportation like this. They're supposed to refuse you. If you ever get tired of using your car for this, tell your boss what I just said so they'll let you take a work truck lol

Edit: never mind I see this is a company car
You trying to make a car bomb? That's how you make a car bomb
Is funny, they wouldn't even put those tanks in the car at my local place
They should be standing straight due to leakage
NEVER EVER DO THIS! 

DOT Requires that they be transported Upright and Chained or securely Strapped to the Vehicle or an appropriate rack system designed for transporting compressed gasses tanks. 

THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE WRITTEN IN BLOOD! 

Stand your ground and if they fire you, then take them out in court! 

If the shop doesn‚Äôt have a suitable vehicle the Welding supply DOES and they DELIVER!
Crosspost to r/OSHA
You have to put the seatbelt around them.
I think the biggest concern here is the momentum these cylinders will carry directly to the front of the vehicle when you suddenly come to an abrupt stop. 

I think we all can agree that we would rather drive without high pressure cylinders but these things are impressively tough. I‚Äôve seen them dropped, I‚Äôve seen them grinded on, welded on, sent flying out of the back of a truck on the interstate.  Whether they are like this or in the bed of your truck or even mounted in a rack, any accident severe enough to rupture one of these isn‚Äôt going to be pretty anyway. 

My biggest thing is just always make sure you have your cylinder caps on.
I‚Äôm amazed by the amount of people on here that think it‚Äôs OK to do this. You guys are fucking morons. Do you know what happens if that car gets hit on the side and one of the cylinders takes off. I realize that‚Äôs highly unlikely, but it‚Äôs not impossible.
How about the fact he‚Äôs got motor oil right next to the oxygen cylinder? Do you know there‚Äôs a reason we have compressed gas cylinder transportation laws (for safety).
I don't like that the upper one is able to slam into the seats while breaking. But otherwise this is fine, if someone tbones you so hard that the valves break you already have other problems
Acetalynen needs to always stay upright or they (can) go boom when you light it
Isn't this a $10,000 fine per bottle transporting it not secured upright? (At least in the US)
ü™¨
Only legal if you drive with all the windows up
Paying the delivery charge to have them delivered properly is far less money than the payout from the lawsuit that will happen in the event of an accident. Very low chance of something bad happening but I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere around this. 

Please make sure that acetylene sits up right for a few hours before you use it.
Looks like a headache
Pretty loud when you break the first time
I saw a guy in Laos transporting his oxy setup on a scooter on the highway (highway is being generous). Just sat on top of the bottles. Final destination stuff waiting to happen.
This makes my skin crawl
Lol my guy, give god ur thanks for each day from now on.
I work at a place that sells thoroughbred gas tanks and I‚Äôve done a few like this before
"And we never heard from OP again"
my high school shop teacher just let them rattle around in the back of his pickup truck.
Back when i worked in a fab shop i hadto run to other shop for parts or whatever no license so they didnt let me drive the work truck this is how i gotter done some daysüòÇüòÇ
I knew a woman who was killed by a loose scuba tank in a car crash.
This'd be a closed lid funeral for sure.
The airgas back home has a poster that shows the aftermath of a similar scenario pretty vividly. Someone is gonna be famous and not in a good way! They‚Äôre gonna name a safely school after them.
Wow thank you for returning your tanks!
What‚Äôs in the tanks? In Australia black is oxygen. I think green is helium but it‚Äôs a different shade. Acetylene is maroon
Aloha snack bar !!!!
As long as that fuel gas bottle is stood back up and allowed to be for a period as long as it was on it's side it is fine. Never use bottles like that. And maybe not the best way to carry them cause they are too close in an enclosed space.
You smoke in your car?
This is actually illegal (USA). Flammable fuels have to be transported outside of the cabin, and exterior of the vehicle. You can't just have as your copilot.
Holy fuck dude
You need to find other employment asap.
Reminds me of when I used to follow Phish 20 years ago, stop by south Philly propane and load up on nitrous and hit the lot, $5 balloons all night.
At least the tops are on. Windows open I guess. Definately would consider seat belt though
Usually air gas wont exchange tanks In anything other then a open bed truck
Been there done that lol.
I used to have to do this in a mercury topaz‚Ä¶. Hit brakes and offf it goea
I showed up with a tank inside my truck cab and my welding supply guy told me not to do that anymore. Better off strapped in the bed. I went after work and hadn‚Äôt wanted to leave the tank in the back of my truck all day.
I drove a work truck across the country with a tank of acetylene like this in the backseat and 2 tanks of oxygen in bed wedged between a pipe threader and hdpe welder.
I freeball transport like this without caps in my pickup truck bed. But have done in my wife's car. 

Acytelene and oxygen tanks only.
Sounds like an ish you not a ish me
Most shops just gave the old rusted out truck that sounds like it‚Äôs gonna explode at 50 mph. So this dudes privileged
Safety first lol
I thought this was the OSHA sub. Sweet Jesus.
I've fit 200cf of argon in the trunk of a g37
Please don't lay acetylene cylinders on their side.
I'm a mechanic and last year I had a customer come in and complain that their CRV was shaking at 90mph, I noticed a noise when I went on the test drive and found 14 full medical oxygen bottles in the back.   I know the odds are in my favor, but christ, imagine commuting at 90+ with those things jangling around back there, eventually odds catch up with you.
I do the same thing and go way farther.. you can can fit 5 bottles in a cobalt coupe. And 8 in a cobalt sedan.
Why so many safety precautions?
Dissolved acetylene horizontal in the back seat!!!??
Crack the windows just in case there‚Äôs a leek
Jesus Christ, do not do that. Especially with acetylene of all gases. Acetylene should never be stored sideways anyways, let alone if there‚Äôs any small leak in that bottle, or it‚Äôs hot outside.
At least you got the caps on.
Do you say aloha akbar when you arrive to your destination
These should go in the front passengers floorboard and leaned back into the front seat.

Then your welding machine goes in the back seat.
Ya... my local supply let me do this once and told me never again or they'd stop selling to me. Can't say I blame them, but I was desperate.
Is this Ukraine??
You shouldn't let that oxygen bottle lay on its side. The acetylene is fine though. I actually store my acetylene like that as I use it.
People commenting about firefighters dying from fires with these tanks - but isn‚Äôt there lead caps in the top of the tanks that will melt before the heat causes enough pressure for them to explode?

Literally had a coworkers welder blow up in his van that had oxygen/acetylene tanks in there next to the welder, and when the firefighters arrived I sprinted straight to them to tell them the tanks were in there because I presumed they were going to turn into bombs.
Babies need to be in baby seats sitting upright
At least sandwich them between the front and rear seats so they sit vertically
I've been told it's bad to put tanks on their sides, not to have them strapped down, and inside a cab.  Like that's 3 different things I a fucking nobody understand are big no no's.
I drove lime five very bumpy miles with big balloons filled with oxygen acetaline mixtures once then used them as compression blasts.   Didnt even think that was a bad idea at rhe time
My back just spasmed thinking about getting these in and out.
I‚Äôd keep the windows rolled down‚Ä¶
Meh, I've had to do that. Windows cracked, just make sure the acetylene stands up straight for a few hours before tapping it!
I foresee this trip ending up like something out of Looney Tunes. That‚Äôs all, folks!
One time we used the work truck instead of my buddies car to go pickup shielding gas for his MIG machine. He just kind of threw them in the bed. It should have been fine since it was already full of shit so they wouldn't move and say below the top edge of the bed still. 

He started to pull forwards with the truck, and BANG, the distinct eary sound of a big high pressure gas tank bouncing on the ground. The entire tailgate broke off the truck under the weight of one of the bottles, 2018 f250, POS.
Subaru? I smell vape.
I was bullshitting with a friend in a group chat about his job he's quitting, he sent a photo of four empty oxygen tanks crudely ratchet strapped together because his dumbfuck boss thought that would look better than them  simply standing up in their designated area. (I don't get it either) i sarcastically asked if boss man expected someone to take them for swaps in the back seat of an intern's car, "and grab an acetylene bottle while you're there."

This is a real photo of that hypothetical ridiculous scenario that should not exist.
Yes let the flammable one roll around
Just dont crash and you will be fine.
i once transported one of those on a 500cc motorcycle lmao

ya gadda do what ya gadda do
Should buckle it in, way more gooder
Must be a shark around that needs blown up

Edit: Just noticed you got quarts of Quaker state and mobile? Which fluids you doing?
I've seen tanks being driven around in a pickup bed, no tie downs, just banging around. So in comparison, this is pretty good.
Toyota Camry is a work horse!
Bruh my civic could stand them upright wedged behind the driver seat
I'm pretty sure this is straight up illegal. They're supposed to be vertical to avoid leakage and there's no signs signifying you're transporting this for first responders. And if you were toned the caps are likely to be struck in which case they may explode or lunch from the car like a torpedo. 

Definitely refuse to keep doing this.
Idiot kids be like: Ohh galaxy gas!
Just wear safety glasses. It's fine.
Is that a pure Ar tank or one with CO2? I used to work at a gas plant and fill these.
A pot grower taught you that shit
Question: wouldn't this be okay if the tanks were argon only?
Not gonna lie, I did this last weekend.
Come with me... follow me... to a world of broken osha regulations...
Put a towel down or something lol it‚Äôs not that hard
I've forgotten how much I miss those back of seat pockets
Not ghetto. IW approved
Sure this isn't just a repost? Saw it everywhere yesterday
Juss keep the windows down‚Ä¶
I helped my dad exchange his tanks as a kid in an 02 Accord. Hadn't crossed my mind until seeing your post now
I did this for years with a Chevy prism.  Just don't wreck.
No car seat?
In IL that‚Äôs illegal and I wouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to let you leave the premises like that without calling the police. That many and that large have to be upright and secured in an unenclosed space without passengers sharing the space.
That's how I exchange my oxy-acetylene tanks except they're rolling around the back of my chevy suburban. It's only a 4.5mile drive from the farm to Napa so it's not that bad...mostly country roads.
You got to do what you got to do.
I hope you're letting your acetylene cylinders rest upright for at least a day after transporting them horizontally like this.
You don‚Äôt have a trunk?
I ride around with two propane and an o2 tank. You hit me, we both lose!
It's like $50 to have Airgas deliver vs picking up. And if you are a regular customer, you can wheel and deal better prices or shop around. This is just ridiculous.
That certainly looks like tanks being transported to be exchanged. Thank you for the post
Don't get pulled over and don't let your business's insurance company, auto insurance company see that picture.
This is fucking dangerous OP. The welding shop I go to won‚Äôt even sell/rent you a bottle if you‚Äôre transporting it in a car. If you have to slam on the brakes or run into something, those heavy-ass gas bottles are going to keep going forward, crushing the seat and you.¬†
Me who just kinda tosses bottles in bed truck, good nuff. Gets home without issue and no kablewys, grabs tank, at that immediate moment nuclear size explosions happen. Wipes out whole state of Ohio specifically somehow. US becomes a much worse place as it really was the heartbeat of the USA.
Anybody else cringe themselves inside out when they saw this?
Every time I‚Äôve gone to air gas they ask if I have an open bed pickup before selling to me.  They will not sell cylinders if you don‚Äôt have an open vehicle.
The ole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt brake too fast method.‚Äù
Aren‚Äôt they not allowed to let you transport these in a closed space?
Ever thought of calling the supplier and asking for a delivery?  This seems ridiculous to me.
Seems illegal.
Seems legit.
You have a 75/25 chance of surviving.
I lay them in the back of the truck. They are tough‚Ä¶ they way they stand side by side without racks at the welding supply is scarier than that.
Secure.them please.
wow.  quit now.  very easily hire a service like praxair and have them come and exchange.  just wow.
Lol I've done this many times
Put an explosive hazmat sticker on your bumpers and you‚Äôre good üëç
You guys don‚Äôt just drag them with a ratchet strap?
These tanks are meant to never be laying on their side, empty or full.
They used to tell us NEVER to transport Acetylene tanks on their sides.  Something about the calcium carbonate in those tanks screwing up the valves?  Not sure about it, but maybe someone knows?
Why in the Isaac Newton fuck are those tanks horizontal?
What‚Äôs the black one nitrogen mix? And green argon? Reminder Acetylene should never be stored on its side.
Pretty brave but also pretty dangerous
all my friends talking about how they absolutely need a pick up truck for grocery shopping and here I am on this type shit

As long as you let the acetylene stand up straight for a few hours before using it you'll be fine. Just gotta let the acetone settle
i hope those are MT!

You have the caps on that‚Äôs all that matters
For those of us that don't get the inside joke - why bad?
Bro please just have the airgas or ehstever the hell pick them up and deliver them

The risk of two ground-to-ground missiles in the back seat of your car during an accident isn't worth the $50 delivery fee.
Once took the work van home one night, wondering what the rattling was, pulled up after a few miles and had 5, 47 litre tanks of oxygen and acetylene that had just been fcuked in from the last job bouncing about
Wild to think how big of a crater this will leave eventually
Road safety engineer. I did some forensic work and seen some crazy cases.

Anything loose in a car becomes a projectile during a crash. A realatviley minor accident can cause some serious bodily damage if these are not strapped down.
And kablooey.
That‚Äôs crazy brother..
Crazy
Dumbest thing I've seen in a while
This is just fucking stupid. If it's only 2 blocks away put them upright on a dolly or something. You're playing with your life (and potentially someone else's.)
And? I used to run them in the back of a Kia for years.
Thirteen years in the industry and this is an absolute no go.  Do not do this.  Acetylene cylinders should not go on their side. 

At 125 degrees Fahrenheit the pressure relief values will likely release and you will have an explosive mixture that is shock intolerant, and easily ignited.  Even if there is a small leak, the gas can accumulate quickly in a car.  Transport them securely attached to a vehicle with an open bed as the gas companies do.
Don‚Äôt care what anyone says here. It‚Äôs fine
Bro, this is so bad. Not only does this go against what airgas advises but it‚Äôs also against DOT transportation standards. 

Don‚Äôt put flame ox or fuel ox mixtures on the side. That‚Äôs a good way to blow up.

A 0.6% acetylene mix with the wrong amount of solvent can make you blow up. I just did my flame and fuel gas trainings for air gases medical division.
JFC. Put them in the boot/trunk with some tie downs, and fasten the rear seatbelts (incase they smash through the rear seats in a crash).
Honestly the amount of times I‚Äôve seen trucks used to move tiny as shit at work seems wasteful I low-key this this is smart af. granted yall should do something to secure that top bottle
That's pretty much how I haul mine in my Suburban, but in the very far back. I open the windows for continuous fresh air.
Can someone please explain why this is bad
Whatever, I let several 300 pounders roll back-and-forth in the back of my Subaru.

Doesn‚Äôt matter what gas is in the cylinder. They are not designed or made to be used, stored, or transported horizontally.              
Full, empty or in-between doesn‚Äôt matter.            
That‚Äôs illegal in my part of the world fwiw.

r/oopsthatsdeadly
Had? I'm so sorry for your loss! Was it from holding the tanks? Happy cake day btw!
Nope, it's the shop car. A 2016 Toyota Corolla. Could one count this as an aftermarket torpedo launcher?
I would love a picture of the article
My supplier has a photo of an exploded van on a label hanging on the neck of each acetylene cylinder.
The funny things is.... none of that happens now that modern hydro tests happen every time a tank comes in.
OP is going to decide to disregard this comment.
I have seen a similar photo of not that one. The tires, or what was left of them were parallel to the road.
That was the acetylene cylinder.
I've seen this picture taped to the counter at airgas.
I thought every welding supplier had that picture just to deter shit like this.  I hope he drives them with the windows wide open
In all fairness might've killed em regardless of how it was being transported. Not much for safety on those old tanks. When I exchanged my dad's oxy-acetylene tanks from the 70s I had to pay an extra $70 due to the old valves on them.
Get your valves checked regularly I guess.
As long as they let it rest upright for a day or so, it would be okay, no?
To everybody freaking out about safety chill out. Unless you have a rig most of the time these bottles just get laid down in the bed of your truck, I‚Äôve done it plenty. Just let your acetylene stand up for the appropriate amount of time and you‚Äôll be fine.
What about me? Can I do it?
Soooo.....what?  Rent a Uhaul truck and strap the tanks with 10 straps for a 2 block transport?!  Guess you better not accidently drop it coming off the truck.  I guess you need a gantry crane now.
Not just because the orientation is dumb either - you have to be placarded and operating under a CDL w/ HAZMAT endorsement to transport stuff like this on the road. 

Getting pulled over would be a *big* deal (likely felony).
You can put it on its side, you just have to leave it upright for 12+ hours before use to let the acetone settle out of the pumice substrate that they use to deaden any sloshing.
Yeah, no. Ace can be transported on their side but need to be left to stand vert for a little while before use. Other tanks it doesn't matter as long as you use them in the correct orientation. 
Trying to strap a vertical cylinder that may be upwards of 4-5' tall to the front of the average pickup truck bed which isn't even 2' tall is just asking for problems. If it has a headache bar on the truck to strap the top to that may be a different story. Otherwise, If it doesn't have a purpose built rack or similar: cap it(if applicable), lay it down with the bottom against the front of the bed or gate in some situations.  Block it and strap it(multiple).
Okay but did you even stop to think about the shareholders?
They could move the front seat forward and lean it against the back. Wouldnt be upright, but it would be upright enough to keep the solvent off the seals.
I work in a hospital and people transport oxygen tanks sideways on patients bed all the time and then we take it off and store it upright. But that‚Äôs medical grade O2
How about if I can't fit it upright in the back of my SUV, better to angle 45 than lay down flat, presumably?
Yes^

There is some kind of wood inside, it soaks up the stuff. Meant to stay upright.
All guns loaded port side captain!
But if something happens they will just rocket out the side of the car and into whatever is beside them.  It's completely fine as long as they put one of those baby on board style signs on the back window. 

Also a firefighter and to find those in a car during a fire or extrication would be a pucker factor. We had a small hobby sized acetylene bottle blow up in a car and kill the driver. They had it unrestrained in the hatchback area. Blew the windows out of the buildings next to it.
You are just jealous of his efficiency
It's a fun surprise!¬†
hey, be nice, you wouldn‚Äôt have a job without people like this.
when?
I had an guy at airgas tell me that a lady that owned a party store would transport helium tanks in her SUV. She got popped and had to pay $10k. He said his first day on the job delivering he dropped off the tanks and forgot to change the hazard sign on the truck/ A cop pulled him over and give him a ticket. It was $2500. And he was making $15/hr.
I keep forgetting there are regular airgas stores, but I know that we have very strict packing procedures and we have removed entire shipping companies from our list for laying cylinders on their sides.
Central didn't care when I grabbed a mini argon tank
One more reason to not use airgas.
It‚Äôs fine as long as you leave it upright for an appropriate amount of time to let everything settle. A lot of welders, plumbers, construction workers do not have a rig that will let their bottle stand up in the back so they lay it down in the bed of their truck.
Our gas supply makes you receive the tanks outside on their side porch.  I always figured it was so they weren't responsible for what you did with it after.  Last time I got acetylene, a guy in a beater pickup took his bottle and put it in the back of his pickup loose.  Haven't heard of any explosions, so I guess it works for him.  I somehow got the impression he was a plumber, so this seems to be how he transports it to a jobsite.
Bet they slapped airgas stickers on the tanks
It's cheaper to pay you than to have then delivered. At least until they get a fine(your fine likely wouldn't matter to them). 

You wouldn't even fall under the MOT(MATERIALS OF TRADE) exception but i don't think it would be hard for you meet the requirements. 

If it wasn't for it being a shop vehicle (though you could say you are borrowing it) it would be easier to say they are for personal use (but that would be lying and may include some other ethical/moral/legal/liability issues. But if everyone sticks to the same story....)
Propane? Aren't forklift tanks always on their side?

I'm also curious, I'm transporting my 20L Argon and 10L CO2 in my car as well and I don't see the issue if the safety cap is on. Only person that's freaking out is my wife that we gonna blow up at the slightest bump in the ground while she knows I'm welding near a rack of 6 50Liters tubes 8 hours a day.
[The reason why](https://youtu.be/qJLf_5RJFG8?feature=shared)
I think it is because most of the ‚Äúwelders‚Äù you meet online are in the first semester of trade school and don‚Äôt have much field experience yet.
They do when they are in operation, but not for transport. Their contents are in both liquid and gas form (at least when they aren't nearly empty), if the valve is below the level of the valve when the valve is open it will blow out the liquid contents instead of gas, then the gas will rapidly boil producing way more volume of gas than the valve would normally allow out while chilling everything in touches, which is dangerous if you aren't connecting it to a device that is intended to use the gas in liquid form.
My point exactly.. everyone was looking at me like I was the idiot for refusing to drive em over. Delivery of them is the obvious choice especially because we a are a very busy shop and need them filled pretty often.
I bet the firefighters that show up to find this surprise would be super thrilled, if they survive
In a crash that shears off the valve, there's a decent chance you're injured.

But after the car is filled with argon, there's a decent chance you die right there.
Reasonable. The one on the seat would be better off with the others, maybe with them strapped together.  Yeah, if you get hit that hard that the cap gets damaged enough to allow the valves to be damaged you're likely already fucked. I would have the valves on the driver's side though if they werent inert though. A passenger side t bone may not kill you but if the valve does happen to leak due to such i really don't want to burn to death. 
In the event of a roll over the damage one of those tanks could do would be gruesome. Other things to worry about though.
They can be on their side for transport as long as you set them back up for an equal amount of time before you use it.
It won't go boom if you let it settle first. It'll take hours but it's perfectly fine.
No it is very common to transport laid down in the bed of the truck. I think the comment section is freaking out because most of the ‚Äúwelders‚Äù you meet online are still in welding school and they don‚Äôt have much field experience yet.
My local gas shop will not deliver to a residential address.  My side business is at my house.
My local shop wouldn‚Äôt accept those let alone let him drive off with a new set that way.
So‚Ä¶ does the liquid oxygen damage the valve?

Mom had the hand truck thingy for moving oxygen tanks (nursing home) collapse under her once. Put a two inch deep crater in a linoleum-over-concrete floor.

Fortunately, it mostly just rattled around making an ungodly amount of noise and didn't travel far. No one was (physically) harmed.

There was a good deal of WTF?! and cautious peering around corners by staff and patients.
Yes, that's a good call, it's a good thing he didn't even try to use a seatbelt to hold it in place.
Having your car's oxygen displaced by an inert gas is a peaceful way to die but can be a bit frightening for other road users.
Yeah
My LWS won't let you take an acetylene tank off the property unless it's in a pick up bed or on a trailer. A leaky acetylene tank in a vehicle is a bomb.

Few years back I went on a highway accident, looked like the dude hydroplaned, straightened back out and then went directly into a tree. Hop out of the ambulance and walk up to find his head literally exploded against said tree with a tank resting on top of his body where his head originally sat. DOA (no shit) and from what we figured out, he had it in the trunk of the sedan ratchet strapped down to the trunk floor to prevent it from rolling side to side on turns, but nothing to stop it going front or back; when he hit the tree the thing basically got launched from the sudden stop up the rear seat like a ramp directly into the back of his head. Not sure if the seat was folded down before hand or not, but with how fast he had to have been going judging by the front end damage, the tank very well may have busted the seat right over. Point is strap the fuck out of heavy shit.
Life is Natural Selection...
I had a buddy who used to keep a sledgehammer in the back of his car for whatever reason unsecured and I always told him to find a way to strap it down. He finally got in a crash at some point with his seats folded down and that sledge hammer moved from the trunk to about 30 feet in front of his car through the windshield. Don‚Äôt keep shit loose in your car if you aren‚Äôt willing to get hit by it.

Wrong
I work at an airgas test center.  They get tested once every 5 or 10 years depending on the cylinder.
Tanks are tested every 10 years. The test dates are stamped on the top of each tank.
Ain't we all?
Pretty sure you only have to worry about letting acetylene tanks stand upright for a bit before using (others you can stand them up and use them).
"objects in motion will stay in motion"

so yeah, if you wanna die when you crash.
30 minutes if it's only a short time. By short time I mean about 45 minutes to 2 hours. After that it's recommended to let them sit for an hour. I've driven them 15 minutes lying down, stood them up, connected the regulators and got my striker glasses and gloves on and never had an issue.
This is a big no-no for acetylene, for welding gases it's not as much of a hazard.
Yeah. If you have to lay say acetylene on it‚Äôs side you have to let it sit for two hours for the acetone to be sure to do its thing I was taught.
That‚Äôs only acetylene
No. We‚Äôre not even supposed to let acetylene mixes roll for 2 hours on its side.
The risk is the bottle failing somehow
It‚Äôs not the laying down, it‚Äôs laying down in an enclosed space that‚Äôs the concern. If the tank leaks, it could turn the car into a gas chamber. Unlikely, sure, but possible and has happened. Our local gas supply will not allow us to transport in anything other than an open back truck.
Both DOT and TC allow 5 tanks in a personal vehicle without placards. OPs setup is completely fine other than heavy shit rolling around in his car and the acetylene needing to settle upright before use
Just had a look-see what we were told and ours gives an hour for workshop conditions or 15 minutes in the field (shit hits the fan and it's time critical).


Far cry from the 12 hours which seems massively overkill...
My boss says 2 hours but I'm pretty sure that's accounting if you have the largest size which is I believe at least 300 cubic
I set mine for half an hour and it's pretty good. Gas supply said 30m so that's what I went with.
True, but it should still probably be done as little as possible and would definitely be better to transport upright.
If this is a joke, I'm sorry, but I really don't understand it. If I were a shareholder, i would value safety above all. Nothing can tank a stock more than the results of cutting corners
It is perfectly safe to transport a sealed acetylene bottle on its side assuming that you leave it sitting upright for an adequate length of time for the acetone to soak back into the substrate before opening the valve. Nobody seems to agree on how long exactly to leave it upright, the highest I have seen reported is 24 hours maximum, but at least as long as the bottle was horizontal, 1, 2, and 4 hours are commonly reported
I suppose. I'm more of a total safety guy, so I would say figure out another way, but these other people are right about letting sit upright for some time, I just prefer total safety.
I have a genuine, serious question. So I have a trailer in storage with an Acetylene bottle in it, hobby size you get at Home Depot. It gets pretty hot and cold here in TN at times, it is under an awning in the shade though. The bottle should be sitting upright in a box. Is this a possible major problem? I had no idea how volatile this stuff was but it's been in the back of my mind.
Without ppl like this he could just be a cat rescuer‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall irresponsible folk standin in the way of his dream‚Ä¶ so sad
without people like this, firefighters wouldn't get blown up in random explosions when responding to a vehicle fire with unmarked hazardous materials on board.
Not great, but at least that gas is completely inert.
I work for a chemical company and it's wild to me what some of these couriers will put in their personal vehicles or transport without the proper placards. 

Gonna be a bad day if they get pulled over once of these days
"regular airgas stores" compared to??
Yep, HAZMAT transport laws are not a joke. Once you anything over 1000 lbs (cylinder weight) for most gasses is subject to HAZMAT transportation regulations, which is about 6 standard full size cylinders. 

Used to work for a welding supply/ specialty gas company myself so we did it all (industrial to medical and beyond) and I did pretty much every job there including driving. 

The party lady in the upper comments messed up. I have told customers on many occasions that they were transporting at their own risk and advised them of possible fines if they got pulled over that we would nit be liable for. Some were smart and asked if they could take a second trip. Most were not.
Thats argon. Argon is okay to do this with. One of the least reactive elements in existence.
I hate airgas
True, but it's hard to know what constitutes an appropriate amount of time. That's why a lot of bottle exchanges will decline doing the exchange if you can't transport the bottle properly. It's a huge liability.
A lot of the guys in this comment section are overreacting, these bottles are made for pretty tough environments and pretty stupid people
Not the same bottle and not for the same use
Federal DOT laws state that all high pressure cylinders must be transported in the vertical position and in either an open air bed or a compartment vented to the atmosphere.


https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/177.840
Irrelevant here since OP is doing this for work.
It's not great that the acetylene is on the seat, unrestrained.  I agree it's not likely to do much since the cap is on. It is possible that a wreck would dislodge the cap though, especially since the tank is unrestrained.
The big issue is specifically acetylene not argon or CO2 because acetylene has some really funky behaviour when in a gas state at more then 15 psi.

Acetylene bottles actually dissolve the gas in a solvent that is held in a matrix to keep the stuff from spontaneously coming apart and causing the bottle to explode, this works less well when the bottle is tipped sideways.

CO2 like Propane is stored as a liquid at relatively modest pressure.

Argon and oxygen are stored as gasses at very high pressure and will turn the bottle into a rocket if the stem gets broken, in addition, oxy tends to make all the things burn.
Honestly a pretty tame example, if the gas comes out at the right angle it moves like a rocket and can punch holes through the wall and leave the shop
No cap on that one. Also how is this any different from throwing it in a truck bed?¬†
Well that‚Äôs hardly like to happen in the backseat of his car.

The issue is only if he has an accident and the bottles go sideways up his ass
[Acetylene cylinders shall be secured in an upright position at all times except, if necessary, for short periods of time while cylinders are actually being hoisted or carried](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1915/1915.55#) -OSHA
"Compressed gas cylinders can be very dangerous when they aren‚Äôt stored properly, and because of this OSHA usually will assess violations involving compressed gasses as serious. That means that each of the violations ends up costing between $1,500 and $7,000 as long as it is a first time offense. Repeated offenses can cost a company even more money.
On Dec 28 in 2011 the Huntington Ingalls shipyard was hit with a very serious set of penalties amounting to $176,000 in all. Among their 50 different safety violations many of them were due to improperly handling, labeling, and storing their compressed gas cylinders. OSHA is always looking into these matters, and they penalize very heavily in situations where workers are put in danger because gas cylinders aren‚Äôt handled and stored properly."
Not knocking anyone for hustling. I‚Äôve done my fair share of sketchy shit. I sell gas and welding supplies and they make us watch safety videos showing what can go wrong. I may be slightly paranoid.
Actually, the sloshing liquid oxygen generates a very strong magnetic field That could easily cause the car to implode

The seat belt probably made a difference, though when I was strapping it, I thought I was being overly cautious (turns out it was the right amount).

I remember this every time I carry anything in my vehicles, especially now that I also carry my kids.
I‚Äôm now rethinking the 8 pound sledge, multiple sleever bars, spudwrenches, bullpins, bridge clamps and other heavy metal objects in the back of my Toyota Corolla

We had an 08 Honda minivan that would absolutely roast the tires if it was damp.
I‚Äôm still driving a ‚Äò06 rolla

Damn, that's more impressive than my '88 r3500.
I ran a mobile weld repair business out of a Hyundai Elantra for 5 years. The Corolla beats the shit out of that.

ETA: I now run it out of a RAV4, which beats the shit out of the corolla
Yeah the car that is beat to shit because it works just as much as we do lol. Our shop truck is an old 2004 Ford F-150 that does literally everything, from plowing the lot, towing vehicles in the shop, picking up parts.
Yup mine too
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK Airgas.
I mean personally, I try not to ignore information that could possibly save my life. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah, most cylinders are just compressed gas over liquid or just compressed gas depending on the pressure remaining just like a propane tank on a grill or forklift, but acetylene doesn't compress well so acetylene cylinders are a porous sponge like material soaked in acetone with the acetylene dissolved in the acetone. If you tip the bottle the acetone can seep out of the "sponge" and sit on the top of the tank for a while, then if you open the valve without leaving it to sit upright long enough so the acetone can soak back in it can spray some of the acetone out of the tank and release way more acetylene than intended. With the standard compressed gas tanks this isn't an issue because the liquid flows to the bottom pretty much immediately, you could even technically run them on their sides if you could reliably check where the liquid levels are to be sure it is below the valve with an adequate safety margin (or in some cases intentionally run them upside down if you are performing an operation that requires the contents in liquid form, like with liquid propane evaporative cooling).
I know you aren‚Äôt supposed to use the acetylene after it‚Äôs been on its side right away. What I remember learning was to wait 1 hour and only transport them sideways when you must.
Worth
Nah just the cars to their right lmao
Well that‚Äôs not entirely true. Objects in motion stay in motion: until they are slowed down a little by the friction from OPs brain.
I guess the seats are jello?
It making an emergency stop
Don't crash
I think it's "objects in motion tend to stay in motion". If it isn't than it should be.
You can safely transport acetylene on it's side, you just need to stand it upright for at least as long as you left it on its side, or preferably 24 hours before opening the bottle.
Might get inerts all over the seats.
Acetylene is a welding gas.
Another reason you want to sit your bottle back to vertical after its been on its side is the acetone will eat the diaphragm in your regulator if you use it rightvaway
I thought it was up to 1000lbs
I could see a lawyer or someone putting a 12 hour warning out there somehow, but yeah - I don't get what would happen in the 5th hour that wouldn't happen in the 1st
I have heard everything from 15 minutes to 12 hours. Better to just not lay them down üòÇ
I was taught it needs to be upright for the same amount of time it was on its side or no less than 4 hours.  

So if you put it in its side drive 5 mins across the job sight you only need it upright for 5 mins.   
But if you forget it's laying flat in the back of the work truck at the end of the shift Friday before you use it Monday it needs to be upright for at least 4 hours before using it.
I had my kid get me an acetylene tank a couple weeks ago and he laid it down. It was still sucking liquid after 2 hours. I left it and it was fine in the morning.
Nah you‚Äôre good, I fully agree! Comment was a joke, fuck the shareholders if they don‚Äôt value safety
Bottles are usually filled no more than 80% to leave expansion area if the bottle gets hot. My ace bottle lives in a non climate controlled environment but is shaded, never had any problems. I'm always spooked about running the bottle below 50 psi when it's below zero in the shop though. (arbitrary number I picked -- 10x the 5psi I usually run my torch at).

Edit: Check how much the bottle is filled with the regulator and so long as you got some 10-20% headway you got no worries about storing the bottles. Pipeliners run trucks in the desert with these bottles exposed for weeks at a time, in the storage shed will be fine. :)
He said she had 5-6 bottles in her SUV when she got pulled over. 

He also said gas suppliers get inspected regularly and sometimes the inspectors will hang out down the street and watch.
My division only deals with medical customers so we have a medical store front and we mainly ship products to our customers. We do have specialty medical gas stores
My local Airgas wouldn‚Äôt let me load Argon in my car. The danger is the cylinder leaks and fills the car with inert gas while you‚Äôre driving, causing asphyxiation. Very unlikely to happen, but potentially terrible consequences.
No? It‚Äôs not hard, what do you mean? If all you did was drive it home it‚Äôll only need a few hours 8 max. If you‚Äôre still feeling squirrelly let it sit overnight.
Seriously, he's just driving a couple blocks. The most likely incident is whoever has to unload them throwing their back out.
Gotcha
So front seat sticking out the sun roof with the windows down. Got it.

Edit: /s
From your link

>(1) Cylinders. Cylinders containing Class 2 gases must be securely restrained in an upright or horizontal position, 

So no, not all cylinders need to be upright or vertical when transported. They do all need to be secured though. 

Now under section (3) for 2.3 (Gas poisonous by inhalation) it‚Äôs different and they do need to be vertical in transport.
so...high pressure laying down, vs standing up?  How will a stem get broken with the cover on?  Only issue I see is that they didn't strap them in with the seat belts, and now it's just a heavy object.  
FFS, this isn't magic.  It's physics.
That's what the cap is for¬†
Yup üöÄ
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying, I don‚Äôt think most of these guys are speaking from practical experience.
I definitely know you don‚Äôt have much experience because you are quoting OSHA
That doesn‚Äôt sound correct
If you‚Äôre finding welding gas in the dumpster behind Wendy‚Äôs, I need to know what Wendy‚Äôs you‚Äôre going to. Asking for a friend
If you have the seats up you‚Äôll be fine. If they‚Äôre down though I wouldn‚Äôt have that shit loose in there personally.
Same. I'm worried about my Iron Maiden CDs in the glove box.

I'm not a welder so this is going to sound like a stupid question, but where do you put that big box with the fuel tank, generator, transformer etc.?
I actually commented a bit more of a detailed explanation of what's inside an Ace tank earlier and the problem with laying them on their side.  More correct info is good though and i rather see correct info get repeated than incorrect info. 
The"sponge"  likely isn't what most people would picture inside. Voids are tiny.

The seats are made from foam and aluminium, and will not stop a weight slamming in to them from behind.

Take it up with Isaac newton
Well if you want the actual law, it‚Äôs ‚Äúobjects in motion remain in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force‚Äù
What reality do you live in where objects only "tend" to stay in motion until acted on by an exterior force?
Possibility of a small gas leak from the acetylene. Last thing you would want is gas leaking into an enclosed space. I have seen a tank that leaks from the valve threads.
I don't know any welders that use acetylene to weld but i sure do know a bunch that use it to cut metal.
Haven't seen how viscous acetone is so maybe it might be an issue that takes 12 hours to resolve itself? Not sure.
You're accounting for the LCD when you stretch times on instructions. If you put 5 hours someone would leave it for 2 hours, and say "that's close enough to 5"
Well. That sounds great until you have to transport them unless you have a cradle or rack to secure them in. You'll never see me transport any cylinder upright unless it is secured in a rack or cradle.
Doesn't seem to be a hard and fast rule on this, unsure of a scenario where the 15 minute timer would come into play where we wouldn't use a thermal lance instead.


As others have said, easier to just not lay it down if at all possible.
Never knew that but not surprising. Lots of money to be made in the medical field. One would think a standard airgas store would also supply the medical gas(which I'm sure they do) along with the accessories but I'm sure when it comes to certain people the marketing is what matters/sells.
Then just put the windows down and you should be good üòä
Is that really an issue if the fix to the problem is "crack a window"?
So if you're a plumber with a tank in your truck you're going to get to the job site and wait 8 hours before lighting your torch?
The covers don't really help with the acetylene thing however, and it is not higher pressure but a larger gas volume that can be the issue.

The other gasses just need strapping down, but the acetylene has potentially got other issues, hard to tell how serious because all the gas suppliers will use an 'abundance of caution' when talking about this stuff.
The issue isn't the high pressure laying down, it's that the acetylene tank is entirely unlike any other gas tank. It's filled with a porous medium and the acetylene gas is dissolved in acetone, so if a tank is ever laid on its side for *any amount of time at all* the safe thing to do is stand it back up and lock it out for 24hrs. If the tank is opened and any acetone is discharged from flowing into the porous structure at the top, there is more airspace for the acetylene to vaporize. If that breaches 15 PSI, the tank can spontaneously detonate. 

Transporting an intensely volatile gas in a way that is directly against the safety processes of interacting with it that ALSO makes it dangerous for an entire day once it's back in the shop is stupidly reckless. Airgas delivery fees are like $60 at my shop and we get four times as many bottles. This guy's boss is trying to save pennies and causing a potentially deadly hazard, it ain't worth it.
Having the stem broken off may be a common point of failure but it‚Äôs not the only one. That tank might not fare so well if the car is t-boned
Just saying what the potential fines are. Whether they're enforced or not is a different matter.
Not a stupid question, I‚Äôm using a miller Multimatic 220 ac/dc inverter machine that‚Äôs is pretty compact, an 80 cf argon or 75/25 bottle, and if I bring a generator, it‚Äôs a 5500 watt generator that‚Äôs small enough to fit in the car. It‚Äôs all pretty compact, but powerful enough to fix nearly anything.
Yah the I imagine the sponge is a bit more solid state like a carbon filter but
That isn't what i stated. "objects in motion tend to stay in motion" is what i stated in response to whoever saying " objects in motion stay in motion". I never said "until acted on by another force". Remember, it's important to not let your emotions interfere with your ability to comprehend what was clearly stated because shit like this will often happen.  i stated what i intended to. Once you add anything to it it is no longer a statement i made and becomes a delusion of your own. 

What i stated "objects in motion tend to stay in motion" is more accurate than "objects in motion stay in motion" because if an object in motion stayed in motion it would never stop being in motion.  Of course, if someone adds more to it then it's no longer the original statement. (who would have thought?)

Tend-regularly or frequently behave in a particular way or have a certain characteristic.

Last time i checked we are all in the same "reality" where everything we interact with and experience will be acted on by another force which is likely why the "until acted on by another force" is commonly dropped. 

So yes, an object in motion tends to stay in motion... It tends to stay in motion because of its inertia/momentum(not having that argument)  would normally keep it moving until acted on by another force which sometimes results in it almost stopping instantly.
You can weld with a torch although it isn't super common these days except for brazing, which isn't technically welding but is close enough that it often gets lumped in. Torch welding was more common when less shops had access to enough power delivery to handle electric welders, and is mostly still used in locations where it is difficult to access large amounts of power like way up on a steel structure, remote rail line access, or hobbyist and farm shops way out in the boonies.
Oxy-acetylene welding was traditionally the first process taught in welding school long ago. The other gasses are shielding gas but I guess I get why they are called welding gas. It just seems odd to me that the only gas that actually allows welding with it is left out of the category.
Acetone is probably the least viscous liquid you regularly encounter. Less than 1/3rd the viscosity of water.
You know nail polish remover? About like that, so basically water... I guess it's more of an ambient temperature and substrate density thing.
Correct. Normally people use a truck or something that allows for that. I‚Äôve actually never seen someone just toss them in the back seat of their car like this. Lol
Yeah I just never lay them down. I've heard getting liquid in your regulator can wreck it too. The only way to find out if the liquid settled back down is to try it. It's not worth the screwing around
Yeah, but it is often impractical to not lay it down. A welding shop might have a dedicated truck with a rack for mounting them upright, but just about every hobbyist doesn't and are just going to put the cylinder in the bed of their truck or trunk of their car and maybe strap it down if they have tie down points, they aren't going to have the time, money, or space for a rack that they might not even end up using once every year depending on how often their projects require acetylene.
You need certain licenses to distribute to hospitals and other medical facilities so its possible they are separate entities on paper owned by the same parent company
The trigger to breathe is not the lack of oxygen, it's the buildup of CO2. So in an inert atmosphere caused by an Argon leak, you might not immediately notice the lack of oxygen. By the time you're feeling lightheaded and dizzy, you would be entering dangerous conditions where passing out is not far off.

As I said, it would be very unlikely to happen, as the cylinder would need a big leak, your car's HVAC system would have to be off or on recirculate, and you'd have to be deaf or blasting the radio to not hear the cylinder hissing. But the outcome would be the driver/passenger potentially passing out, causing a wreck, and/or dying from asphyxiation, so while the risk is low, the consequence is high.
No I‚Äôd pick it up the day before because I‚Äôm not a fucking idiot
Yeeeeah, I didn't notice the ACE take was in there.  But also, it's still okay to have on the side, just be careful about it. 

But, who besides companies use specialized tank transportation?  And even then, as we can tell from OP....some don't care.

I mean, hell, we have specialized training for work dealing with compressed gasses and tanks.  We get our stuff from Keen direclty.   My welding biz at home?  I'm putting my tanks in the car and driving the 5 miles to Keen.
Of course just like it wouldn't if it gets hit while in a truck.¬†
Brother it is a rule of physics. A hard fact. Things DO keep moving, until acted on by an exterior force. 

You should go look this up.
Never actually looked it up technically but yeah. Acetone is much thinner than water.
Was always under the assumption it was more of a spongy membrane rather than a liquid.


Only cylinder with questionable contents as of the medium the acetylene is absorbed into.
Used a 2m length of U steel as a cradle for steel, that was sketchy as fuck despite being strapped down and secured with kit around it.


Took corners *very* wide to not risk it, even if it was Corgon.
For the last 3 years or so somewhere between every 3 to 6 maybe 9 months i end up loading the cylinders into the bed of my truck. I think it's 4 of the large 2-300 Cuft.( I think. I'm 6' tall and they are somewhere around chest height and quite a bit fatter than my others)  oxygen cylinders. 2 Ace cylinders. 3-4 125cuft c25 cylinders, and usually 2-4: standard grill propane tanks. They all the valves tightened one last time, get capped nice and snug. Lay them flat in my bed, blocked enough so they likely wouldn't move without straps and then i strap the hell out of them and make sure to leave with plenty of time to make the 1 hour trip each way to where i go.
So‚Ä¶ just crack a window while transporting it.
Orrr you could *open the window before getting in.*
Not everyone isn't a fucking idiot, and a lot of people don't stay at the same job long enough to wait. If you're on the clock and have a bunch of jobs to travel to, waiting for the bottles to settle is just wasted time and money. So the idiots push it a little. Then they get lucky, so they push it a little more.

It's a lot easier to say "don't be a moron, secure your bottles properly" than to say "well, you can do it that way as long as you're willing to sit on your hands for a few hours. Also if you are storing your bottles improperly they're more likely to tip and you can damage them. And places won't exchange your bottle if you roll up in a Corolla because if you blow your ass up they might get sued."

You can list all the specific ways to do something dumb safely, or you can just not do the dumb thing. Get a smaller bottle that you can put vertically on the floor boards and ratchet strap it to the back of the passenger seat or something.
It is also regulation that they be transported upright in many places the side of a cylinder can take a pretty hard hit
Except in a truck, the pressure is being released outside the cabin where the humans are sitting.
Viscosity isn‚Äôt the only relevant property though. Especially when mixed in with a porous solid as it is here. You‚Äôd be more concerned about adhesion, or electromagnetic interactions between the liquid and the solid. Acetone is even more polar than water, so may actually pass through the substrate *slower* despite being less viscous. But I don‚Äôt know for sure. It wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to test.
Spongey membrane... Are you talking about the inside of an acetylene cylinder? 
When first looking into it i remember reading it was pumice(stone. Same thing in commonly used to hand cleaners like gojo and fast orange). More recently i kept seeing "diatomaceous earth" and "silica based" materials. 

To my understanding the acetylene gas is actually dissolved into the acetone inside the cylinder which slowly is released (think soda. The carbon dioxide is dissolved into the liquid. When left to sit the carbon dioxide will slowly escape. If opened quickly though it may "explode" which is comparable to having your ace regulator too high allowing the acetone to escape). The solid material inside of the cylinder stabilizes it (how? I don't remember. I'm thinking it slows the release maybe by traping the gas or maybe limit the surface area)
Acetone cylinders are acetone soaked into a material that acts like a sponge
Like I said above, you should do that. But AirGas attorneys decided that relying on customers to do the smart thing was not a good business decision. I‚Äôm not saying cylinders shouldn‚Äôt be kept in cars, I‚Äôm explaining why AirGas has made rules based on liability.
You could and should, but at some point AirGas attorneys decided that relying on customers to do the smart thing was not a good business decision.
I believe definitely a surface area or volume thing. If you use piping/manifolds that are sized too large... Boom. It can explode. Lol
I'm going to have to look into it later or the next time i remember. 
I never heard about the piping/manifold size causing an issue but i have heard to never turn the regulator above 15psi

You need to apply torque near the base. It‚Äôs twisted because the metal is weaker. Get a pipe wrench around the base and give it hell.
peal the oil filter can off.. exposing the filter backing plate..

wedge allen wrenches into the holes.. and a screwdriver between them to get some. twist... 

 others have use the pin spanner wrench that comes with many Angle grinders.. or this from harbor freight. https://www.harborfreight.com/adjustable-pin-wrench-36554.html

 over the past 45 years of working on cars every day.. i run into these not too often where somebody probably used an oil filter wrench to over tighten the filter.. its contact the rubber and 3/4 of a turn usually..
Air hammer
Everytime I've tried the screwdriver through the filter method, all it did was shear the filter in half when I tried to turn it.
Strap wrench and go as low as you can towards the threads before turning
this tool with a 1/2" impact gun,   i bought one for $6 at harbor freight, works great

I had one of those issues with a 96 gmc sierra v8 it literally took me 4 hours to get it off I done everything you could think of besides using heat when I got done I wanted to kill whoever put it on before I got the truck
Had this problem. Had to end up using a strap filter wrench to get the damn thing off, needed to stick a pipe at the end of it for more torque.
screwdriver thru side in middle with hammer completely thru filter

I know u tried screwdriver but try my method

use screwdriver as a pry bar
You're not grabbing it at the base. See the part of the filter closest to the mater surface that's barely scratched? That's the toughest part of the filter and least likely to crumple.

Grab it from there. Or screwdriver but... Ya the base.
Hit it with your purse
You ain't even hit it yet.
Remember this when you "hand tight" the new one
turn it the other way
Pipe wrench near where it‚Äôs mounted or a strap

Hammer a screw driver into the filter then just turn the screwdriver.
Hit it with your purse

if its recognizable as an oil filter you still haven't done enough.
I've never tried it, but maybe try tightening it a smidge to break the seal and then loosen it?
Put the filter pliers nearest the top of the filter. It will crush less and allow better grip.

Have you tried turning it to the left? /s
This is exactly why you don't use the screw driver method. It is the worst possible way to remove a filter. When it fails and rips the filter it will fuck you. It makes me scream when I see people recommend it. 

You can't use a claw attachment now since you already done ripped the filter. Those usually get about any filter off. 

Use a strap wrench near the base of the filter. Or your oil filter pilers.
I've pounded a screwdriver through them before. Worked great.
Chisel it loose
Drive a frickin screwdriver through it and twist.
Jeez thats on there.
More then likely you'll need to destroy the oil filter. And piece by piece remove it.
Turn it the OTHER way.

Oil filter pliers. They crush and bite harder than anything you‚Äôre gonna fit in that space and they are literally $10 at any parts store
Use multiple oil filter pliers

Strap wrench all the way to the screw end.  Spray it down and clean it with some brake cleaner first so you can get a good grip.
Have you tried not having a stuck oil filter? That usually does the trick.
I wonder if a razor blade around the top to cut loose the rubber seal wouldn't work here since there seems to be some room.
Get a chisel and make a Notch and tap it around

Lisle oil filter wrench.  Bought one the other day.  Makes removing filters an easy task, even the crushed ones like yours.  $11 on Amazon.  My Mazda3 has underbody covers and it's a pain stick your hand in the cat flap when you're laying on your back.
A fucking filter claw. 

How do people not know about these things? Ive had one for 20 years and have literally not once had it fail to remove a filter
Are you sure you are turning it the right way?

I‚Äôll see myself out‚Ä¶
Why are you working on your shit an hour away from home?  
A bit late to be asking this now I suppose, but isn't that rather unwise?
Use a chisel and tap it loose right where the filter meets the block. The chisel should almost be parallel with the right with a little angle to bite into the filter
Righty tidy, lefty, Lucy
pipe wrench worked for me
This would have been a situation where I hoped I didn't damage the oil filter and left it on there until I had more access to tools and money. 

Would recommend piercing with 2 screwdrivers, not just one. If it gets desperate enough, remove the oil filter housing entirely. You will wanna replace the gasket of course, but then you can put it in a vice or in between your legs really tight, and really crank that hog on it.

The problem here is it has become squished and mangled. They're soft metal so that's expected. You have now learned about the over removal torque phenomenon. If it feels like it's taking too much effort, you need a better tool or better leverage or better grip. Keeping this practice in mine will stop you from rounding off bolts in the future as well.
You can probably get it off by putting a screwdriver through it, however you might end up ripping the whole thing apart and will likely make a big mess. My best advice is to heat above where the filter screws in with a torch carefully and evenly, and it usually will loosen right up
Pound a flat head into it and twist.  Not at the base though you can damage the threads
Rachet srap. This is the way

Good luck üëç
You try turning the other way?
Chisel at the base lip of the filter. Might have to end up just peeling off that filter piece by piece if none of the suggestions above work.
Any success OP?
It is possible the seal is what's stuck, you could try a utility knife around the seal to cut it or soak the seal area with a penetrant.
The absolute worst case scenario is getting out the air hammer with a chisel bit, and VERY carefully chiseling the top edge of the filter (where it screws in) on the outer edge to get it to start spinning.
At that point just call the fire department and tell them you need the jaws of life
Jesus, man, the Hulk change your oil? Look at that thing.
Buddy of mine had a similar situation except he had the entire top of the oil filter off and I ended up driving 3 hours only to crush what was left of the oil filter with a pipe wrench and got it off
Which oil filter wrench? they have 2 that I‚Äôm aware of one sucks ass literally filtered shape that goes on rachet or the claw for the ratchet  that opens and closes so when you turn it to loosen it closes on the filter and while your turning grips it tighter as you turn till comes off.
 
This filter has been thru it ü§£üò≠üòÇ
Pipe wrench up as high as you can get it. When taking the filter off you want to be as close to the top as possible. Never try to loosen in the middle or at the bottom or risk this issue. Filter do not need to be that tight.
Channel locks
This happened to me. Forgot to put oil around the rubber seal. I had to use a vice grip locking chain clamp to get it off safely without damaging any other of the components it was mounted to. You can get them on Amazon or call your local auto parts shop.
Grab it more at the base, use a pair of nice quality Channellocks.
Good luck I‚Äôve had to chisel a filter down the the threads before
Just buy a new short block and swap it
Wack tip that once worked for me. Hammer a used screwdriver through the filter and turn on that extension
Are you turning it the right way?
C3
Out of ideas? Out of oil for sure.
Put a couple of hose clamps around it, then use an oil filter wrench. Some wd on the seal won't hurt.
I had this happened when helping my buddy changed his Mazda 3 oil, screw driver method only left the threads/upper most ‚Äúdisk‚Äù. Pulled off the oil filter housing put it in a vice and used a 3 foot pipe wrench to get it off, oil was everywhere.
Heat it with a torch.  Not too much, just enough to get it to start moving.  I'm not a mechanic, but my buddy is and he did this to my Outback before I fucked everything up.  Best of luck to you.
Try turning the opposite way?
Is that a Valvoline filter?
Clamp a big vice onto it and turn the whole thing
Chain wrench will get any filter off that has the base left, which yours does.  Gotta go find one!
The only thing that worked for me is the little thing with 3 fingers that goes on a ratchet. As you turn, the fingers get tighter.
Maybe it‚Äôs threading is nonstandard
Big, fuck off channellocks. It‚Äôll be off in 10 seconds. You will never rich that fight again.
Mother of god...mm what have you done
If you have an air hammer, that'll definitely do it. If not, grip it higher up with a strap wrench, then a pipe wrench or channel locks if that doesn't do it. Stabbing a screwdriver through it isn't likely to work. Is it hot? If no, heat it up. If yes, let it cool.
Why the f were you trying to do this an hour from home?
Spike it.
Channel locks
Did you try asking nicely? Seems you may have been a lil aggressive with the poor thing...
Twist it maybe‚Ä¶.. the other way üò±
Looking at the way that‚Äôs twisted, I would suggest trying to turn it the other way. Lefty loosy, righty tighty.
Biggest pipe wrench you've got, grip it near the base, twist that sumbitch off.
A chain or strap wrench at this point. Next time, be sure to lube the gasket. Failure to do this causes your predicament
Have you tried asking nicely?
Hammer and flat chisel
Pipe wrench that thing
Pipe wrench from the top
My Grandmother very strong. She like bear. Bare hand. Easy.
Strap wrench
Take a chisel and hit it all the way to the left but perpendicular to the threads.  I mean in the counterclockwise side of it in the direction that it will  rotate off
Oil filter was the victim¬† of a hate crime
One of these [filter chain wrenches ](https://www.machinemart.co.uk/p/cht243-oil-filter-chain-wrench)will do it. You wrap the chain around the filter as close to the base as you can get it, then you can use an extension and wrench to twist it and release it. The chain tightens onto itself.

I had a filter that had been put on dry and over tightened. Nothing shifted it until I got this.
Try oiling it a little bit
Strap
Hammer and chisel. You put it on the rim of the filter, and gently tapping it loose.
Heat that base.
How does an oil filter get stuck like this in the first place?
I made a filter tool out of an old seat belt and a 3/8s extension. I guess it would be call a band wrench maybe. It‚Äôs a life saver for heavy equipment filters.

https://preview.redd.it/ifhxb8t4sojd1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3be40995e23b95681179fb75184ceae78161d90a

It looks similar to this
Try turning it the opposite direction
Get the car to operating temperature.
Not sure if it would work with the condition yours is in but if you‚Äôre able to clean off some of the oil, wrap an old belt or one you don‚Äôt mind getting dirty tightly around it. Might help get a better grip around it. Helped me when I did the oil change on my car after buying used.
well, just a thought: you did‚Ä¶ i assume‚Ä¶ release the pressure by opening the oil cap first?

not sure why you would want to remove the oil filter away from home either‚Ä¶ seems silly
Maybe you‚Äôre already done but what helped me once is the cut the gasket with a cardboard cutter all around and then it came off very easily. The gasket was seized to the block because they didn‚Äôt lube it prior to install it.
It's easy to overdo it on the main body or end of the housing but I find the base has way better strength
Heavy duty nylon strap wrench at the base. Big 1/2 inch drive ratchet and an extension, and a pipe for extra leverage.
Lefty loosey.... Righty tighty... ü§î
Idk‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always gotten them off with the round metal band type filter wrenches, everything else physically destroys the really stuck on ones
Since it appears that you have pretty good access, a a strap wrench on the base of it.
Bunch of DIY strap wrench recommendations on here already - I would pierce it w a screwdriver
Strap wrench or a pipe wrench on it tight and giver!
Ask it nicely
I think I might try using chain wrench as close to base and as tight as you can close it before applying any torque, brace yourself  and give it as much power as you can, all you need is to budge that first time then you're on your way.

The key to this working is how tight you're able to close that wrench before hand and getting it just right at the base . If that doesn't work then next I'd try peeling it as someone else said and using a chisel and hammer to begin turning it, if you go this route be very careful not to hit the threaded part at any time . Take your time it will at some point come off.
I had this happen once when removing my oil cooler on an f250 7.3l. I drilled a hole through it and put a big ass bolt through it and turned.
Large punch at the rolled steel base in the counter clockwise direction
Make sure you dip rub some oil on the seal of the new one when putting it on. Will help with this issue in the future
I would use 2 strap wrenches as split apart as possible. Usually does the trick.
Others have given you good options, but I'd just like to add that overtightened bs is a large part of the reason I do my own maintenance.
Use your purse
Just unscrew it
The real solution is change your oil much earlier. The seal will only do that if it‚Äôs been baked on there for 100 years.
Have you tried a wrench similar to the one in the link? It seemed dumb but I picked one up. Worked great on a stubborn filter. Filter got crumpled but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an issue seeing the state of yours lol but it did get it off. You can also use it with a pry bar for extra leverage. Good luck

Some wingnut put loctite on it.
Did you try turning the other way ü§î
I know it may not help you where you are,  but after 40 years in the trade getting a few  of these over the years,  the best way is to hit the base of the filter with the torch to burn out the rubber gasket.  Watch for possible oil fire. Have extinguisher available.
I have used a pipe wrench before and if I couldn't get up on it for grip I would drive a large screw driver through the side and out the other and use that to turn it
Strap wrench on a socket
Are you wearing a belt?

Take that bad boy off and wrap it around he filter. Use a wrench or screwdriver to make a tourniquet in the direction of unscrewing it. Then crank on it and it will come loose.
I would suggest warming the car up but it looks like the oil might already be drained.
actually went to the nearest oil shop once and they removed it with whatever magical tool they had
Hemp rope
You may be SOL on the side of the road.  A boss I had years ago had a similar issue.  They ended up cutting it off.  
Drain the oil if necessary 
Cut the shell off as close to the mount as possible 
Gut the insides
When all you have left is the top plate screwed to the engine.. use a dremel with a small cutting wheel to CAREFULLY cut it off.

I recall it was an all day job on a lift
Have you tried a belt style oil filter wrench? It tightens down as you turn
Channel locks
They make tools for the that has claws in really gives you a grab us short extension then use your ratchet.
If ya can fit a pipe wrench in there
Pipe wrench
I‚Äôve used a 20‚Äù set of channel locks when I‚Äôve had this problem.
You turning the right way?
My question is why did you decide to change your oil filter 100 miles from home?
So you need an old serpentine belt. Make a double hitch and put both loops around the filter. Then wrap the loops around against the knot until you can put a breaker bar in the final belt bite. Orrr‚Ä¶ just bead the outer casing off and go at the core with some Vice grips
What I do is get a long flat head and hammer it all the way through the filter and that usually will give you enough leverage to turn it. Be careful tho because if it starts tearing the filter and half instead of turning you should probably stop and use an air hammer.
Punch through it with a big screw driver and hit the end with a hammer to do the spiny thing. 
Worst case you need a new engine anyways
Who ever put that on has kids that don‚Äôt speak to them.
Its still all there, you have not tried hard enough yet!
Left handed thread?
Been through this many a time!  Try 6 turns to loosen to turn by hand.  
Strap type oil filer wrench & a 1/2 inch fine toot ratchet wrench.  Just tighten it first before torquing down to remove.  Good luck!
It looks angry.
Turn it the other way...
Been there brother.
I have become prejudice against stock oil filters‚Ä¶ lol
I have a custom tool I made from a wheel nut, some steel and some seatbelt strap for these. Basically crank the nut with the seat belt around the filter. Hard to explain, but works wonders and good for hard to reach places.
Jb weld. Looks fine.
Two pairs of pliers or one with a grip towards the top. Just keep twisting or trying. It‚Äôll come loose. Dealt with this not too long ago myself.
Leather belt wrapped around the base as close as you can get it and through the belt buckle as you pull on it it'll get tighter and tighter and gives you leverage
Ask your wife to twist it off for you.
Cut it open ad use wise grip
Let us know is how it went
![gif](giphy|zqhZB6bo5FgoE)
Try tightening it slightly then loosening it. It works on screws so idk worth a shot.
22" Channellock (or similar) pliers. The extra leverage makes a difference. I had to use my pair on my step father's Silverado the other day.
Replace housing or engine
I‚Äôve used channel locks successfully to get stuck oil filters off before.
I've been in this situation once. Eventually, the entire outer wheel was gone, and I had to use an air hammer with a chisel end and hammer it off.
Extra large channel locks
you tried taking the oil filter off? (im kidding) ...you gotta use the oil filter tool with extension and ratchet ... it'll take it off
Yeah I‚Äôd just stick a screwdriver in there. 

When you say you tried using a screwdriver, it doesn‚Äôt look like you punctured it, which you need to do.
Hammer a big screw driver through the filter and turn.
When this happens I just get a Phillips screw driver and a hammer, drive the screw driver into the filter as close to the base as possible, twist it off.
Hammw a large screwdriver through it and then turn like hell
Tri finger oil filter tool.
Did you try those three jaw clamp style filter wrench?
I was in a similar situation, ended up getting it loose by duct taping my hand to it and using my body weight to get it loose. Sounds dumb but it worked
Beat it with a Nokia phone. Don't hit it too hard though, may cause the motor to crack.
Valvoline?
New engine üòú
This happened all the time on my 1998 Saturn SL best car I've ever own still got it going strong 370 k miles shifts great auto but Id get a clothing belt and rap it a bunch of times and use a pry bar to loosen it before trying a screw thru the can  maybe slight heat. Be careful use your best judgement. Good luck ü§ûü§û
Set your purse down and try again
Take a screw driver and jam it all the way thru horizontally. Then turn.
Thick thick thick screwdriver straight through as far up towards the bit it screws in and then twist. That‚Äôs how I got my last one off even though I had hand tightened it myself a few months before.
Slam a big flat head screw driver though it and turn
Screwdriver through and through and twist
Torches
I gotta ask why people are putting these oil filters on so damn tight? I always hand tighten only on my truck and never had a problem. Always was able to take off by hand too, albeit it‚Äôs hard as hell but I don‚Äôt own an oil can wrench or used a monkey wrench
take the screw driver and hammer it through the side of the oil filter.  
if you have the room, put a small pipe over the screwdriver's handle. (i.e, just use a breaker bar.)  
should come right off.

before you put the new one on, please make sure that the threads on the oil filter head haven't been damaged or stretched at all.  
I hope all goes well for you.
Stab the screwdriver completely through the middle of the filter with the hammer and then turn that
Try puncturing all the way through with a screwdriver, then turn off slowly.
I'd dry driving a screw driver all the way through it and turning it off or if you have it air hammer
Punch s hole straight through it with a screwdriver and use the screwdriver to get some good leverage. Make sure you have a catch pan under neath.
Jam a screwdriver all the way through it and use it like a handle
Good ole Hawk Tuah should fix it
Stab the screw drive completely through near the base, just don‚Äôt hit the threaded part
Pound a screw driver through the center of the oil filter (sideways not into oil sump) then crank it loose like a T handle.
I punctured the screw driver up towards the top of the filter, there you can wedge the screwdriver against the oil spout and break it free
Hammer and flat head screwdriver/blunt chisel. Put screedriver/chisel head on lip of oil filter and hammer in direction of unscrew. Take care not to damage the block
Try using an actual filter wrench strap. But god has forsaken you, so now you can try to jam a long flat head and turn. Or turn to an air hammer.
Put a screwdriver thru filter, beat screwdriver head counter clockwise
May dad hammers a screwdriver in  and usedes a hammer angainst the handle and that normally works but use a old one it could get bent
I use a large pair of channel locks (when there‚Äôs room) to grip that mess and turn it off. It will either unscrew or tear the can off. If it tears the can off you can use a pin spanner or a coupe Phillips screwdrivers in the backing plate holes with following leverage to turn the backing plate off. Whomever installs these filters  with dry gaskets or excessively tight is an imbecile.
I typically run a screw driver though the entire filter not too close to the base - would hate to hit the threaded oil intake - key is to figure out the spot that will allow the screw driver to turn a 1/4 of a turn prior to punching the screw driver into said filter. Usually a 1/4 turn is enough to get the typical filter wrench to finish the job
Hammer a screwdriver through it and use that as handles to turn it.
Put a screw driver all the way through it and turn it off
Hammer a screwdriver through it and use it to twist it off. Easy peasy
Can't be stuck if it's liquid :)
Very Long screw driver all the way though, sticking out the other side. If you cut the whole thing in half, get some tin snips and just cut the whole dang thing away.
Drill a hole and stick a long metal rod then torque away
jam in 4 screwdrivers of a somewhat large diameter and crank it
ü™õ Screwdriver punched straight through the middle, then use both ends to unscrew [Like this.](https://www.fiestastforum.com/threads/stuck-factory-oil-filter.17982/page-2)

Stab a screwdriver through it
Ram a long flat head through the filter and use it to turn.
Usually by that point I hammer a screwdriver through it and pray it turns.
Put a long screwdriver through it. Then, use that lever arm to turn it.
Drill a hole thru it side to side wide enough to fit a screwdriver then turn the screwdriver.  hopefully that‚Äôll help you‚Äôll need a power drill of some sort to drill that hole. Just a idea. Good luck.
Drill a hole use a screwdriver to twist
I've seen on YouTube a mechanic using a flat head screwdriver and a hammer like a chisel on the bottom of the filter. Tapping the filter to spin lefty losey. Good luck.
Get a fatty screwdriver through the filter as close to the base as You can. Then made an extension from both sides with *something*. Been there, done that - I have used a socket extension for one side.
Smash a screwdriver through one side and out the other, then twist.
Put a flat head or Phillips straight through it and turn
Screwdriver through it and turn.
I would drive said screwdriver through the filter and use that as leverage.
At a very low point in my life I've hammered a screwdriver through one and used it for leverage lol. Actually works pretty good.
Hammer a screw driver all the way through and turn it with both hands on each end
Drive a long flat head through it grab on both sides and spin that fucker
Jab a screwdriver tru it... then lefty loosy üòÇ
Hammer a big ol flathead right through the filter and use it as a handle to turn the filter
Hammer a screwdriver through it
Poke a hole in it.
Punch a screwdriver through the filter then use a pipe on one of end for torque.
Drive a screw driver horizontally through the centre and turn.
Hammer a flat head screw driver through filter. Use leverage to twist off‚Ä¶ just make sure you are turning the right way.
Drive a screwdriver through both sides and spin off using the screwdriver as leverage
Flat screw driver  would do job
You could always stab a screwdriver through it for more leverage. Messy, but usually works.
Drive a long screwdriver all the way through and twist like we did last summer!
I would hammer a screwdriver through it As close as the base, as you can get it.
I drilled a hole through one before stuck a long extension through for more leverage and unscrewed it.
Screwdiver through the center. Twist.

Use a Soft blow Hammer  and hit a screwdriver through it and use that to twist it off....
Drive a big screw driver through it and twist
Hammer a Philips horizontally through the bottom area and turn it off
Stab screwdriver through and turn.
punch the screwdriver through, turn to loosen
Take decent size drift pin with a flat end hit it with a hammer right up by the flange. Problem with chisels they will cut right through, not enough surface area. If you don't have one something like a pin from a door hinge might work.
Stick a screw driver (the longer the better) through the middle of the filter close to the base as you can and try and turn it that way.
ü§¶ use a hammer and screwdriver like the rest of us
I would drill a hole right through the center and stick a socket extension through it and turn. If it does not dislodge it will tear apart and you can peel it off.
in situations like this ive just jammed a screwdriver through the oil filter, then used the handle of the screwdriver as a handle to unscrew the filter.
Here's a last ditch... This has worked a few times for me. Hammer a screwdriver through it about an inch up so as not to hit the standoff. Wiggle the screwdriver tight and loose then loose. Sometimes ya gotta go tight before lose.
Punch a big screwdriver through it, till it comes out the other side, then use the screwdriver to turn it.
One my dad told me forever ago was to stick a screwdriver through it and use the handle to torque it off. It works but I'm fairly sure that's probably not the greatest solution
Have you tried a screwdriver thru the oil filter ? Then turn .
Take that screwdriver and hammer it through the oil filter and then twist it.
Knock a old screwdriver thru it then use that as handles to undo it
When I got nothing handy or stuck helping a friend with no tools with this situation, I have hammered a flat head screw driver through the filter. Then use the screw driver as leverage to turn the filter loose.

Has worked every time, even on large diesel filters. Now a pipe wrench or filter wrench might be better, but when in doubt, screwdriver works.
A product called liquid wrench
WTF‚Ä¶
Filter socket/wrench on an impact in reverse?
Drill a hole in the bottom. Will drain and alleviate pressure.
Flathead, hammer, think of what SpongeBob and Patrick did to Squidward when he was in a full body. Do that.
This is the correct response.

You need a pipe/strap/chain wrench around the top where the gasket meets the mount.

You also need a voodoo doll to curse whomever put that on.
Pipe wrench every single time
Mousse_Upset is correct and means the top of the oil filter  not the bottom. It is correct near the base but it confused me so here is my two cents worth it it's at the top where there's metal you can grip on.
Thats what she said
Hell even a huge set of channel locks will do it without any problem
18 inch pipe wrench and if that fails, bring in the cheater bar .
After that: screwdriver right through it, if that doesn't work, use the screwdriver or a chisel to counter tap it like a stuck stripped screw
The only time I had one that was that stuck was from the factory.

Just goes to show how true the "your milage may vary" saying is.
This is the way, peel the can, grab the strong threaded part.
Lot of decent answers, but try holding constant strong tension on it.  A lot of times this happens the filter has been put on dry as well as too tight and it basically sticks to the mating surface.  Constant holding tension will help break that seal.  

Not a guaranteed fix but it works a lot for me.
You know why have our freight sell them?

Because they don‚Äôt fucking include them with the angle grinder as I found out, getting to site and realizing that I now have to drill holes in a wrench and thread some bolts through the holes to make one lol.
I've only got an air guitar, will that do?
Or just a hammer and chisel will work too.
When mine was stick on my OBS Burban. I took a long flat head! Hammered in in above center so you go through the interior filter. Then spin with that. Messy. But It came off
OP maybe post a location or pin, if I had the tools and you were nearby I'd stop by but I'm not going too far a distance.  You might be lucky if someone is nice
Be careful not to chisel out the block though.
Agreed. This is the worst method. Plus you get oil everywhere and it's slippery for the next method you choose.
Lol if that, my first time trying to use it, the screwdriver just crinkled the whole damn filter into a c shape and barely punctured enough to leak but to get a screwdriver in.

Said F it, if its so flimsy that a screwdriver couldn't be hammered through it without bending the whole damn thing, obviously the metal is just going to shear off.

I used those adjustable oil filter wrenches that look like a c shape, but I grabbed the filter at an angle and then gave it hell and even though it twisted a shitton and the jaws dug into it, it came out.

Only time its ever had someone else do the oil change. Never again lol.
Never had an issue with this tactic, and by the 3rd push it‚Äôs loose, I think you need to try penetrating deeper before twisting, silly goose
I've done this multiple times and never had this happen. Does this havw to do with what the filter is made of or how tightly it's on?
I only used that method once. Instead of a screwdriver I used a 12 in double sided dagger. Stabbed straight through and the width of the blade I think helped it not tear the filter. But was so messy I never tried it again.
Once after the screwdriver failed I screwed 4 long screws into the filter going pretty much all the way through. 
That gives you 4 points to attack and in total was enough torque to turn the filter instead of wrecking it like the screwdriver did
I sheared mine off and was able to use a chisel and a hammer on the thick bit of the filter to get some turn.
Damn, never had that happen. But looking at the state it's in now I would 100% see that happening
You have to drill the holes first!
Yup. This 100% happens every single time. I hate this advice.
Yes
I use a strap wrench from Napa that accepts a 3/8‚Äù or 1/2‚Äù ratcheting drive, and have yet to have it let me down on oil filters of this size, even when they are badly mangled. One of these:

https://www.napaonline.com/en/p/SER773529
I had a filter worse than the one pictured, and this got it off.
These are good. Have one from YEARS ago.
I've never used an impact gun with one, but a breaker bar with a cheater bar on the end of it.  Surprised this response was so far down.
This response should be higher.  I love that thing.
I've used this! With a rachet + extended breaker bar! I was about to set the car on fire already after trying 3-4 different tools with no success. This was after not doing an oil change after 3 years. I even removed the damn tire to get more space and leverage.  Car mostly sat in the garage and no one cared so Im happy I did it.
I bought one like that at Cars At Carlisle years ago, except the arms extended to nearly the length of most filters. Best money ever spent.
That is the best method I‚Äôve found too.
woah that's really cool
Or an old serpentine belt.
This is usually my last ditch.  Only once has it failed.  And that was on a car that sat ankle deep in water for 20 years and sat for 5 or so before that.  The filter and the car were one.
I've seen that just rip the filter basically in half, while the base stays in place. Use a hammer and a chisel and go at the base of it in the direction you want it to turn
I came to write the exact same thing,long n thick ü™õ  will make the trick
That's what we did when the tractor oil filter failed to unscrew(Almost always)
I think people are using little regular screwdrivers. I have an 18‚Äù flathead for this job and it‚Äôs never not worked.
I‚Äôve tried this in the past, and the oil filter just crumples when you do it.
Dealer once put my motorcycle filter on so tight I had to do this, even bent the 3/8 shaft of the screwdriver, I was shocked it didn't strip. Then they wonder why you don't ever come back.
Did that once. Pierced my engine oil bay. Never again. https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/s/UdwaNzWxir
I second this, a metal rod through the filter will act like T-wrench. Try using both hands to twist, if that fails proceed with the hammer.
I've had to do that, and was going to recommend it if no one else had. It's a neat little trick when it's necessary to use.
Came here to say this
mater?
And there it is!
I was gonna say big boy pants, but this is better.
Jettison it!
Yep, these work.

I bought a vice grip for rounded stuff on Amazon for $12 and oil filters are no match for it.
This is my go to. Never understood why anyone cares to keep the filter in tact when removing, but maybe I‚Äôm just not informed.
If you can get an even halfway decent grip they're 100% effective. Some filters are in really bad locations though. I like using the three pronged one with a ratchet and wobble socket for the less accessible ones.
I guess that could work, nut if it‚Äôs already too tight, maker it tighter doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea.
Get a soft blow hammer a screw driver. Hammer in the screwdriver sideways and then twist it off using the screwdriver.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
This is 100% correct.¬† I'm the guy that gets to remove the filters when the screw driver crowd messes up.


If there's enough room to get the screw driver in, then there's enough room to use a better tool.
Like one on the base and another like in the middle. Works everytime.
Yup!

This is a photo from an Amazon customer.  Person got the filter off with the Lisle wrench.
some people live in apartment complexes that don't allow people to work on their cars in the parking lot.
And if that ain‚Äôt gonna work I‚Äôm sure a pipe bomb will do the trick
Hahahaha , a used screwdriver. Just funny
I just saw that you're stranded an hour from home.  I hope you have a new filter and fresh oil to fix this situation.  As far as the torch thing I said, get one of those cheap ass butane cigarette torch lighters from a gas station and heat the base of the oil filter all the way around.  You're not looking to get it scorching hot, but just enough to let the filter know who's boss.

Jiffy Lube. Some dipshit Jiffy Lube employee (they don‚Äôt qualify to be called mechanics) probably wrenched it down really hard.
Look up biltools on Amazon. You may be able to get one locally.
OP said that they have tried an oil filter wrench already.
My ‚Äò92 SL1 and ‚Äò99 SL2 were the best cars I‚Äôve ever owned as well, both went nearly 400k miles on original trans, engines and even a clutch. I never had an issue with the filters getting stuck on, though.
I‚Äôve done this also. You drive that damn screwdriver all the way through it and grab that handle and twist it.
That just shreds the can.
I concur
The voodoo doll is an often overlooked essential in these situations.
Strap wrench
Or a big set of channel locks.
Chisel and hammer. Put the chisel on the base plate (that screws onto the car) and angle the chisel to get the filter to move counterclockwise. The ‚Äúshock‚Äù of the chisel will break the seal made by the rubber gasket. Once it moves even a fraction of an inch, it will be a LOT easier to twist off.
Just to clarify, the base of the oil filter is towards the top in the picture.
Sometimes the quick lube places employ Hercules just to spin on filters
every time I have to change the factory one, its completely torqued to 150 ft lbs or something insane. I really wonder what their specs are at the factories.
LMFAO
Lock the disc and grab it, the actual disc not the nut, with your hand and spin it off. Worst case, lock it and jab it into concrete, forcing it to spin the nut loose and come off. 

You only need to snug down the nut on a grinder hand tight. It spins against the threads, it's nit coming off during use. You should be able to take them on and off with your hand on the disc. The grinder pin wrench is optional when i grab any of the grinders out of the truck.
Most people just grab the grinder disc and twist with the hand. Almost nobody uses the wrench on an angle grinder
give it a try

And I‚Äôll add some hairy banjo.
Nope... Maybe an air banjo
i will back you up with my air drums
Yeah but a hammer and chisel doesn‚Äôt go BRRRRRTRTTTTT
Tap the screw driver into the very bottom first just enough to get most of the oil out
Dude only time I had firestone change my oil the drain plug was put on with like the power of zeus. I had to use an impact wrench with a bolt extractor to get it off
That's what she said
I was fighting the filter on my subie, straight up and down, tried multiple end cap wrenches, couldn't get a strap wrench on it, with this tool and the impact gun it came off so fast it made a big mess, next time around I just burped the gun enough to loosen it where I could finish by hand
oh, the arms extend out
that sounds like a literal nightmare. what car was worth the trouble that must have come with 20 years in water?
Same here about ripping in half.  I go straight for the base, put the screwdriver in those holes and hit it with a hammer.
Sounding like my friday nights
To be fair, you're not supposed to do that.
That‚Äôs your fault. 100% user error, 100% avoidable. You should have been more careful when doing that.
Not to be an asshole, but with some basic knowledge you could've assessed what would've happened before running the screwdriver thru the filter into the block. If you just rotated the screwdriver about 45 degrees in either direction you would've missed the block. 

So I mean, you definitely could do it again, just correctly the next time.
OOOO I REMEMBER THAT
To be fair you could have looked at that for 5 seconds and realized you would hit the block if you went through at that angle. If you had turned it 45 degrees in either direction you would have been fine
You either are Thor with Mjollnir, used some kind of mechanic drill, or that engine block was cheaply made. 

How can something that is suppose to withstand all that heat, vibration, etc be that easily punctured?
That's wild yo
Oh hey I remember you lol
I was thinking using the hammer to drive screwdriver into filter
Just make sure you Hammer the screwdriver through the lower portion. you don't want to hit the threads.
I was also lookin for it
Didn‚Äôt see it so I had to oblige
And the answer is to find a nice, convenient spot 100 miles from home?  That doesn‚Äôt make much sense.
I meant as in dont use a brand new expensive one
Wow they must have used a torque wrench or some big ass breaker bar to tighten that down
Welcome fellow Saturn owner. They are tanks for sure.  Maybe I tightened filter to tight most likely  I had the reverse slam for 5 + years then installed a new transmission valve body super easy and fixed that problem.  The Saturn is so easy to work on.     Carry on dude SATS AWAY üòäüòä
Never failed me.....
I bet it is cause most don't recognize the importance of having a voodoo doll in the first place.  Gotta keep one in your back pocket,  all you need then is a tuft of hair and you're all set.
Hammer and big ass standard screwdriver. Punch it through the filter and use it as a handle.

This is what happens when you don't lubricate the O-ring. I had to drive a screwdriver through the filter to be able to twist it off.
On AF
This. I know quick lube gets a lot of hate for this but those factory filters are the worst. I used to hate being a lube tech and getting a first oil change car. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I invested in a snap on air hammer after one of the master techs showed me a quick way to get a stuck filter unstuck.
The tool takes me one second to use and cost me a shorty old wrench and two bolts and nuts.
Set it on fire.
Turn the amp up to 11

Duh
My first car.  I got it for free. It was hell, but I did get it running for about a year.  It was a Zephyr.  They had a short run, didn't change much. I don't remember the year. Traded up to an 89 Celebrity Wagon, then a 90s Cavalier wagon, 99 F150, 03 Impala in 06, 14 Crosstrek in 16 and then a brand new Ram 1500 in 19.  I miss that Impala daily.
I read this in Trumps voice and died laughing. Thanks lol
If you're going to puncture your engine oil Bay, there's really no need to be careful.
Looks like aluminum. It really doesn't take much.
Ive used a screwdriver like a chisel to start the turn, 50% of the time, it works everything
Came here and searched before posting... This should be higher up.
I've had this go badly before; the body/can of the oil filter just got torn to shreds and it didn't help loosen the remains at all.

It just made things worse.  YMMV
Works EVERY time

Impalas are such great vehicles. What did you like about it?
Mercury Zephyr was my first car too.
Oooh I had a 94 Cavalier wagon. A small car with enough room to pass out drunk in the back comfortably. Served me well, then a tree fell on it.
send you my bill.  LOL

Glad it worked

"install" simply means "pour shit in"

There is a maintenance schedule in the owners manual. Follow that and you'll be in good shape plus it keeps your ass covered.
Yeah youre getting premiumly ripped off
Engine treatment, fuel treatment and the air filters can be done by you at home.
Lots of additives you don't want and don't need in your car in that quote. That alone would put me off.
Hahaha these guys are crooks, yes!
Yes. Depending on your year make and model, you can buy the filters yourself and do them. Everything else is snake oil with the exception of the oil change.
569.00 oil change and rotation
Yes. If your car is new that is not needed at all except the oil change and you can go to walmart and find the air and cabin filters and install it yourself. You don't need additives like that claims
Fucking stealerships. An oil change. Two $15 bottles of BG that's basically snake oil at 15k miles, 10 minutes replacing two $15 filters, spray and wipe the throttle body, $569. Oh and they'll give your nearly new car a 10 minute once over while it's on the rack.  Whole thing is over in an hour. 

Go find an independent shop and stop being played like this. Or do it yourself for less than $100 in supplies and fluids.

They're counting on you knowing nothing about how cars work. Lol especially at "install" for gas additives you pour in the tank.
I mean unless you drive a Bugatti Veyron then yea this is ridiculous
Can we get a year/make/model? For a Toyota Camry,  this is a ripoff. For a 23 Jaguar XF, some kind of Maserati, Bentley, or other high-end end European vehicles in the US, this could be accurate. I know that at a reputable shop, just changing oil on one of these cars can start at $180. Of course, you can always save money doing it yourself, so just because you're paying a markup and labor cost on certain things doesn't make it a ripoff, it's a service.
Jesus, that price and they'll still hit you with a charge for more than 7 quarts of oil
The "up to 7 quarts" is your clue that this has nothing to do with maintaining your particular car. It is just an extremely overpriced service.

"Am i being ripped off" is a weird question- are they telling you that you need this or just suggesting you have it done? This is like buying a $14 beer and complaining they ripped you off.
Ya
Hyundai dealer just told my friend she needed a cabin air filter and engine air filter. Fair enough because of the miles since they were changed but they were going to charge her $ 120 for the two. Ripoff! Air filter: Two latches, pull the old one out, put the new one in, close and latch. Pretty much the same for the cabin filter but behind the glovebox. Did them for her in less than 10 min.
Here‚Äôs an idea. Get an oil change.  If you really care about your car and it‚Äôs not a lease, opt for synthetic.  Let them rotate the tires. 

Skip the bs inspection- that‚Äôs just to find stuff they can upsell u more on- next u will need wiper blades?

Engine treatment is fake.  (You can get it at the auto parts store for $10)

Fuel treatment is fake.  ( $10 at auto parts store)

You probably don‚Äôt need an engine air filter at 15k unless you‚Äôre in the Mojave.  $25 at auto parts store and you can probably do it yourself if you wanted. (YouTube video)

You can change a Cabin filter your self for $25.  (YouTube video)

You don‚Äôt need a throttle body and intake service at 15k miles.


In fact manufacturers do NOT recommend anything other than fuel in your gas tank, and oil in your oil. Modern oil‚Äôs and fuels have all the detergents and additives you need.
Oil and filter yourself is probably 50, inspections are free, engine treatment is a bottle of engine treatment probably 7 dollars, ethanol fuel treatment same as previous at about 7 dollars, air filter lets go crazy 30 bucks, cabin filter same 30 bucks, spraying your TB intake with cleaner about 7 dollars, rotating tires is free.

&#x200B;

If they take 3+ hours to do this its not a bad deal but the issue is you can do all of this in less than 3 hours by following youtube tutorials and spend a bit over 100 dollars.  Heck, you can spend less than 50 if you buy the items online.
Yes. That is a rip off. That it is being presented as an option would keep me from ever going back and I‚Äôd explain that to management. Same thing as a doctor recommending acupuncture. I would explain in small words that is not a useful service, not in my benefit and the mere act of recommending it taints anything else they may say in the future. Years to build trust. Seconds to destroy it. Poof.
Yes.
Little diy skills and 100$, done
That's a lot of fancy talk for a tire rotation and oil change.
$600 for an oil change?
For sure. For what car is this?
If you're getting full synthetic oil that's about 200$ max.  100$ for the oil change and max 100$ for the filters (depending on the vehicle).  The rest is nonsense.  To "clean" the throttle body it has to be removed, which I guarantee they aren't doing.
Yep.

Change the oil and rotate the tires. If you are somewhat mechanically inclined you can change the cabin filter yourself. There should be video guides on YouTube to step you through the process. If you don't feel like doing this pay for the shop to change it.

The rest of that is BS extra cost crap you don't need.
You can do all this on your own for like $150
1000% a rip off
Completely getting ripped off
This would be $299 at my shop, total rip off
Hell yes
By about $400, yes
What kind of car is it? If it's got GDI engine then I'd do the file system/intake cleaning as they burn more oil and build up faster than other engines. But even on the GDI engines that service isn't recommended but every 30k miles.
All of this is BS except for IMO the throttle body cleaning. At 15000 miles you shouldn‚Äôt need it but 70+ it would be needed but isn‚Äôt worth $570. You can get a new one put in for that. My throttle body went out on a car I had and it was a pain.
lets see, the oil change is 100 bucks if you're running synthetic and that includes labour(60 bucks if you do it yourself). the "engine treatment" and "ethanol fuel treatment" you can pick up from an auto parts store for 6 bucks each. cabin air and engine ait are 10-20 bucks each(depending on what kind you get and what car you have) and can be installed in 5 minutes. Throtyle body and intake cleaning services? again, you can buy the cleaner at autozone for 10 bucks and can be done when changing the air filter. tire rotation should be about 50 bucks.

Definitely not a 569$ job, and the only thing you actually need is the oil change and rotate tires. the cabin and engine filter casn be DIY by you easily.
Absolutely a scam!
You don‚Äôt need the fluids that they put in your vehicle. The gas today has everything needed to help keep your engine working right
At 15k miles your engine does not need the engine treatment, fuel treatment or intake cleaning. Even then that‚Äôs just pouring shit into the gas tank and spraying some stuff into the intake. The filters are $30 tops but the engine air filter lasts a lot longer than 15k miles. I checked mine at 50k and it was perfectly fine. The cabin air filter on the other hand does accumulate dirt and other shit real quick so id do that (at home for $10 not at the dealer for $60)

Oil change and rotation are necessary though. Go for those, everything else is forget or DIY
That‚Äôs frickin criminal lol
This is a total ripoff. I swear we need to start naming and shaming places like this.
yes bt thats why u youtube how to do things yourself if youre good at that kind of thing. Save you a shit ton of money. All of that would likely be under 100 if u did yourself tbr
So... Change the filters, rotate the tyres, change the oil and clean the manifold. Almost 600 bucks. I may go to the US to do basic maintenance on cars, that definitely seems like a great way to get rich!
We are ALL BEING RIPPED OFF (ON EVERYTHING!)
That is a bunch of BS.  
Just get your oil changed and tires rotated.  
The fuel you buy has ethanol in it you don't need more.
Biggest scam I‚Äôve seen in a while
This has to be a joke
If you're handy the only things worth paying for is the oil change and the tire rotation. Everything else you can do your self without a lift or a jack.
Fuck ya thats a rip off. If able change your own oil and only have them do the rotation. Youtube can show you the rest and if youd like you can reach out to me and I can explain what some of these are and how its done. 

P.S. Those fuel treatments are not really effective for cleaning. It helps stabilize old fuel and maybe helps in the tank itself (I don't know of any evidence that says yes or no at this time so thats why I say maybe) but thays about it. Hope this helps
DIY will cost you $50.   There maybe a warranty item to document this was done - so look into that before DIY.
Yes
That‚Äôs crazy
That's absolutely highway robbery.


The only actual services there are an oil change, air filter replacements, throttle body cleaning and a tire rotation. The rest is a waste of money.¬†


This should cost maybe $200, tops.
100% ripoff
Learning to do most of this yourself will feel both amazing and humiliating at the same time. Amazing because you will save tons of money now and in the future. Humiliating because you will soon see how incredibly easy it is and how much of a rip these maintenance services are. 

Luckily, the car only has 15k miles on it so you are learning early. Go forth to YouTube and conquer my friend!
This is a load of horse shit. 600 dollars to undo 4 clips in two spots and change your oil and blow some air in the air filter housing. Not even mentioning the additives
Depending on make/model, getting at the throttle body for proper cleaning CAN take some time, no? I do all this stuff myself but haven‚Äôt tackled that one yet‚Ä¶
15000 mile service, as in, thats the interval or thats the miles your car will be at?

Intake cleaning is crazy at that low miles, rest of the quote is just a regular service with some shit poured in your fuel tank which it most likely doesnt need at all.
That's about $160 worth of service (including tools and supplies).  $40 for tire rotation at any service station.  The rest you can do on your own.  Oil and Filter (synthetic 5qt and oem filter) = $30.  Engine tx is bullshit. (all modern oils have the additives needed)  Fuel tx is bullshit. (all needed additives are in top tier fuels) Air and Cabin filter are $30 at walmart.  Add a can of mass air sensor cleaner (any electronic cleaner spray will work for $10) for the throttle body/mass air sensor).

You'll need another $40 or so for tools ($5.00 screwdriver set, oil filter wrench and a basic socket wrench set for $30 and oil drain pan for $3.  $3 for a funnel).  All in the tool aisle at wally world.  Any autoparts store will take your used oil no charge (use your 5qt jug from your new oil for the old oil.)

Youtube is your friend on how to.

And stay away from the dealer unless it's warranty work.
The two air filters are like $180 for both installed and then reg service is like$269
If you feel like you can get it done quicker then go ahead if not just pay them because you can always make more money you can‚Äôt get your time back.
Yeah the word 'install' made me laugh. Lemme see where this treatment got installed at.  Probably a bottle of Lucas Oil in the gas tank.
honestly that might be the biggest red flag on here, because they‚Äôre telling you they think you‚Äôre stupid
No, "Install" means "we said we did it, but we lied."
$56.99 would be a great quote tho

&#x200B;

*/s*
Not worth it. He‚Äôs better off getting an oil change and buying ATS additive himself if he really wants to
The intake cleaning service is definitely not snake oil but these prices are awful
Tire rotations are snake oil? Genuinely asking
I disagree not everything is snake oil if it‚Äôs a BG product it‚Äôs pretty good especially the EPR. That being said fuel services normally recommended a 30k
if engine additives had 200+ studies showing effectiveness to go with 2,500 years of use, that would be a solid analogy.

https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=peer+reviewed+publications+on+acupuncture+effectiveness&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart
betting it‚Äôs seafoam
No, that part is good to do. Easy to do it yourself, or have a buddy do it for a couple beers.
at 15k miles?  

This price is a scam. $50 oil change, $50 in air filters. $20 Tire rotation.  and a $10 bottle of fuel treatment will get the same results for 1/4 the cost.
Found the sales rep
No. It‚Äôs snake oil. I used to work in a shop that peddled a lot of this crap. 30k miles is not a lot of miles on a car these days and the fuel hasn‚Äôt been running in your system enough to cause excessive carbon buildup or anything that would warrant a cleaner.

The ONLY fuel additive that I have ever used was a can of Seafoam because that‚Äôs the only shit that works - and even still, it‚Äôs not going to completely clean out the carbon.
Agree with that. BG is good all the way around with proper tools they give you.
Hell no, 30k is extremely a lot over what's recommended, 30k if you wanna replace the engine after warranty is gone. Also fun fact mister, not oil is the issue of keeping it for over 30k inside the engine, but the oil filter which goes to üí© after 15k and starts degrading.
Betting they do nothing.
Betting it‚Äôs nothing lol.
Sales rep!??! Can I get a funnel.
I‚Äôm a tech I‚Äôve seen this firsthand The fuel service is that they‚Äôre  are offering OP is not needed the engine oil, treatment optional, but he doesn‚Äôt have to do it
You don‚Äôt have to be a sales rep to know when a product is legit I‚Äôve seen intake valves cleaned with a fuel induction   
The EPR cleaning a sludge up engine even some of the varnish along the cams
Yea everyone use to work in a shop‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt spread your wrong opinions without facts backing them up
If you pedal Valvoline, but I stand by B.G. products because they do work if everyone just bothers to use the product and tear it down then they can see for themselves
Dude, I‚Äôm talking about the products not the oil change. What the duck are you on about
Yeah fr, what the duck! ü§£ü§£
I thought you told the guy to keep the oil if it's BG brand inside the engine for 30k miles lol
No lol obviously need an oil change, but the services are optional
Stop. Dumping! 
We all complain about tourists and out of staters but if I see one more VT plate white pickup throw a twisted tea or beer can or McDonald's bag out their window I'm gonna LOSE IT. 

This is your state, your town, your local roads. I literally will never be able to understand the mentality that it's ok to just throw your trash out your window. How someone can do that and not feel like a total piece of shit is beyond me.

Keep your shit in your truck. Pull into your driveway. Pick up your trash and put it in your own damn trash can. Takes three fuckin seconds and you don't end up looking like a white trash loser. 


It‚Äôs always a twisted tea or mini bottle of fireball
A few seasons ago, I saw someone toss their cigarette on the ground in the Burke parking lot. Then I heard a BOOMING voice from a massive dude behind me, who said slowly, ‚Äúthe world is not your trash can.‚Äù The person realized they might get their ass kicked and picked it up and it was one of those chef‚Äôs kiss no notes moments.¬†
The number of times I and my buddy have had to clean up trashed primitive campsites in the Green Mountain National Forest is too damn high.

We used to find broken camping gear, bottles, plastic bags, etc.  Now we are seeing whole gutted camping trailers being abandoned.  The National Forest Rangers can't even keep up with removing everything that is being abandoned on public lands.  Disgusting that people think this is OK.
Ages ago, when I was a kid, my dad came across some hunters parked on the side of an old road. On the way back, they were gone but had left behind a mound of trash. 

He poked through it and found some mail with a home address on it.  He boxed it up and MAILED IT BACK TO THEM, along with a letter to the editor of their local newspaper.  

He was my hero that day.
When I was an obnoxious teenage girl walking with my pack, giggling, swerving, and acting foolish on the sidewalk, one of us threw a piece of garbage down. A man came running after us with the wrapper in his hand. We were mortified. It literally changed my view forever. We need to call out these assholes.
I live in a fairly rural area in Southern VT, and the sheer amount of people with VT tags just dumping tires and all sorts of shit in our little river is fucking infuriating. 

The local recycling center takes tires for $5 a pop. But apparently that's too expensive, and just polluting the local brook is a better alternative?

I'll also add onto the list - smokers. I don't care how insignificant one butt is, that shit fucking adds up. Just throw your damn butts away, it's not that hard! 

I really hate people sometimes.
Every single time they stop to get gas they are literally standing next to a garbage can. 

Literally.

Every single time.
I worked in a job in an agency where it was my job to clean up everything you were talking about. Everyone else who worked with me and all the people who did it worked incredibly hard. We were demon by local people and talk down to by our superiors. It‚Äôs almost like nobody wants to clean up this state. And yes, that is something you do on a daily basis clean where you live. Maybe it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt give a fuck attitude that every entitled person has to toss trash to the wind. And not have to pay to deal with her own garbage.
Love this thread.
Can we also talk about the end of cigarettes everywhere? The amount of them that pile up in common spaces is insane. The number of smokers who CHOOSE to litter them create a nasty reality.
[deleted]
Some of these littering folk want to get their buzz on before arriving home but feel the need to hide the evidence from those they live with.¬†
My brother-in-law said he knew who was driving the back roads near his house based on the brand of cans along the road.  You gotta get rid of the evidence immediately if you drinkin!-n-drivin!
I run dozens of miles a week on dirt back roads north of Montpelier. The litter is everywhere, and it‚Äôs constant. Beer & twisted tea cans hung on trees, dumped in the ditches, smashed into the road, whatever. Thought my neighbors were all alright but clearly there‚Äôre a few bad apples in the basket.
I own a good-sized wood lot out in the boondocks.  I refuse to post it because it's against my beliefs about "land ownership".  So I kind of like when hunters use the land.  

But the amount of trash I find (mostly empty cans of cheap booze) out in the middle of the woods is really sad.
[deleted]
I complained about this a few weeks ago. People will argue you and say it doesn‚Äôt happen/ doesn‚Äôt matter because we are already the cleanest state they‚Äôve visited. 1. They‚Äôve never been to Canada. 2. That doesn‚Äôt make it okay. 

Go on any walk and literally count the twisted Tea, white claw and ring ding wrappers. You‚Äôll lose count before 1/10th of a mile. It‚Äôs obvious that there‚Äôs one group of people doing it and they are also the ones who claim to enjoy nature the most. 
Why do hicks litter when you all claim to be huge outdoors people? Also why do hicks have the most girly taste in drinks? It‚Äôs funny to me that you guys are out there mudding and shooting guns and have to ask your buddy in your hick voice ‚Äúwant to pass me that grapefruit claw.‚Äù 

I have no problem with hicks and would probably be one if they classed it up just a few notches and cared about anything other than themselves and their pussy drinks.
Garbage people gonna make more garbage.  It‚Äôs science.
This happens every day on the road behind my house -- National Guard Ave/River Cove. We picked up a bunch a few weeks ago.
Lots of woods by the roads by me. So when garbage including lots of twisted trees cans-gets tossed,it stays there until we can fish it out of the brush. 
Trash throwing trash.
I live off a road where no tourists would have any reason to go unless they got lost.

We are *constantly* picking up twisted tea cans or fireball nips.

Remember this the next time we get a post about flatlanders.

There‚Äôs no right to litter because your white ancestor got here before someone else‚Äôs white ancestor.
White pickup driver here and I‚Äôm more of a heady topper guy
I can't believe people willingly throw trash like that. No values or parenting? If my mother had seen me throw an empty can out the car window she would've knocked the shit out of me, and rightly so.
Its always Twisted Tea. Why is it always Twisted Tea?
Definitely agree I had a ex that did this once I made her go back and pick it up. Definitely a nasty pig move.
That is when you wish you were driving a completely tough, POS truck, to sort it out. 

I am with you only complete ASSHOLES throw their trash out the window.  That includes flippin cigarettes!!! 

Makes you want to follow them home. Empty all neighbors trash can onto their lawn‚Ä¶.
When I lived in Vermont a VAST trail went through my property. Those assholes always left Twisted Tea cans everywhere.¬†
"white trash loser" - I think you probably hit upon the reason right there.
As an ex piece of shit alcoholic with 5 years sober off the sauce, I can confirm it's ppl throwing empties out of their car to avoid legal trouble. Can't get charged for an open container if there's no container. :(
I saw someone just open their door at an intersection to dump their McD‚Äôs trash. No shame. I hate these behaviors.
Next can we do people who pick up their dog poop on the trail and then leave the bag next to the trail? There's nothing more infuriating to me.
If you're looking for logic and reason out of some redneck drinking a twisted tea on his drive home from work, consider he's too busy worried about people treading on him. He's got the complexity of flags, Biden, hatred, climate denialism, and just general shitheadery to worry about. He cares not for your complaint. He's probably disappointed the can didn't hit your windshield.
 Also, scoop your dogs poop and then take the bag home! The bag won‚Äôt just teleport to the dog poop bin!
Near my parents‚Äô house there‚Äôs somebody who throws crown royal bottles out of his car. I‚Äôve probably found 20 of them on a half-mile stretch of dirt road. At one point the guy must‚Äôve gotten his license suspended because there was a pile of them in the woods‚Ä¶ a year later, though, he was back to his old shenanigans. Alcoholism is wild
Lamoille county is bad
I was wondering if Twisted Tea is the most littered can in VT or if it is just more noticeable because it is yellow.
I regularly pick up litter at Shelburne Pond where a lot of Vermont trucks go for the fishing access. They are THE WORST. Just last week I picked up about 3 dozen cigarette butts in one spot where someone had clearly just dumped out their ash tray in the middle of the parking lot. So many cigarette butts, disposable vape thingies, cans, bottles, tons of tangled fishing line, lure packaging, broken lures, Slim Jim wrappers, take out containers.... they're fucking disgusting. I can't believe how much litter accumulates in such a tiny parking lot.
Thank you it‚Äôs way more locals than tourists littering!!!! Glad a fellow Vermonter can finally see and admit that!!!! I get so sick and tired of locals blaming tourists and out of state transplants for everything when it‚Äôs their neighbors 9 times out of 10..
I learned on VT Green-up Day that there's a local alcoholic who loves his big can of Fosters on the way home. I picked up at least 50 of them in a stretch of 150 yards!
You'd think with the property tax hike we'd at least get municipal trash removal for it.
You think losers drinking and driving care about littering? 

Those good ol boys enjoy how big of a pile they can make. They usually throw it out of the window at the same spots, hence piles of big light piss here and a cluster of twisted iced tea over there.
The park and ride by the catamount club in Williston would like a word. Feel like I drive by there daily to see a new stack of tires regularly
I lost it once, and the person followed me, then reported me for making ‚Äúracial comments‚Äù, which I didn‚Äôt, I just said to pick up after themselves, we were all white. people will do messed up things if you call them out on littering.
Hasn‚Äôt been active for a while, but you‚Äôll enjoy the Instagram @budriververmont.
Jokes on you these losers don‚Äôt give a fuck about literally anything
Can we start a coalition to get a $1 bottle and can deposit? A lot of the litter would magically go away if it were more then 5 cents!
I would love to see a poll of every county tallying the most prevalent can. In Windsor it‚Äôs a close call between twisted tea and bud light, but twisted probably edges out the lead.
Vermont. My home. Where people from there come here and then try to make here like there.
Dirtbag
White pickups are gonna be like that in every state‚Ä¶ they also think the own the road‚Ä¶ I know it sounds ridiculous. But it‚Äôs true. 5 years, and over 500,000 miles on the road, these are the guys most likely to be a holes
Problem is there are a lot of white trash losers in Vermont. And unfortunately all the twisted tea cans that you see on the roadway, and are actively thrown out of cars... Are by white trash losers that live in the state of Vermont. You are never going to change their mind. I wish we could change their minds, I really do.
Unpopular opinion: Abolish Greenup Day. In my rural community, in the months/weeks leading up to Greenup, the sides of our roads start looking like a landfill. People chuck appliances, toilets, all manner of trash because they KNOW it's going to be picked up.
If they tolerate it at the swim hole, imagine what the inside of their homes must look like!
A lot of it is dumbass pickup drivers who leave trash in the bed, and don't know how wind works.
Something about big pickup trucks attracts the wrong kind of people.

Rules for thee, not for me
Hey, leave the out of staters out of this!

Well that's a nickle pick them up and return them. Free money in your pocket.
"Just giving other people something to do on earth day"

Said by random old dude when I confronted them about throwing trash out their window..
Amen!!
So many here I see dig holes and burry truck loads of it or illegally burning it. It‚Äôs heart breaking. Hearing the ‚Äúit‚Äôs below the soil so it won‚Äôt hurt anything‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a little bit of burning. It won‚Äôt hurt anything.‚Äù
Just because you‚Äôre trash, doesn‚Äôt mean I have to accept it. There should be more signs for dumping fines.
It's everywhere, Maine is bad as well. I walk the dog on a very rural road and take a garbage bag with me. I pick stuff up everyday.  Beer cans, fast food bags, fast food Styrofoam containers, people are disgusting..
Stop.  Bitching!  

We all complain about tourists and out of staters and our neighbors.  That's a shitty way to make ourselves feel better.   And why I quit reddit.  Come on, people.  Please stop worrying about what your neighbor and tourists are doing and put that energy into stopping the systemic polluters of our state and country.  A bunch of twisted teas and butts by the roadside don't compare to the poisons we turn a blind eye to in our families, communities, states and country.
When I used to live near a public beach, it was out of state road bikers who were the most vial litter bugs The worst and most memorable litter I witnessed was a pair of underwear covered in feces with a bag of McDonald‚Äôs with it. 

One thing people fail to realize is that poor people don‚Äôt have a fancy trash service to pick up their trash every week. That means they have to bring the trash to the dump, which might not be affordable. That‚Äôs why you see disgusting mattresses and bags of trash dumped on my road. There‚Äôs a trailer park close by and a lot of people living in tight quarters and poverty. I have made it known to everyone in the park that if they need help hauling or paying for trash removal, to call me up. I would rather come help then look at a disgusting mattress for weeks before town road crew gets harassed into finally dealing with it. 

The beers cans is an obvious reason. They do not want to get a DUI. So they throw the can out the window so they don‚Äôt get an open container violation.  They know someone will eventually pick it up anyway. Not saying it‚Äôs right, but the reason people litter is more nuanced than just being inconsiderate or bad people.
There was a legislator who proposed a bill to ban the foam cigarette filters since so many smokers are inconsiderate and suck and toss their butts to the curb whether walking or driving. The bill never never gained traction, but I thought it was a great idea. At least the rest of the cigarette is essentially biodegradable for when smokers continue to toss them.
Burlington is by far the worst area for littering. It's like a 600 yard trash can on the interstate alone when you're driving by. To be fair they're busy dealing with a debilitating drug problem so maybe environmentalism has taken a back burner up there
Used to be BudLight, now it's Twisted Tea. The change seemed to happen right after the Right-wing freakout over that Mulvaney can, so I guess we know who's doing it.
People don‚Äôt want empties in the car if they get pulled over. Obviously not justifying it but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening
It's disgusting. Any good Vermonter knows you wait to litter till you're on the New York side of the lake!
All I had to see was pickup and can exactly picture the driver. I‚Äôm not putting every pickup driver in that category, but there‚Äôs a certain type of person who does that, and they pretty much always drive pickups, or at least some crappy American branded beater car‚Ä¶
People that drive white pickups know that they‚Äôre fucked up dick heads
Yeah because out of state people are gonna be reading Vermont Reddit lol
I hear you all, but you know...just to be a devil's advocate, cigarette butts are biodegradable. I'm not a Smoker (anymore), so don't yell at me...I'm a chemist.
Just a good guess, here. There are probably plenty of people who would (rightly or wrongly) point out that they have the right to litter. To toss trash and old tires into roadside ditches. To let their fast food bags haunt the roadside. And so forth.
Yes! And why those in particular?!! actually love a twisted tea but after picking up probably 20,000 of them from my side yard and ditch over the past couple of years I've lost my appetite for them
I always wondered if I just see more twisted teas cans because they are yellow but after attending several green up days over the years, I am confident in saying it is the official drink of VT litterers.
I just picked up 3 BL cans and 2 Foster's oilcans on my walk around the pond.   Not to mention the half dozen plastic UTZ pretzel size jars full of spent pickles someone dumped at edge of our property.   It's always a local throwing shit and dumping.
Fireball is a favorite of most Jerry‚Äôs to give them the courage to send it.

I've noticed the mini Fireball litter everywhere. I had no idea they sold so many until I started seeing them on the ground next to basically any road I've stood next to.
Love that. I have a lot of respect for people who aren't afraid to speak up on their principles like that
I really hate the way smokers just casually toss their butts as if they aren‚Äôt littering. I‚Äôve ‚Äúreturned‚Äù a few to sender over the years, but that wasn‚Äôt me (although it makes me happy to hear others are doing the same thing). I work at my local mountain which has a no smoking policy at the resort (they are allowed in the lot) and I‚Äôm always polite with the reminders to throw their butts away but still I always find a bunch. Scattered in the lot. If it looks fresh, it then gets put up under the windshield wiper.
I never thought much of it before I quit, always assumed they were biodegradable since they're tossed so much but saw something like over 2 billion butts are tossed on the ground per year and the effect they have. Ever since I was OCD about it, got alot of strange looks. "You really think your few butts a day will make a difference?", was something I often heard. 

It really wasn't hard to not litter
But what kind of vehicle was it tossed from? 
Cause I drive a white pickup and I‚Äôm MASSIVELY triggered rn
I was up Mt Tabor last weekend and there multiple literal pianos dumped on the side of the road in a national forest

This is fantastic!
üëè proof that this works! All it takes is one "oh shit, I fucked up and everybody knows" moment to potentially change someone's behavior.
Smoker here! Nothing irritates me more than sering butts all over the place. Its not hard to find a trash can. If a smoker is hiking, you bring a receptacle with you. Pack it in, pack it out *always*
Infuriating. I always want to blame out of staters but the people I see leaving their wrappers, butts, and dirty diapers down by my local river swimming spot are all from town. They grew up here and apparently don't give a shit about keeping the places THEY RECREATE in clean.
Us too. So much trash pushed down into the West River. But at least we haven't found big piles of human poop this summer.
Sounds like it's time to set up a well hidden trail camera to catch these people in the act and start shaming them publicly. They'll probably get a nice fine from it too.
If you can afford the new tires or couch, then you can DEFINITELY afford to properly dispose of the old ones. (You is plural. Not singling you out.)
Wouldn‚Äôt be Bull creek by chance? I‚Äôm pretty sick of pulling tires out the creek that runs through my property.
There is Green-Up day. Tons collected by volunteers.¬†
My favorite thing is the people who are so fucking cheap that they take their shit to the corner and put a free sign on it instead of where it needs to go the fucking dump you cheap ass motherfuckers!
I‚Äôll never forget a ride somewhere up in the NEK with a couple miles absolutely littered with the same small boxed wine cartons. I felt obviously disgusted but also kind of sorry for that person.
I'd like to argue that stoners and those who throw beer out of the window are two different groups of people. With some overlap..
Most people post their land because of all of the littering.
Agree, unfortunately. That's why we need to tell them they're acting like fools to their face, get a little bit of that social shame going.
Difference between "outdoors people" who just use the outdoors and those who also appreciate it.
I saw a sticker, ‚ÄúOnly trash litters‚Äù
Set up a trail cam
The only thing worse than flatlanders. Alcoholics.
Classin it up! And... You don't litter.... Right?
You don't see nearly as many "fancier" cans on the side of the road... gives you an idea of the caliber of folks drinking swill.
Knew someone who would get fast food, bag up all their trash in the bag from the meal, and then promptly chuck it out the window. I lost it the first time I watched it happen & then I was made out to seem like some hysterical eco nut but why on earth could you not just save the bag to throw out at the next place you stop? They said their family always did it that way and it didn‚Äôt matter.
Bud Light
I seriously fantasize about dumping all their trash back on their front lawn, making a pile the size of their house that engulfs their front door
That honestly makes sense. I'm sorry you had a hard time and great job on your 5 year sobriety!!
Trail? They do that at the park within 50 feet of the trash can in my town.
This made me laugh üòÇ fair point
Littering is the easiest way to "own the libs," don'tcha know.
When you can't face the family that you live with sober. Maybe you need some therapy. Or go back to being single.
It‚Äôs a common drink driving drink because of the smell.
> You'd think with the property tax hike we'd at least get municipal trash removal for it.

The property tax increases are almost 100% due to education spending.  This makes me think ... perhaps our school buses could be combined with dump trucks.  

Have the schools pickup my garbage along with my kids.  (at the end of the day, return the kids, not the garbage.)
Dude, I wish. Do you think that mentality is part of what's contributing to the littering? "I don't want to fill up my can at home because I don't want to go to the town dump/don't want to pay for a trash service"? Just curious. I don't like driving to the dump either but I do it because that's just part of life in the country. If people want an easy life where they are catered to they can pack up and move to a city
Vermont would go bankrupt from all the out-of-state cans returned to Vermont.
Orange Co-Bud Light
Lots of the white pickups tend to be carpenters/contractors in my area.
Burlington did something this past year where they had a collection area for dumped items to avoid sidewalks getting all clogged up. Apparently that worked. Maybe communities need to offer a yearly "free dump your shit"... I know that's probably wicked expensive though
It's going to get dumped anyhow.
Idk man sounds like we're bitching together here!
[removed]
Nah, tons of nice people have white pick up trucks. My dad does and he wouldn't hurt a fly (or litter). It's just a shitty stereotype I accidentally perpetuated with my angry rant.
You new here?
'Cigarette butts are not biodegradable because they contain non-biodegradable cellulose acetate plastic fibers.¬†While they can break down over time depending on environmental conditions, like the sun and rain, it can take up to 15 years for them to decompose.¬†In fact, a study found that a cigarette butt was only 38% decomposed after two years.'
> cigarette butts are biodegradable

not over time scales that matter

I'm gonna pick up smoking and dump all my butts on your lawn and see how you feel about it.
Don't chemicals from the butts and filters (if filtered) leach into the soil? Yeah, I know.... minimal impact from just a few discards... but often, they accumulate into quite a pile when many people drop them in the same spot.   
  
What happens if birds or animals eat them? 

Those are sincere questions. Not snark. 

Cigarettes may not be a massive pollution issue as far as the longevity of the thing itself (the cigarette butt) but there is still an impact. 

For me, an additional issue is the psychological orientation of people who pollute, period. I mean... to me, from that standpoint, it doesn't matter what the item is. Dumping one's crap along public roadways, in public waterways, just anywhere they damn please is a shitty take on being a human/member of society.  

Anyway.
what the fuck are you talking about
It‚Äôs the freedom crowd, I‚Äôm sure.
Cheap way to drink on the way home from the job site without your wife smelling alcohol on your breath
Choice drinks of alcoholics and drunk drivers.
It's a cheap and easy way to get loaded.
You're not supposed to drink the ones you pick up from your side yard and ditch. No wonder you've lost your appetite for them.
Honestly? I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs because you can buy both of those at the grocery store or gas station. Going to the actual liquor store before it closes requires some strategy and organization, apparently like figuring out how and where to throw away your garbage properly. Ugh.
A lot of gas stations have started selling mini fireball and mcgillicuddy‚Äôs at the register.
fosters oil cans lol brings back memories!! (not of dumping them on your property)
Easy to put down. Smells like cinnamon...decent kick and its CHEAP.  I see all sorts of weird random cans on the side of the road from the white trash that lives down the road.  We are on a dead-end back road, so it's pretty obvious who it is.
My mother used to knock on their window and throw the cigarette back into their car.
In between quittings I smoked one winter outside the house only and threw the butts in the snow bank and where ever.  Come spring I had to pick up every single one of them. Made me quit for good.
My first step towards quitting was quitting smoking in my car. Primarily because I had my car detailed, I guess, but also because I decided to never throw my butts on the ground again. 

It‚Äôs been like 20 years since I last smoked a cigarette in a car, but maaan, the urge is still there every time I close the door.
Damn.  A shame too because there can be some good wood to reclaim from a piano, especially the older pianos.
Field dress your smokes!
5oz energy thingies are really air tight. Great for stowing your butts in your pocket without getting stinky.
Yep, I carry one of those Rescue Remedy tins to keep my butts in when I'm out in the woods or anywhere where I'm unlikely to find a trash can. And if I forget it, my butts either go in my pocket or in my bag. It's not that hard...
I take the paper off when I‚Äôm done with my butt and throw the filter in the trash
[deleted]
"Excuse me, you dropped your (trash item)."

Give them a chance to realize they were seen and a way out "oh, I didn't notice, thanks"

Then lay it on
Can‚Äôt reason with alcoholics üòï
Yeah I could, but I‚Äôm too busy to police this.
Must be the only guy in a white pickup who doesn‚Äôt. 

It‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôve been subjected to just about every stereotype there is for a white middle aged male contractor in a pickup truck
I agree, but pickup trucks are expensive!
People have no sense of right and wrong anymore :(

People have really become so self absorbed that they don‚Äôt even consider the consequences.
It's all good I'm funnier and more aware for having gone thru all of that, if anything.
Lol on my ride home today some dude in front of me threw a diet coke can out the window...now that, I can't explain, aside from just absolute disregard for anything besides one's own desires.
At least at the park there's a reason to pick it up in the first place. Not that it's okay to not throw it away, but I don't even understand the mentality of picking up dog shit in the middle of the woods and then putting it back down in the woods in a plastic bag where it can stay forever. I don't even clean up my dogs poo in the bushes at my own house. It makes more sense to let it do what it does than putting it in a plastic bag to sit in a landfill for the next 100 years
The tax hike is almost entirely driven by the cost of health insurance for teachers. It‚Äôs one giant advertisement for universal healthcare.
No. It‚Äôs mostly shitty alcoholics who don‚Äôt want the evidence of their DUI in the car.
It's part of it.  Maybe not casual littering but that's certainly why every pulloff has couches and mattresses down over the bank.
With weekly trash pick up, you get morons leaving their trash outside all week so a bear or other animal can sift through.
Or constant, not just annually.¬†

Read my other reply.  Not a butt dumper...just making a factual point...cans are worse.
Yeah, I hear you and agree.  When I was a smoker, I carried around one of those weed ziplocs to put my butts in.  It's just that I've been in acetate tow manufacturing facilities and seen how it's made.  It's basically wood bark.  It would be interesting to compare the biodegradation of a cigarette butt next to a stick and see if there is any difference.

EDIT: All I was really saying is that cans and shit are way worse.
Yeah there's a real specific brand of person who consistently puts their personal liberties and convenience over public good and well being
Oh damn didn't consider that. Sir here has the inside scoop üòÖ
And tossing the alcohol bottle removes some of the evidence of the DUI that is owed.
> on the way home from the job site

only on the way home, for sure.
This is why I assume 2/3 at least are twisted tea.

Easy to chug with no bubbles too.

Ah, ok, that actually makes sense and it's not something I had considered...
Even in places with municipal trash removal, those are usually an extra charge (so you still see it in those places as well).

yep. 

I've been off the sauce for a few years... well like 8... I never liked twisted teas, so gross.
That's why I started with 'To be clear" and ended with a question mark. I wasn't sure if that's what they were saying, so I asked for clarification.
Congrats! Proud of you :)
They're saying it's an inadvertent advertisement for Universal Healthcare, cause if everyone just already had healthcare this wouldn't be an issue and the tax hike most likely would not happen.
Skier or Snowboarder‚Äôs Fault?!
üôÑ
Last time I check you can only see what‚Äôs in front of you. Skier‚Äôs at fault. Should have seen snowboarder in front. Watch closely and skier wasn‚Äôt paying attention.
Skier 100%. Skier was uphill of her before he hit her (he could see her whereas she could not see him). She was riding a line on one side of the hill and was in a toe side turn when skier recklessly slammed into her back
It amazes me how so many skiers (and riders) go down the mountain like they have horse blinders on and zero situation awareness, like 95% of people on the slopes.  I ride like my head is on a swivel, I'm constantly looking back and around me for unaware Jerrys.

https://preview.redd.it/6u5kea52nmdc1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dda4bf266294241f26ba10e9e460cb48b6bbc96
Post this in r/skiing and see what they say for comparison. Should be fun to watch that unravel üòÇ
If you come from above and shot down someone in front of you, its your fault. Especially if the person don‚Äòt even see you.

So its the skiers fault for 100%
[deleted]
Easily skier

Was behind the snowboarder (carving on their blindsided) and the carved right into them still semi behind them
Listen, it‚Äôs always the overtaker.
Downhill rider has the right of way - every run, every time. Skier was uphill and able to see the boarded, even when cutting across the slopes in the boarder‚Äôs direction, whereas the boarder couldn‚Äôt see the skier at all. The skier is 100% at fault here.
This seems to be a thing with skiers that they try to ski way too close to people for no reason. I remember teaching my small children to ski, we would have ‚Äújerk-off‚Äù skiers constantly going past us very close even though I had a 6 year old with me. Boarders never seem to come close ever. I would say most accidents are skiers faults simply because they refuse to give anyone room in the mountain.
dumbass skier
Skier
Shred Court judge seys - skier 100% at fault for failing to shoulder check when making a wide sweeping carve from one side of the hill to the next and failing to keep track of others as you speed past everyone.
The fact that so many people in this thread think you don‚Äôt need to look behind you ever is mind blowing. I never want to share a mountain with any of you.
Skier, he was uphill.
Skier 100%
The jury is unanimous..skier is to blame..wonder if he tried to blame the snowboarder?
I‚Äôm sure that douchebag skier had some words for her.
I said skiier before I watched it, was right ü§∑
Two details from the slow-mo:

1. Her helmet cover has bunny ears! ü•π
2. The skier not only crashed into her, he also hit his ski on her helmet at the end there.
Skiers fault. I was recently skiing at Park City resort and a ski instructor hit me from behind like this. He tried to blame me, but the skier‚Äôs responsibility code is very clear about this: downhill skier/rider has right of way. Glad that PC safety patrol was around to mediate when this idiot offered me a free lesson while trying to blame me for him running into me. As a former ski instructor myself I was very offended. Reported him to the ski school director and leadership at Vail Resorts but that was 6 weeks ago and nothing has come from it.
Toothpick jockey for sure
pro tip, if you want to live to be an old age and not have life changing injuries or worse, then it is ALWAYS YOUR FAULT. 

Don't let the world convince you otherwise. You can snowboard and ski safely your whole life but you have to realize that everyone on the mountain is trying to kill you.
80/20 skiers fault.
Skier.   No question.  Uphill.
Skiier and their tunnel vision.
Skiers suck at skiing
Boomer‚Äôs fault
A question for you fellow redditers. It seems like overwhelming opinion is skier‚Äôs at fault. Skier was uphill but was catching up. Because of the wide lens it seems like skier was really uphill but when the snowboarder decided to cut across there is no way skier can see her coming unless he turns his head to look if he is clear.
My question is skiing or snowboarding, do you have the right of way to cut across as long as you are clear of anybody infront of you? Can you just cut across from one end to the other and it is the responsibility of the people behind you to watch out for you? Somebody gave a traffic example. Can you just change lanes and cut people off and say it‚Äôs their responisibility to make sure they don‚Äôt hit me

PS. I am not a member of this subreddit. I don‚Äôt ski or snowboard. Reddit just suggested this post, beats meü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èJust curios about the right of way
I hate selfie sticks.
Seems like just an accident. If I absolutely had to place fault it would probably be the skier since they came from further up the run. Yes the snowboarder cut across a bit much, but the skier did the same at the same time.

Editing to add that the skier absolutely should have seen the snowboarder since he was uphill. Zero situational awareness on their part.

2nd edit:
Changed my mind while watching the video again. 100% the skiers fault.
she couldn't see him
Skier I will not write more because English is not my language really and dk how to write that but 100% skier
What‚Äôs up with these videos lately? It‚Äôs always some snowboarder hugging the edge of the run and some skier doing grand slalom across the entire run?
Skier 1000%
Didn't watch the video so don't know who is who. That being said whoever was uphill is at fault.
Skier. They were up hill long before the collision and moved across into the snowboarder apparently not seeming to see them at all.
Skier 100%
Skier is in your blind spot.
Back turned, def skier! Those unexpected crashes can be gnarly.
Skier's fault definitely!
Skier
Skier 100% and not even debatable.
100% skiers fault. Snowboarder has a blindspot and skier technically came from up hill and clearly wasn‚Äôt scanning terrain. Also had his goggles up for some reason which could cause for his bad visibility.
the person who is overtaking is responsible for avoiding the person  being overtaken.
The snowboard was downhill so they‚Äôre right. The skier should not have gotten that close from behind.
Skier here, I can‚Äôt say what sort of visibility the snowboarder has here (as I have never snowboarded) but at least as a skier I find that it‚Äôs really easy to glance over quickly and keep track of others on the slope. Probably not a great idea to swerve across most of the hill in general if you can‚Äôt throw a quick glance (as the snowboarder here did). But the skier seems more culpable to me here as they had more visibility and were clearly not being aware.
100% not even an argument to be made‚Ä¶ the skier
The skier is for sure at fault. Not sure why this popped up on my ‚Äúfor you‚Äù stuff on Reddit but got damn some of you snowboarders need to chill out about skiers‚Ä¶.
Oh shit I know this hurt
100% skier
It‚Äôs a simple rule: it‚Äôs always the fault of the person behind, because he or she can see what‚Äôs in front of them, whereas the person in front can‚Äôt. In that case it may not be that obvious and they‚Äôre both a little at fault in my opinion for taking such large curves without even looking around them, but it‚Äôs still the skiers‚Äôs fault as she should have looked around her more carefully and spot the snowboarder.
skier 100%
Whoever is behind
Skier 100%
Downhill always has the right of way
I‚Äôd say equal but kinda more the fault of the skier
Pretty cut and dry the skier no contest
Anyone coming from behind you has 100% responsibility to avoid you
Skier was uphill so it would be their responsibility to avoid downhill skiers
Uphill skier is at fault.
üíØ skier
Skiier was dumb as hell.
Skier lost control
Skier, came from behind, dipshit
Skier all day
Uphill party. Skier in this instance.
Skiers, they were up hill, thems the rules
Skier
According to a skier it‚Äôs always snowboarders fault but in this case it‚Äôs definitely the fault of the skier. They were uphill of them. Not paying attention. And the snowboarder wasn‚Äôt taking wide lines, definitely skier
Skier
It‚Äôs the uphill skiers fault 99% of the time. This incident is on the skier.
Skier was taking up the whole trail !
Skier but I can‚Äôt blame them for taking out the boarder wearing that cringe helmet hood
Skier
Like a car accident, who ever is behind is at fault.
Skier 100%.
100% Skier‚Äôs fault. Rider downhill has the right of way. Classic skier move, being completely oblivious to all surroundings except for what is right in-front of their face. Left Turn Lucy should have been more aware of the riders ahead of her. ‚ÄúGo fast, turn left!!!‚Äù She ate way too much vagisil for breakfast.
Skier. You can see the skier way up the hill behind the snowboard. That MFer skis right down and hits the snowboarder. You have to be in control AND people down hill have the right of way.
100% skier, snowboarder has established a steady & consistent line. Skier is on the boarders blind side and should be a lot more aware.
Last time I checked you don't have eyes behind your head
Skier 1000%, not even a remote question.
Downhill skier has the right of way. why are there so many videos coming out like this, people skiing recklessly then blaming it on the slower skier down the hill. If you can‚Äôt see where you‚Äôre going idk maybe pick a different sport
Skier
Skier. They had second position.
Neither they both clearly didn‚Äôt see each other it was an honest mistake on both ends
skier, but they both seemed to be in each others blind spot
Both yall never looked around
He French fried instead of pizzaing... 
Bad time...
Hard to tell with a fish eye lens
Always the fault of the one behind. It's like hitting someone from behind in your car.
No one‚Äôs fault really, boarder couldn‚Äôt see the skier cuz they where back to there left a few feet above and skier clearly didn‚Äôt see the boarder cuz of their helmets blind spot. It happens occasionally
Wtf. ‚õ∑Ô∏è didn‚Äôt even pay attention
I just think it was unlucky timing with no fault tbh
Skier
I do both and it‚Äôs clearly the skier who was uphill
Skier. People downhill of you have the right of way.
Skiers. They approached from further back, going faster, to catch up before collision. Meaning they were more in the blindspot of the snowboarder. 

I'm an old school skier. If I can side with the boarder this easily. Honestly, it's the skiers fault.
Skier. Snowboarder was below him and couldn‚Äôt see him, the skier had the uphill advantage and decided not to look.
Snowboarder was hit from behind
Skiier was behind and didn't check their sides while drifting. Snowboarder couldn't even see the skiier behind them...
Skier‚Äôs fault!  This is also a perfect example of how not to ride a snowboard.  You have to look over your heelside edge to avoid situations like this! If you ride like this these situations will continue to happen to you
Skiers fault....they need to yield the way to the snowboards and move out of the way
Should we not first establish her level of steezy or am I on the wrong sub?
Both doing the same thing and both not looking. I keep my head on a god damn gyroscope going down the hill.
Anyone using a selfie stick bears some responsibility for any collision
[deleted]
Skier. Next question
Are you ok!?
Skier. Always. Always the person above. Always. There could be some shit sudden move on the part of the person below, but it‚Äôs still the uphill rider/skier to be ready.
Skiers ruin everything
Downhill always has the Right Of Way 

The Skier ‚õ∑Ô∏èwas at Fault.
Skier 100%. Your line was nice and tight, keeping to a very small section of the run. Skier was uphill, gaining speed and decided it was a great time to cut clear across. A$&hole move if I ever saw one. I have absolutely seen the opposite happen, but whenever I'm cut off, it's a skier 9/10 times.
I assume most people here are snowboarders. I just wanted to say that from a skier's perspective, all you damn snowboarders, jk, jk.  100% skier's fault. They were uphill and are responsible for seeing the boarder below.

The one situation that frustrates me is when a downhill snowboarder goes from normal, predictable turns, to cutting across the whole run on their heel edge, not looking at all where they're going. Not the case here, and pretty rare, but I've had a few close calls.
I think legally it‚Äôs always the snowboarders fault
Snowboarder, should have been watching where they were turning, not going left without looking.
Always the boarder
Technically the skier - downhill rider has the right of way. But the nuance is that the snowboard cut way farther toward the skier than the skier cut towards the snowboarder - look at the distance between the skier -> trees and snowboarder -> tress before the crash and at the time of the crash. Even if you have right of way on a busy run you can't just take big sweeping turns and not expect to catch anyone off guard. Claim that the skier is at fault is countered by the erratic snowboarding, case dismissed. üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

Number 1 reason why I avoid cat tracks at all costs is all the people turning the full width of the tracks or turning at unpredictable times. It can make it really tough to pass them and avoid this kind of mistake.
So there are a few things:
- neither the skier or the snowboarder are taking the time to look around at their surroundings. Sure you don‚Äôt have eyes in the back. Of your head, but situational awareness of the people around you are key. 

- the snowboarder started at the left (perspective left) most section of the run and ended up in. The middle. The skier started in the right most section and was carving to the middle. The displacement made by the snowboarder is more based on the start of the video than the skier who is consistently in the same course. 

-The run curves towards the right, so the snowboarder should have been a bit more aware that the near, mountain side of the track is technically faster as it covers less distance. You can clearly see how far the snowboarder drifted from the edge marker from the beginning to the post crash shot. 

Having said that, I would still hold the skier at fault at 80% for not seeing the snowboarder come closer to them, but I also partially blame the snowboarder at 20% for going across the run without ever looking to see who might be barreling downhill, and for lack of situational awareness.
Watch it closely, skier on the lane but snowboard gets closer even s/he can't see back
clearly the skier on this one...it was uphill and came way off its line. Downhill boarder had right of way.
Both tbh and if you were checking uphill while you were crossing the ENTIRE hill on your blindside it would have been avoided as well.
Didn't watch the video, skiers defenetly at fault
Obviously, the skier‚Äôs fault however I‚Äôm gonna blame it on the motorcyclist. üòÖüòÇü§£
Skier. The one that's in the back should always be able to see the ones that are in the front, and chose the  right speed just in case they need to stop.   
Snowboarder didn't check the safety, so that part is her fault, but in the end, if you go by the rules and common sense, the skier is at fault here.
Always skier.
The snowboarder was turning AWAY from the skier. It couldn't have been their fault. They couldn't see the skier, and they were also downhill. Skier's fault 100%
I hate skiers....have them buzzing too close on empty runs for no reason. 

Had one drop into a chute with me last season, they're just fucking idiots. That was cozy for a bit.

100% skiers fault....they not even looking.
skier‚Äôs fault, clearly and unambiguously. 

having said that, the snowboarder has chosen to compromise their peripheral vision towards their heel side by having that hoodie pulled so far forward. it is possible that they may have been able to see the hit coming and lessen the impact, or even avoid entirely if that were the case. just because you have right of way doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt be situationally aware and vigilant at all times.
Now post this in r/skiing and watch the skier crowd blame the ‚Äúout of control snowboarder‚Äù for not being able to see behind her on her blind side. Feel for the rider, never saw that coming and looks like it was a fairly high speed scorpion. Hope they are ok.
Good thing snowboarder had a dash cam easy case. Skier at fault 100%
I‚Äôm a ski patroller. This is absolutely the skiers‚Äô fault, as anyone in front of you has the right of way.
It looks like the snowboarder went all the way from the left side of the trail to the right side of the trail pretty quickly. I would have looked over my shoulder for a move like this. So I think both are kinda at fault here.
I see the comment section, but having never been skiing or snowboarding, and without knowing anything about either, the snowboarder looks like they did the equivalent of cutting across 4 lanes and slamming their brakes
Maybe put the selfie stick down and take a peek uphill once in awhile. It‚Äôs obviously skiers fault but at the end of the day it‚Äôs a collision and could be the end of the season for either one. Same thing goes for when driving. The thing behind you can kill/injure you same as the person thing in front. And if you‚Äôre gonna trust every Jerry that‚Äôs uphill to give you the right away you must trust the media and government blindly too
The person coming from behind is almost always at fault, but not in this case. Snowboarding should be illegal and therefore everything that goes wrong on the slopes is their fault.
Both of you. You did not check your surroundings once the whole video dude.
Both at fault
![gif](giphy|IuaM5sUvLCYTyNKV4J)
The snowboarders line is pretty predictable. Shes going down her line in her turning rythm letting enough room to overtake. The skier used the whole space and behaved unpredictable, so for every faster one it could be a callenge to save overtake, and for slower ones, as you can see, it can end up bull dozed.

Hope she‚Äòs not too much hurt and can still enjoy her ridings.
[deleted]
These videos are fucking annoying
Skiers fault on the hill, snowboarders fault for making another ‚Äúwho‚Äôs to blame‚Äù video. 

Any cool shit on that GoPro, or is getting run over the best ya got?  Nerd
Hard to tell 100% from video, but ski law says the downhill person always has the right of way. In this case, it kind of appears that both the skier and snowboarder and weaving back and forth across the slope without much awareness of what‚Äôs around them.
both. Look over your shoulder when turning toward the center slope.
lose the selfie stick and be alert to your surroundings. Knob.
Unpopular opinion here but I think the snowboarder is ultimately at fault. I think the wide eye lens portrays that the snowboarder is ahead when they are actually closer to being next to one another when the collision occurs. It‚Äôs hard to tell why the snowboarder is cutting so hard to their left without seeing the downhill view to see if the run is turning but to cut that far to the left and not to check slightly uphill is just irresponsible. It‚Äôs like changing your lane in a car without checking to make sure if someone‚Äôs there or not.
Snow boarder not looking where theyre going.
It doesn't really matter. Both you and the skier did the wrong things.

The skier didn't catch the line right and didn't avoid you (assuming its your selfie vid), and you didn't look up to avoid the skier. Situational awareness on the mountain is important.
Skier was making an aggressive cut across the majority of the run. Snowboarder was staying in their ‚Äúlane‚Äù. Skiers fault.
Snowboards fault. What was she thinking looking in the direction shes traveling. She should be looking up the mountain...oh wait..skratch that, reverse it. I just looked it up and you are supposed to look where you're going when you're traveling at high speeds. Go figure
Skier for sure, but the snowboarder is cluelessly going across the slope
Same reason why you should NEVER, and I mean FUCKING NEVER stop in the middle of a trail and keep your back turned to uphill traffic. It's a recipe for disaster!!!
It‚Äôs the skiers fault in my opinion, but things happen. Skiing/snowboarding is a dangerous sport. Things happen. He wasn‚Äôt being reckless, just not as completely aware as one would like. When things like this happen, there‚Äôs no point in pointing fingers. Just make sure everyone‚Äôs ok is all that matters.
Honestly about as 50/50 as you can get

The boarder 100% could've paid more attention heelside, especially since they're at a left turn, and you can tell they cut more to the left,which would've cut a LOT of people off if there was more. And while the skier is still at some fault for not being totally aware, this is one hundred percent on the boarder. She didn't even try to turn her head left at all to check her blindside, and a tad bit of unlucky timing with the both of their carving patterns. The left turn was only gradual but enough to make a difference. Being uphill doesn't mean squat when someone still cuts toward, even if it's gradual it's not going to help if it crosses an eventually path of where another person is going to carve to decrease momentum.

But nope, had to be more preoccupied with a selfy stick.
I know that the person uphill should be aware but they were at the time the snowboarder cut across the whole entire run they were at the same elevation so I think it is the snowboarder
It‚Äôs the snowboarders fault for being a knuckle dragger
Primarily the skier, but I would have checked my blind side if I was drifting left like that.
Snowboarder‚Äôs fault. The skier definitely wasn‚Äôt alert or situationally aware and shame on them but the snowboarder made an unusually broad, toe side turn across the whole slope without looking.
Both. Period.

 Neither were paying attention and there was absolutely no excuse for either of them. I dgaf what you ride, pay the fuck attention, neither were going so fast to make it unreasonable to check your six from time to time especially when you're doing swooping S curves or wanting to start cutting across the field.  

As a boarder, I put more blame on the boarder for riding absent minded and for a video shot around people rather than doing this on an empty section. Nope, don't care, "blind side" is bullshit and boarder could have easily spotted that with proper attention instead of doing their dipshit glam vid.
I don‚Äôt even have to watch the video to know that it‚Äôs the snowboarders fault. They have no place in the mountains with the real athletes that are skiers
Skier, big time. That snowboarder should be pissed.
Snowboarder switching lanes without looking. Snowboarder def cut pretty far across the hill. It‚Äôs hard to see it cuz that‚Äôs who‚Äôs filming. Guarantee if it was a stationary cam at the bottom of the hill, everyone would be blaming the snowboarder.
Idk man snowboarder kinda cuts across the entire face of the mountain into the skiers way. Although snowboarder can‚Äôt see skier. So I‚Äôd say both are at fault?
Snowboarder, shouldn‚Äôt have been focused on filming with a selfie stick.
I bet if the snowboarder wasn't more concerned with making the video than enjoying they run, they would have had more situational awareness and could have avoided the collision all together.
This is why I ski Alta
You‚Äôre both dumb for being in the snow. Next time stay home.
I‚Äôm always checking over my shoulder when I try to bomb runs because I can‚Äôt trust anyone on the mountain
Lmao yeah. Skier was cutting all the way across the run while looking the opposite direction. Wtf
[deleted]
![gif](giphy|UqKD7TU0igaUE)
Downhill rider always has right of way. Skier at fault.
Yeah idk how it‚Äôs a question. Watch where you are going.
Idk how skiers don‚Äôt understand that we cannot see anything behind us on our backside. It‚Äôs not like they can see behind themselves either.
Did the skier have their goggles off their eyes on their helmet? I blame skier all day.¬†
Exactly for this reason, it is typically the ‚Äúuphill‚Äù entity at fault in most collisions.  You have to maintain control and be aware of people downhill from you.  (Exception being if downhill entity is not visible or doing something stupid.)
While I still agree that it‚Äôs the skier‚Äôs fault, I suspect the camera lens effect makes it look like he swerves much farther than he actually does. 

Even so, he is uphill and not aware of his surroundings.
Yup the skier had so much time to actually take a quick scan and see everyone around him with his peripherals. It‚Äôs like driving you see cars and their patterns of where they‚Äôre going so it‚Äôs up to you to figure out when you can pass them
I don‚Äôt ski or snowboard and it‚Äôs so blatantly obvious the skier is at fault.
Skiers are the road bikes of the mountain
I agree it's the skier's fault. To play devil's advocate here, I would just like to acknowledge the accident happened right when they crossed over into a shadow, perhaps causing the skiers eyes to be temporarily blinded from their adjustmenting to the light difference. But yes, the skiers fault.
They were pretty much side by side though. Neither is paying attention to their surroundings.
I‚Äôd say they both did the same thing at the same time. it was a whoopsie.
To me it looks more like she slammed her back into the skier. The only reason it seems like the skier would be unaware of her is if she was encroaching into his line.
Both are just as guilty she ain't ever looked around
You are correct only because skier was uphill. Snowboarder is still a dick for crossing (what looks like) to the other half of the run. Being faster and downhill of everybody else doesn‚Äôt mean you have full right to the entire run.

Both also look like they are the fastest people on the mountain, so they kinda both suck for having zero awareness.
She suddenly cuts hard left and he doesn‚Äôt catch it because he‚Äôs not even facing toward her in that moment. Pretty collaborative if you ask me.
I‚Äôm going to disagree. The camera is in front of snowboarder. So if yo keep your eyes on the skier , the skier stays on the right side of the hill. The video makes it look as if the the snowboarder stayed on the left , in actuality the snowboarder drifted to the middle then to the right ( looking at the screen ) where the snowboarder collided into the skier which was in their lane
Nah, it‚Äôs a fisheye lens. I don‚Äôt think the skier was as uphill as it looks. The skier was on the edge of the run on the outside of their turn and the snowboarder cut across the whole run to their blindside. A blindside exacerbated by that ridiculously stupid hood thing they have on. Undoubtedly with headphones in listening to music. I say both at fault but edging towards snowboarder.
It looks like both of them don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing or how to snowboard/ski on a mountain that‚Äôs not empty
skiis are much faster and less able to change direction suddenly
I would have thought it was the snowboarders fault. It looks like the skier goes straight und the snowboarder cuts into the skiers lane. But maybe it's the lense.
I think of snowboarding the same way I think about riding a motorcycle. Sure I might have all the right of ways in the world but if I‚Äôm not on my shit I might be dead at any moment and it doesn‚Äôt really matter who‚Äôs fault it is at that point. Snow sports have lower consequences but think about the average persons decision making‚Ä¶..and then a standard deviation below that‚Ä¶..yeah I‚Äôm gonna look out for me, cuz most people are not.
I like to hit side hits and I always turn around to look then give a turn signal when I‚Äôm about to do something stupid
RIGHT‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ I‚Äôve never thought ‚ÄúI ride regular, I guess I can only see the right side of the mountain ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù. Ultimately if you‚Äôre up hill you have responsibility to not run into someone down hill but if you‚Äôre down hill you should still be conscious of the other person going just about the same speed as you.
It‚Äôs incredible how many people have 0 uphill awareness‚Ä¶ or any awareness whatsoever.
I don't ski or snowboard. As an outside observer, I think 95% of people have blinders on in general regardless of being on the mountain.
100% I‚Äôm constantly checking blind spots etc. can‚Äôt trust people to not be morons
There are probably 1% of skiers that will clip me from behind and I still turn my head uphill just in case. Doesn‚Äôt take much effort to do it.
Honestly I do too but I'd never have seen OPs accident coming she's progressing on a predictable narrow line, and carving on *toe side edge* when she gets struck on heel side.¬†¬†


It's egregious of the skier. And they aren't even a beginner there's just no excuse¬†


Like literally had the OP boarder looked over they'd still have been hit
This might be unpopular in this thread, but this whole thing could have been avoided if the rider just peaked over their shoulder before going long heal edge.
I admittedly have blinders sometimes, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm faster than 95% of people on the mountain so my main focus is avoiding people downhill of me, sometimes I forget to check uphill
As a skier, this is definitely the skiers fault
Someone did, resoundingly the skier's fault. Just different planks of wood that you're sliding down a mountain on ‚úåÔ∏è
Downhill rider has the right of way regardless of the type of plank (or planks) you‚Äôre on. Countless videos of both boarders and skiers doing this stuff‚Ä¶end of the day, they‚Äôre just idiots and assholes not boarders or skiers.
I hope someone does post it, I‚Äôd be interested to see the difference. There would definitely be plenty of dumb ‚Äújokes‚Äù about how it‚Äôs always the boarders fault, but I‚Äôd like to think most of the highly upvoted comments would recognize that the skier here was completely at fault. 

Mainly I just hope no one was too badly hurt! This looks like a painful crash.
Would not be any different opinions than here (besides a very rare minority). It‚Äôs weird you think there would be any notable difference‚Ä¶
This was cross posted to r/skiing which is how I came upon it. Every single comment over there agreed it was the skiers fault.
Another skier here. I think r/skiing would be overwhelmingly blaming the skier as well. I feel like it‚Äôs more often the boarders‚Äô fault in videos like this, but this is definitely skier.
I‚Äôll get the popcorn.
Did you get the reaction and attention you wanted?
I second this
Surely the person going left and right on a slope shouldn‚Äôt check if they‚Äôre cutting someone‚Äôs lane. Of course not. At least, not when they‚Äôre snowboarders lmao. I snowboard but I‚Äôm gonna check if I‚Äôm cutting someone off
[deleted]
This is the only answer. Lots of people talking about who is turning, which is irrelevant.
What if someone swerves across an entire run without looking?
It's definitely not always the overtaker. If you're going completely horizontally across a wide trail, without looking back, you deserve that shit. I've waited like 120 seconds trying to get into the mind of a skier in front of me so I can pass them. Try to do it, and all of a sudden, the skier going half as fast as me, literally is taking such a wide turn that they're moving UP the mountain. So annoying.
100% "Downhill rider has the right of way - every run, every time." End of conversation.
This.
While it's still good to keep an eye on who's behind you, by this camera angle, the snowboarder shouldn't have had to check her rear.

The skier seems to have full view of the rider the whole clip.
He seemed to not care and assume the rider could see him when clearly she couldn't.

When someone is in front of me, I always try to predict their line and keep out of their way as much as possible. In my experience, skiers don't know how to read rider's lines.
I've had close calls like this clip.
Depends where this is, in Europe you for sure have to check before you deviate a lot from your line. Similar to how it works in cars. But it's impossible to tell from this camera who is taking what line relative to the slope
You did WHAT to the skiers? (Sorry but I had to)
Last season I had a skier behind me ski right up on top of the back of my board and rip off a chunk of the board. Good for you to teach your kids about looking out for others. I took both ski and snowboard lessons. In my snowboard lessons spacial awareness and safety were drilled into me. Not once in my ski lessons did they mention spacial awareness or down hill etiquette. At least at my local hill, there is a huge educational gap and that scares me.
Definitely not just skiers, I snowboard and have had countless snowboarders (and skiers) come blasting 3 feet away from me when we have had the whole width of the slope to ourselves and I‚Äôm doing super tight obvious repetitive carves. I think it‚Äôs more of a inconsiderate people issue than a snowboard/ski issue
Yeah, daily experience when on pists. There could be the whole riding space almost empty but skiers pass and let no room or chrash a rider like in the vid. Those guys should get banned for a while. In case of an injury happened, bring em to court.
For me personell the only to avoid this.
Go faster than all of em!
Or enjoy off pist.
But at work, i have to go sometimes slow as well, sometimes  i go as last of the group and let one of my studs lead, and i just block off the skiers. Sometimes one of em have to bite the snow, but not me or one of my studs.

If i see something like in the vid and the skier would leave without leaving his data for insurance issues (in case, most the injuries you feel a little later), i would chease this guy down.
I was just snowboarding in Switzerland. A lot of skier kids would purposely do that and laugh. They enjoy doing it and make it like a game. 

Awful because it can really cause a massive accident, if they somehow lost control.
Facts. There were two skiers one time weaving back and forth edging from one end to the other of the pathway when everyone was trying to pass behind them. They got hit by someone trying to time their weave to go in-between and got pissed.
Of course most accidents are skiers fault, there are several times more of them.
wow, it's boarders that do that where I've skied.  If someone has come flying up from behind, 90% of the time it's a boarder.
But in this case, it looks like the skier stayed in his lane and the snowboarder cut into it? Or is it just the lense that makes it look like that. Before the crash, the skier passed others with enough distance.
Absolutely not true.  Knowing and following the rules are completely independent of what you have on your feet.
No back, only front. Big hill, one stick go fast.
Right, how many times have you seen a skier look BEHIND them? Is it even fucking possible? GTFO
Facts. Snowboarder should have been alert to the skier just as much  as the skier should have been aware of the boarder. This is why music should be listened to so loudly that you can‚Äôt hear your surroundings. I‚Äôd put money that snowboarder was bumping some toons and couldn‚Äôt hear the skier.

Anyone saying one person is 100% at blame here, is 1. Not considering that the fisheye lens makes the skier look further behind the snowboarder than they are and 2. Just not really thinking about this whole thing critically
As the owner of a similarly snow camouflaged snowboarding jacket (black & white), let me victim shame the snowboarder by saying ‚Äúadd some colorful flare to your jacket already!‚Äù Also, only focussing on holding your GoPro on a stick to make a cool video, makes me think this is staged. Or was it one of those snowboarder-only runs?
I‚Äôm going to guess the skier absolutely blamed the snowboarder. Although most collisions usually involve blaming the other.
[deleted]
You‚Äôre 100% right to ask this. Camera lens definitely distorts the depth of this footage. Honestly, it looks like snowboarder cut across harder than an uphill person would expect. Skier didn‚Äôt react in time to avert collision. Two minor faults make a little boom. But this is an outrage sub, so it‚Äôs the skier‚Äôs fault. /s
Boarder didn‚Äôt cut across that much really. Looks like more due to wide angle lens. The skier was ALL OVER the run and was cutting to his right like all the way across very quickly with his head turned the opposite direction. The run may also curve in the direction boarder is going across, but we can‚Äôt know
Skier was behind the boarder. Boarder had the right of way.
Whether she could see him or not, it‚Äôs still 100% the skiers fault and obligation to avoid hitting her.
If you watch the video though the snowboarder was on the edge of the run, then cut across the entire run to make contact with the skier. It‚Äôs just the camera lens/angle that makes it look like they didn‚Äôt. 

FYI I‚Äôm in the camp that both sides made a mistake. The skier should have been more aware of the boarder on their right, but this was hardly a skier crossing a run into a boarder.
Skiers, because they suck
I don‚Äôt think that would‚Äôve helped. She was already toe side before he hit her and he was nowhere near her when she was heel side. You can‚Äôt really prevent someone uphill from turning into you.
It was criminal
I agree while it‚Äôs obviously the over-takers responsibility here‚Ä¶. Riding while holding a selfie stick is a huge distraction imo
Do skiers use poles? Aren‚Äôt you holding two poles? I‚Äôve always been confused why holding a stick is worse than carrying two short spears?
1. Correct

2. Wrong
[deleted]
Always is a strong word 

There‚Äôs a million different reasons the downhill skier/rider could be at fault
Bro WHAT??
This is the way.  Exactly.
This was pure skier not paying attention.  Snowboarder could have been more proactive, but bares no fault what so ever.
Always look behind hahaha!  Printed on every lift ticket
![gif](giphy|l3V0H7bYv5Ml5TOfu|downsized)
Wrong. The uphill skier is at fault. The downhill rider has the right of way.
Snowboarder cut across the whole run
No canche for the boarder to look that angle.
skier came across even further than boarder. traversed half the hill
The snowboarder barely moved laterally. They changed edges, lol
![gif](giphy|8Ff4s9SMVjKr2nCF6C)
Not hard to tell at all, freeze frame it, that skier isn‚Äôt in front at any point in time

>ryone on the mountain needs to be aware of their surroundings and unless you're on a chute solo you should be constantly checking the

but you could see the skier in the video, so.. he was behind, but seems like he was looking the other side
Found the skiier
That's not even remotely the issue here lol.
The rider could not see the skier even without a selfie stick. You can‚Äòt look that angle when riding. Especially when going on toe edge, no one looks uphill on the blindside.
Unpopular because it‚Äôs wrong. The snowboarder was carving back to her right when the skier hit her.
When the video starts the skier is way way way uphill, when you ski fast enough to pass people it is your responsibility to watch them and find a safe space to pass them.
This is 100% the skiers fault, he wasn‚Äôt paying attention and was behind her.  It wasn‚Äôt like she took some massive carve/turn
The boarder barely cuts left. They changed to their heel edge  and looks like they're trying to go back toeside before the skiier traverses the entire run into their back
Don't get out on the slopes much, eh?
At fault and using your brain are two very different things.  I have been riding and skiing for 39 years and I‚Äôve only been in a collision once because the other skier was skiing backwards while filming someone else.  When I am on a mountain around people or not I am constantly assessing risk to make sure I don‚Äôt hurt or get hurt because it‚Äôs simply not worth it.  

If you play in the mountains, winter or summer, inbounds or out, situational awareness should be just part of who you are.
Nope, up mountain rider is 100% at fault. You don‚Äôt have to constantly look behind yourself and up mountain while riding.
Nah man, this is not a case of shit happens. Skier is by definition being reckless b/c he was not paying attention, he, and he alone, directly crashed to the snowboarder. It doesn't matter what skier's intent or character is, he caused a crash, and it was definitely his fault. 

It's like saying to a car crash victim that shit happens when a driver is texting on his phone and crashed to you.
Where do you see that? They were making a toe edge turn and didn‚Äôt fall until impacted by the skier.
Lol. *left*
Yeah and if I'm cruisin' down with speed I also try to stick to the side of the run that puts my blindside to the edge of the trail, so my frontside faces the majority of the hill. If someone tries to sneak behind me it's got to be a concerted effort.
This is what I came here to say. I ski and snowboard. Started on skis, raced for years and far more comfortable on skis. When I began boarding, the blind spot always bothered me, so I have always looked over my shoulder to minimize situations like this. That said, absolutely skiers fault.
The mountain be like life sometimes
snowboarder had no chance, they were facing the other way
I find that skiers tend to do this more than snowboarders even, making them slightly more dangerous while on the slopes. I'm not exactly sure why nearly every older individual who skies has to swerve from one end of the run to the other but it's quite annoying. I'm gonna take a shot in the dark and answer my own question, It might have something to do with them not being able to do tricks so they try to make their runs last as long as possible?
Luckily we have rules: Downhill snowboarder has right of way, Skier is causing the crash
The boarder is on fall line not turning across so you are very wrong
The POV on this one is kind of weird. I agree the skier is coming across the mountain, but the snowboarder seems to be cutting across more significantly. I am using the skier in the dark outfit that they both passed as a reference.

The snowboarder was doing short turns maybe 15‚Äô away from them on skiers right. The yellow skier went to the left edge of the trail to pass both of them. He starts coming back to the right, but doesn‚Äôt go significantly past the dark skier and its already at the apex and going back to the left.

The snowboarder seems to be crossing the entire trail more significantly. Which is also out of character and a little unpredictable for the rest of the turns she was doing.
The skier was pretty straight. The snowboarder was going across the whole slope. Still the skiers fault but the snowboarder is also reckless
Quick point on this, though- the boarder appears to have carved from the side to *at least* mid-trail when the skier hits them. Check it again- they start off carving a tight line, but pretty clearly have drifted to the center when the skier smacks them from their left, and not even once did they (the boarder) check their surroundings.

I'm not disputing the skier appears to be at fault, just pointing out that the boarder is not doing a great job of spacial awareness.
Exactly who I was thinking the skier was when I saw this accident.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It's your responsibility to check your blind spot. To me it looks like the skier gave plenty of space on the overtake and she just cuts across the whole run without looking. It's hard to see with the fisheye lens but you can clearly see she was on the edge of the piste at the start and then cuts across to the left before the collision.
He‚Äôs on her blind side too.  It‚Äôs 100% skiers fault.  Need to be extra cautious coming up on heel side of a snowboarder.
He cuts pretty hard into her direction while actively looking the opposite direction of where he‚Äôs heading.  Watch his skis and the snow they throw off his left side when he careens into her.
Found the skier
Skier was fixated downhill and just derped on this. Snowboarder changed position towards middle a little, but she's definitely leaving everyone enough room to her heelside.
Look at the objects on the sides as reference point.  Wide angle has nothing to do with this.   Reckless skier who‚Äôs think he is the only one on the mountain.
Ok? What‚Äôs your point?
Skiers fault, but don‚Äôt act like snowboarders aren‚Äôt assholes üòÇ
Yeah skier‚Äôs fault, but the feud between the two is fuckin old, and snowboarders can *definitely* be turds too.
Being very kind there buddy. He should see her long before that.
The skier wasn't paying attention. Didn't look where he was going long before the shadow came into play.
The skier was complacent and didn't expect the right-side boarder to cross over the middle. OK, fine, the boarder was negligent, but who had the opportunity to mitigate the damage?

Place the blame wherever. Better here than on the road!
Yet hes looking straight ahead whilst moving laterally.
Yes dude yes that‚Äôs exactly how I thought ( I have cheap Amazon rearviews though so I‚Äôm ALWAYS turning my head).
The voice of reason
Agreed. It‚Äôs not the boarders fault but if this happened to me I‚Äôd blade myself for getting careless. I‚Äôm always under the assumption that some idiot is gonna come bombing down out of nowhere and crash into me.
This is fair, but anecdotal. Even if they couldn't avoid it, it's no excuse not to be aware and constantly scanning the slope on a busy day. Same thing as taking a crosswalk, just because you are in the right doesn't mean it's safe
Also skier and seconded. This is reckless skiing. 

Now can we talk about the habit of so many snowboarders who just stop and sit down in the middle of trails and chat while people are trying to use the mountain? Genuinely curious. Is this widely considered ok among snowboarders and if so why?
Yeah the whole skier vs snowboarder thing is really getting old, everyone go out and ride the opposite set of plank(s) for a change
[post link](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/s/qUL8tzfci4)
It's been posted. They agree it's the skier. Can we be done with the skier v snowboarder rivalry?
Last year I got hit from behind by another boarder, he saw me go first getting on my feet to go down to the lift which was only 50m down, he hit me in the back, speed was pretty low but I fell on my back and head (helmet yes), and it was a bad fall. So indeed I hope as well nobody is too badly hurt
Literally everyone is saying it‚Äôs the skiiers fault
you mad?
Checking his riding space the skier must see the  boarder and act to avoid a crash. The boarder could not see or check his blind spot.
They‚Äôre not recklessly cutting left and right. Look at all the lines in the snow from previous riders. The snowboarder is following the fall line
Downhill has right of way. You can use the whole slope, but it is the responsibility of the uphill rider to avoid the downhill no matter how big their turns are.
Happens all the time, especially with low level skiiers, super annoying. All you can do is risk it or slow down
It is ALWAYS the uphill riders fault in a collision. The downhill rider can make a reckless move that can endanger themselves, but it is ALWAYS the responsibility of the person behind to leave room for the unpredictable. Any other answer is wrong and will make to look dumb. Either leave more room or be better at avoiding gapers in front of you. It is good practice and etiquette to be aware of your surroundings in front and behind you, and to maintain a consistent lane, but it in no way excuses someone from hitting you from behind. This shit is so fucking simple it hurts.
Agreed. The amount of times I've been in this skiers position where I gave people room to do their thing and then they shoot across like they're the only one on the mountain. 

Both people are at fault here. The board shouldn't have cut so far across and the skier should have paid attention to the people in front of them.
I can't believe there are some idiots on here debating whether or not the snowboarder is riding lines too wide. Thank God I don't board below single diamond, because I would be furious and cursing out that skier in the video.

First of all, it's common courtesy to wait for the downhill rider to be down a safe distance before going down, additionally, 100% the uphill rider's responsibility to either avoid/pass the downhill rider safely. It's the most basic snowboarding/skiing rule there ever has been.
I purposely put my 6 year old in their way on green runs because I‚Äôm trying to ruin a middle aged man‚Äôs attempts to make the Olympic team. I‚Äôm really unpatriotic in that way.
You *had* to? You mean that the skiers *forced* you to do that?

Good lord‚Ä¶ we need to call the authorities‚Ä¶
*I already jerked them off once, why do these skiers keep coming back for more?*
Mix in a couple more comas typhoon jeez. Almost gave me an aneurysm reading your comment
It's just relatively inexperienced riders/skiers who are out of control and unable to anticipate the actions of those around them imo. Easiest way to avoid them is ski harder runs.
Skiers like to use slower moving people on the mountain as gates in their imaginary slalom.
Except you are wrong.
I have not commented on the go pro stick, but it‚Äôs probably the real culprit here. Nobody gives a fuck about watching a backwards pov of you amateurly sliding down a mountain.
First reasonable take in here
To me, with very little experience, it looks like the snowboarder's fault and I was confused as to why everybody is saying it's the skier's fault. What I see is a skier who is pretty far back trying to take a curve towards the inside, watching in front of the along the curve, when the snowboarder cuts across the entire "street" and collides with the skier with neither of them looking at each other.
Yeah that's part of why I edited my comment. I agree.
The boarder goes from one end of the slope to the other. That is a long way to cut across and they are boarding unpredictably. The skier should've been paying more attention, but that boarder is an idiot. They knew there were other people on the slope and still cut across the entire slope even when they had no idea what was happening in their blind spot
he tried to avoid i

Reddit never lets up on reminding me there are shitty people in every hobby.
It‚Äôs more of a mental distraction rather than a physical danger. If you‚Äôre filming yourself you‚Äôre thinking about your steeze, the footage, and so on. So you‚Äôre not 100% tuned into the mountain and other people around you.
[deleted]
I can‚Äôt look fucking Behind me.  Uphill skier/rider has a responsibility not to create a Crash.
Yea man, like technically the skier is at fault. But in reality it was a group effort.
Doesn‚Äôt matter one bit. Read the rules on any ski ticket or any ski hill. Downhill riders have right of way, uphill has the responsibility to avoid others.
They where speed checking to go at a safe speed on one side of the run ?
A lot of people aren‚Äôt mentioning this. In vehicle form this is equal to someone cutting over from the far right lane to the far left lane and slamming into a car that‚Äôs already in the left lane. 

Seeing no one putting any blame on the snowboarder is weird.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Also in scrutinizing the video more, at the point of impact, the snowboarder is on toeside edge moving away from the skier, while the skier is still moving towards, and ultimately hitting the boarder. I think from a legal perspective, it appears pretty clear, however it‚Äôs still a situation that can be avoided most of the time by keeping one‚Äôs head on a swivel, clearing your turns before making them. Those big open slopes lead to situations like this all the time. Hopefully everyone else involved in this collision was uninjured.
I agree, avoiding collisions is everyone‚Äôs responsibility. It‚Äôs like being a defensive driver - in many instances, skiing/riding defensively can prevent these scenarios in the first place. People definitely ski/ride without the proper awareness, and the law will ultimately sort out fault, but personally, I do everything in my power to stay away from people who are riding without situational/personal awareness. Even if it‚Äôs not my fault, I really don‚Äôt want to get hit, and my actions can increase or decrease the possibility of this happening.
It's part of it. From the selfie vid it's clear the boarder wasn't checking their uphill at all
Gratz on your first comment lmao, glad I could pop your cherry.
That's what I'm saying. Both people could have avoided the accident regardless of who is at fault.

It's better to avoid a collision altogether by being cautious on crowded groomers.
It doesn't matter who is specifically at fault. This isn't a car accident where an insurance investigation will decide the root cause.

Look up every now and then on a crowded run. It isn't hard to do, and it can easily save you and someone else from a crash.

You don't need to "constantly" look up the mountain to see people. But you absolutely should do it every now and then. From the vid, the boarder never did that even once.
Yep this is my move, throw my back to the trees and bomb down while keeping the most possible in my field of view. I know 95% of people on the mountain aren‚Äôt going faster than me, so not much concern from people coming down behind me.
Even if they weren‚Äôt, it still would not have been her responsibility to avoid this. She was going downhill in a reasonably predictable manner using a fair and reasonable amount of the slope.
That‚Äôs what gets me with all the uphill/downhill semantics. Snowboarders can only see half the hill with a huge blindspot, whereas skiers have much better visibility coming down the hill if they‚Äôve properly got their head on a swivel.

As long as the snowboarder is being somewhat predictable, I tend to blame the other person for swerving into their blindside even when technically downhill or whatever.
I've been hit by skiier while I was on a board, and by a boarder while i'm on skis, so fuck all y'alls us vs them bullshit, it's a matter of ignorance and unawareness of one's surroundings. 

read the code; It's the uphill skiers obligation to avoid anyone downhill from them.
> has to swerve from one end of the run to the other

I call those Texas turns
It's peak lead poisoned boomer attitude¬†
You‚Äôre obviously a skier. The skiers turns are incredibly wide in regards to the boarder. He also carved hard towards the skier without even looking. Boarder was always downhill and has the right of way. Last the boarder,prior to collision, is back on her toe side edge which would initiate her direction to the left side of the screen. She didn‚Äôt exaggerate a turn or cross the run. Very predictable riding, very poor awareness by the skier. Typical skier carving across the entire run to ‚Äúlook cool‚Äù turns out skiing still doesn‚Äôt look cool
You‚Äôre definitely right. I had to watch several times and keep an eye on the edges of the trail but the boarder makes the more significant cross trail cut without getting a proper view

The skier was uphill, though and needs to know how to share a trail with snowboarders. There are many on every mountain that don‚Äôt check their back side and only look at half the trail. I think there were two wrong parties in this collision but being uphill makes the skier responsible for the crash
Don‚Äòt talk about character. If you overtake somebody on pist you have to let this person enough room to do what ever this person wants to do. Especially when there is so much room. Its free will where, what and how to ride, aslong you bring no one else in danger.
From this aspect, Ski or board does not matter.
You are correct. I would never do that kinda toe edge slip and blindly slide across the whole trail. And while filming yourself? I actually blame the boarder on this one. You gotta stay in your lane sometimes..
I noticed the same thing. Boarder starts out hugging the right edge of the trail. Ends up in the middle without ever looking left. The angle of camera makes it look like the skier is the only one coming toward her, but she actually drifted way to her left. He is uphill though.
There is nothing wrong with using the whole mountain. That's what it's for. 

The boarder is looking ahead. You are responsible for not running into anyone in front of you. You are also responsible for checking uphill when stopping mid-run or crossing a run. 100% on the skier. I don't know why there are so many people here trying to create conflict between boarders and skiers. So many people just trying to create conflict period.
They do move but we also don't know what is downhill of them they're accommodating for and they do glance to their left before making that move away from the edge. But moreover the boarder is downhill of that skier and especially well before they moved was that look so I'd counter they're actively spatially aware from what we can see.
Dude downhill skier/rider has the right of way. Boarders absolutely should check their blind spot, and as a skier I‚Äôm always checking over my shoulder cuz I trust no one on a crowded run, but this is 100% on the skier. 

If the skier was watching where they were going the boarder would have been easily avoided. 

Plus, even if the boarder had looked over their shoulder when they started the turn, there‚Äôs no way they could have predicted that the skier would come across half the run to smash them a hundred feet later.
You‚Äôre kidding right? The skier is undoubtedly 100% at fault. Zero ambiguity in this case. The skier is overtaking and not paying any attention.
You are right. At first I thought the skier crossed the piste and hit the snowboarder. But while the snowboarder is in the center of the field of view of the video the whole time, if you look at the sides of the piste,  it is clear that it was the snowboarder that crossed to the other side -- the one facing their back -- and not looking where they were going.
Heel toe has nothing to do with it. It‚Äôs uphill downhill. Uphill gives way. It‚Äôs easy.
Turning into your blind side to go downhill could lead to violating the uphill rule.

When you come from uphill, you can plan for the people downhill, but they can't plan for you.  You can't rule them out until you have clearly passed them.

If they will be in your blind side when you haven't been able to rule out a collision yet, you have a responsibility to make extra way until you can gain vision again.  This means take conservative lines or better, just perform a reflexive nose role to get into switch so you can see the situation.

The skier is acting like they have clearly passed the snowboarder when they have not.  They fail to perform a nose role due to their inferior equipment, leading to them relying on peripheral vision.  If they were a snowboarder comfortable alternating into switch, they could keep the snowboarder in their field of view while passing.

The moral of the story is to use proper equipment learn to nose role and ride switch.

But seriously keep track of people until you are sure you have passed them and don't take chances when you can't keep track.
Snow boarder never looked up the hill. I think the skier is in the wrong. 

But, someone is just daft and will inevitably find themself in this situation if they‚Äôre not looking over their shoulder to see what‚Äôs coming their direction. No situational awareness by either!
I'm a skier, 100% the skier's fault. He's uphill, which is cause enough for the blame. Even beyond that, he can see her, but she can't see him, and she's not making any sudden movements. So it's extra his fault.
Untrue. I do crime.
We‚Äôve come full circle
I agree. I'm too kind. 100% skier's fault
She certainly doesn't seem to scan left and right I agree. Still if I was on the right of a run carving and saw a skier keeping pace carving the left side, I'd never assume they were going to traverse across straight into my back you know what I mean?


Like I'd visually check them every few seconds but I don't think that would've saved this boarder
Nah, its fine to sit at the side of the run, where you can be seen for a while, but for sure not in the middle of a run or after a corner or hill.
As a snowboarder, these snowboarders annoy me a lot
Do more snowboarders stop and sit than skiers stop and stand? Or do you just notice it more because they sit to more easily stay in place and that makes it more noticable?
It's usually beginners struggling.
Snowboarder here: it's not ok. I think it tends to happen more frequently because beginner snowboarders fall on their ass *nonstop* and are more likely to sit there with a bruise tailbone and take a break.

I typically say "You should scoot off to the side of the run so no one hits you" as I pass anyone sitting down in the middle of a run regardless of what's strapped to their feet.
As a snowboarder it gets out of hand
Honestly, nothing is nearly as bad as skiiers just barely at or below intermediate. Always taking ENORMOUS berths and never looking back before they do. Idc how far up the mountain someone is, if you're moving straight horizontally across, you have to check traffic. It's like changing lanes without looking, like yeah, the person's behind you, but they're not a god damn mind reader. 

And it's always skiiers. Once you're at that level of snowboarding, you are always going heel toe heel toe just like an advanced skiier would.
Skiers do the same thing after exiting the chairlift
So many of them stood side by side with their skis across horizontal to the run to take up the maximum amount of space
Skiiers do it too and just stand at the trail heads and in the middle talking and bullshitting

I wish everyone, skiers and boarders both would just get the fuck out of the way
I've always found it to be opposite. It's certainly not experienced snowboarders. Experienced riders always stop on the side of the hill where there's a bump or something we can use to get a little bit of momentum going. Also means we don't stop on the blind area at the bottom of a roll in the trail. ü§∑
Agreed nobody should sit in the middle of the run, but off to the sides I (in view) is fine. I‚Äôm an older guy (40), I can‚Äôt make it down the entire run without stopping. It‚Äôs exhausting stuff
The friend group I go with is almost an even split ski/board. We fully embrace the Johnny Tsunami mentality and race for mountain rights. They were both in the middle of the run when they collided.
This doesn't really exist.  Skier/snowboarder are the same.  They enjoy the same sport.  Being on the snow going downhill in the winter.
Skier is clearly at fault. Idk how posting that in the skiing sub is satisfactory in a very lazy attempt to troll. But whatever makes you happy
Or they make statements like "she didn't stay in her lane".  Clearly many here are stating uneducated opinions and know little about the rules and nature of free skiing.  And skiers/ boarders who don't know the Skier's Responsibility Code don't belong on the hill.
if you keep jerking them off then they might not stop skiing close to you
Pretty much that, otherwise I wouldn't be able to explain all those close calls on some of the freeway-wide runs during off-season. Fuck those assholes.
Sometimes i really wish i had a paintball marker, to mark em. There should be a law that ‚Äûmarked‚Äú skiers have to return the ski pass.
I would have to carry ammo instead of my ava kit sometimes.
Yeah the whole ‚ÄúYou were uphill so its automatically your fault‚Äù is about as sensical as ‚ÄúYou rear ended me so the accident is automatically your fault‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve only been skiiing a handful of times but it seems they‚Äôre both at fault. The boarder for cutting across half the mountain pretty much directly in front of someone and both for lack of awareness. I mean boarder is speeding past everyone and randomly makes a wide, sweeping carve. Doesn‚Äôt look once.
Actually not at all. Your holding a stick. Just like every skier. In fact mine folds comfortably in my pocket. Many cameras are also now filming locked POV or 360‚Äô degrees making the stuff you‚Äôre saying irrelevant. 

It‚Äôs pretty clear in the clip she‚Äôs just riding her snowboard and minding her own business. 

I skied 17 years before I switched to snowboarding 30 years ago. I‚Äôve ridden endless hours with both poles and a selfie stick and there‚Äôs no difference at all. Many skiers don‚Äôt even use their poles. They just flail them around.
Wrong because the rules of the mountain are simple. The uphill rider must yield to downhill riders. It is a rule and it‚Äôs on every ski ticket.
Did you know your head actually is able to turn left and right? That plus a little shoulder turn gives you all the visibility you need. 

All skiers have a responsibility to avoid incidents and if you‚Äôre skiing unsafely downhill because no one‚Äôs in front of you, youre an idiot. That‚Äôs like driving 15 mph on the highway changing lanes without checking mirrors - everyone behind you could be doing everything right and then you come along and cause an accident.
No. The snowboarder isn‚Äôt obligated to just straight line it down the mountain. You‚Äôre coming in at 2x the speed and paying zero attention as the skier there.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have the right away, you should still be checking your surroundings. Pedestrians have the right away but I wouldn‚Äôt walk out into the street to cross the road with out checking for traffic first, same applies if you are crossing a ski run.
The faster one who overtakes someone is responsible to let the one in front enough room for his manouvers.
The snowboarder moved laterally like two feet and was back on their toe edge at the point of impact. This is in no way the snowboarders fault and they were not being negligent in any way
This 1000%. Yeah it‚Äôs not my fault if I get hit from behind but I‚Äôd rather avoid getting hit at all. Somebody else footing the ambulance bill doesn‚Äôt unbreak my arm. It‚Äôs always best practice to ride/ski/sled with enough SA to avoid the people who lack it.
one thing they did good in italy its mandatory liability insurance. i know that no money will buy back your lost health but some money is better than no money
Didn't know boarders were supposed to have the neck flexibility of an owl

Also that still has nothing to do with the selfie stick lol.
Have you ever seen a skier check the uphill? No. That‚Äôs not even a thing. You keep your eyes downhill so that you don‚Äôt slam into people below you. If you‚Äôre looking uphill, you aren‚Äôt paying attention and could run into someone. It would be your fault for not looking where you were going.
I agree and I‚Äôm not sure why you are getting downvoted.  People are more invested in right or wrong than being successful.  I mean, you‚Äôve got a broken tailbone but at least you were right that it was the other person‚Äôs fault!
So you look up when you're not traversing to check if people are behind you?

What's your plan? Dodge them while you're ahead of them??
No
The thread is literally a post asking who is at fault‚Ä¶
And the skier was originally behind, way back. Total unawareness of surrounding by the skier. Go home boomer.
Snowboarders can see everything ahead of them just fine, what they cannot see is a skiier cutting right across the slope from the other side swerving into them at high speed from behind.
I definitely agree. After years of only skiing I started snowboarding, it was extremely helpful to understand how your view changes on a board vs skis. I‚Äôve changed how I ski around boarders because now I understand their blind spots so much better. If I‚Äôm on their backside I‚Äôm extremely careful until I know I‚Äôm far enough ahead they can see me.
This is the right answer.
There's definitely a type of 50 plus bearded skier who needs to carve all the way from the treeline to the snowmaking equipment regardless of what else is going on. I'm saying this as an older skier.
Correct! Add that the skier isn‚Äôt at all being situationally aware
Well, i‚Äòm definitely an older rider, and sometimes its just great to carve wider turns with speed. You can feel gravity forces on pist.

Everything feels different, a nice kicker line, half pipe, there you feel great gravity forces, and on pist by turns when not in the park.
‚ÄúPeak lead poisoned boomer‚Äù lmfao that‚Äôs a hilarious phrase, thank you.
I actually do both.

I disagree‚Ä¶at no point did the snowboarder go anywhere near the lane where the dark skier was prior to the final turn. She was well wide and hanging on the edge of the trail.

If you look at the yellow skier, he is initiating his turn on the very edge of the trail. He is not making a big exaggerated turn across the mountain out of his lane. It only appears that way because we have snowboarders POV who is also moving across. 

At the point of collision they are more or less next to each other. The skier clearly sees the boarder but wasn‚Äôt expecting the turn and tries to avoid it.

This is why I think ‚ÄúDownhill right of way pay no attention to your surroundings‚Äù is overall a bad way to handle things. The snowboarder could have looked over her shoulder before changing lanes. I do all of the time. We have necks.

The fault probably lies somewhere in the middle.
The boarder is damn near straight lining. Lol wut?
Isn't this is all irrelevant though?

You're ALLOWED (and it's also proper form) to make wider turns! As a skier, I love ripping high speed carving S turns across the slope. Obviously one should be reasonable and don't go from one edge of the slope to the other (esp. if crowded), but the boarder has EVERY right to use the space he's using.Boarder drifted left, but so what?  Skiing/boarding isn't like freeway driving where you have to stay in some narrow lane.

Skier is so blind here I legitimately wonder if he's disabled and skiing with only one eye or something.
I think the skier/boarder conflict is a red herring and I'd be making the same points if it was skier on skier. 

I do both, but learned years and years ago when I think it was fair more driven home to always have your head on a swivle. Some time in the last 20 years, decorum and awareness has gone out the window for everyone learning the slopes. This beers out in the injuries and complaints I've seen over my last 10 years on Ski Patrol, too.
They just said extra cautious
I agree with this. Use caution passing anyone because they don‚Äôt have eyes on the back of their head.
I think their point was that the snowboarder was already moving away from the skiier as they are a regular rider and so are on their toe edge.
Sure that's how you do it but you need to be aware of your surroundings and other people on the hill. The same reason when you come out of the trees or a merge you don't go bomb across the run without looking uphill. Technically you are downhill but you need to be aware of your surroundings.
It will always be better to recognize you are on the blindside of a snowboarder.  Why would you chime in to chastise someone giving good advice?
So you are claiming riding in peoples blind spots has nothing to do with safety? How about driving in the blind spot of a semi truck? Is that a perfectly safe place to be too? What a bold way to live.
Found the skier
Yeah and the camera makes it hard to see how much the snowboarder moves across the face of the hill, but if you look at the lines that are cut from other people, the snowboarder mostly follows the path likely towards the chairs. 90% of the time it's on the person who is uphill at fault because they can slow down speed up or turn to avoid hitting someone in front of them
I prefer the sides of runs versus the usually skiid out center so idc if they stop in the middle. 

Imo as long as it's not a blind spot, bottleneck, or huge group of ppl creating a 15 yard obstacle to go around or thru, it's fine.
At least I can hop over the sitting ones lol
Depends where you are on a blue/black it‚Äôs rare.   Green runs are ussually avoiding the beginners.  Also when you die snowboarding as a beginner it‚Äôs tough to just finish the run if your calf/foot is tired/sore/cramping.
My favourite is when they sit on the low side of a hill and you can‚Äôt see them. I almost killed someone today. Middle of the fucking run on a steep black and sitting right under the blind rise.  Was not excessive speed on my part, and I was able to avoid, but barely. I stopped and politely suggested they should be more aware of where they stop for their own safety and that uphill skiers:riders would not see them. They suggested I go fuck myself ü§£. I‚Äôm a skier and see skiers do it often too, it‚Äôs just exacerbated by fact boarders are sitting so waaaay harder to see until it‚Äôs almost too late.
In my experience skiers stop on the sides, not in the middle. But I often see groups of young snowboarders sit down in the middle of trails. I guess it‚Äôs just harder to move around and I get that it‚Äôs tiring.

EDIT: lol. I appreciate the downvotes from readers who know more about the things I‚Äôve personally witnessed than I do. Lol. Thanks!
Have skied and snowboarded quite a bit and in my experience snowboarders are far more likely to stop somewhere they shouldn't¬†
I‚Äôve been skiing and boarding for 40 years. I still have my first snowboard from 1988. It‚Äôs only snowboarders who sit 5 to 8 people in a line across the middle of a run and block the whole thing, or in a huge cluster of 15+ all waiting in line to go over some small jump.
>Do more snowboarders stop and sit than skiers stop and stand?

Yes
Modern day Lancelot
You made me laugh, almost 58 and i know only one stop moment and that's in the lift. 
I am getting older but still a bit in denying
Seriously. I mean, I'm thinking about switching to skis right now...
That is logical tho. How is one supposed to drive out of the way to prevent themselves from being rear ended? Same thing here. Skier just wasn‚Äôt looking and crashed into boarder from behind.
So someone hits you and breaks your back but youll be happy that you didnt take extra precautions to avoid the situation because technically you were in the right.

Yeah thats how dumb you sound.
Yes, keep your Head on a swivel.  However, when someone crashes into you from UpHil, the downhill skier/rider has the right of way.
It's more important to note that the snowboarder went almost from one side of the trail to the other on their heels which means it's near impossible to see anything while making a sizable turn. If this rider were on their toes, this would have never happened. The snowboarder wasn't at fault, but was definitely overly brazen and thoughtless. I'd only only take big ass turns like that if I knew damn well no one was around me. If these people were cars, the skier would have been considered to be cut off.
Everyone on the mountain needs to be aware of their surroundings and unless you're on a chute solo you should be constantly checking the above traffic.

The selfie stick was obviously taking the attention of the rider instead of them analyzing and adapting to the surroundings.

Selfie sticks are a distraction.
> Have you ever seen a skier check the uphill?

Many times. Many of the buds I ride with are skiers. A skier taught me to do it.

> You keep your eyes downhill so that you don‚Äôt same into people below you. If you‚Äôre looking uphill, you aren‚Äôt paying attention and could run into someone

That's like saying checking your blind spot in your car when you turn is bad. Situational awareness is important.
It‚Äôs definitely a thing. I ski and snowboard and I‚Äôm always giving a quick look over my shoulder if I‚Äôm gonna do a cut across a run. Just smart. Someone could be straight lining and I wouldn‚Äôt even know. It takes less than a second to give quick glance to see if anyone is immediately behind you.
Yup. It doesn't matter who is at fault if it wrecks my season. It's still a wrecked season.
> So you look up when you're not traversing to check if people are behind you?

Yes. Especially when I'm about to make a big traverse. Why wouldn't you?

> What's your plan? Dodge them while you're ahead of them??

Move the other way and avoid them altogether.
Yes. Maintain situational awareness on the mountain at all times.
Whether or not someone is 30-70% at fault doesn't really change the injuries or shotty situation.

The accident could have been avoided by both parties regardless.
But you're agreeing with them?
Lmao bro you‚Äôre literally on the same side
you should try the Montucky Clear Cut event at Turner Mt, for carving snowboarders! you're expected and encouraged to use the whole run because we have a no passing rule on groomers at a privately rented mountain. don't have to look uphill every turn for a straitliners.
As a ex ski instructor I don't mind people using the whole slope, to me it's about predictability, someone doing short turns at the edge of the slope suddenly switching to large turns using the whole slope without checking is what causes crashes.

People uphill need to keep their eyes open but erratic driving makes this hard.

Also, sometimes shit just happens, I've had a kid crash into me  while I couldn't react in time, he quite literally just fell in front of my skis.
I'm one of'em! that's why the ignorant take me out, but I stay out of idiots way whenever possible and wait for a window in the traffic
I board with a load of older guys who are all excellent I was just making a dumb funny comment,¬† I've got nothing against someone doing wide carves on an open run. Wide carves on a packed run though is selfish and dangerous for beginners around you¬†
yea maybe u should look to ur left or right sometimes before randomly cutting everyone on the mountain off. appreciate it!
Pause it at the beginning and the end where the crash is. First frames snowboarder is on the very edge of the trail. 

Final frames snowboarder is well past the middle of the trail.

I am assuming this trail cuts left and the snowboarder was heading for the apex rather than following the right side of the trail around.
Yea but conversation is super hard bro
That‚Äôs why I keep  huge mirror on the front of my snowboard /s
\> "snowboarder was already moving away from the skier..."> "He's on her blind side too..."

Interesting and good points no doubt to put in footnotes or discussion on safety, but for the purposes of determining who's at fault, this is all irrelevant minutiae.

1. Skier was clearly uphill and overtaking.
2. It's the uphill skier's responsibility to pass safely.

The snowboarder could have been doing wide turns across the whole slope and it would still be the skier's fault. Skier plowed into the dude at high speed from behind. 100% skier's fault.

\-Skier coming here from /r/skiing
You've found 'a' skier
> Also when you die snowboarding as a beginner it‚Äôs tough to just finish the run if your calf/foot is tired/sore/cramping.

It's tough to finish any run when you die whether you're a beginner or expert.
It‚Äôs not a snowboarder thing it‚Äôs just a young person thing. They are kids, they aren‚Äôt always the most considerate.¬†

For every twerpy snowboarder there is a stick so far up a skiers ass you‚Äôd think they were a popsicle.
I find Skiers normally stop at the start of a steep section. Across the piste. Almost as if it‚Äôs treated as another start of a piste. Ive never really understood it. Sometimes there‚Äôs only just enough room to get through.

Take a look next time you‚Äôre out.

 I find snowboarders sit off to one side in rough conditions. They can be really hard on the legs of a snowboarder. Especially if you arn‚Äôt linking turns.
In my experience it's not about skis or snowboards but groups. Groups of people or families that are on a trip together will stop and block significant portions of the width of a run and act like they're the only people on the mountain.
When I was a teenager I would go down the run and spray anyone sitting in the middle lol.

It's a beginner snowboarder thing as they haven't learned they are potentially dangerous obstacles.
Because I‚Äôm out of shape and exhausted üòÇ.
Plenty of skiers who stop in the middle of a run or on transition paths. I think it‚Äôs more of a consideration / experience thing. Always lots of people at resorts who are new or infrequent riders.
I grew up snowboarding but is why I ski more these days. Both are equally fun (provided you ski as well as you board) but skiing is just infinitely more convenient. If you stop in a less than ideal spot on skis it‚Äôs very easy to get moving again, less so on a snowboard.
Its illogical because it ignores the nuance of any situation, simply faulting one person for being a certain position while disregarding all of the other things that created it. 

Perhaps the skiier is a novice with no time to react, perhaps skiier didn‚Äôt expect them to make a wide carve directly in front of them. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have. 

Reminds me of the only accident I‚Äôve ever been involved in, getting cut off in the city, right at a red light, during a rain storm by someone whipping out of their parking spot. Insurance instantly tells me I‚Äôm 100% at fault simply because I rear ended someone.
Not technically. Legally. If I‚Äôm downhill and you crash into me from uphill causing injury, when I sue you, you‚Äôre completely fucked in every state that gets snow and most if not all countries with a ski industry.
It's an assumption on your part about the selfie stick. They didn't seem particularly focused on it to me, but I've never ridden with one so who knows. 

I agree about situational awareness being important but you even see the snowboarder check over her shoulder at one point. Skier had a clear line of sight while the boarder did not.

There's a reason why those downhill have the right of way.
I check my blindspots if I'm traversing of course. If I am riding in a straight line down the hill I'm not looking up hill. 

If someone is speeding towards you as the downhill skiier looking uphill you have to swerve to avoid them? What if you swerve into them? You can't predict which way they are going to go
They're obviously talking about the skier. Nothing in their comment indicated disagreement...
Yeah, i do. I can ride and cut no one off. I‚Äòm on off pist since i was a kid 80 days averag/ season.

Beeing on or somewhere off pists turned to be part of my job.
Yeah it‚Äôs basically like driving. If you hit someone‚Äôs back/rear you‚Äôre almost always gunna be at fault.
I thought you were supposed to hold those skipoles in your hands. 


I think they're doing it wrong.
Exactly!!!
Im a skiier and noticed its a lot more to do with age. Snowboarders where i live are a young. Basically all 16-25 year olds only snowboard in Japan for some reason.
Kids are dumb and do stupid shit from lack of experience and such.

I see dumb skiiers too who are young but tue ratio heavily skews to snowboarders here due to it being dramatically more popular in that age group.

Last time i went, a group decided to sit mostly in the middle right under a mid slope hill that creates a blind spot until you get above it. Its not so big that you would automatically hard stop to check, but just big enough that if a bunch of kids sit under it(versus stand) you wont see.

Inevitably i almost hit them but managed to avoid them at the last moment as they popped into vision.

I shouted to my partner who asked me what happened and i just said those kids sat under a blood hill and i almost hi them.  They must have heard because they all started shifting to their lefts as much as possible‚Ä¶.

It is literally an inexperienced thing and young people thing and thats that. More noticeable with snowboarders due to them tending to be younger(at least where i am).
If you need to sit down for whatever reason, best practice is to find a place that is visible from uphill, and move to a side of the run.  If there is a wide open run and you are very visible from above there is no real reason why you cannot sit smack dab in the middle. 

People stop for many reasons, feeling tired, some beginners are scared or a bit overwhelmed, and some people are sorta dumb. But there is no reason anyone should run into you in a visible spot, but‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt trust people and I would always recommend stopping off to the side and staying visible.

Skier here.

Cruising doesn't take much quad stamina, but turning on steep terrain does. Stopping at the top of the piste, _on the side as taught by ski instructors_, is preferred since it lets you catch your breath and get ready for the next section.

If I had to guess, stopping in the middle allows for weaker skiers to start the next section on their preferred leg and/or choosing different lines.
This is super accurate.
Likewise, tourist families/groups block city sidewalks rather than standing off to the side pissing off locals.
> lots of people at resorts who are new or infrequent riders.

THIS. THIS. THIS.  
By and large most people who go to resorts are *very* infrequent participants to the sport. Sometimes often 5 days a season and often in a singular trip.
> It's an assumption on your part about the selfie stick

No, it isn't. It's the head movement of the boarder that gives it away. They were staying within the selfie stick zone instead of moving their head enough to look around.

> I agree about situational awareness being important but you even see the snowboarder check over her shoulder at one point. Skier had a clear line of sight while the boarder did not.

With that mask the head rotation was nowhere near enough to be an adequate check over the shoulder.

> There's a reason why those downhill have the right of way.

There's a reason to actually check above you on a crowded groomer if you don't want to get in an accident.
The crash in the video was during a wide traverse that the rider was doing.

Looking uphill before that traverse would have made me speed-check and let them pass, since they don't seem to be in as much control as I would be. Thus avoiding the collision.
More so in skiiing/boarding actually.

The driving analogy is problematic: there are no lanes on the snow. There's more onus on the overtaking agent to stay clear in skiing/boarding compared to driving.
Depends on what you‚Äôre into I suppose.
This guy's never heard of the tri-skipole technique, amateur
Yeah that makes sense, thanks for the reply.

It does look like they are scoping out the steep section to come. 

Much like snowboarders I guess it‚Äôs just poor discipline/ too many people to stay on the side. Just in a different spot.
I was just thinking about it more. I suppose boarders like to sit in a row and I could see that drifting into the piste more than they should.
The snowboarder was not traversing? They changed edges and moved laterally about 2 feet. The skiier traverses the entire the whole run and slams into the downhill boarder.

Are you going to start checking your blindspots every time you edge change?
The turn was far longer than 2 ft and took them far away from the poles outlining the edge of the run.

Like I really don't understand the issue here.

Check uphill when you're riding. It isn't that hard. I see so many tourists do this shit, and this is exactly why I am super cautious on crowded groomers when other dipshits (like that skier) are around.
Just sharing this photo I took yesterday 
Not sure if it looks good or way too edited but either way I love visiting your state. It‚Äôs therapeutic. ü´∂üèª 

Holy saturation.
[deleted]
Ah the K1
Sold photo, where you riding
> therapeutic¬†

Perfect word for it.¬†
Niiiice. Really not looking forward to the winter when it's too cold for me to just wander around outside and take pictures like i can the rest of the year.
OP Would you recommend this one over the Stowe gondola for the upcoming weekend? Also, how's the parking situation? Do i need to buy tickets online beforehand or just show up and wait in a queue?
Stowe?
Hahah I thought so too :( but I only really reduced highlights and added a vsco filter (FF 5)
Please be careful, Milton is currently the stuff of nightmares. It is a very powerful storm.
:(
Stay safe, friend.
Yesss
Yes I was, it was so hard to take the picture with the little bit of space the windows allow
You need to purchase them online as opposed to Stowe where you can just show up and do it in person (especially if it‚Äôs for same day). One big advantage of Killington is the fact that‚Äôs closer to CT than Stowe (an additional 75 miles) and the views are just as great. Also check the weather because when I went, it was sunny in Killington and cloudy in Stowe.
Nope, Killington!
lol it literally says Killington on the gondola üòÇ
What did you take the picture on? My iPhone refuses to pick up leaf peepage. It turns all that red and orange to a shadowy dark green. It‚Äôs baffling.
Sick, ment to say solid btw üíÄ
Beautiful
Mine does this too, and it‚Äôs infuriating! I‚Äôve had to resort to using live mode, and scrubbing through the clips for the most accurate one of the set.
iPhone 15 Pro Max. It‚Äôs definitely frustrating, what helped me capture this one was the sun. The sun did everything. I only used the filter because everything was way too yellow and bright, so I darkened it a little with the filter.
Lol I know
I feel like iPhones try to detect what our pictures *should* look like, and then they try to enhance accordingly. What‚Äôs crazy is my sunset pictures are always superior to everyone else‚Äôs pictures of the same exact sunset. The camera can pick up reds and oranges just fine then! But in that case it recognizes that it‚Äôs a sunset and sprinkles on some magic. When it sees a forest, it wants it to be green I think.
Fucking Otter Creek Labs
POW ‚Ä¶ Warranty Update 

Andrew and the team took care of me like the heroes they are. 

I received the 2 day air label on Sunday the 16th, dropped off on the 17th, and arrived to OCL after hours on the 19th. The package arrived today and as you can see it contained a perfectly repaired suppressor along with everything above. Oh, and these dates are all June‚Ä¶11 days from when my suppressor left my hands. 

If you were on the fence about OCL, don‚Äôt be. Dive off, jump in, or fall backwards, it doesn‚Äôt matter, you are in great hands.

Thanks again Andrew (and team) and I hope we never have to interact again /s. 
That neckbeard sticker is absolutely awesome
Babe, wake up, new copy pasta just dropped

otter creek is a shit company and Andrew is a scumbag. Decent suppressors but putting money in that fat neckbeards pocket isn't something I'd ever consider.
I was there watching him do the repair. Can confirm andrew personally fixes the warranty stuff and everything in the ketter is true.
That busty otter is gonna make for a weird wank, but I ain‚Äôt no bitch.
OCL sets the bar pretty fuckin high. All manufacturers in the gun game should take note, especially fuckin Sig.
Otter creek gang has been nothing but standup.
Based Andrew Otter Guy.
Everybody in a niche but expensive industry needs to call OCL and study up. This is such top tier customer service.
Honestly this is all I everything I could want from customer, ‚Äúhey, we fucked up, our bad. Here‚Äôs something for your inconvenience, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù If it were me, they would have just won a lifetime customer.
Well I can tell you who‚Äôs getting my next suppressor order
Great service
At least they fixed it themselves instead of contracting it back out
Yeah if only I can find them in stock
Alright, should I get the Polonium K or full size?
As much shit as I see people giving OCL for the "shilling" that happens on this sub, this kinda shit makes me have the utmost respect for them. I'm glad I chose them for my first 2 cans.
The weld sketches are elite. ‚Ä¶ This post has solidified me buying another Polo‚Ä¶ this time full size, I have a K already!
This is the kinda shit that makes me want to support a company. And that‚Äôs just from the letter, accountability and rectification. Then the stickers just make me uncomfortably turned on.
I don‚Äôt even have a gun but it makes me want to buy from this guy.
Mistakes happen in manufacturing, it‚Äôs inevitable. I think we as buyers understand that sometimes shit just happens. It‚Äôs not the fact that it happens that typically turns us away from brands. It‚Äôs how the brands handle the problem. In this case, how could you possibly be upset at this guy? Talk about a great response.
Otter Creek STAYS undefeated as the best suppressor company
Fine I‚Äôll buy more OCL
OCL gets it.
**Based.**
Just so I'm clear. To get the neckbeard sticker I need to buy a Polonium-K and force feed it a 220 grain .30 cal projectile, then send it in???
Hometown heroes.
I don't have a wife but if I did I'd let the otter creek team lay her down 


Deff love seeing stuff like this as I crank my polo k on the end of my rifles üçÜ
Average ocl W. 

I had a different company‚Äôs can in for warranty with said company and it took 2 months. Ocl continues to out perform the competition in most aspects.
Fucking based
fucking legend
Legend shit right there
Thanks dude. I updated the tracker. ü§ô
Those stickers are fire
Good hell. I guess it‚Äôs time to pull the trigger on a Polo
Just an FYI, he wears the penis helmet around the shop MOST days....
Not going to lie, I kinda want to order one now.
I‚Äôm going to break a suppressor so I can just get those stickers.
Guy seems like a real dickhead‚Ä¶
Ocl gang 4 life!!!!!
Those dudes are awesome.
I just want there infinity 30 ü•∫
Man we gotta buy all his suppressors until he is rich and never goes out of business.
I am officially sold on making my next can purchase an OCL. S++ marketing and customer service here.
Man I‚Äôd really like to find a polo 30 in stock
Nice!
These guys just can‚Äôt miss, can they? lol
I forgive them on your behalf
Otter Creek Johnny Cash üëè
Do you sell the hats on your website or is that super special swag?
Literally Legendary!

As soon as I can find a Polo or Polo K I‚Äôm grabbing it.
Ok, OCL *will* be my next can.
I‚Äôve been thinking I‚Äôd get an Anthem S2 because of better sound suppression but seeing stuff like this makes me want to get a Polonium 30 just knowing this is the kind of guys they are.
Can‚Äôt wait for my Polo 30, back ordered it through one of your dealers 2 months ago üò¨
Need to get a ocm5 to complete my spr when they restock.
Thanks for sharing the update! Love seeing companies stay true to their word. 


Too happy I went OCL for my first ever 3 cans (Lith 9, Pol 30, Tit 22). I was a bit nervous I should branch out more to be safe but just loved the reddit presence and overall vibe.
Low key want to get a fucked up otter creek suppressor now! 

Ok done, waiting. Gotta support another KY neck beard dude! 

If it wasn‚Äôt for neck beard I wouldn‚Äôt have a beard at all.
Otter Creek Chads*
Wait, is this satire? I thought they were the go to for cans? I also NEED that  beck beard dildo  picture as a patch. Like today!
The stickers are great!
Pumped for my polo K to get out of jail üí™üèΩ
I own 2 OCL suppressors and I‚Äôm very happy with both
Is one of those reviews from the guy who tried to turn a 6mm can into a 30 cal can using a hand drill and WD40 after half a case of Old Mud?
Honestly cannot wait to get my dedicated 556 can from them üòÇüòÇ
Everything that I‚Äôve come across on the forums pretty much solidifies that OCL will be getting my business on my next suppressor purchase.
OCL are the goats of can making and customer service.
Probably going to buy one from these guys because of this
And just like that I want to buy from OCL
How do I get these stickers
Got one in jail. Can‚Äôt wait. In my dreams I see an integral upper.
There's a reason this man's last name is kingüëë
The wiener helmet!
OCL owners online presence and his quality product and price point single handedly change my mind for suppressors when finally get mine I‚Äôm gonna be OCL all the way!
Other companies should be taking notes
FUCK! God damn it Andrew, you're going to force me to buy a Polo with this level of customer service.

I fucking hate you, I'll take 2.
Damn. I gotta get an OCL can.
Nice! Good customer service.¬†
I have one waiting in jail I can‚Äôt wait to get. Feeling great about my decision!
Good shit. Getting an OCM5 when they come available.
Im sold. Getting an OCL now lmao. But I want the stickers and the pics
These fucking otters can't keep getting away with this good CX üò§üò§
This man is an absolute gangster.
My next can will be OCL ENTIRELY because of their customer relations. Love all of this.
I don‚Äôt own an OCL product as of yet, but that is definitely going to change after seeing this. I‚Äôve never seen such fantastic and hilarious customer service.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm happy to be a part of the Otter gang gang
Well, hell. Now I want an OCL can.

Are you the one who didn‚Äôt check with the alignment rod before you shot?
Dang where do I get that hat?
Just DocuSigned for my OCL Polonium K this morning through Silencer Shop. Waiting now for Form 3 to be approved and then wait to certify.
I'm still looking to take the dive into my first suppressor and I'm always taking in different info to decide which brand I'll go with when I do it and see shit like this and damn.. I gotta go with OCL
Thanks for sharing this! I've got my first ocl in jail. A polonium. May need to try another, either a 9mm pistol can ifbthey make one or a 22lr can. Already have a huxwrx 556 and 762 rifle can a rad 9 2 rad22s and a rad45 in jail so not sure what I need that isn't flowthrough. Ordered the polonium to try their stuff out and can't really go wrong with another 556 can
Waiting on a energetic armament, but this is kinda making me wish I went with otter creek
I have one on back order. Get me on that bandwagon!
I need that hat.
I have the OCL Ti, and of my four rimfire cans that is the one I recommend to friends who still think they will get only one rimfire can. The experience relayed by the OP is why my next can will be OCL.
Question for OCL: Do you guys have a lower back pressure can or plans for one in the future?
Good to know they did you an excellent service

Just got a Polonium K put in jail earlier this week. Hopefully the approval is fast
I found my next can. That negative review sticker even got my Mrs laughing.
Well shit, now I definitely want an OCL. Only if I get dildo head stickers tho.
I want to put some money in that neckbeard's pocket.
OCL>>>
Andrew really giving us that customer service ‚Äúhawk tuah‚Äù.
He should be going by "Dr." with that penmanship
I want to buy more of their suppressors just for the stickers
wow I had no idea
Alright I don't have money for another suppressor but I'm buy some swag.
Andrew is the flippin' best
I know what company I am getting my next can from
Now that's good customer service! Good on them. Those stickers.............haha......awesome.
Who hurt kindle
I love my polonium
So what part of the suppressor has the welds he mentioned? Curious.
OCL has ALWAYS been ULTRA based fantastic job boys
Fucking love the otter, now throw that aero safety in the trash while yelling ‚ÄúKobe‚Äù and order you either an FCD or a badger ordnance
Almost zero chance, but fate has the chance to do the funniest thing now, and let this cans end fall off again.
Hahhaha.   I am waiting for one on backorder at SS and am ecstatic because these dudes are clearly based.  Unlike YHM who told me to cover my suppressor I have to send in the entire UPPER along with it.  This warmed my heart
Meh looks like a cya for some outsourced shop.  All the boner stickers and signatures wouldn‚Äôt make me buy from them again if this happened.  Glad they honored their mistake which is better than a lot of them.  A reputable shop should have qa /qc process that catches this mistake and is more in line with some backyard bs.  Especially for what they charge for those things.  It‚Äôs a weapon your life could depend on.  They rate them as durable and reliable.  And stuff like this meh.  How many are out there defective like this is the question.
The weld is off center a bit oh well.  The penetration is what matters.
I thought so too, I got the non generic stickers.
Lmao please make this a thing üòÇüòÇ
Also, this post REALLY makes me want to go buy one of u/ottergang_ky cans right now but I'm broke af
otter creek is a shit company and Andrew is a scumbag. Decent suppressors but putting money in that fat neckbeards pocket isn't something I'd ever consider.
Aren‚Äôt you on a date wtf you doing on Reddit lol
Repaired by the myth, the man, the legend himself. 

I‚Äôm honored and I think I‚Äôll case it.
And there ain't no hole in the washtub
My K tube is turning into an L.
Instructions unclear, suppressor on backorder
Take what you can
Ehg, I've had stranger wanks than a busty otter
Fucking Smith&Wesson, 10 weeks on a rifle keyholing out of the box. 

OCL just smashed them all
Sig: ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt warranty products if we only sell two every year for $10k a pop.‚Äù
Stuff like this is literally why I bought a Hydrogen S last night, having to preorder it because my FFL can‚Äôt keep their stuff in stock. I love the way the team is active on here and I see so many ‚ÄúOCL took care of me‚Äù posts that I don‚Äôt worry they are going to screw me if I have to warranty something.
I can‚Äôt stand sig. someone needs to hire their engineers to another company and save us all from their BS proprietary crap and lack of testing
I need to try you guys out, I‚Äôm in Texas and need to support y‚Äôall.
Can you mail me my Polonium K already? Approval should be here any minute now. FAT doesn‚Äôt have to know.
Ordered my first can through you guys earlier today. Polonium. Glad I went that route.

For sure, product quality is just as important as customer service. You get it‚Ä¶
It can be you‚Ä¶
Do it, no hesitation
Great magazines
The issue was we just didn‚Äôt have enough welders. But I bought another one and went and picked it up Tuesday. So that issue is resolved
Try waiting for the ODG Polo from Stockpile, it‚Äôs never in stock
Capitol has both the regular and k polonium‚Äôs in stock.
At the price they are, both.
Why not both?
I have the full size, K, and 30.  No reason not to have all 3 at $500 a piece.  Polo 30 is the quietest 30 cal can I have.
That stuff doesn‚Äôt matter to me, buy whatever you want
This is the reason for the ‚Äúshilling‚Äù tho. They are awesone
I had some damage to the end cap from flying down range and it‚Äôs flawless, can‚Äôt even tell
I don‚Äôt even understand the weld joint pictures but I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs the issue‚Äù and ‚Äúclear from the picture to me‚Äù lol
You have to start somewhere.
As if you need another reason
This guy gets it
Truth
I don‚Äôt know if my case is unique, but I definitely feel special
Well said
Enough said
Yep, cementing it right now
Thank you sir, and good work
For the special people.
Yesterday was the best time
Username checks out
Is that not the ‚Äúin office‚Äù helmet?
Don‚Äôt let my data push you to make the right decision‚Ä¶
Interesting‚Ä¶
The best to deal with in an unfortunate situation.
I‚Äôm waiting for the ODG Polo from Stockpile
I like that plan
You will be making a wise choice
You and me both
Thank you
They haven‚Äôt with me, don‚Äôt know about anyone else
Lol
They win the sticker game too
I think Capital armory has them
No argument here
I was in for the LPM Torch and I‚Äôll push that back so I can get the Polo K first
I always see people wanting the OCM5? What‚Äôs the deal? Clone specific?
I just provided additional data points for the warranty and CS. I owed the follow up post after the first post to make sure people knew what the results were and could be confident in their decision.
I‚Äôm pumped for you
I‚Äôm excited to shoot mine again.
You made a great choice.
Just do it
Repair, warranty, or dealer
If you dream it, it will come
Rightly deserved. It‚Äôs like his destiny
I‚Äôve never seen that available on GAFS
It was his presence in the sub that drove me to buy this one. You can‚Äôt go wrong with OCL
Customer service isn‚Äôt even protected IP, you just have to care.
I know, I had to just push people over the edge with the post. If you thought about, just do it.
I was late to the party but I still got here
Same
The best in the business
You made the best NFA decision possible
I want the ODG Polo from Stockpile
I have more stickers from OCL in the 2 boxes than I get from anyone else.
I know, if only it was contagious. It‚Äôs certainly not IP so someone can easily copy it
Fucking legend works too
It‚Äôs an important part of the business as you can see.
Customer **relations**

üòèüòè
They are changing the game for CS
Happy I joined.
Join the club
With that helmet? They are lining up.
That‚Äôs what I said.
No, he got a genuinely bad product. Manufacturing defect. Zero fault of his. 100% on us
That would not be me
Andrew sent it to me in the package, and I‚Äôm sporting it right now
Can be purchased on their website
You made the right choice.
You can‚Äôt go wrong with Rugged either, they have an unconditional warranty.
It‚Äôs a big choice, I‚Äôm just here to provide data to support your big decision.
You made a good choice, you will be happy
You made a good choice with the Energetic, there‚Äôs always more cans to buy
Welcome aboard!
It‚Äôs a nice hat
I can‚Äôt wait to shoot it for the 1st/2nd time.
Yep, Andrew is the man
I was caught off guard at first
It was a nice surprise and a good laugh
I‚Äôll put more into his pocket after this
For 2024
lol, I don‚Äôt even understand welds/welding the pic looks good to me??
That‚Äôs my plan after this
You are just doing your part
I‚Äôm just here to provide data points
I‚Äôm living the best life thanks to OCL
Mrs. Shay
Front end cap.
It‚Äôs a win in my book
Not when it matches so good‚Ä¶

FCD fucks too
If fate puts Andrew and I together again then that‚Äôs just it.
We have certain stickers we only send to warranty repairs, dealers or special people. I‚Äôd gotten angry emails in the past about putting them in boxes
As funny as it is, it could lead to the unfortunate side effect of the uninitiated believing OCL is shit, instead of OCL is the shit.‚Äã
This was GOLDEN üòÇüëèüèæ I'm glad I made my investment with the otter gang ü¶¶üí™üèæ
Lay away that bitch, just 4 easy payments
do you really NEED two nuts?
He‚Äôs pretending to be occupied and busy, nice strategy.
Shitting
He's on a date with you, you just do know about it. He just likes to take long romantic walks with you that only one of you know about lol. BTW how do I find out I was the one that didn't win the drawing at stockpile in Idaho
Gonna need some lithium grease big fella.
Fukt
I've got a Hydrogen S in jail also! I shot Andrew's Rattler/ Hydrogen S combo at the Quiet in the Capitol event and holy sheet... it was badass.  Bought it just moments after shooting
I'm out of state, but only buy from CA now.  Love not having to deal with ignorant local FFLs.  They make it too convenient to impulse buy cans.
Come to their Quiet in the Capitol event next year, guaranteed good time and likely will walk out with a can or two in jail.  I've had great experiences with them thus far.
Oh thank you üòä
Literally some of the best mags. The price point makes them even better.
I did reputation management SEO back in the day. Hated it. My number one recommation was always FYS - fix your shit.


It was always the one thing clients were least interested in, so I had to keep fixing/covering up their mistakes and they always wondered why they still looked bad.¬†


This is a prime example of FYS. If all companies did this, the reputation management industry would cease to exist.¬†
Sweet
That‚Äôs our fault right now. We‚Äôre so behind on black we‚Äôre basically only producing black for the rest of 2024. No FDE no ODG just black only until we‚Äôre caught up.
There‚Äôs an ODG Polonium? üëÄ
As if I didn‚Äôt need another reason to get an OCL lol. I signed up for email notifications. Let the games begin
I have the polo k in jail now since the 10th.. haven‚Äôt even gotten the fucking K and I want to get the full hahaha
Facts ü§£ü§£ü§£
This guy gets that guy‚Ä¶getting it.
From the very few warranty issues I‚Äôve seen with ocl yours is one of the longer wait times but this is the first one I‚Äôve seen post quick approval and we all know they‚Äôre slammed.
my polo-k arrives at my FFL today, crossing my fingers for a short form4 approvalü§û
It is obvious someone either paid attention during marketing class,  or just has a sense about how to interact with regular people in an authentic way. Either way,  I'm here for it
It can't be any worse than Silencer Central. I bet their rimfire can would actually make a difference on a 10/22.
Much respect when a company takes the time to fix and acknowledge the problem
They are definitely the most popular with cloners. Mine isn't a true mk12 clone, but kinda a modernized take. The ocm5 and the aem5 both are probably the quietest 5.56 cans out there also.
Oh, I haven‚Äôt purchased it yet üòÖ currently have an omega 300 that floats between my AR and my 6.5CM deer gun, but it‚Äôs on the list probably early next year!
I want to.  I‚Äôve never purchased any NFA items before.  Not really sure where to start. But am in the market for a solid 9mm suppressor for my PCC‚Ä¶.  have a general idea.  I know I need fingerprints and such.  And I see that I need to send them in. But if I e-file, how do I send prints digitally? I need to do some research. Or have some help/guidance if anyone is willing to lead me through the process.
That's because everyone who has one loves it so much they won't sell.
He seems like a really standup kind of guy you wouldn‚Äôt mind hanging out with! I wish more companies were like this
I almost did, but went with a B&T Rotex instead because I got a really good price on it. OCL keeps going higher and higher on my list for my next purchase.
Looks cool.
My only concern is my ar15s lack an adjustable gas block but it sounds like playing with weights and springs can get itbunder control
Thanks friend! Ease of cleaning titanium was what sold me on it, but I‚Äôd probably go buy a otter creek after seeing this post and seeing the guys comments
It's probably the wrong place to ask. Is the Polonium compatible with PlanB/Rearden?
Damn the only things I hate about this is the rail, the safety and the CH but the colors do be fucking
I‚Äôm as fucking special as they come, have you seen the ODG build. Tism to the max‚Ä¶.
I love you made a negative review a sticker üòÜ
I stuff my Polo K with breakfast sausage links every morning before work. Then when I shoot with it, it sizzles and gives off a beautiful aroma of pork. Does this make me special or a full blown retard?
How do I qualify as special üòÇ
that cash sticker is amazing
I‚Äôm about to flip through my angry email templates and whip up a doozy because I DIDN‚ÄôT get some of those sticker gems.
You sir and your company are exceptionally based. Currently on the hunt for an instock product of yours. Keep doing the lords work.
If I place an order how do I check the box that says "do your best to offend me"? Can't believe snowflakes bought your products, but ü§∑üèª
https://preview.redd.it/8923pb7z499d1.jpeg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72856a1a9a6baf30e21944eff4629415af5ccf86
That is the funniest fucking sticker I have ever seen. 

Hope I never need to warranty but if I got that sticker I wouldn‚Äôt be too mad about it.
How do we obtain the otter with Mexican hat sticker?
I hope my Polo K fails just so I can get those stickers. Worth the two weeks without my can üòÇ
I never got stickers with my purchase, alas I will be sticker less forever missing the OCL stickers on my safe. How will I live?
Please tell me that the hottie otter is the one that did (or almost did) make it onto the work car!
you guys forgot to bring stickers when we met at the Phoenix shoot earlier this year, that was special..
My mom says I‚Äôm special. Does that mean I can has funny stickers while waiting for my polonium to be freed from jail?
You can put anything in my box‚Ä¶
I wish we lived closer. I think you and i would have an epic bromance full of god-tier shit talking and weird side projects. I need to really consider getting into the firearm biz just to make new connections with people. Thanks for all you do, my ocm5 has been great since repair!
Is there a trick to finding one of your cans in stock? Dying to get my hands on a polonium 30 but they're always back ordered. Oh, love the otter sticker with the nice rack.
Just found out from this post and your username that y'all are from KY.  My next silencer will be from you.
Momma says I'm special. I want special stickers....
Polonium 30 L please
But wait! There's more!
Throw in a ShamWow and you‚Äôve got yourself a deal!
That‚Äôs 6 of my 8 hours a day on work. Shitting on company time hits different when you‚Äôre the boss
I wish mine was in jail, my FFL said it would be 1-3 months until they get restocked but they were on order but I figure I might as well just get it done. 

I can‚Äôt wait! I am going to run it on my bolt 308, so I can replace the 36M I have on there and run that on my long range AR. Their 22can is probably going to be next for me
I might have to try CA next
Lmao I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing. Like a job or industry. That‚Äôs pretty cool but also weird people have to be told how to act. 

It‚Äôs simple. Your customers are literally the only reason your business exists. Every dollar you have, everything you own, your entire life and future depends on your customers. Without them there is no business. I‚Äôm not perfect and I‚Äôve definitely made mistakes but I will bend over backwards and take the shirt off my back for someone who pays my bills and supports me no matter what. No and/if/but about it, period.
I‚Äôll be waiting patiently then‚Ä¶
Any OCM5s in the near future?
Yes, Stockpile Defense has the rights to the ODG version. It‚Äôs never in stock but it‚Äôs a looker
Jump on them while you can.
I‚Äôll head back for the K just because of this experience
I think Andrew said it‚Äôs the 3rd or 4th warranty issue out of 30,000+ cans. That‚Äôs pretty impressive
Thoughts and prayers
Do they beat the Vent 3 or WB 718, or the hybrid design? Is that comparison to traditional baffle style cans?
There you go.
Easy, I was where you were. First step is trust or individual, then choose your distributor or FFL for transfer.

If you choose trust, national gun trust, is what I went with. They have videos and written examples of everything you need to do for Form 1 and the trust work. 

If you go with national gun trusts, they also offer fingerprinting services too. I had the digital portion back in 24 hours after I rolled them myself with the paper forms and ink stamp from Amazon. 

The form is self explanatory and I my prints looked like a one armed, blind man rolled them and they still accepted them. 

You can also choose Capital Armory, they walk you through the process step by step, and then ship the suppressor direct to your door.
Figures
He‚Äôs a legend for sure when it comes to customer service.
Can‚Äôt go wrong with B&T, great looking suppressors
All but 1 of my 5.56 rifles do not have AGB. It‚Äôs not necessary at all.
Fuck yeah it is brother. Rearden for life
I‚Äôm still looking at ESF-H for the end plate, ABC/R V3 bolt catch, and LDFA for the forward assist. All in ODG, and I think I‚Äôm done.

No but now I‚Äôm intrigued and an OCL suppressor has been bumped to the top of my list because of this post
Rizzin‚Äô w/ the ‚ÄòTism‚Ä¶
You get a sticker from the ‚Äúspecial pack‚Äù for sure‚Ä¶.
What have I done?
‚ÄúSorry, Andrew. I accidentally sawzall‚Äôd my polo k in 3 pieces‚Äù.
Definitely gonna slap some flex seal tape over the can, if it's good enough for Billy Mays, it's good enough to be my suppressor cover.
More like shitting on competition 24 hours a day
"Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that's why I...wait just a goddamn minute."
I need to buy more suppressors so you can at LEAST shit 7 out of the 8 hours
Sounds next level.
Do you want to play battle shits?
Yeh, the Hydrogen series def take the backseat with Poloniums driving. I bought it on March 3 and certified May 28, will be worth it though.

I'm with you, their 22lr can is on my list!
What's funny is in the automotive supplier world, that's how it works. You cant piss off your customers otherwise it's over. Getting new business with someone you pissed off is hard. Everywhere else every company just seems to want to fuck everyone over ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

P.S. y'all got at 9mm cans? My UMP has been begging me for some sweet whispers...
He gets it‚Ä¶.
Capitol Armory cerakotes cans solid color for under $100 and do a bang up job. I've had them do one and they had it ready for me to pick up in like 3 days. Been a couple years so not sure if prices have changed but they did great.
Just paint a black one?
Subscribed to in stock notifications. I‚Äôll do dirty, nasty things to get my hands on that
And I guess I‚Äôll get the full. Look at us, couple of gentlemen.
Yup I have 5 of their dans, probably gonna back order another one today. All have been perfect and with the brt gas tube awesome performance.
In noise reduction specifically, I believe they do. But they are not flowthrough cans. I'm by no means an expert so take what I say with a grain of salt but maybe u/ottergang_ky can touch more on it. I want to say I remember a video from mrgunsngear hearing the aem5 had around 40db reduction and in the info of the ocm5 it stated that it was slightly even better than that but didn't give any specific numbers. I'd love pew science to cover them. I believe both are traditional baffled cans and the ocm5 is a more modernized version.
Thankyou for this! And you can have these bad boys direct to your door now?? That‚Äôs sick
Time to buy ANOTHER DPB.
Why no Rhf4? The Fde ano one will look insane on it
I will shoot it this weekend for the second time and I‚Äôm stoked.
Because of this post I'm getting an OCL suppressor now too üòÉ
YES. I‚Äôm gonna put it next to the gold star stickers my teacher gave me
More like 25 hours a day
I didn‚Äôt know better when I bought my 22 can and went with a JK Armament - I don‚Äôt see the utility in the bunch of baffles, I thought I would adjust the size more than I do and it‚Äôs annoying having to check each of them for tightness when I am blasting 200 rounds through my TX22 pistol 

Do you think the hydrogens are less popular because they are more expensive?
yeah ocl has the [lithium 6in 5.7oz 9mm can](https://ottercreeklabs.com/product/lithium/)
I did not know that, and I have never heard any one mention it. Thank you
I should have never said anything lol, I‚Äôll see you at the click to add to cart screen eventually
Someone got to fill the gaps, that‚Äôs us
I‚Äôm rocking non adjustable gas blocks on all but 1. That‚Äôs probably the issue
Great information and thank you, I‚Äôll see what I can find
Capital Armory will handle it from start to finish. That‚Äôs the best choice for you and it takes all the guesswork out of it.
I like the PRS and R2S
I‚Äôm not a quad rail guy, and I know they have their purpose.
Basically. Just need to find one lol
They are awesome. My least expensive can is my polo and it is by far the best can I have.
Personally I'm not that big of a fan of JK Armament, the modularity aspect is cool (I guess) however I'd never use it.  

I'm not sure why the Hydrogens haven't taken off as much as the Poloniums have, they're a solid fuckin' can.
Yup that‚Äôll help a bunch, also can‚Äôt order the can I want because silencer shop isn‚Äôt doing a back order on it üò°
Thanks man I appreciate the help!
Quads are for gods
I agree, now. But at the time I was thinking I would run it at full size for the 10/22 and like half sized for the pistol, but I just leave it together in the full configuration. If I could do it again I would just buy the 22 can from OCL, I‚Äôll still do it eventually haha
They are swamped with Polo orders, as they should be. I bet they won‚Äôt make any runs until 2025
lol, oh
Yeah I kinda want a hydrogen L which isn‚Äôt a big seller for them so I get it. If silencer shop will rob you for a polo they should let me be robbed for a hydrogen. Maybe I‚Äôll just do another ocm5.
I want the ODG Polonium from Stockpile Defense
To whom it may concern. The Aurora in Vermont.
First time I‚Äôve ever had the opportunity seeing such a beautiful sight. It really is amazing.

Absolutely wild up here in Central VT. Could easily see it with our naked eye and could watch it change/move. Crazy that I‚Äôve seen aurora in Iceland and Alaska and the best I‚Äôve ever seen it was just off my back deck.

Goddamit. I love somewhere with almost zero light pollution. Anytime there‚Äôs a chance of seeing the aurora I go outside and never seem to catch it. Last night my newborn slept (and therefore I slept too) from 9-3am and by 3am it was done.

Anyone in the Burlington area?
Seeing them in central VT too!!
Thanks for sharing! Completely cloudy in the Burlington area, but still awesome to see in your pictures!

Richmond around 10:30 pm! My phone photo is much more vivid than what we actually saw.
How far north?
Damn, I missed it! Anyone still seeing it? I'm in South Burlington and maaaaybe see a faint greenish glow in the north? But I'm probably imagining it.
Any idea if we‚Äôre supposed to be seeing them again tonight? Unfortunately I fell asleep at 8 last night and missed it
Thanks for the heads up. Wish I was home right now.
I don‚Äôt see crap
Just seeing glow behind the clouds but it‚Äôs mostly blocked. Unfortunate
Nothing but clouds here

I've never regretted a full, heavy night's sleep before, but here I am. :(
Beautiful
Amazing. I just saw some greenish clouds. Eerie but not spectacular.
And I was fucking sleeping?! Sob. 
Eclipse or northern light?
Saw absolutely nothing in the southern part of Vermont. The brightness I was from the moon.
Clouds in the Upper Valley
Incredible!!
Saw the sky being vaugely pink, but we had too much cloud cover where I was last night to see them
God damn it! I did. See shit!
If you didn‚Äôt know flights from Boston to Iceland can be surprisingly cheap (275-300) and it‚Äôs a 5 hour flight.¬†

If you like the northern lights and want to see some crazy country side you can see a ton renting a car and staying in Reykjavik. ¬†The golden circle and snaefellsnes are both really awesome

North Street Montpelier VT
That sounds incredible. I remember the first time I saw the Northern Lights too. It felt like magic watching those colors dance across the sky. Vermont's beauty can be so breathtaking, especially when you catch moments like that. Thanks for sharing your experience. It‚Äôs always nice to connect with others who appreciate the wonders around us.
Yeah we have clouds here across the river. Fuck you Vermont.
So I actually almost booked a trip to Iceland this year to try to see them. I‚Äôm in Burlington and while it looks pretty cool on my phone, irl it just looks grey and slightly bright. Literally thought it was clouds until I put my camera up. Was that similar to how you‚Äôve seen them elsewhere? I always imagined you actually see all the colors and such. I can see maybe a tinge of green but it‚Äôs more grey than anything.
Amazing!
Awesome photo and view!
https://preview.redd.it/xv0wzrarqpzc1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95959e0de6b7875e46194d69ca9ced7e5e822627
It‚Äôs defiantly trip holding up your phone and seeing all the colors so much more intense. This was taken in Saxtons river about 30 minutes ago before all the clouds rolled back in
Damn. I just drove out to Colchester nearly an hour ago. It looked slightly pink to me, but I thought it was too cloudy to see anything. I drove through Winooski, Burlington, and South Burlington. Only saw a slight hint of pink, maybe. 

Damn clouds. Maybe I'll try again soon. Those pictures look great.
Holy heck! This way to the emerald city!!!!!!!!
Yup I‚Äôm just a bit south of you and saw something similar
https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast
Cloudy here in South Royalton, too. I miss everything. üòÇ
Same üò≠
It‚Äôs definitely trippy looking up to the sky and then holding your phone up and seeing a shit load of colors!
Saxtons River. Had about 10 minutes where the clouds cleared out and was able to snag a few shots
You were not imagining it. That‚Äôs what I saw in Colchester early on and my phone got this

I also see a greenish/blueish hue to the north. Usually Montreal‚Äôs lights are brown/beige.
I second this I must know. I had read about it in the morning then fucking forgot, saw this post and am now so fucking mad at myself
same here, I could have sworn we had extremely low chances of seeing it here so I didn't even think to look and see ;o;
https://preview.redd.it/zku8j42jrqzc1.jpeg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65384c1b878e4c0b12620c03902f883a3c773104

I'm wondering the same thing. This is what my camera was able to get before cloud cover came, and it definitely wasn't that bright in person. It looked more like blue hour. But this was farther south than you.

I was hoping to see angels descend from the sky, but maybe you and I just got unlucky, angle-wise.
When I first went out I had to use my camera to really see it (which is a trick I picked up on a tour in Iceland). 

Then something happened, either our eyes adjusted or the storm intensified, or both and we could easily see it with our naked eye. With just our eyes we could see several distinct colors and watch it move around. It took up almost the entire sky. 

It was honestly one of the most awe-inspiring things I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Easily up there with the eclipse.
No it can be much different! Last night was amazing but when we saw them in Iceland they were very bright green, fully visible to the naked eye and swirling. We have been to other places north of and near the arctic circle during the correct time of year and haven‚Äôt seen them though, so try not to only go for auroras. Iceland has plenty to offer on its own if you don‚Äôt see them anyway
Depends what time. Around 1 it was moving and pulsing a lot
I‚Äôm in Burlington but drove out of town to see them last night. You need to get away from light pollution to see the colours. It was fully pink and green visible to the naked eye last night once I got to a darker area. I used to live in Alaska and saw them regularly. It is the same there. You have to get away from light pollution to see them. Also the less moon in the sky, the more visible.
I saw them in Iceland the same way I saw them here in Vt last night, through my camera lens. Have not been able to see them with the naked eye, yet.
That was my experience seeing them in Alaska. Still impressive but mostly grey. It seems some people's eyes are more sensitive to it and will see more color. But digital cameras definitely pick up more than "real life".
Saxtons river?!? That means i probably could have seen it in bratt! Of freaking course i missed it lol miss this and the eclipse. Is there a chance again tonight? Beautiful pictures by the way!!
Interesting!! Tysm
Yes, it‚Äôs supposed to be happen again tonight though last night was peak intensity
Corvette C3 1979, how do I get the lights to go down at the same time?
Hey everybody, I guess you could say this is an update post from my previous post. Car is up and running, no major issues to get it running other than having to rebuild the carburetor (front bowl had a huge hole in it somehow). These pop up lights and the brake lights not working are the only 2 problems I am having at the current moment.

These headlights are raised and lowered by vacuum actuators. You seem to have some imbalance with the vacuum.  I would check all of the vacuum routing and the actuators themselves.  I suspect that it is the actuator itself. You can easily test this by swapping them.  If the left one goes down slower after you swap them, then it is the actuator. They are available.  However, even with everything working correctly, sometimes the headlights do not go up and down in unison.  They do make an aftermarket electrical actuator system that would make everything work as you want it.
You should point to it as soon as the drivers side goes down instead of waiting
Convert the vacuum actuators to electric?
It seemed to go down when you pointed at it, try pointing at it faster.
Fully clean and lubricate all the moving parts, make sure the actuators have no resistance.


I worked on one of these before, I don't remember if the vacuum source goes to one and then the other, or goes to both from the source.


- You can rework it so that each one draws  direct from the source.

- you can add a supplemental can that holds a little bit more vacuum like the old 70s Ford trucks, it looks like a small coffee can. It's a vacuum reserve storage.
The wink adds personality.
On my C3 it was doing that too, I checked everything. Two things helped the most.

1. Closer to the engine mine has a check valve. The valve was bad so I replaced it. There‚Äôs a way you can test it but they‚Äôre cheap enough to replace. 

2. The driver side actuator had a leak in the rubber at the plunger. I swapped that out and it was like night and day. Both lights open and close almost in perfect unison.
You're lucky it can get it up at all, life after fifty is rough I hear.
Point at it sooner....Duh!!
If I drive mine and then shut it off for a bit, like running into a store, most of the time my driver side refuses to pop up again until the car fully cools down again over night.

I've been considering the electric conversion, but it is kinda pricey.
Why would you want them to if you do this when you get out you'll look badass every time
i think the wink is legit. don‚Äôt go messin with it!
Point at it obviously, you already did it once.
There will be springs to help assist. You can check the springs or even add a bit more tension. 

I twouldn‚Äôt focus on it too much; see it as a charm of old pneumatics

I have a 60‚Äôs mercury with vacuum actuators that wink for a second before closing i think it‚Äôs cool
But it's cool. This way you can 'wink' to other drivers at stop lights ;)
Seems like the right headlight never locks in place as well, I'd advice to disconnect things and see if they both moove freely.
https://www.motortrend.com/how-to/vemp-1201-c3-electric-headlight-actuator-install-light-at-last/
there are conversion kits for this... it replaces the vacuum garbage with a normal electrical motor. It opens and closes faster and simultaneously
Have you tried pointing to both sides at the same time?
I don't see anyone else mentioning it, but if you look closely, the same light doesn't even open all the way either
If you cant manage to fix it, just use the move u just did in the vid everytime, easy solutions for easy problems
That‚Äôs the cool thing, you don‚Äôt.
There are kits available to convert to electrical actuators
Cause you‚Äôre not saying, ‚ÄúClose Salami‚Ä¶‚Äù

That‚Äôs the problem.
The one going down first has a vacuum leak on the down side of the vacuum map.
No need to fix!  Vette is good boi!  Best boy!  Gives treats?

- not written by a dog
I had to manually crank down the left headlight of my '86 Firebird back in the day. So I mean. It could be worse lol.
Be happy that they work at all.
Did you try lubricating the mechanism? The passenger headlight clearly is getting stuck on the way up, I assume it's getting stuck on the way down.
Electric headlight motor conversion.  That‚Äôs what did to my C3.  Best $179 I‚Äôve ever spent on the car.  Perfectly even up and down movement in synch with each other, and I was able to delete those massive vacuum pots and a ton of old rotten vacuum line off the car in the process.  There are plug-and-play kits readily available for these C3s, do it and thank me later!
![gif](giphy|KgvxQwEgpd9YI)
If anyone asks yes I already put WD40 on it
Hmmm, maybe the vacuum system can be improved if everything else is lubed and in good shape, is there a vacuum accumulator anywhere in the factory system? I would suspect that the vacuum lines are a longer run on one side vs the other or maybe there is a small leak. I'd try running equal lengths of vacuum line from either headlight to a central vacuum accumulator, connect the accumulator to the vacuum signal source.
TIL those light are actuated by vaccum lines.

Good to know.
These are so cool.
It‚Äôs winking
Or, just get a license plate that says winky
Even with the vacuum perfectly balanced between the two, any imbalance in friction on the hinge points or in the actuators themselves will cause one to move first.  Apart from swapping to electric, installing needle valves on the vacuum line to each one would allow you to adjust the balance by essentially setting a limit on how fast air can enter or leave the actuators.
Replace the pass side actuator. It‚Äôs just crusty. The ds goes, then vacuum builds up till it‚Äôs enough to finally get past the over center lock. They will never be perfect but an actuator would help a lot.
You don't
Have you tried telling it to close faster?
I always wondered about these headlights, Why not have a bar to link them? 

Even though they are individually powered, in most cases even a flexible bar of some sort would add enough force to keep them pretty well close to seamless.
I kinda like it
[Electric motor conversion.](https://customimagecorvettes.com/product/c3-electric-headlight-conversion-kit/)
KaChow?
Install electronic actuators.
you could convert it from vacuum to 12v motor‚Ä¶ idk if it exists but it should
Rebuild the vacuum system that runs BOTH lights.
lol as someone with a ‚Äò76, I‚Äôd just say.. ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt‚Äù
Mine did the same thing. There are videos online to repair the actuator. New actuators aren't terribly expensive. I thought about going electric, but it takes away from the nostalgia.
I absolutely hate this angle but i love it
Lazy eye
Get rid of the vacuum actuators, there are so many issues that can and will happen over time with this system, I've replaced the. With a kit like the one I'll link to. It's pretty easy to swap them over, no special tools needed. Keep in mind, this kit may not be the one for your car, but it will give you an idea of what to look for

This guy has a great series on the early C3's!
Order electric kit for headlights and do away with vacuum
Your pop up up and down headlights are actually pop up up up and down down headlights. Neat
You gotta winker!
its winking
If you figure it out, tell GM.
It's just winking
Had a Miata, the same. Loved it
This is where it gets a little bit tricky cuz it messes with people with OCD but if you have to have the same amount of vacuum line on both sides because if one is longer than the other it will take longer for it to drop back down
![gif](giphy|hpAMh2sBYpsmFhSRPI)
Welcome to hell. If you can get them perfectly synced, without replacing EVERY SINGLE PART in the vacuum system, you are really lucky. Even if you replace all the parts, it is unlikely that they will sync perfectly. I devised a way to do this, but it would only work for a while and require constant fiddling... (micrometer valve to tune each leg of the system).
Tell it to close a little sooner to match the other light.
It might bug some, but I think it's charming that there's one not quite ready to give up and go to sleep, lol. Like a toddler fighting to stay awake. Adorable, actually üòç
The actuators need some love‚Ä¶new seals on both
This is better.
Wait your 79 corvette lights actually go up?
A whole SHITTON of WD40!
Keep it winky bro!
Please post again when you fix it, it would be awesome to see. Hope it is the actuator as others have said. Good luck OP
Maybe if you can get it to go fully up it‚Äôll be ready to start going down faster.
That point was smooth
Be happy they‚Äôre still working!
I have nothing to contribute in terms of mechanical advice here.  I just want to express how extremely awesome vintage vehicle technology is.   Maybe an unpopular opinion but I love how out of sync they are, lol.
Swap out your vacuum shit for electronic motors.
You don't. You leave it like that. It's awesome.



Also just throwing out there there are electric conversions if you want that. I personally would leave it on the vacuum lines unless you're adding forced induction and fucking with the vacuum pressure.
Just name the car Winkie and be done with it.
Those C3 with high performance engine like the L82 the vacuum is low like et at  15 psi . Compare at the regular engine the vacuum is around 20/21 . 
 I had 2 of those C3 with that engine and they both behave a little like it from when they were new . 
 When they get older they may get more out of synchronization and slower.
Free Miata upgrade.
The old Mercedes used vacuum for the power locks. Watching them go down slowly was cathartic.
![gif](giphy|10X22vzgNamaiI)
You don't want your car to wink at people?
Why would you?  it‚Äôs cool this way
Its fine. It just disguises you as a motorcycle for a few seconds at night.
It's cooler that they don't go down at the same time.
Try pointing at it faster
See if you can find someone (mechanic buddy) who might have an ultrasonic leak detector it will pick up a vacuum leak anywhere most can't be heard by the human ear bet ya got a leak somewhere in the vacuum circuit, used these detectors for under dash actuator leaks work like a charm !!!
I love the uneven closing! It adds so much character to a classic car. It reminds me of airplane hydraulic landing gear retraction. Both gears unlocks, one goes up, then the other.
If you're facing issues with your 1979 Corvette C3 pop-up headlights not going down at the same time, the cause could be related to headlight motor malfunction, misaligned linkage, or faulty electrical connections. To ensure proper synchronisation, you should also check the headlight motor relay, vacuum lines, and control switches to a [car repair shop in New Westminster](https://matrixautorepair.com/). For a professional diagnosis and repair, Matrix Auto Repair New Westminster can help with Corvette repair, classic car restoration, and fixing issues like headlight motor synchronization. Their experienced technicians will ensure your Corvette's headlights function properly and efficiently.
Personally, I like the voice-activated closing. Lol it's very knight riderish.
 .
.
not an issue with power supply between the 2?
Who cares that is cool as shit
Lol @ your magic üëâ at the end ü§£
Replace the vacuum hoses/someone else did and did it wrong!
I think it looks way cooler and more unique that way, with that brilliantly timed point, makes you look cool too
Forrest Whitaker type of head lights.
Don't buy a Chevy lol
[removed]
Checked all the vacuum routing already because I had to swap out the vacuum relays, so I was thinking it would probably be an actuator problem. Thanks!
This guy knows
Correct. Dad had two different ‚Äò76 Stingrays. One ‚Äúbehaved‚Äù, the other did not. I got to spend hours upon hours holding the light over one of them. When he finally learned about the vacuum system, he also learned, a bit, about, Communist Russian airplanes. He did actually say it, once, about GM. 
‚ÄúCommie garbage.‚Äù But, only the one time, in front of me. I was of an impressionable age.
Is this vacuum system also run the wipers? It wasn't this car but I remember a long time ago my grandpa had another car that had the headlights that flipped up and down but his wipers didn't work that great and actually found the leak in the wiper line. Does that sound at all familiar?
OP, this is the answer. Listen to AnalPoundingMagician.
![gif](giphy|d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY)
I'm just wondering how you came up with that username.
Do you know if there are commercially available kits for this, or would it be more of a DIY situation?
Ya
I second this üëÜ
Came to advise this. You need an overwhelming vac source to accomplish this.

I‚Äôd plumb an r/o water tank in for this.
Yeah, I saw a 200 dollar one off of AliExpress. Probably isn‚Äôt toooo bad but I wouldn‚Äôt buy it unless these actuators stopped working completely
https://www.madhornets.com/1968-1982-corvette-c3-electric-headlight-conversion-kit-upgrade/?sku=C116-175&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADxvMT5Jii3iWJANJmMXr2aRiAdOF&gclid=CjwKCAjw9p24BhB_EiwA8ID5BiciAmp3IlO3ZBqm2aZMMd2IaUt4IYq0MNqrbVPy6uckI-QyXHRhixoC1JMQAvD_BwE
Seriously this is a feature not a bug now
yeah i was wondering if its binding or sticking at that point

would make sense how it never goes fully up, and then takes a lot more 'oomph' to go back down.
WD40 is a terrible lubricant
I have no experience with this car but If the vacuum hoses are fine and the problem is that one of the actuator has more friction than the other you might attempt to disassemble it, clean any oxidation and lubricate properly?
I always used dry graphite lubricant in my vacuum motors as its less prone to gum up.  "vacuum wipers, headlights etc"  a little bit goes a long way.  you might have to degrease them inside then apply the graphite.   
I have used sewing machine oil a few times with reasonable success.
Although I did have some fuse problems the pop up lights are completely powered by vacuums
Didn‚Äôt see this but you get it, this literally happens to almost of them over time. Just a design flaw and just gotta enjoys it‚Äôs ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù. It‚Äôs like a scar and makes you unique.
And then once you‚Äôve got them synced up, do [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funnyvideos/s/K2A2x3XxLB)
Have you lubricated  the actuators?  Any parts that have pivoting connections, including where the hinges that the headlights swing from.
The vacuum tank also
Good idea to clean and lubricate any sliding and pivoting points. Odds are they are rusty and causing additional friction.
There were many cars that had vacuum wipers. I had a friend long ago who had an AMC Hornet, witch vacuum wipers.  They would not work, but the strange things was that the vacuum solenoid would hold the wipers in the park position. We routed a rope outside of the car to pull them across the windshield, and the vacuum actuator would pull them back.  Not ideal, but it worked.

Ya, I try to put parts that are going to be upgrades. I daily mine and plan on keeping it for a long time.
Interesting. I'll have to do some research on those, that kit is way cheaper than what I was looking at. I have to make sure I'm putting quality parts in my car. Thanks for the link.
I agree, Astroglide is much better.
This depends on the product. Nowadays, WD-40 is a brand that manufacturers a bunch of different products. In the past year or so they pushed hard their "specialist" line of lubricants, penetrants and degreasers.
it was much better back in the day when it was made from whale blubber
I thought the headlight going down as the guy walked past was a cute party trick. Id keep it as long as it still shut lol
It looks like a winking robot.
The car blinks it's super cool
if you can't fix it, feature it.
Fair enuff'
That's quite the price disparity.
Just don't confuse the cutting oil with the energy drink
This guy WD-40s.
Hell naw, nows the time to invest in a double switch electric. So you can actually control the party trick.

Set one on a timer for 10 seconds delay or so, but the other one is instant. That way you can do the 180¬∞ reverse wink and then sling back around and drift off into the sunset. Then you also have the exit finger gun close.
Detroit speed is the kit I saw before, one of the car shows on motortrend or power block installed it on an episode. I had sticker shock on that one too so I put the other one out there that came up in a google search. 

Wonder how much difference there actually is they look pretty similar. There are probably others out there too.
degreasing my intestines is usually what energy drinks do to me
And beware of intimate lubricant and contact cement that have similar packaging.

That‚Äôs the way we used to do it, headbands and hand plants!
Just want to say that I dont think people appreciate how much harder it was on gear like that/ it's not like there was a big mega industry behind you (or people of more my early 90s era). It was build your own jump for the most part, people didnt want you there, and we were working with wooden planks. Now I ride a board approaching 40 and can do all the old tricks or more and it's because the pop is insane, the jumps are well designed, and the swing weight of the boards are tiny compared to what we had.

This is the way. ‚ö°Ô∏è
This is the way.
Wasn‚Äôt this shot in a ‚ÄúJuicy Fruit‚Äù commercial ya boyee
I used to ride in a Burton pullover jacket that was fuchsia pink and yellow with some black and purple felt wizard's hat... those were the days.
This is the best.

Methods are still the shit! 

I can't remember who said it but something along the lines of "you can't judge a book by it's cover by you can judge a snowboarder by their Method".

And yours was sick in the 80's!
I still have an old sims beanie, awesome throwback
r/oldschoolcool
Guys will see this and just think 'fuck yea bro!'
Amazing stuff dude!! One of your photos reminded me of Zoolander, hence the gif! Those photos are gold!!

Wave Rave & SIMS!! SAME ü§ôü§ô
Are you the guy off that Nintendo game?
You're a fn legend G!!! Good ol'VHS snowboard video days
That heelside turn is absolutely iconic
I tore my ACL just looking at that third photo. So sick.
Yeah this is hard as f
#5 gets my vote for most rad because the whole thing together is just mad steezy
[deleted]
Nice Tindy.. üòÇ
Congratulations,  you are officially old. 

 Do you have readers, and have you had your colonoscopy scheduled yet?
My man!
Hell yeah. I got that board in my office as a shelf ü§ôüèæüçªthis is so rad
Method Air on a Dare!

Is that the 1710 Blade in the first two shots? (my first snowboard)
Was your nickname Ninja Turtle?

Cuz you‚Äôre a fuckin shredder.üòé
Is this from cool boarders on  ps2 ?
Woahhhh so cool!!!!! Do you still ride?
![gif](giphy|qhqDb82rg1uuI)
This guys girlfriend is probably pretty steezy too!
How‚Äôs the riding looking these days? You still able to do this these tricks? Or more/ better? Or have you abandoned tricks all together?
Hey, it's you with that... missile. I bet it doesn't even have brakes.
This is fucking rad my guy
Fucking awesome. Film too. Amazing shots, so much tougher to get shooting single frames of film vs mashing an iPhone button or bursting with a Sony a7r
Hell yes dude, these photos are sweet!! One other thing that is underappreciated these days is how incredibly rare it was to get photos at all, let alone pretty good ones like this. Fucking sick!!

Also, love those Wave Rave pants. I got sponsored by them in '89 and those pants are bringing back some memories.
Methods are still the shit.
Where were you riding?
Everything about this is the raddest thing in the history of radness.
üî•üî•üî•
What is this? my grade 7 science book cover shoot?
I wrote a paper about snowboarding in 6th grade in 2001. I think I put some of these pictures of you in it.
Now that.. is cool
Sploosh!   If I may, how about someone do that with your own gear for wall art?   

Also, your gnar is the ground on which we now try to shred.
lol, also, you need a helmet!   Hehe
Methods are still the shit my guy.
These are incredible
Slay
I just want those burton gate gloves again
Calm down Mr steezy
You must of had a bad case of "snowboard arms" a gnarly case!
Hell yeah bro shit is dope as fuck
Rad, dude!
Wave Rave
I had the same board as pic 5, but different color scheme. Thanks for sharing!
I had that Sims board! It was used. I started boarding in the early 90‚Äôs.
Hand in the air ü§ö= rad
Oh, I‚Äôm uncool. Fuckleberries.
Sims Pocketknife in the last pic? That was my first board, good times.
That tindy!
How is your body holding up after all these years?
Damn this is so cool! 

OP do you still ride?
Nice!üí™üèΩ
These pictures are totally choice, my dude! Rock on
Now this is what I'm talking about.
So friggin rad.
Picture number 5 is a peak 80s moment. Fucking rad!
Steezy AF hell yea
[Methods still are the shit- 7:15 mark.](https://youtu.be/e7AXH7SPyCE?si=GdAr1N0UVZ7UpVMG)

I mean DAYUM. 

You have serious cred- big props dude.

I‚Äôm still rockin the SIMS beanie proudly. Only the OGs know- like a 13 point lightning bolt, but for snowboarding hoodlums that have committed  numerous crimes throughout the years.
Hell yeah dude!
Dope. Here a picture of me in the 80s

You invented steez
No Zinca on the nose?
Vintage crimes?
Omg you‚Äôre awesome.
Rad
Great pics especially for a camera from the 80's
Lucky that you had someone to take photos. Most of mine are poorly timed (handed the camera to a buddy).

Fun stuff!
And head injuries were just a‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶ I forgot what I was writing.
Looks like we started boarding the same time, although I was closer to 13 years old.  I believe my first board was in 84. BURTON Buckhill.  Then the 87 Performer Elite.
Reminds me of the short-lived word "badical"

1625 Halfpipe, 89
Still have my old boards but not my snow suits. Wish I did.
How old is that deck? Compatible with current bindings?
Looks sick. But you couldn‚Äôt catch me dead having that snowsuit hanging on my wall. Thing would scare the bejeezus out of me weekly, at least.
Damn that Sims one piece is sick. Nice TK to
Bro. Kidwell!! Had that then a 1625 halfpipe. Had one of those green suits‚Ä¶still have a black one AND the pull over shell üëäüèªüí•üëäüèª
I had that exact same board- (different bindings) as my first board.
Criminal af
OG tindy.
Back then it is just gear.. lol.
Methods will always be the shit.
Do you remember the ‚ÄúJ-Tear Air?‚Äù Mike Jacoby‚Äôs signature trick?
Not to mention there were so few mountains that even allowed snowboarding. The ones that did required a ‚ÄúCertification‚Äù which basically meant you took a lesson and were taught how to stop. Eventually once things loosened up a bit that requirement went away. Ahh, the good old days. Most of these pics were taken at Hunter Mountain in NY. On a typical weekend there would often be less than 20 snowboarders there, the rest skiers.
No but I often dreamt of being one!
I dont know him by looks but I suspect he was. I was briefly sponsored in the early 90s as a kid and I feel like I had posters on my walls that looked like these posts. It's wild how different the sport is but the equipment makes such a difference. Those 80s boards/ early 90s ones were so fucking heavy compared to the new boards and they did not have the pop of a modern board at all.
Yeah. On and off but the last two years I‚Äôve been getting a little more serious about it again, the stoke is back!
Cool, Procreate, Photoshop? How‚Äôd you do it?
Ive had cataract surgery but instead of the roto rooter I poop in a box and get the colon checked that way. Much more to my liking
Yep, I still have it hanging on my wall.
Yeah had a pretty long stretch where I stopped and got into surfing but the past few years Ive been getting some days in. Got my first trip out west in a long time coming up early March and really looking forward to it.
This guy‚Äôs girlfriend is your mom. And my mom. ü´§
Not flying off jumps anymore really just trying to work on pencil line carves. Sort of obsessed with getting that down now.
Oh yeah we had a couple compact film cameras not even good ones we used to beat the crap out of. Hey at least back then there was 1-hour photo so you could get your prints the next day!
Oh, I loved those pants! Prior to that I had a pair of Descant ski pants (as seen in the red jacket photos) which I couldn‚Äôt wait to get rid of cuz you know, ski pants!
East Coast. Pretty sure all of these shots were at Hunter Mountain in NY
They weren‚Äôt invented yet lol üòÇ
The gauntlets! I felt like a knight wearing those. I think they were so you could bash gates because slalom riding was a thing back then
Great! I do a lot of different training modalities, weight training with kettlebells, clubs, barbells etc, mobility work, yoga, cycling, hiking and what not. The quads will burn towards the end of the day on long runs but no aches or pains. I remember feeling like garbage after riding when I was younger because back then snowboarding was really my main activity and I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to fitness at all. I guess you can sort get away with when you‚Äôre younger to some extent.
Yeah got back into it after a long break, loving it.
Hunter Mountain in NY
East coast never got sunny enough to use it. Plus we didn‚Äôt want to look too much like Bert LamarüòÜ
Yeah, same time period. I had the Burton 165 Cruiser with the split tail then a year or two later they had the Cruze which I think I traded to a guy for the older Sims Blade in these photos
I have the same one hanging on the wall.ü§ô
Google is telling me 1989. It's a Sims Terry Kidwell 1635. Union bindings on it courtesy of the V-Plate binding adapters.

I've ridden it a couple times for spring gaper days and it's definitely an experience. I could see it being moderately "fun" in pow (where you don't really need edges), but it's terrible on groomers or hard pack. Haha. And weighs an ass load.
that deck is somewhere around 1986-88
trust me, you don't want to ride it. doesn't have any modern composites or shapes that have been built out over the past 40 years for good reason
Hell yes. Would love to see a black one. I think I've seen an orange one once.
Hey who you calling old grandpa?üòÜ
Proper tindy
Yep you had to throw one to win a halfpipe contest in late 80s. Stupid trick but 'invented airels' where banned in competition. I did them but I hated it I thought it totally lacked style.
I have this dream where I win the lotto, buy a mountain, and exclude all skiers.
I rode in the 90s and remember needing a leash at some mountains. I was turned away from the lift first time at Sun Valley for this reason. Really stupid.
I love that this was at Hunter. I love that shitty, shitty, mountain.
I had to get certified at Stowe, also remember first time I got on a lift
Dude, the boots and bindings too!
[deleted]
That's the way to do it brother. Shred on
I had one but unfortunately sold it.  Just had a custom board made with graphics inspired by my old Sims: [image](https://i.imgur.com/sFw4Iiq.jpg)
Nice, wish I still had mine. It's one board I've owned that I no longer have.
Shit dog. Steezy mom explains my genes I guess!
It definitely looked like ice coast to me.
NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE wore helmets back then!
It's a ton of fun that's for sure!
I miss regular sized halfpipes at resorts
Where did you get the plate adapters? Have the same board but it's been so on the wall for at least a decade.
That wasn't my question lol I didn't think such a board would be compatible with today's binding mounts
What is it?
I know that dream.  NotAlta.
All the east coast mountains required a leash as well
I remember when SV was only half open to snowboarders.  Same price ticket, but Seattle Ridge was closed.

My brother and I would duck the ropes anyway...
We used to hit that early on the weekends after driving 3.5 hours from LI. I now have the ability to go mid week which is really the only option!
lol i forgot about the boots! I actually still love early 2000s bindings but not 90s ones. Remember when we didnt have ratchet bindings?!
Super cool. Looks great on my iPad Pro
The black one was a 1725 Blade and I have no idea what I did with it!
It was probably 10+ years ago but if you're on the book of faces look up "V-Plates" or something to that extent. If that doesn't yield any fruitful results, look up a group called Vintage Snowboard Trader (VST) or Dig My Quiver (DMQ). Both are filled with a ton of very good shred heads and will be able to steer you in the right direction.
I had this same board as my first one, with different bindings. My first new board I had was a Ride in the mid 1990‚Äôs. The bindings are not compatible. Back then, the screw mounts were much farther apart. I ended up selling my ride when I wanted to upgrade the bindings to something more comfortable because the mounting hardware was too narrow.
oh sorry lol yea I dont even think soft boots existed back then. a lot of those bindings were just a strap over the top of your foot between your toes and ankles, and you slid your normal boot into it
It was like a weird 180 to hand plant sort of thing. He was one of  Burtons freestyle riders before the days of Craig Kelly
Kinda hucking backflip twisting invert over your shoulder where you reach down and ho-ho plant. Ugly. As people got better at them they would just slap with one hand to meet the requirement in compeition. Try not to throw up in your mouth a little: [https://youtu.be/DfvI-Q6KUe8?si=zMeFCxbm\_MDfe1Z0&t=1073](https://youtu.be/uMKsW0YOP5E?si=mch6xNyYTWqGQtIF&t=1073)
Great name!
Those Sims bindings had those U shaped wire bales (I think that‚Äôs what they called them) like they use on ski boots.
Nice! Thanks. I'll search it out.
Link says unavailable. Do you have another video?
Wow, that old Burton video brings back the memories. Pretty sure I had a copy on VHS back in the day!

I filled my gas tank and read full, this happens

So I filled my gas tank as usual, read full. Nothing so I drove to the store, did my purchase and turned it on, and I was waiting on the signal to turn green, I saw this. So what can I do. One thing for sure this never happened before. It‚Äôs a dumb question I know, but please I need some advice. Thank you.

Go drive at 130 mph, see if it knocks the fuel gauge needle back to the correct spot
Have you tried disconnecting your battery terminals?
Disconnect your battery negative lead for 5 min, then see what it does.
[removed]
It‚Äôs not that of an no run issue, you can drive it anyway but refueling it every week to be sure not to get stuck on the side of the road. You will still be able full the car when going to the gas station without problem either.
https://preview.redd.it/3g25zu6g2l1d1.jpeg?width=222&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=580324d27da172915651560d7e24b43b3f2741ef
Your tank grew. Happens in older vehicles.
[removed]
This can be the float (fuel level sensor) on the fuel pump that fucked up. Have you tried to turn it off and on again to see if he does it again?
It's a speed limiter now.
"Gas stations hate this one simple trick"
[removed]
Too fix this you'll want to pull the speedo out. Usualy2-5 screws and a pair of bolts.

The clear lense unclips. You then turn the fuel pointer to the correct location and clip cover one and reverse steps
My brothers Silverado use to do this. We traced it back to a bad ground that was spotty. Once that fault was fixed it went away. Not sure if your situation is the same but possibly.
You put too much fuel
This means your car wants you to go 127 mph
Is this half full or half empty tf
I'm kinda wondering what'll happen if you drive 128mph, what with your fuel gauge being at 127mph and all
Ok.   Try 2 quick fixes first.   
One disconnect battery for 5 mins.
Two.   Buy 2 20 oz containers of Techron concentrate.    They are great for cleaning fuel systems and messed up sensors.      Put in when car is low on gas and have to fill up again.   Put in before refueling. Run through the full tank so you don't dilute the concentrate.    Repeat if needed.  They are like 12 bucks a container.   It's the additive chevron uses in their gas, just way stronger and concentrated.     Good stuff 

Hopefully that works.
Try taking out the negative cable and putting it back a few times. That‚Äôs how i fixed my temp gauge üò¨
Try flipping the ignition off and on to the second position without starting it.  Do it several times and see if it‚Äôs just a stuck needle.  That may reset the gauge.
Thats just the extra tank
See if you can get the speedometer needle to touch the gas gauge needle.
Thanks Biden.
Your gas tank wants to go 127 mph.
I'd disconnect the positive on the battery first.

Then, try the magnet trick on the dash.

There is no need to take the chance of introducing a magnetic force to live wiring in your dash. I'm not familiar with the wiring schematic of your car. I'm just saying it couldn't hurt.
This has happened to me in my 2008 Ford Taurus all you do is you takeoff the instrument cluster Bezzle you loosen up the screws holding on the instrument cluster unplugged the wires and remove the instrument cluster once removed. Remove the plastic cover off the front and then plug the cluster back in. You can drive to a gas station and Phil the gas up all the way, and then cut the car to the on position pull the needle off of the fuel reader then push it back in where it‚Äôs touching the full line and that will reset it then all you have to do is push the plastic back on and screw down
If you messed with the cluster or replaced it, chances are you need to pop the cluster out, pop the needle off and re center it.  Depending on car, this can be a 30 minute job or 2 hour job.

or its broken and you need a new one OR your fuel gauge in pump is bad. 

  
There are lots of guides online for how to adjust your fuel gauge, mine randomly did it on my Taurus years ago.
Try the battery trick. Run it and see if it moves. If it stays the same, I'm guessing a short or a loose wiring connector on the tank.
You need to go 127mph now and get the tips to touch.
Stepper motor that moves the indicator could have died.  You could try disconnect and reconnect the battery or even cycling the key multiple times.  Sometimes it will rezero itself.  If not, they are not that difficult to replace if you can solder.  I rebuilt the entire cluster in an Equinox with steppers I got cheap on amazon
You better don‚Äôt go 125 mph for the first half of a fill-up üòÇ
You‚Äôre extra full now
Gotta do like 160 on an empty tank to try and spin it back down to the start üò±
Don‚Äôt use your phone going 130 man come on!
Sometimes when I over fill or "top off" my work truck this happens it usually just corrects itself
It wants a speed per gallon not mile
Bro before you said "double it and give it to the next person"
Now you have to push it to 127 mph so the needles can high five.
You have ~126mph of fuel now. If you can do better than 126, you unlock infinite MPG!

Hope you've got the V6 because the 4banger will take a long time to get up to 126!
In some vehicles, turn the ignition on without starting the engine while holding the odometer button down for at least 5 seconds. You should see a series of numbers,a count up, displayed. Soft reset/calibration of cluster gauges should occur.
My stupid ass would try to hit 127mph to see if I could knock it back into place ü§£
My first instinct is to hit the gas needle with the mph/kmh needle???
Schrodinger's tank.
"how much gas ya got?"

"about 125 MPH"
Try using a magnetic and rotating it back into place.
10 joke responses for every useful one.

OP, this isn't a problem that affects the driveability of the car at all, so you shouldn't worry too much about it.

The only risk is that you'll run out of gas because you didn't know it was getting low.  Bad fuel gauges aren't uncommon, and a typical way of dealing with it is to just make sure you fill up the tank every 200 miles or so.  Reset the trip odometer each time you fill up.

The actual problem is probably with the gauge itself, not the level sensor or any control module.  I don't know about this car specifically, but unfortunately on most cars it's a major pain in the butt to take out the dashboard to service the instrument cluster.  So unless one of the other actually helpful suggestions (disconnect the battery, try flipping it around with a paper clip, etc.) works, I'd suggest just getting used to it.
THIS BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY!
Well, you just have infinite gas now. But I recommend just filling your tank frequently. If you go to work farther away after 2 days, fill it up. I personally like to fill up around a half or quarter tank is gone, so I know how my normal travel affects my gas gauge as I watch that. If you do that too, it'll make it easier as I'd try not going below half if I don't know the level.
Go do 140mph, I wanna see the needles sword fight
IMO how much do you care, financially that it
Would require some balls to test.  Maybe have a jerry can in the boot, but will the fuel light still come on with like 60miles/100km to go?
200% full
Time to put a gas can in the trunk. Just reset odometer between fill ups.
My brother in Christ, you have reached 100% fuel efficiency. May we all be so lucky.
Use a strong magnet to move the dial back to the right.
Now it‚Äôs waiting for you to make the speedometer to give the fuel gauge a low five
Looks like you have 127mph worth of fuel
If it's a floating magnetic gauge it might be 180 out, they have different spots they can key into the field geometry. You can open the cluster and put it back on the stop pin if this is the case. Stepper or servo it's done for

Edit to add if the oem didn't put soft stops on the software a stepper could get that far over with a bad sender so worth verifying with a multi meter what it's actually reading
Hey now you got tank and half
Try to touch it with the odometer needle
Full tank literally üòÇ
If you drive at 126 you'll get to witness a light saber fight.
Full and a half.
Gas tank on fuck ya
Infinite gas glitch
This is how i feel after a week on the cruise.
![gif](giphy|orUDTj9Q5TMzTdB892|downsized)
Must be pretty full
That's weird...
This is a bad gauge, it has gone past the stop so it needs to be overhaul or replaced, the good news is. That it's easy to replace. Just a few screws and 1 wire harness, the bad. It's about $200.00 for a rebuilt gauge cluster on Ebay
Don‚Äôt go any slower than 127mph or the car will explode.
That means it‚Äôs ultra full
Your car noticed how expensive gas has been for you and expanded dimensions. What a blessing
extra full
Bros gas going 120+ üò≠
Why are you showing us that your going 134mph
You‚Äôve unlocked the unlimited fuel cheat.
too full
I hear u
It got a little too excited and wants to go 130mph
Looks like you have to fill it up again
To fix you need to get up to 130mph.
Magnet may help
Flick it
Hit 130mph to see if you can knock it back around to where it needs to be üëçüèª
Full tank AND a half! ü§©
You have 125 miles to e
Nice - 150% fuel remaining!
You gotta go real fast now, past 127mph and use your speedometer needle to knock your fuel needle back in place.
ü§£
I see no problem here... Your gas is now at 127 (gallons)?
You really filled it to the tippy top.
I think you put to much gas in it
May need a gauge cluster if a reset doesn‚Äôt clear this issue
Disconnect your battery for a half an hour and then reconnect and see if that doesn't fix it. Otherwise your fuel sending unit, in the tank, needs to be replaced. That sounds expensive. Good luck.
My 2016 Toyota Corolla needs to be serviced due to airbag light in.never received recall alert from a few yrs ago, now NOTHINC on the steering wheel works.
Also, the lights that turn on behind radio buttons, air controls, and PRNDL shifter are OUT. CANT SEE ANY OF THESE AT NIGHT. ODOMETER AREA IS FINE, ACTUAL RADIO IS FINE. THAT LIGHT CNTRL IS ALL THE WAY ON. MIDDLE OF CAR, ACCEPT FOR RADIO & CLOCK IS DARK AT NIGHT.

CAR IS PAID OFF. I DONT WANT TO TRADE IT IN. I DONT WANT THE NOTE.

ANY SUGGESTIONS TO WHAT THE ISSUE IS W/THINGS NOT HAVING BACK LIGHTS? ANYONE ELSE EVER EXPERIENCED AND FIXED THIS?

You‚Äôve achieved unlimited gasoline
I'd check my fuses.
Cycle through the trip meter. Should be an estimate of range remaining
Looks like you got a half tank buffer!
LoL!
Slow down bro
Wtf.. it spun backward??
2007-2011 Camry‚Äôs seem to this issue. The gas gauge fluctuates and gets stuck. It‚Äôs a cluster issue. The Empty gas light still works so at least you won‚Äôt run out of gas.
Have you used a zip tie? Try poking in back in place through the slit between the plastic and reset button. ü§üüòÇ
Obviously your fuel tank is bigger than the gauge is set for!
Achievement unlocked‚Ä¶ Unlimited Fuel
Super duper full.
Just means you have 133% fuel
Buy Tech Ron at the auto parts store. You almost certainly have a sticky float.
I think you‚Äôre getting 127 miles per gallon
Drive it for 100 miles and see if it moves or not. Then try the suggestion that fits the problem.
Now your fuel is 130mph.
Odds are its a faulty stepper motor in the gauge cluster.

You can try the "reset" thing people are suggesting by disconnecting both battery terminal connections and tapping them together then waiting 5 - 10 minutes then reconnecting to the battery, but it likely won't work, if it does it may also not be a permanent fix.
Send it!!!! I have spoken
Bro has 127 mph gallons of gas
Maybe you put too much gas in
Some crazy shit is gonna happen when you hit 127mph
126mph? That's some fast gas right there now...
120 fuel tank in a car is crazy
Just means you suddanly have another extra half a tank of fuel lol, but 2 things, try the battery disconnect, but also if possible, the motor for that gauge might be bad, so it may never move or it might wait till your close to empty to reset itself
Is "real" empty land half tank?
That just means it‚Äôs extra full.  ü§£ü§£
Man you overfilled it wayyyyy to much!!!
A break in the matrix buddy own it!
Damn bro that shit must be SUPER full
It‚Äôs a fail safe speed governor to prevent speeding at 130 mph.
Fill up get an extra half life?
It‚Äôs okay you just have half a tank extra of fuel
it's full FULL
I think it‚Äôs asking your speedometer to slap him one
![gif](giphy|N04ulekzkjwtIBUsg7)
Next time, don't fill your tank up so much
You now have 1 1/2 tanks of gas
Unlimited gas, nice.
Damn you overfilled now it's at 150% full......
Why not put it in neutral or stay in park and press the gas does the needle still move ? I never paid attention to it and pressed the gas at same time may sound stupid lol sounds safer tho
Whatever you do don't cross the beams
This is either a problem with the sending unit in the tank reporting an incorrect voltage to the cluster(gauge), or the cluster(gauge) has gone bad, or you have a chafed wire/short which is reporting an incorrect voltage.
Oh your full full then lmao
Fkn cluster man. Pain in the ass to fix
Dum assas over filled the soccer game hauler
Where we‚Äôre going, we don‚Äôt need roads.
Oh damn you unlocked the infinite gas glitch
Gas tank is stuffed and can‚Äôt eat another bite.
I've had success blowing air with a gun style blower into the trip reset hole. Many times actually.
If you can get access to a scan tool with bi-directional control you can likely perform a gauge sweep test or a ‚Äúreturn to home‚Äù procedure that will correct your gauge needle.
You filled it with premium plutonium? Rookie mistake. Camrys run fine on regular plutonium.
I think you filled it a lil too much üòÇ
125k miles. Trade it in
It shows the current gas price per 100 liters
u got some xtra gas.. or im with the dude sayin hit 130.. only fix I can fathom.. but I am no professional in this field
Bad stepper motor or you've got broken solder around the contacts on the board. Both are YouTube fixes anyone can do. I resoldered the gas gauge on the board on my truck and it works fine now.
It‚Äôs extra full.
You a prince from middle east or what? 
Now tell me the cheat code! Did you press up up down left right? Lol
This happened to me 2 days ago. Unplug your battery and let it sit for a few minutes. Mine was sitting at 30  mph. I have a Lexus, I think it‚Äôs a Toyota thing.
you have excess gas ! you need to fart some out.
You should get 1,000 miles from this tank of gas, if the gauge is correct. Hope this helps.üëç
Ah, filled it to 126% of capacity
dude what kinda car only goes to 140 mine goes to 240
Looks like you just over filled your tank.
You filled it up too much
You obviously put way too much gas in.
I saw a movie clip where they used a magnet to fix it
You overfilled it
Mr. Money bags over here ‚Äúoh I always just top it up‚Äù
Wait for the light to come on, that'll give you at least 40 miles to pitstop.

Or just fill up every 300 miles, resetting the trip counter reach time. Not worth fixing until it needs other work doing at the same time
You probably have a spare tank.
Over sFeeding! üöÄ
Now its FULL!
It‚Äôs rely full. üòù
Now for real, disconnect the battery and let it sit for 20-30 min.
You got bonus gas my friend, congrats!
Good on gas
Bad stepper motor on the gauge pod.
Time to start relying on your trip meter (reset to zero everytime you fill up) and low fuel warning light to work out your fuel tank level, rather than fuel gauge.¬†
Honda fuel economy in a camry your mechanic blessed you
Think you over filled it.
Shitts good till next year!!!
Extra gas  ‚õΩÔ∏è
Don't worry, you just have 127 mph of gas. Totally normal.
Expanding gas. It will go down.
Bro driving on borrowed time...
Get a strong enough magnet and place it on the needle
That‚Äôs what happens when you use 127 octane.
Damn dude, u overfilled the shit outta it, huh?
It‚Äôs reminding you that the gas cap is on ‚Ä¶ that side
Did you shut off gas nozzle at first click ? I've often found issues like this occur because we want to top off the tank which really isn't good for today's fuel systems.
You hit your lifetime deductible on gas. Now it is unlimited!
Got to be careful, If you had put a little more it would have been empty again
Did you fill up with 130 octane gas?
I'm sorry but that's kind of funny ü§£
You got hella gas now I guess
Keep pumping gas till it goes back to empty
It may be due to a loose ground. Lift your hood and inspect it for loose or corroded ground wires/cables.
Always look for obvious, visible stuff first
This is to recalibrate your fuel gauge if it's inaccurate. I'm not 100% sure this will work in this situation or for your particular model but it's worth giving it a shot. The worst thing that can happen would be that it accurately displays it's not working. üòÖ

-Park the vehicle on a level surface.

-Turn the ignition switch to the ‚ÄúOn‚Äù position.

-Place the odometer display into the ‚ÄúODO‚Äù mode.
Turn off the ignition switch.

-Depress and hold the ‚ÄúODO/TRIP‚Äù button while turning the ignition switch to the ‚ÄúOn‚Äù position. Hold the ODO button for two seconds.

-Release and press the ODO button three more times within five seconds, example: (Release-Press-Release-Press-Release-Press and Hold.) Continue to hold the ODO button for at least five seconds until the leveling information is displayed on the odometer.

-Release the button.

-Depress and hold the ‚ÄúODO/TRIP‚Äù button until the odometer display confirms that reset has begun (odometer reads ‚Äú1‚Äù).

-Once reset is complete, the odometer returns to normal.

-Release the button. Turn off the ignition.
You have 126 gallons of gas left in the tank now.  

  
Karsh
Use a magnet and it will move the needle.
Can you do a gauge sweep test on this? Literally Had a friend last week with the gas needle not reading between E and F, did the gauge sweep, all the needles moved except the fuel gauge(it just wiggled below the E, told him he needs a cluster
Don't top off the tank
Gas companies don‚Äôt want you to know this one simple trick
Prolly put booze in it ü§™ it‚Äôs drunk
You have 127 mph worth of gas left
Filled it up too fast
Hell yea, 130 gallon tank ftw
It fainted‚Ä¶ this the first time you filled it?
filled er‚Äô up a lil too high
Gahdamn your fuels going 127mph
Mine shows Empty with occasional correct level. I just reset my odometer on fill ups. Took a fuel jug to determine how many miles to empty 327.5 miles on a tank. Fuel level sending issue. $$$ can‚Äôt fool me ü§£üñïüèºüòé Edit: 2012 Colorado. Also had ABS light on that was the sensor that looks through the fluid in the reservoir. A good cleaning fixed it. ü§™ü§™
Try going 220km/h .... Maybe the big needle can reset the fuel needle ü§£
Overfilled that‚Äôs all
No worries, just go off your mileage to refuel,
You filled the overflow tank. Kind of a flex with all that fuel storage
Slow down bruh
You're driving 127 in the other dimension, sick!
[deleted]
You have 132mph of gas in your tank.
Bro unlocked the secondary half tank
Honda needs a fuel sender, more than likely a fuel pump assembly
Just keep rocking it as is boss, track your fuel you will be fine
idk man, I wouldnt mind 128mph of gas in my tank tbh XD

If you could I would just open up the faces of the gauges with the car off and flip it lightly by hand back too E. then see what it does
Damn, you're brave taking a picture while doing 127..
It's doubling down on pointing to the side your fuel cap is
The fuel tank sender/fuel gauge is faulty
Your gas tank goes to 127? Cool, mine only goes to 88.
You put in 50% to much then what the tank wanted
We paid close to 900 mid vancouver island and the house has multiple bids. And it Needs a new roof and lots of finishing work
This seems the only reasonable solution
What if the needle gets stuck at 130mph and he is unable to stop
‚ÄúOfficer I can explain‚Ä¶ Reddit told me to‚Äù
This comment is not getting enough attention
OP try this, Im curious now üòÇ
Any answer that‚Äôs not this belongs in r/askashittymechanic
This is the way.
This is the only correct solution
You'll need a strategy to reach 130 before the gas consumed spins the fuel gauge out of the way.
World's most epic high five.

This fixed my issue on my DC5
I always reset the odometer after a gas up. That‚Äôs how my dad taught me, just in case the fuel gauge breaks.¬†
[removed]
Along with this...reset the trip odometer and fill to "it shuts off the pump" every time.  Then when you go enough miles for "about half a tank used" fill up again and reset it again.
Was this the night before Steve Rogers got the Super Soldier Serum?

You win the comments ü§£
A piece of wire through the odo reset button hole can flip it back around
this is probably your best bet
You can usually fix this with a magnet, without taking it apart
Depends. Are you a pessimist or an optimist?
Engages the flux capacitor
I‚Ä¶ read this as ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù and was deeply concerned for the entire post.
This is the way
You mean the negative? Then positive
I also have done this, but it was to replace the cluster light bulbs that had burned out on my 2004 Tundra. 

That dash the way it was, I couldn't push it back in without the plastic/glass cover, which meant I had to approximate positions of needles from when I turned off the car. It wasn't quite right. 

Still drives. Just off by an 8th of a tank, 4 mph, and a few rpms. Been driving it like this for 10 years.
HOW DID YOU GET THIS FAR INTO YOUR COMMENT WITHOUT REALISING YOU ARE SHOUTING?
Mine had the same problem. Dealership mechanic worked for two straight days only to find a wire that intermittently touched the firewall where it had rubbed through the insulation. ($0.00 deductible warranty plan paid for it.üòÅ)
2010 Toyota Camry LE, it‚Äôs literally in the post
Apparently someone can‚Äôt read a speedometer . It‚Äôs at 127. That‚Äôs enough of a difference to keep a lot of $$$ in your wallet if the heat pulls you over for speeding. It‚Äôs the difference between stunt driving and being able to drive your car home and keep it out of the impound yard for two weeks
Ludicrous speed
Unlimited fuel and unlimited speed üëåüòÇ
Make sure the flux capacitor is topped off first, that way he can always go back, and that won't be a concern.
Simply continue driving at that rate until fuel tank is empty. Two birds, one stone!
At least op has unlimited gas to go 130
It wont matter, once he hits 88MPH he's time travelin'......

DC5??? Pics????
Like‚Ä¶ the airplane?
I do that too, but mostly it‚Äôs so that I‚Äôd notice if my fuel economy suddenly goes down. It could indicate an issue. It‚Äôs probably irrational because it never has in many years‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ old habits die hard.
Even to monitor for issues - my dad taught me the same, and I remember at one point his old truck went from 600km a tank to 400km a tank, but still seemed to be running fine - there was some issue with the throttle body, they fixed it and everything was good. If he hadn‚Äôt tracked his mileage he never would have known.
Dad's 1987 has 125 miles on it's Odometer
How do I do that lol
Y‚Äôall have working gauges? We use a stick to see how much fuel we got let
We drove one of our car‚Äôs about 40k miles using the fill it and reset the trip meter method‚Ä¶
This cuts down on depreciation as well
Mine broke and I ran out of gas, a minute later I did think, huh, I was at half a tank for a while lol
That‚Äôs some funny shit!
I resemble that remark.
Humor is one of the only things we have left.
He got a solid answer already. What‚Äôs the harm in a joke?
U can drive it, just calculate miles per fill up with the trip odometer
You can drive it just fill up more often and use your trip gage to remind you to fill up. At 200 miles fill up and see how many gallons you put in. Then subtract that from your Gas tank size.
You can definitely drive the car
The little fuel needle is just a convenience feature, it is not vital to the operation of your car. There's still fuel in your car and it will still arrive at your engine and it will still go kerchunka kerchunka kerchunka and make you go fast.

Just go refuel it every now and then as you always would. The pump will tell you how much you're putting in there. Google says you have a 70 liter / 18 gallon tank. So if you fill it up you just keep track of how long you've been driving with the little trip button and keep in mind the trip length and how much fuel that used and you can just do the math yourself. 

On my old car I'd get about 600km / 370 miles out of a full tank so if I had this issue I'd head for a gas station after about 400 km / 250 miles. How far you can personally go on a tank of gas depends on your car and your driving style and your city driving vs highway driving so that's entirely up to your own needs. Just drive 200 miles and refuel and see how much fuel that took and extrapolate from there.

...or fix it. But definitely don't just get scared of driving. The fuel will arrive in your engine.
Reset the trip meter every fill up. Fill up before it hits 300 miles. EZPZ
Try disconnecting the battery terminals
Why wouldn‚Äôt you drive it? Just be careful about the gas level.
Should probably just abandon the car and buy a new one
How often do you normally fill it up? Friend had this issue and didn‚Äôt care to fix it, he just filled up once a week and was fine
I'm disappointed u were downvoted for asking the right questions
Why not drive it? You know it has gas.. a full tank, at that.. just fill it up every couple hundred miles like normal, except you have to go by miles instead of the gauge. The gauge doesn't affect anything at all mechanically.
Drive it - be paranoid about filling it up.  I bet there's an iPhone app that can help try replace your gas gauge... should be possible to calculate based on last time at a station, miles driven and alert when you hit the 150-200 miles mark.
Man you got obliterated for no reason.

The Techron has been known to fix the stuck fuel sensor or the corvettes.   Worth a shot for 20bucks.     It's just a bunch of undiluted Techron additive
This. Negative first.
No. I said what I meant.

You only have to remove the positive terminal. You do not have to remove both. If you remove the negative 1st or just, you can still make a ground contact and still have a "hot" connection. Always remove the positive first. This eliminates the chance of accidental grounding.
Damn I'm blind ü§£
Don't forget! You can't just stop. You have to slow down first.

JATO ASSIST
Diesel powered?
787 Dreamliner standard reset.
Don't let it die. I noticed I had to fix something ASAP because i do the same thing. I usually got 200miles per half tank (where I then refill) on a car I just bought and suddenly noticed my gas was only lasting 100 miles per half a tank. Fixed a part and now it's back up to 220 miles per half tank. I dont know how anyone operates otherwise. I'd never know how far I can push my car with the gaslight on if I didn't do this either. So many benefits to it. My car has two gauges so I reset one every refill and the other every oil change
I do the same thing. Mainly because my Chevy silveraydoh has always had a needle issue. 

But I keep track of all my cars miles this way and notice if there's a big drop in fuel economy this way.  

It's smart to do. In my Chevy it's a necessity though or I'd never know when it's time to gas up lol
I cannot START this habit. Idk, I‚Äôve done that maybe three times and I cannot for the life of me remember to reset it until I‚Äôm a quarter tank in (I fill every half tank) do you/anyone have tips? advice? Insults? Idk I‚Äôm open minded
I suck out the gas and count the seconds until I get a mouthful. 
I swish it around for a free mouthwash and then spit it back so I don't waste it.
[deleted]
I had to do this for like 10 years with my ranger until the fuel pump died and I couldn‚Äôt avoid fixing it anymore.
I used to fill up religiously at the 400km mark on an old car with that issue
A 4 cylinder camry can *easily* go 350-400 miles on a full tank. A V6 I would guess 300-350. 

Try using a really strong magnet to coax the needle back around. If it flings back to that position the gauge cluster will probably have to be replaced. I‚Äôm pretty sure that isn‚Äôt a full dash pull to do, either.
Some cars had a stick you'd put in the gas tank to get a read on how much you had. Kind of like a dipstick in oil?¬†

This I drove a s10 for 5 years  using trip odometer as a gas gauge
I did this for several years with a Malibu.  You should always carry a gas can.  Because eventually, something will go wrong, either you don't fill up the tank all the way by accident, or for some reason you used more gas than usual.  Gas stations price gouge you for a gas can, because they know there's only 1 reason you need one right now.  So carry a can, even if there's nothing in it.
I fill it up once a week, I don‚Äôt drive often, only to and from work 4 days a week and the commute is twenty minutes per trip. On this day however it was a monthly get everything done day.
I don't think they were downvoted for asking questions. 

I think they were downvoted for thinking that they needed to take the car off the road just for a faulty guage that could be mitigated by simply keeping an eye on their mileage.
>The Techron has been known to fix the stuck fuel sensor...

"The Techron" sound like a faction of Transformers.

"For millennia the Techron ran and maintained Cybertron. Usually found "behind the scenes" they were indispensable and essential part of the planet. 

Unfortunately neither the Decepticons nor Autobots respected them. Both factions largely ignored them, and treated them like "lesser" or "inferior" beings. This ultimately lead to the decimation of Cybertron.

The Techron were peacful and neutral in the civil war found themselves always caught between the warring sides. Neither side was cared about the "incidental damaged" inflicted on the Techron. Eventually their numbers were reduced to the point they non longer could keep Cybertron properly functioning leading to the eventual collapse of all systems and eventually the impetus for the evacuation of the planet."
And if your wrench or socket touches the chassis as you remove positive terminal?
Dangerous advice. You should read up on current flow. The only way you will get an accidental grounding is by touching the positive terminal while the negative is still connected. Remove negative first and the circuit is broken safely.
You would be if they pinched you doing 50kms over instead of 47. 47 would still be a huge hit to the wallet but nothing compared to a stunt driving charge
It‚Äôs the suddenly becoming stationary. That‚Äôs what kills you.

Just out of curiosity, what was the repair?
Crazy thing, I have this issue as well speak,
400 miles for a full tank and only getting like 250-300 for a full tank. I‚Äôve asked here but nobody could come up with an answer so I thought I was going crazy

Do you know how I can reset mine? I have a 2014 ford escape titanium
I‚Äôm having an issue now where my mpgs went from ~10 down to ~8 (figured it was because we were hauling more, not driving the truck without a trailer anymore, shrugged it off) but this past week we‚Äôre down to ~4.5 mpg. Took a trip we‚Äôve taken many times, usually it‚Äôs 1/4 tank each way, this week it was a half a tank each way‚Ä¶ tranny issues are fun üôÉ
How about don‚Äôt let the gas light come on.
Spitters are quitters
I mean the answers are there you might just have to swim through stuff sometimes.
Give your balls a tug.
Man I used to have a motorcycle without a fuel gauge and I ran out of gas like twice a year. If my car fuel gauge broke now I'd probably gas up every hundred miles now that I have responsibility.
Did this with my Silverado until the fuel pump died. Unsuccessfully calculated a couple times.
I‚Äôve seen a video where they stick a little stiff wire up through the gap where that long button is to flick the needle back to where it needed to be
my 2021 sienna can go around 600 miles or more per tank.  current running average right now is 36.5mpg.  It has an 18 gallon tank.
Bit of wire is good because you can bend and flex it.
You could literally just fill it up every other day and never worry about it until you have the money. It‚Äôs not a big deal, fix it yourself even, do research on YouTube.
My 2010 Camry SE was absolutely bullet proof but the volume knob would randomly turn the volume way up while you were trying to turn it down. This one is slightly more annoying. Id just live with it, it‚Äôs not worth paying to chase it down if it doesn‚Äôt fix it with the diy fixes suggested here. Just fill it up and reset trip A and drive it no more than 350 miles and you‚Äôll be completely fine, if you have a v6 do 300.
If your ground is connected or not, you're going to ground out. It doesn't matter. Your wrench is completing the circuit bypassing the need for the negative terminal. Thus, the need for caution

I ran out of gas on my motorcycle with a fuel gauge Lmaoo
Sensor is malfunctioning inside the fuel tank, or some connector is bad and giving this reading.

If you force it to a different position it will just be wrong anyway in another position and when whatever else that is broken is fixed, it will not be where it should be. 

This could be simple as some contact cleaner at the connectors on the tank or behind the dash.
AWD or FWD? I have the AWD and have averaged (according to the cope calculator on the dashboard) about 34.7mpg over the last 20,000 miles. 

I do a lot of mixed driving and sitting around waiting in school pickup lines for the reasons I own a minivan. Nothing gets good gas mileage while idling but I‚Äôll take roughly 540 miles per tank.
This and the ‚Äúspeed mitt limits are like herpes‚Äù are my two favorite quotes from him

Awd. If i hypermile i can get 38 to 40 mpg

[removed]
I fully admit I have a heavy foot and do a lot of mixed-cycle driving (with a fair amount of idling). That said, any other non-hybrid, AWD minivan would be getting low to mid 20s for gas mileage. 

I think the Chrysler gets a little better gas mileage for frequent idling, being a plug-in hybrid, but it‚Äôs still a Chrysler. 

And as the wise Carfucius said ‚ÄúJourney of few miles, still Chrysler product‚Äù

Did someone drill a hole in my gas tank?

My guess is yes. Looks like they either got spooked and stopped or had a very dull bit and couldn‚Äôt break through the tank. I‚Äôm ruling out road debris simply because of how perfect the hole seems to be and how hard it would have had to hit to make that hole, it would have still been in there when you checked it.
Looks like it

Source: I failed to drill something once and it looked like that mark
They tried and failed for what ever reason. Battery died in the drill? They got spooked?

Sand the area and clean with lacquer thinner then apply a plastic  or fiber glass 2 x 2 inch patch repair. Use a cloth to get into the hole. 
It should be fine after that.
Looks like he needs to sharpen his drill bit
Yes
Did you see any shavings on the ground.  The wetness is from spraying lubricants while drilling.
They'd have self immolated if they weren't using a brushless drill. 

Just clean the area and pack it with JB Weld epoxy. It'll be fine.
That is definitely a drill hole. Domed inner, swarf on the surface shoulders.
Looks wet, so it may have a tiny hole in it, but it might be external moisture. Also even if it looks like an attempted drilling it could be a manufacturing fault. Does it smell like it's gas on the outside or not?
This is going to sound stupid but as a worker at a dealer in a sorta sketch area, would there be a possibility of a bullet nearby? 

Of course wouldn't be a direct hit, but we've had a loaner car shot (probably from a distance) that caused some slight centralized damage like this. Maybe from a ricochet.
Either drill or richochet bullet
Imagine laying under a car, doing something that makes sparks, and then pouring gasoline all over yourself just to trade for a few crack rocks.
The discoloration and texture matches the surrounding area a bit too closely. If it were recently drilled I'd expect it to look different
Wonder how practical it is to steal 225 lbs of gasoline through a tiny hole.
Someone tried.
Attempted.
Is it empty???
he definitely tried
Has this been replaced/patched before or is there just a mark like that on it?
Yup, someone tried to drain your tank
They attempted to steal your gas but gave up halfway through due to having a bit worth fuck all
How did you find that?
Those with Husky or Ryobi bits know this feel

Drill bit was dull.
Looks like it. Had this happen at the dealership I work at. After hours someone came in and drilled a hole in the tank of a brand new truck. Judging by the mess, they weren't prepared for the amount of gas they got.
Someone definitely tried to
On today's episode of "Why I Hate Crackheads"
100%, I drill into metal alot.... my guess is idiot probably went too fast, dulling the bit and they just got paranoid it was taking too long
Looks like the battery on the drill died lol
I've seen it before, and yes, they did.
[deleted]
I guess so. Please check the rest of the tank and surrounding areas.
That‚Äôs not a hole it‚Äôs a mole!
Not completely
I think I see some of his pubes, see if you can have them tested for DNA. I‚Äôm guessing he wasn‚Äôt trying to steal your gas, but instead that hole was as deep as he needed, and he was just down there for some privacy.
I doubt that this is what happened because it‚Äôs really difficult to explain how it would have gotten there, but that‚Äôs what a bullet splash in a harder metal looks like.
Everyone is saying it's a drill, and they tried to steal you gas, but I don't think so. Even if the drill was dull or they were spooked as many suggested, why is the hole so dirty? It should be fresh Shiney metal. Also if you zoom In, there is a + stamped into it. Doesn't look like a philipps though. Definitely doeesnt look like a drill bit. I think you caught road debris, and the wet around it and dirty hole are from a very small gas leak you now have. Also there is a second mark to the right, not as deep but similar size. 

I would also say you have had an oil leak for quite a while.
Well see Bob what happened here was felonious act upon your life in which case someone wanted that ass dead and was drilling into your fuel tank if I were you I would take good care and watch my six
That or a pot hole and you bottomed out but it's pretty suspicious
Electric drill plus gasoline poring all over once tank is drilled through , blazing fire ?
N-n-*noo*.

![gif](giphy|11Xc3nOtJcb8Aw)
Am I the only that thinks this isn't a drill hole. Admittedly if does look like one. But do you know how long it would take to get 15-20 gallons of gas (possibly and easily more) out of a hole that size . Not fast at all... 

Not to mention carrying 20 or more gallons of gasoline down a street..... 

Logistically speaking. this just doesn't even possibly make sense. At all.  Still can't say what that is actually from because does look like drill caused it. 
But I really highly doubt it
Signs point to yes.
Put it in reverse Terry!
lol that's an interesting patch job
It appears so. That's definitely a marking from a drill, lucky they didn't get through because that's an expensive job
Who the hell drills a hole in a gas tank?
Jb Weld da fugg outta that thing lol
Possibly Stolen drill and drill bit and the drug addict didn‚Äôt realize he had stolen a left handed drill bit.
Older cars and trucks have drain plugs in the tanks, its hard to tell in the picture if that is the tank itself or a metal scuff plate protecting the tank. The fact it has some kind of paint on it means whatever happened, whoever did it decideded to mitigate rust and painted it with something.  If it was a plug, it could have broken off attempting to drain it.
Nope.  That's not a hole.
Manufactures switched to plastic tanks because the lock ring holing the sending unit didn‚Äôt corrode off fast enough.
was i the only person who looked at this photo and thought it was a very blurry african grey parrot?
Shot
? reverse in drill the Was
Looks like a high velocity impact dent to me. Yes it‚Äôs called a gas tank, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs as thick as tank armor. That looks over a quarter inch deep, and the interior doesn‚Äôt appear to be cleaner/resurfaced as you‚Äôd see with material removal from drilling. I could be wrong but that‚Äôs my take.
I've seen this damage from a wheel bearing blowing up, and the ball bearings were glowing red hot bouncing under the car. Car came in on the hook from a bearing failure and found a ball stuck in the gas tank. When I popped it out, the mark in the tank looked like this. And yes, the customer declined having me apply something to strengthen the compromised area in the tank.
I had a tank get punctured once do t know how very random but it happened
Yup
Junkyard tank?
OP got enemies fr
Are we even sure we are looking at a gas tank? Seems a bit too thick, looks more like a corner support with the folded material. 

Any agreement?
I don't get why someone would go after the gas in the tank instead of taking the cats. Gas is way harder to transport. Maybe a broke meth head was low on fuel, lol.
Your suppose to just spike it with an ice pick
I have a cut in my transmission that looks an awful lot like a angle grinder that accidentally hit the wrong place, whether it be a production error or a bad mechanic i cant say
Ok. I'm dumb. Given common consensus is yes, Why would someone do this? Just out of spite?
Yeah i mean they even bent the strap over for more room  drop it clean it out drill it tap it ü´°
It was me.
Better your gas tank than your wife.
My question is why were you looking at your gas tank?  I have not looked at one in all of my life.
It also looks like a lot of effort when they could have just gone in for the filler tube and sucked the fuel out that way.

It looks to me like the car was running at high speed and rock was bouncing and hit the pan. A lot of cars have undermount guards in this area for this reason
Either that, or he had the Drill in Reverse and couldn't figure out why it was taking so long.
I feel like this may have already been said, but maybe the drill was in reverse?
Or, or they had the drill in reverse.
or the drill was in reverse
A Darwin award for using such a dull bit that it ignites the tank would be some shit.
Should have used a dewalt titanium nitride coated drill bit, it would have drilled through that like butter****
Can confirm. That's the point at my job where I grab a new bit.
Gas tanks are thin sheet metal, not an 1/8" thick. The sheet metal would only be around .020 of an inch. So, I'm thinking it's more likely a dent than a drill mark.
Are you the one who tried to steal his gas ?
I found the culprit!
I worked for Boeing. Drilled thousands of holes. Can confirm.
Just drill on and on and on and on
Jb weld works good for this aswell
It's fine how it is made of metal
maybe it made too many sparks and thief got spooked by the possibility to turn into a torch
He's stealing gas. It's not his drill bit, he has no clue they can even get dull, let alone be sharpened.
Why would you need lube? Isn't it mild steel?
Probably realized it was a diesel and stopped.
While there is always a chance of fire with flammable materials it's not likely in that situation. While gas is flammable it's mainly the vapor that is the issue as far as ignition is concerned. It put it at 80 fine 20 fire ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It looks‚Ä¶ patched? Is someone repeatedly draining and patching OP‚Äôs gas tank?
There is a tiny hole, it is wet from the gas, I then also sprayed krud kutter must for rust and tried cleaning to see it better.
I do agree that the act is shitty. However drilling metal doesn‚Äôt make sparks.
Fuel tanks are plastic.
100%. If it were recently drilled the indentation would be shiny, smooth, and clean looking. It wouldn't have the same grimy patina that the rest of the tank has.
I sprayed must for rust gel on it and sanded around before that pic. Maybe that changed it.
You‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be easier to siphon it
It was being towed for another reason (spark plug blew out the engine) and the tow truck driver noticed it while strapping it up.
Went through a 10 pack and still not halfway through.
Came looking for this and I got it
Quoted $2500 for replacement. What would they have gotten, $20 worth of gas :(
Probably left because you had oil in your gas tank.
I sprayed it with must for rust and sanded around it. Probably why it‚Äôs so mucky looking.
There's a video of that happening to someone at a shop. Sets the entire bay on fire
That‚Äôs interesting because I did have a wheel bearing seize up on that side of the truck a couple years back. The bearing seized and ripped the whole rear differential casing. I had to get a spindle welded back on, then track down a new axle that was also broken in half.
No parked in the city.
Why not slash the tires or put something in the gas tank though?
It‚Äôs a metal 37 gallon gas tank. For a ford, it was leaking gas, about a cup over night.
Or an attempt at a catalytic converter perhaps?

Or maybe you just ran over some road debris.
[deleted]
new cars dont allow that but you could easily drained the tank from below.
Amazing how a rock or other object kicked up left such a perfectly circular dent /s

Someone tried to drill it.
You think so?
Right, because a random rock or bit of mishapen metal bouncing up and hitting a metal tank at speed is definitely going to leave a perfectly circular dent. 

That looks like a drill mark.
*agressive polishing*
Meth is a potent substance
The bit was in the chuck backwards
Electric screwdriver?
"Is the drill in forward, Steve?" said the master plumber to the slow-learning apprentice plumber, who was taking forever to drill a hole.
I've did this while trying to dimple the barrel of an AR15 for installing a gas block. Drill for a bit. Realize the drill isn't doing anything. Drill longer. Get pissed and change bits. Go to drill with the new bit and realize I'm in reverse.
Must have been Australian using American drill. I hear everything spins the other way down under.
Yeah, someone would have to be stupid to do this and not realize it for a while!

*looks around nervously*
They even used a oil type lube to keep it cool lol
Sounds methed up...¬†
Definitely in reverse.

Both the drill and the drill user were on meth...And in reverse.
Drill was fine. Operator was in reverse.
Or, or, or the drill was going forward but had a left hand bit
I felt this.
Could have been anti-clockwise.
You could sharpen them but fuck it right?
Most tanks in the last few decades have been made out of plastic, if not all. No sparks involved with tank damage in the instance of a collision and I'm sure other reasons, cost probably being on the list.
This is an older tank. Some of the older truck tanks were thicker.
Depends on the car
No it was me
I still got it but I just used the fill cap instead

I've never used JB weld on plastic. I guess my fear would be that the plastic would flex and pop the JB weld out? IDK? I never used it. How about you? Have you HB welded plastic before? It would be good to know for reference.
Probably shouldn‚Äôt have picked the flint drill bit.
I dunno, I'm not sure people willing to steal gasoline have a lot of safety concerns about the process.
What are you drilling with that creates sparks?
That would require common sense
I thought most gas tanks nowadays were plastic
yeah, but heat/spark management or whatever around flammable vapor while on drugs yada yada.
They need lube for when they got caught.
Gas vaporizes very quickly and the drill would also likely be warm which would help vaporize whatever gas hit the drill.  Sparks from the brushes in the drill could ignite it then.
I was thinking this. It looks like a hole was drilled and then patched.
Maybe so,  but that has to be one sneaky bastard to be draining it on a regular basis, risking that op would notice that the fuel keeps disappearing
Yup, someone drilled it and gave up
Using a brushed drill does, though.  I was one lift away at a shop when that exact thing happened.
Modern ones yes. This isn't a modern vehicle. You can tell by the frame holding the tank.
Drills are using electricity.
2001 ford. It‚Äôs metal.
Even then... 30 gallons of gas is impossible to carry without some impressive storage tanks.
Could very well be the aftermath of that incident that just never got noticed
Ok, I understand
Im 90% sure its from an angle grinder or similar cutting tool, as i do a lot of metal work, and in my country cat deletes are very rare not to mention my cat is still there and unharmed, most likely what happened was when a mechanic was fixing the exhaust they accidently hit the trans.
Far out. I'm gonna tape $20  to my tank and say just take this, no drill.
Why can't they sypthon anymore?
Not even new new cars.  I had a 92(I think) Cutlass Ciera I tried siphoning gas out of after the engine blew and I couldn‚Äôt do it through the fill hole.
I mean go into the filler pipe as in the plastic or rubber connector from underneath. Perhaps a cheap scissor jack may be required, but would get you in without too much effort and a hand held siphon would do the extraction, or perhaps a vacuum pump. Less mess, more fuel extracted and not as noisy as drilling.
Okay Mr. Know it all, then why are you on reddit asking?
You seem like the type of person who deserves having the gas tank drilled through. Hopefully next time it goes all the way through.
Rofl
That‚Äôs methed up man
Or possibly a left handed drill?
As we say down under "lefty tighty"
This thread explains so much about my last dentist.
Or, they were holding a drill with a right hand bit in their left hand
Nah, more likely counter-clockwise.
Yeah I would if I paid for them, but company provides them so it's easier to just grab a new one.. and arguably cheaper for the company as well
Not sure where you‚Äôre getting this from. I have three cars the oldest being 90‚Äôs and the newest being 10‚Äôs. All of them have metal tanks. 

Maybe Japanese cars but certainly not European or American.

Oof rush order, this is the best I can do
Yeah nowI do maintenance and it‚Äôs much better.
Shhhhhhh
It's metal, not plastic üòÜ
I was backing a work truck onto a barge in rural Alaska and backed over a welded  pad eye and tore a 3 in hole in the fuel tank. So I had some jb weld in the boat and figured I didn‚Äôt have anything to loose. I cleaned it up as best as I could, and buttered it up with 2 kits and cleaned up the fuel. Let it sit over night and filled up the tank the next day and it held with no leaks! I never said a word and i worked there for another year and it was still going strong
JB weld make a specific plastic bonder specifically for plastic and it works very well.I have yet to try it on gas tanks though.
JB Weld bonds quite well to plastic.  It lacks tensile strength as it's weakness, but as a filler for that, it would work well, IMO.
I‚Äôve used jb weld on the side of a Chrysler radiator. Both ends of the radiator were fucking plastic. Guess where a hole blew through? The jb weld never failed. Kept using the car for several years after
The drill bits used in Flint michigan are rather effective. I believe it was user error. ;)
They are, but judging by the crust on that frame crossmember, this isn't a modern truck.
Maybe they stopped because they realized this one is metal.
Well people do it everyday across this country. It's just not likely. Of course there is a possibility again just not likely.
I watched my coworker weld some exhaust next to a bucket of gas.

He set the gas on fire. I had to put that shit out, used a cardboard box lmao
You can tell by the way that it is.
True.
And that's how you lose $20 and a gas tank
Zip tie a spent shotgun cartridge to the tank.  They should take the hint.
Try a sign that says "Sanitary tank", instead
Most new cars have anti-siphon screens in the pipe to prevent the siphoning device from getting to the gas.

Actually was anti clockwise but also phase reversed.
Depends on which side of the pond
Every car üöò be owned in the past 20 years had plastic gas tanks.
Most stopped doing metal tanks in the mid 80s
What cars exactly?
Or it was in reverse
Then he should just weld it. Would take 10 seconds with a MIG.

üî•üî•üî•
They also make a specific gas tank formula
I have pulled many a plastic tank with tank straps more rusted than that. Plastic tanks have been the norm for quite a while now.
A quick smothering can do the trick, even if you use a flammable object.
Gotya. Make it a $50
They can't read.
Thanks for answering. Gas theft isn't very common in my country, so that's probably why I haven't heard of them.
The screens are there to prevent gas from pouring out if the vehicle rolls over. They have the side effect of also preventing siphoning.. but they are primarily a safety feature not an anti-theft one.
Dredrick Tatum?
Last of the Metheecans
Righty tighty until righty loosey.
Man idk, I‚Äôm thinking it was in reverse
Do they have a Tig and the knowledge to remove the tank?  (X)
Yeah, well, that hole would be through the tank if it was plastic. You can drill through a tank with a dull bit all day, it just melts its way through
Yessir!
Give em an inch they'll take yer whole car.
it is called anti siphoning screen for a reason. the screen has holes and wont stop gas from flowing back out when flipped.
No need in all the extra work. Just weld it as is. Gas and all in it. 


/s obviously. Please don‚Äôt do that
No but they have a Hobart Handler and a devil-may-care attitude.
Not arguing that. Although the plastic tanks use significantly thicker material than the metal ones and the hole looks pretty deep. Just stating that plastic tanks have been around since easily the mid 2000's and the rust on the strapping is not a good gauge of age of the vehicle.
"Modern" can also mean different things to different people. I would not call my 2008 necessarily "modern" compared to say, a 2020.
If you're lucky maybe they bought a slim Jim with the 50 and didn't break a window

Jesus fuck LMAO
Underrated comment. Overvalued ex wife
Took all night to find the leak in 4,000‚Äô of pipe
Firing up new compressed air system, and never would have found the leak without waiting for the rest of the job to shut down. 
Bet you could hear that leak
That welder gave zero fucks. No inspections or was it only a percent?
Some rock solid qc
We couldn't find a leak 2 days a electricians dad had one of those FBI listing kinda headset found it in an hour it was in the pipe not one fitting
Why didn't you just look there first?
There are all sorts of smoke, smells and other marking methods to trace leaks in pipe networks of varying kids. Apparently peppermint is a good for tracing with smell. You decrompress the network and then charge it up again but with peppermint misting at the intake vent of the compressor.
That weld looks like putty. I'm no professional but it looks a little cold.
The welder should have seen this when finished. That guy needs to get the boot.
I used to work in software with these guys. 

https://www.ecoplant.com/

They detect leaks as well as lots of other stuff.
We use the UE System's ultrasonic gun on site here.
A leak like that, you would hear when you walked into the building through the unit, and be able to pinpoint it in 2 minutes or less.
We use the 9000. Great for air leaks, bearings, steam traps, and electrical issues...all you need to do is have it set for the right frequency.
Oof
Is there any way to run smoke through a pressurized line the same way that they run dye through plumbing to find leaks? This would at least let you narrow down the search area.
Piss test tomorrow to find the r tard lol
Pull his certs.  Leaks when sticking is understandable but a leak at 12 o'clock with tig is shameful.
So the weld tore or cracked? Or did it blow out under pressure? Both?
Former pipe fitter (plumbing/fire sprinkler).. did you guys not use pressurized air first to hear it.. or add a scent to the air in the line to smell it?
It‚Äôs always in the last place you look
Oops missed a spot lol weld looks good around the rest. Don't forget your mirror!
Finally found the leak in one of my gas lines.

And yes, the threads have nothing to do with the gas sealing surfaces, but some made it near the outer edge and was just enough to keep it from leaking too much.


This is why I can't stand most rural homes. Always something done wonky.
Go to every fitting with a spray bottle of soapy water? Maybe?
That welder needs to be fired immediately
That little guy was done at 4:00 PM on a Friday.
Glass jar with charcoal and straw, make two holes, two plastic hoses light the straw using torch, and blow into one hose. Easy smoke machine.
Man, you guys really need an ultrasonic leak finder. Theres cheaper options than the fluke one that work fine
Reminds me of my sprinkler fitting days. We had a leak somewhere  in a giant apartment complex and couldnt find it forever. Ended up pumping peppermint extract into the system and checked every apartment until we smelled it. Good times.
It‚Äôs always in the last place you check‚Ä¶
Throw that spearmint oil in the system and smell that bitch out
This person started their welding career in a muffler shop!
Why is there no weld sticker? Unless it‚Äôs on the bottom
If you fill the building with soapy water it‚Äôs much easier to find this type of leak.
[Fluke ii900 Industrial Acoustic Imager](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/product/industrial-imaging/sonic-industrial-imager-ii900)

It uses an array of 64 microphones on the back of the unit to locate hissing air leaks, even with normal ambient plant noise. Little bit pricey, tho.
Not with everyone working, but once the site shut down it was super obvious
TSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
In every code iv seen it's written right in it that the WELDER must visually inspect every weld when completed. The welder gave zero fucks in multiple ways, 1) not inspecting the weld, and 2) not multipassing a socket weld which is required by the manufactures and 99% of the codes that allow socket welds.
Correction they only fucked up the 1 way. When zoomed in they did multipass the weld just very poorly.
I remember as an apprentice, we needed help welding, and instead of putting me on to weld (when I had the certs and everything), we asked a different contractor who was on the job with us doing something different if we could borrow a guy for a week.

The results was a guy who did not give a shit and we had like 6+ leaks on a line.

Still finished on time though but our foreman was PISSED off.
Mistakes happens lol I wouldn‚Äôt shit on the man like that
He‚Äôs never gonna live this one down. I was there until 10pm, and it‚Äôs never good when the GF is fixing welds in the middle of the night.
Solid rock bottom
Shoulda used swagelok
It's always a good feeling when the material is bad and not my weld
It is always in the last place you look
Water?
Sour gas works well for this too
Not cold. But definitely fucked
Love the unit...pondered buying a refurbished unit for my own.
Idk, a Halloween smoke blower comes to mind to me.
I don't think you need to necessarily pull his certs.This doesn't necessarily mean he's a bad welder. All it shows is that he is definitely lazy. Perhaps a good reprimanding is all he needs? There's a difference between being a bad employee in being a low-skill employee.
Neither, he was running cold and didn‚Äôt get into position to see what he was doing properly. You can see from the toe of the fillet that he wasn‚Äôt tying it in very well.

I just grabbed a piece of 1/16‚Äù and ran a pass over it at about 95amps to make sure it was all smooth and broken down.
I just fired up the compressed air system and tested the lines that way. Was just way too much work going on to hear the leak until everyone left.
Because you don't look further.
Sorry it's not welding related, wanted to rant, 10 months of leak hunting.
If you have new electrical panels under the header, water is a bad idea.
Thought that said 2400 bucks. 24k is a big chunk of change lol.

Wonder if I could LPO one for my ship...
Wow, that thing would disappear so quick üòÇ
Give it 5-10 years and we'll have that on smart phones. And thermal imagers.
I've used one of these to find air leaks around aircraft doors, they're pretty amazing. Found in minutes what would have taken hours to find by feel
Shush
I'm so fucking dense. First read I thought what possible noise can any potted plant can make
We use that tool to find leaks in pressure test on plumbing drainage.  We test at 5psi and it finds leaks.
It‚Äôll find steam too
My Fluke tool bag was almost $500. That yellow color is tremendously valuable!
One of the coolest tools I‚Äôve seen
Ahh here I thought u pulled out soap and water.
Little bit pricey?????? Jesus
Oh neat! My wife is gonna be so angry "did you really need that new tool!?"
Ill stick with my toilet paper tube to isolate noises üò¨
That‚Äôs interesting üßê
My last shop had access to one of those. Might have been a higher tier model because it was like 36k or something. I mostly used it for finding refrigerant leaks in the ceiling of a grocery store while standing on the ground and it was fucking amazing but it's terrifying holding essentially a midsize sedan in your hands.
I'm getting chirped for sounding like I'm advertising already, BUT ultrasound audits can be done with business as usual. The only thing is you may have to do it with a clipboard or something to shield from rebounding sound waves.
What are the situations where one would want to multi pass? I had this question the other day when I was making a stout bracket to host a hitch receiver on the front of a truck, at the frame rail. Cheers
Every code says the welder must inspect their own welds? I have never seen a code state a welder can inspect their welds. It's always a certified level 2 welding inspector and 100%VT
QC usually does 100% VT and then QA does 10%. At least for semiconductor. Idk what kind of plant this is.
I'd be checking every one of that welder's welds based on this one
Yep. There is another indication at 90¬∞ too.
My girlfriend is not fond of late night bead running.
A GF should never be fixing welds or on the tools lol
Never look further
Filling a big grid with water is actually a quite complicated task, as is draining it, and then drying it. Meanwhile peppermint oil is in grocery store's baking section (at least here it is) and one 20mm bottle fills a whole big ass hall.
Dude your attempt at advertising in the comments is pathetic.
Youre right, theres another unfilled spot there towards the bottom.
That‚Äôs way worse than the 10 hours I spent searching.
In the scope of NDE tools, $24k is peanuts. I've worked with $150k Fluke IR cameras that never got used until we pulled one out of a cabinet when we needed to check for cracks in a turbine part by vibrating it and looking for hot spots. 

I'd think a sound camera would be useless compared to a heat camera that can probably do the same thing.
start working on a fishing mega trawler u can get all the fancy toys no questions asked
Worked for a yacht company and we used Fluke machines to check for air leaks when doing large vacuum infusion for fiberglass. Because combing over the bag will induce more leaks and ruin the plastic. 

But the minimum wage laborers, usually covered in resin and fiberglass shards, would toss that thing around like it was a 50$ tablet from Walmart. I cringed every single time they asked to borrow it.
https://youtu.be/c5ynZ3lMQJc?si=NgN9pf7ZjXW9nMaA
That‚Äôs 2 months of helium where I work.
Took all night, so assuming it took 6+ hours for one person @150/hr that's still -$23.1k. Gonna need to find a lot more leaks for a cool gadget like that.
Some cellphones 5-10 years ago had thermal cameras. Same way Samsung released some smartphones that made clothes transparent by exceeding the visible spectrum. 

Someone abused it and now we can‚Äôt have anything nice.
Phones are used in my city to track gunshots already.
https://youtu.be/c5ynZ3lMQJc?si=NgN9pf7ZjXW9nMaA
Less risk than driving around in a company truck.

Less risk than putting an employee on a ladder every day.

(companies should buy me more ultra high tech tools, is what I'm saying)
It‚Äôs a 1,000,000 square foot room with at least 20 impacts running at all times as they‚Äôre putting in mezzanines and shelving. 
There was an insulator working 20 feet from this joint, and he couldn‚Äôt hear it.
Depends. On plate it's the have the beads the proper size for the rod being used. A 1/8 rod will give a fillet weld max 1/4 inch with out a weave. You can weave a bit so long as the puddle does not exceed 3x the rod size and you won't see a reduction in strength of the weld, any larger, and you will have stress points forming in the weld. When doing a weave on a fillet you also need to keep in mind that more material you are adding in a single pass will reduce your penetration into the corner which is a major weld defect I  99% of cases. 
In this case, though, the mulitpass is not only to ensure the weld size does not get to large but it's to add layers to reduce the likelihood of a leak. A good welder when doing multiple passes will stagger there stops and starts to further reduce the chances of a leak.
If you're Leeloo Dallas, you definitely multipass
Not every place has a qc, but even with a qc the welders still need to inspect they just can't mark it VT pass.
It's normally under the section that lays out welders responsibilities at the beginning of the code.
Welders are responsible for checking every weld they do. This is before QC even gets to it. More people need to read and actually understand the damn codes they are working too instead of trying to argue on this sub.
If I was the foremen on that job that welder would have his certification pulled for that weld alone. We all get into shitty spots and some welds look like shit but their is no excuse for leaving that weld as is.
And a 3rd below that one, plus cold lap from the 12o clock to 4 o'clock postions.
I hear you, and if the first year I had with me knew how to weld, I would have let him.
That's actually an amazing idea that I'm definitely going to steal. That said, I can imagine there being certain scenarios where you wouldn't want even peppermint oil residue in your compressed airlines.
It isn‚Äôt complicated.   

Hook up a cheap electric pressure washer or in this case a garden hose.  

Purge with air.   If the air is dried it will dry out the lines too.   Even if it isn‚Äôt it will dry out the line.
LOL...I know, but really not "my business". I'm an end user.
If you had a pickup truck that would pull a Redwood stump out of concrete, would you not share with your brothers? OR...help someone to know what they don't know.
Do some homework. 
I'll give you an upvote just because I agree (pathetic is a little harsh üçªüòú)
Butt hurt
Spent a bunch on a super-sensitive leak detector, did the bubble thing, even on the union. 

Slow leaks are the worst, almost undetectable.  Always detected some gas in the general area but it kept close to the pipes so I didn't know where. 

  
I still think yours is far worse. Without the proper equipment how could you have found that? Glad your troubles on that job are hopefully over.
I have definitely used TICs designed for shipboard firefighting to find electrical faults on gensets, inside enclosures, or locate mechanical problems on various types of machinery. 

I think my favourite was seeing an alternator bearing casually spinning away at 700‚Å∞C on a genset without making any irregular noise. The generator was chasing occasionally despite no changes in electrical load, so a "sonic imaging" camera would have been pretty useless.
I've demoed the acoustic imagery it's very cool and more things make sound than you would expect
You can see valves that are passing
Sound cameras, acoustic imaging, are such an easy tool to utilize and are worth every penny.
I haven't used a sound camera but have done a full untrasonic survey of the instrument air system at a petrochemical plant.  Put on the headset and point it at piping as you walk.  It was a $1500 unit ten years ago but paid for itself and my time on the whole survey on the first day of use.  Instrument air is expensive.
So, a big chunk of change
You can still get cell phones with thermal cameras.  Some brands:
CAT (yes the industrial company), Blackview (I have this one), uleFone.

They also make thermal cameras that plug into the usb port of your phone [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Android-TOPDON-256x192-Resolution/dp/B0B7LMB22Q/ref=sr_1_3?crid=32CNO39VBMFB&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.D_WxWY9Fa41-D4OAT4B0SFnGFcSACYOl4lpktgBZaA7bDRqZUurVdh9eLLSP5yK7GwThIV5_VVnXTDDT7bqunhPUZXNjYuC2e0ndxYe78selkRI1kY6fb3HV_RD9ih6d_IBT3dSJq7NtgSB43sJiaU8HMoLYAMImLOcQGt_LcJZnVHEsgfgBVqqTJ1vtJAU7h-7W-KRiDucXf-94MQQYilFNyS4OpYlXlIyT43VI5g4.9kcq1dKwrhlET5jjZBrNe3mHOqKUN72dN6pm4GfEOEQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=thermal+camera+for+phone&qid=1728231925&sprefix=thermal+camera+for+phon%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-3).
Someone: Iran.
How‚Äôs that work
It's also less risk than driving a scissor lift around the grocery store when there's customers around because they didn't like us doing night work and sometimes you needed more than 4:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. when they opened.
Oh I get it...we have many 1000hp Compressors, Chillers, grinders, you name it. EACH SOUND HAS ITS OWN FREQUENCY. Set it to 40kHz and it filters out all that other shite. It is used with earphones, and a visual readout. 

Edit; To describe it another way...give every noise you mentioned in that room a different color (color representing the level of kHz). Now make each color 1 square foot, they hang out and kind of group together and mingle...now, lets say the compressed air leaks are white (for example). You walk in there with UV light, and a magnifier that makes those 1 square foot noises 10 square feet...you will see them very easily. All the other colors are filtered out, and anything close, you focus on the areas (40kHz only), and the close colors disappear too.
You want to listen to a bearing, now you're physically putting a probe on the machinery and calling this sound maybe green...25kHz, your unit now doesn't even see those white squares anymore...you get the idea...
Thank you for this info. I'm self taught, so lacking many of the bits of info you pick up through formal training or being in industry.
Ah, touche, fair enough. I was thinking of the "Inspection section"
Well duh. Thought that was a given. I also wasn‚Äôt arguing bud.
A foreman can‚Äôt pull someone‚Äôs certification‚Ä¶. I can just not let him weld anymore, but I can‚Äôt take away his credentials because he fucked up a weld. 

Not sure what kind of work you do, but we have an international body that handles our certs.
Are you union? Your steward should have stepped in
If you have sterile air lines for like pressurised breathing air for masks, then yeah. However... This stuff can be removed from pipes by just flowing air through them.
Your "cheap electric pressure washer" is not going to handle over kilometre of pressure grid.

Lets see. A cheap pressure washer from Clash Ohlson (Cocraft HHR 160) has pump capacity of 8 l/min.

Lets say the whole grid is like 40 mm tubing (which it isn't because main branch is way bigger) and just one straight pipe at ground level (which it isn't). The volume is 1,508 m3.

Your little pressure washer is tugging along for over 3 hours.

Oh and then we get to consider fun things like viscosity of water, resistance to flow when felling, and the ability for air to escape the pipe which is going to be restrict.

Now lets empty the pipe by just opening it. Lets say the water collum pressure is 0,02 bars because the one end is elevated by 5 cm.  So we get a flow of like 3 l/minute (it isn't this simple but lets pretend it is), so with just gravity the pipe will drain in like 8 hours. Once again assuming that there isn't air pushing in or anything constricting the flow, and it's a straight pipe (which it isn't) at ground level that is elevated (And it clearly is not), and it drain completely cleanly (which it wont). Then you ram the compressors and open all the ends of the grid to push the water to the dryer units (Which once again can take a fucking long time - and so will vacuum drying).

So yeah... you could spend 11 hours doing this. Or you open the primary valve, let the grid equalise (Which can take a while depending on the size of the trunk line) and buy a bottle of peppermint oil, or rent of air leak scanner. Hell... Or just manually inspect the pipes using soapy water.
I use a thermal camera to identify shorts and malfunctioning chips on my circuit boards. Really small stuff like 1x1 mm surface mount components.

It makes debugging a lot easier when you can see that one little chip 50 C above the rest.
I bet it's stupid cool! I wonder what the comparison of resolution is between a sound camera and a really accurate heat camera. At the end of the day, sound is just waves moving air, right? Movement can also be measured as heat, but I wonder if the resolution of the two may not overlap as much as I'm assuming.
Ive seen one used on a steam trap survey. What used to take two weeks for that particular building was done in like 3 or 4 days
Point was a TIC would accomplish the same thing with no new tools theoretically.
I have add-on cameras and I've seen the CAT phones. What I'm waiting for is something that's not super chunky and is standard equipment on consumer phones, so that we get a bunch of apps that can do interesting things with it.

The other thing that could get really interesting is single photon avalanche diode arrays. You can do time-of-flight measurements with light that way, among other things. You can do stuff like see around corners to some degree. And light field imaging, where you can get depth information and refocus the image later.
If you hear a gunshot, use the phone to call 911.
Sound travel by 300meter or yard per second.

They use exactly time and a special program to find exactly where shots are fired, the direction is easy, but recognising gun shot is done by AI.
Time difference of arrival. You get very accurate time synchronization (and of course position data) from GPS so if the mic on multiple phones picks up the same gunshot you can trilaterate the source. The hard part would be filtering out false positives.
My contractor may be a little cheap, they‚Äôll just pay me double time to stay late and track it down lol
Where I am I can. I can physically take there weld certification and notify the governing body that they need to be re certified.
Sure am, and as long as there are less than 40 guys on the job there‚Äôs no rule against a foreman being on the tools. 

Job is coming down, only 15 hands left, and nobody wanted to stay. I gave them a chance to do it while I sat in the trailer, but they wanted to go home.
While your numbers do add up, that doesn‚Äôt mean my proposed way is bad.   

I‚Äôll address a few easy ones.  
The leak detector-I agree.   
Draining water-compressed air and it‚Äôs purged in minutes.   
Filling taking hours-no.  Simple T and a couple of valves.   Could have this line filled and pressured up in an hour no problem.  
Peppermint oil-great in theory.  This line is obviously up in the ceiling.  Difficult to tell how high up, but it probably isn‚Äôt close.  Dripping water would be much easier to spot than any other method.  

Now.   If this air line is using enough pressure that it‚Äôs better ti weld and have it inspected-it should really get a hydro anyways.  Cheap insurance.  

The part about it taking 10 hours-OP said she(?) spent all night trying to chase down this leak.   One leak.  Lucky it was a couple of bigger holes, otherwise they might not have found it at all.   

(Excluding renting electronic equipment) Your ways would work.   But so would mine.  As to which is faster-that would be luck of the draw.   Seeing how I‚Äôve done this more than a time or two, I‚Äôd bet small money that I could figure this out faster-along with finding any more potentials.
We used them in hydraulics for the same thing. Find the inefficiency, and it will probably lead to the problem within a couple of components up or downstream
If your sound camera is "active" then you are dealing with sonar, which has all kinds of neat applications beyond checking out what is underwater. Ultra sound is a kind of active imaging. Your resolution, increases with the frequency of sound used, but high frequency sound doesn't travel as far. (Need more power)

With passive, you are pretty much in fancy stethoscope land. Microphones can focus the direction where they listen to help reduce noise and provide some gain. You can also filter out super low frequency sound, if you are only interested in higher frequencies. Oh, also, you look for things outside the range of human hearing, well above 20 Khz.

For imaging things in air, I expect that active sonar would scatter over distance, making it hard to have a clear image, but I mean, it works for bats?
Predator vision cameras should be stock on high end phones by now.
Interesting  
**(nods head)
I was more asking along the lines of how do they get that information for peoples phones? They just have access everyone in the city‚Äôs phones remotely?
Their machine wouldn't work near my house.  Gun shots are normal things to hear, the occasional explosion from someone with tannerite, sometimes screams from people getting shot.... you know,  the usual.
I would totally be into that as well...LOL
Just because you find it in a hurry, doesn't mean you have to punch out in a hurry üçª
Interesting. Our rule is if there 5 members on site or less then you can be a working foreman. But anything above 5 members supervisors cannot be on the tools.
But the thing is that air supply systems are never straight pipes. They are branching networks which come from bigger trunk. These also always have U bends to dodge structures and utilities.

Look there is nothing inherently wrong with your way. I have used that very way. But it was a pipe with total lenght of like 6 metres. I can imagine doing this method to like... tens of meters, but not hundreds and least of all branching.

This is a pipe network of a system with total lenght of over a kilometer. And I assume that it is also a branching network.

Also no... you don't need to hydro inspect something like this. And you wouldn't don't hydro inspect kilometre of a network in one go, you do it in segments. 

I haven't done the peppermint test myself. But I know of it from people who make these kinds of network installations. Apparently all you need to do is stink up the network and going through the pipes you'll find it quickly. If the networks extends to many spaces, then you can find the correct space easily.
You're missing the point.

When things make noise, there's particle movement and energy. When particles move, there's heat. Any measurement of energy can be accomplished with the measurement of heat. Why buy a dozen specialized sensors when, at the end of the day, you're measuring energy aka heat?
They place out their own phones, at known places. How expensive can they be?

The police were surprised to some of the shooting.
Ah.   It makes sense now.  

You lack experience.   I somewhat suspected, but this response confirms it.   

I‚Äôll treat you like the other ignorant engineers.   ‚ÄúIf you want to do that, we will make it happen.  You are the one who spent 4 years at a university learning what to do‚Äù.   

Luckily, it isn‚Äôt often I have had to say this.   Most of the time there‚Äôs enough snap to give some leeway or to ask for feedback.   The ones that don‚Äôt cost millions of dollars that gets covered up by their supervisors.   But everyone knows.   Don‚Äôt be this guy.
Thank you for explaining this, that was quite enlightening. You would learn this stuff In a physics class or what ?
Ooohh okay I gottcha. They have there own phones in places around the city acting as surveillance microphones.   I thought you meant something completely different
"Triangula" system
Do point out where I was wrong.

Also... I was a fabricator and specialised in tradtional fabrication methods before my degree. My degree has fuck all to do with pipe networks as it is in mechanical and production engineering. Also my focus was in welded steel structure and products, with thesis work on correction of weld flaws.  I did my degree while working day job on-sites, and my thesis was about the projects I did for my day job.

But show me your work, where am I wrong. Get out your calculator and prove it. You claim the experience, the show the experience. This is how we learn, you show and prove where I am wrong and I'll correct my knowledge.

All the information, charts, equations and everything else you need are in the standard HVAC books, I know HVAC people refrence and keep handy. I know this because I know HVAC people, I have borrowed my uncle's books for refrence in the past. They are all there. So why don't you just take those and show your work?

How about I return the favour: I'll treat you as the ignorant, biased, and unskilled person who can't justify the shit they are talking about, and should forever be stuck at the lowest pay scale which the collective agreement allows for.

P.S Concentrated peppermint aroma 30 ml, costs 2‚Ç¨ at my local grocery store. I assure you that if it comes between spending 2‚Ç¨ or filling and entire grid with water (and hoping that the ties would be able to carry the whole network + water) followed by draining and drying operation (which requires compressor to be on full blast through the whole network. I can imagine why the 2‚Ç¨ option is preferable. But then again... Who knows... Industrial management is not my speciality - that's a business degree afterall - welded manufacturing is.
Please stop being a d*ck to visitors to our state
I mean, look at all the comments on the eclipse posts, or really any post where someone from outside our state dares to come and visit. What happened to "if you can't say anything nice..."?

Those of you who are unwelcoming and rude on this forum are giving VT a bad name, and I would request (as a fellow Vermonter) that you stop that shit.

People are getting shouted down for asking questions about how to best come and enjoy our state and spend money here.
>What happened to "if you can't say anything nice..."?

Sir, this is ~~a Wendy's~~ Reddit.
Also, clean the snow off your fucking car.
It‚Äôs not a Vermont thing. It‚Äôs a Reddit thing.
Oh ya you think yer a vermonner huh? how many generations?

All joking aside, some of the tourist posts have been borderline brain dead in terms of the things they are asking. Like asking things that just blatantly show that the tourist asking a question already has a definition of vermont and vermonters in their mind which is so off base that it's actually insulting. Or asking something that indicates that they are a Karen who is going to flip their shit when they get here and realize just how hard it is going to be for them to have all the amenities they want and need.

So my point is that I would ask the tourists to at least try and use their brain before just hopping on reddit to have us do their thinking for them. But I also ask residents to not assume everyone coming here/asking questions is such an idiot either. 

We are often treated like a playground for rich tourists, and as such the entire state gets treated like "the help" by these particularly boisterous tourists who unfortunately give all tourists a bad rep. I think a lot of people are just touchy about tourists because of this and I don't blame them. This is a once in a lifetime event for us too, but also a lot of us have no choice but to attempt to go about our normal day meanwhile our state is going to be overrun by people who have the privilege to be here on a day off getting mad at us for not having the infrastructure to support them for a day.

This is honestly a psychologically complex thing and I think "be nice to tourists" and "fuck all these tourists" are both oversimplifying a very complex and emotionally charged issue that requires more finesse and emotional intelligence than either of those mindsets possess.
Depends on how they are acting. I've had people be super rude we weren't running at full capacity at my job. And I very nicely told them they were part of the issue. Stay at a hotel and not an Airbnb. I know so many people that lost housing because of those turds. There's no one to run the business because they had to move
It was me! I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to be rude but I literally didn‚Äôt know how to respond to ‚ÄúAre there any antique shops?‚Äù - usually I‚Äôm more than willing to help with restaurant and other recommendations - but that question‚Ä¶ that question broke me.
Let me be one of the first to say "when they stop being one to me." I will try to be helpful to nice people hoping to move here, or have moved. 
But the guy from Massachusetts who nearly killed me getting off "a noise shotc during hunting season. Or the family that let their kids out of the car to pee in our door yard during foliage season. If they had just asked they could have used the bathroom, been offered a piece of cake, a tour of the barn, and maybe a pony ride for the kids. There are a lot of obnoxious jerks in the world, and I'm done with them.
It seems most places that rely on tourism to make $ have a love/hate relationship with tourists.
I think people are usually more than accommodating, taking the time to answer THE SAME questions over and over and over again when these out of state posters are spending no time googling/browsing the sub (otherwise they would have found their answer immediately, several times over). I think we‚Äôre going to get 100x the visitors we can even handle, if an irritated reddit comment offends someone so much they cancel their plans, stay home and relieve us one less eclipse tourist, oh well‚ÄîI welcome to crowd relief ü§∑
This post reminds me of oil paintings depicting Vermont from the 1800's. One often sees robust, wealthy visitors, surrounded by plainly clothed "locals" serving them (making their fire, plucking their fresh kill, holding their dogs, carrying the rifles, etc.). 

Here we are, hundreds of years later, commenting about it on reddit. It's a strange life, friends.
I think a bad name might be exactly what we need right now. Our fake invented image is whats causing us to be priced out of our home.
Reddit is not a travel agency. Also service industry people in Vermont, NH and Maine are absolute sick of tourists behaving like we should change and accommodate them. As in, the locals needs to change for what a tourist or new resident is used too. When in reality the new resident or tourist should learn the local culture and customs. If you like the way Vermont is and you come to Vermont don‚Äôt be confused when it‚Äôs Vermont. Just like if I go to Colorado, Romania, or heck Egypt. I follow the culture and customs without demanding that I am accommodated and treated special like I am back home.
I live in NY and work in VT (trust me, I‚Äôd love to just move but family is here) and people in VT are uncommonly nice. Part of why I work in VT is so I don‚Äôt have to deal with the nastiness of the Capital Region, lol. There are certainly some jerks but they‚Äôre way easier to tolerate than the NY jerks.
Good, I hope it gives us a bad name. I dont want them to come back. This whole "SUCH AN UNDERRATED TOURIST DESTINATION" gimmick is speeding up gentrification, and it's putting immense stress on towns that DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY OR SPACE to re-plan their roads. So we und up with partially gridlocked towns, worse road conditions between re-paves, and rude people all over the place throwing their trash on the ground, treating our state like dirt, and putting stress on our weak infrastructure.

Don't even get me started on how it encourages our housing crisis by diverting properties away from the housing market, instead incentivizing owners to take advantage of the much more lucrative short term rental market.
I‚Äôm coming to Vermont for the eclipse. Can you guys put on that foliage thing I always hear about?
I lived in VT for a few years.  My parents lived there for more than 70.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a single person be rude to me when they saw my MA plates.  It‚Äôs New England‚Ä¶people are not ‚Äúoutwardly‚Äù friendly to each other.  But, rudeness is generally reserved for when I go to NY or PA.  LOL.

In general‚Ä¶people aren‚Äôt rude.   Just don‚Äôt walk in like you own the place, say please and thank you, and keep your opinions yours‚Ä¶until you are asked.  You‚Äôll be fine.
Nope. Id say more but i dont feel like setting a new high score in reddit golf today,lol.

Edit(1?): i will say this though, it is kind of unrealistic to expect a local population that is trapped in a low pay tourist economy to keep the same mask on that allows us to scrape out a living when we are at home in our comfortable clothes and in the cups.

Arrr, how be yer feelings 'bout pirates, matey?
As a flatlander from a white plate state, I was going to buy a vacation home in Vermont, but after reading this, I‚Äôve decided to buy two. /s
Good I hope vermont gets a bad name from out of staters personally.  The housing crises isn't going to fix itself.  We aren't dicks to each other, just the tourists who treat our homes like a theme park.
I wish more people understood the phrase ‚Äúfuck around and find out‚Äù,   If your rude I‚Äôll just give them wrong directions
Of all the subs I follow, this one has the most bitter people. 

Every thread, there's always at least one person being an asshole, hating flatlanders, hating homebuyers, hating visitors, hating all-season tires, hating Subarus, hating any opinion that's different than theirs.

"If they're not like me, they're not welcome to VT" - it's exhausting.
Born and raised Vermonters are generally pretty rude to ‚Äúflatlanders‚Äù and act with an air of superiority.

(Born and raised Vermonter‚Äôs opinion)
OP, when using social media and getting triggered by people, it's smart to take in account, how many updoots or how many people actually agree with the person. Most post here have double digit interaction. Meaning that's a fraction of Vermonters agreeing with them. Also commonly known as the vocal minority. 

From one grown adult to another, do yourself a favor and block those people. You'll never see them again. At the end of the day every is allowed to have an opinion even if you don't like it, but you're allowed to block any opinions you don't like.
Though a CEO of my own consulting firm, I enjoy driving for UBER sometimes after work to clear my head and engage with the public, and in that capacity I meet a lot of tourists, and I can‚Äôt name a single time they treated me like the help, seemed entitled or were anything but genuinely good people here to have a good experience. Most first time visitors in for a conference or other work have made comments of how well they‚Äôve been treated here, or other things they‚Äôve enjoyed about the experience. (Even when the weather is totally crappy!) I think we need to be careful with our stereotypes and generalizations, whether we are talking about ‚Äúflatlanders‚Äù or ‚Äúwoodchucks‚Äù. 

‚Ä¶Though somehow drunk frat boys still fall into a pretty narrow band of behavior! <3
Totally agree. People just like being mean on Reddit, including on this sub. Visitors are always welcome, as long as you act safely and respectfully.
[deleted]
I had a woman tell me she never leaves the state to justify being shitty to visitors.  Absolutely wild.
I feel like this is a moderation issue. Everyone's saying this is just how people are on Reddit but this is not the norm on other locally focused subs for other states/cities.
I‚Äôve noticed since moving to Vermont about a year ago that Vermonters online can be real assholes/downers/maximalists.  The Vermonters I interact with in real life are almost uniformly nice, welcoming, and helpful.  Except for the one little old lady at the grocery store checkout that never says ‚Äúhi‚Äù back, but I just assume she‚Äôs got her own shit going on.
Reddit has a bad name. Vermonters are just confused to why no one can look up sub history? Like the same questions are posted over an over again. Simply googling something followed by Reddit would save all of us a ton of time. And as someone who‚Äôs lived here their whole life I don‚Äôt really give a fuck what out of staters think of us. I‚Äôd rather give them the ability and educate then keep out states charm
I once saw a bumper sticker "Not all Flatlanders are assholes, and not all locals are cool". I've certainly met my fair share of "rural folk" that acted like Flatlanders.
[deleted]
To visitors?  There's a good chunk of rightwing Vermont that's horrible to a most of our residents.
I‚Äôm glad someone took the time to make this post. It‚Äôs long overdue. It seems like everyone from out of state who asks for advice gets immediately down voted for no reason.

I love my fellow Vermonters but we sure can be a judgmental  bunch.
I try to only do it when I'm stuck behind a car with out of state plates
What happened to if you can‚Äôt say anything nice‚Ä¶?

Social media happened giving everyone a voice with no consequences for their actions
I‚Äôm heartened by how upvoted this post is.
That damn interstate..wish they never put it in...leve it to them Flatlanders and will be like mass in 20-25 years..cutting into our mountains to build there homes.and don't even live in them..just visit from time to time..sorry just saying..
I‚Äôm mean because I grew up in New England.
People from every state are mean online
Reddit does suck but lol if anyone thinks the average eclipse tourist is even aware that a bunch of online freaks are complaining here
Hmmm... how can I explain that tourism is vital to our economy without being downvoted?  

As someone who worked many years in service jobs I dealt with many entitled and occasionally violent jerks. No one should be allowed to get away with being a dick to people doing them a favor by bringing them food or selling something to them at a cash register. We need to get rid of this ridiculous customer is always right bullshit everywhere,  not just in Vermont. If someone starts out rude, by all means take the gloves off and feel free to inform them of their shortcomings. 

That said, someone simply existing here and behaving within the bounds of civility should be welcomed. We need their money. This eclipse could make up for the lost revenue from the devastating flood of 2023. 

If you work in the service industry, f*ck anyone who tells you to kiss the rod or acts like they are better than you. But, be cool, you don't have to even be friendly, to tourists. Vermont indifferent qualifies as moderately friendly in some of the places these people come from.
It's the same in every state/city subreddit. I wouldn't take it too personally. We're a cynical bunch.
Looks Mean.
Is Nice.
Entire roads are unpaved over much of the state and Mud Season is something we all endure to keep the visitors out!  This is the sacrifice we make!  üòé
Lived in vermont my whole life, I get both sides. To be fair though, without tourists 75% of us wouldn‚Äôt have jobs. Vermont has the lowest GDP of all 50 states, you should be thanking them for coming here lmao. Unless your 60+ years old and own a farm, you need the tourism üòÇü§™
It's not just visitors. People in this sub are assholes to literally anyone who wasn't born and raised here.
No. Some of us are fed up with being the wealthy‚Äôs playground.
I do really enjoy this sub, I am from out of state, with aspirations of moving to VT, but do not feel the vibe of this community is consistent with the many really good people and now friends I have there. I'm talking about born and raised in rural VT kind of folks. Agree with the comments that say it's a reddit thing. Or just simply an internet thing.
Not all state subs are as unwelcoming as ours. I follow several b/c I've lived all over. Vermont doesn't belong to anyone. I was a Navy brat & I'm not really from anywhere. In the US, people are allowed to relocate & travel among the states, and some people's jobs demand it. 

Maybe don't answer tourist questions, or if you decide to, be nice.
> Those of you who are unwelcoming and rude on this forum are giving VT a bad name, and I would request (as a fellow Vermonter) that you stop that shit.

No.  

Or actually, yes, I'll stop being rude on this forum.  I've always been much more rude to flatlanders IRL anyway.
I'm betting most of the people that post here are recent transplants.
I absolutely agree. The message was clear, stay the F&$& out of Vermont!
If my dick behavior keeps ONE snowbird from buying a house in VT it‚Äôs worth it :D
[deleted]
Spent 5 years in Burlington Vt. Politics aside one of the greatest ‚Äúsmall cities‚Äù in America.
The sunset in Battery Park is the best. Driving to thru ‚Äúthe notch‚Äù on a day trip awesome
But the people who got ‚ÄúVermont‚Äù as their place of music on Spotify‚Äôs wrapped are cool right?!?
But but but , I kinda like Vermont even though I‚Äôm not from there I have always felt welcome in your state and it‚Äôs really pretty. I‚Äôm not coming for the eclipse I‚Äôm not that self hating
Seems like a cultural thing when something like property taxes are significantly higher when VT isn‚Äôt your primary residence no matter how long you have owned the property. Had someone recently tell me that the tax assessor told them ‚Äúyou‚Äôre from CT, you can afford it‚Äù. As if every CT resident is in the Gold Coast. Median income in VT is on par with NY lol
When the visitors get snow tires
In all fairness, we're also rude and unwelcoming to each other. I'm sure the junkies will ask for change politely.
Put some tolls around just for Flatlanders to help keep are roads..that don't put anything in my pocket..just more work for all of us..good for business but not for workers..sorry just saying.
It‚Äôs all lame, anyone with that attitude is a loser. Most of them are probably real chucks who are lonely. Sad but true, to act like you own the state who tf are you. üòÇüòÇ
They don't put nothing in my pocket..just the states pockets and small business pockets..this state is going to hell quickly...seen big change in my time and not good..it's all about money!! This state wasn't built on lots of money..just hard work and good neighbors..just saying.
We'll skip right over Vermont and spend our tourist money in Quebec.
Just adding my 2 cents as a new englander, but one from the flatlands. 

Vermont already has a reputation of having a  weird and unwelcoming vibe towards visitors that veer out of the tourist spots and ski resorts. 

I get it too; a lot of city folk don't know how to behave themselves out in the country, and if they end up moving in, they wanna change how things work, which sucks.

But northern New England is truly something special and we should collectively wanna share that and welcome guests all over our region. 


All of that to say, in all the times I've been to Vermont, people have been extremely friendly and courteous. Got lost on a guys farm once looking for my cousin's house, saw him approach me and got worried he'd be angry. Dude smiled, shook my hand, and gave me directions.
sounds like someone from mass wrote this‚Ä¶
People complain Vermont is not business friendly and businesses can‚Äôt survive yet complain about a few days that will most likely bring a huge amount of money to those businesses. Get of the forum for a week if it annoys you so much.
Vermont is the 48th best state in the country
No
If it makes you feel better, no one from NY or CT will care if you're an overt asshole. We will just feel at home.
"Vermonters and visitors alike".  Either those criticizing are not true Vermonters, or true Vermonters are criticizing those who THINK they are Vermonters, and visitors.
We had a lovely visit
The Vermont economy does take in a lot of money from visitors.   Look at all those ski areas, retail shops, ice cream, coffee, restaurants, and gift shops.    $penders! 

Keeping trash off the roads, small road signs and decent people keep the visitors coming.  And they are paying a heck of a lot in sales tax every month.     

"Don't bite the hand that feeds you" is a good lesson for Vermonters.   

It is a small state with limited ability for crowds based on hotel space and the roads.   It will get busy, but not like LA.  So just chill.  Take the back road.  We do drive slow for tractors.   You can also chill for the BMW that is paying the sales tax.
[deleted]
I‚Äôll never understand the hostility towards someone for simply visiting your state from across an imaginary line. Some people are way too uncultured and insecure.
Hey, my wife and I visited last year, everyone was actually pretty nice and friendly! Cept that one dude on the highway in Subaru...ü§£
A lot of small business owners rely heavily on tourists, it's a major source of revenue for our state that doesn't have many sources of revenue.  Be kind to the tourists, let them spend money and appreciate our beautiful state!

ETA: the fact that a post saying "be nice" gets downvoted tells you all you need to know about this sub! 

I hope visitors realize that people in Vermont are much nicer than people on this sub.
I fully support the hostility. As someone in NH I‚Äôm sick of all the transplants and the tax free masshole shoppers
Ironic...

"Stop being a dick" But also "those who are rude, stop that shit"
Luckily, most people who are the worst on here are just a very vocal minority. They get to say all the nasty things they never would in person in the safety of online anonymity.
https://youtu.be/k1BneeJTDcU?si=4AqHfc6tEb1nrlmS
People in New England are on average ALL d*cks compared to most of the country.
People are sick of idiots coming with their entitled attitudes ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è maybe go cry about it?
I‚Äôll stop yelling at idiots from out of state when I stop needing to pull their Audis out of the ditch because they don‚Äôt know what the fuck they‚Äôre doing.
I‚Äôm from New Hampshire. We are kinda like your cool big brother. Hang in there Vermont.
Blame Reddit if you want but Facebook is even worse. Between crying about today being a snow day and how how dare people want to come here on monday for a once in a lifetime event for many. People just suck in general.
My name is Richard 

I can go by D*ck if I want

It‚Äôs not my choice to be a D*ck

My momma gave me that name
In real life the dumb people are too scared to shout these obscenities and the smart people understand where the revenue comes from (tourism). It's just a reddit thing.
The rudest person I‚Äôve ever encountered in the wild was in Vermont. I was walking my dog (a rescue) and she was walking some fluffy, fancy dog. When my dog tried to say hello to hers I asked if it was okay and she scowled at me and said, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù extremely rudely. I‚Äôve never been so put off. Usually dog people are nice.
lol spend ur money and get tf out
Reddit problem, not a real life problem
Go the fuck back to Jersey.
Yeah Reddit is for scum!
We have to differentiate between the tourist and the guy who actually moves here, is a dick to his neighbors, runs for office, etc. Nuance.
Pocahontas told me the wind would help if I was running late
But the 60 MPH sweep works pretty good!
Eh, as a born and raised VTer the xenophobia definitely runs strong w/ in VT‚Äôs culture. Reddit just broadcasts it more openly.
It's not a Vermonter in real life thing, it's a Vermonter on Reddit thing.

I've lived in a few different places, and the local area subreddits have never been as salty and unwelcoming as the Vermont subreddit.

Of course, the actual locals in real life have rarely been as friendly as Vermonters in real life, and I far prefer it that way.
I disagree; I follow a few subs that are pretty nice- this one is salty AF, especially in contrast to actual real-life interactions in VT.
Both
That's true.  I see so many people say it's gatekeeping, but a lot of people in the sub will shit on vermonters and tourists alike.  This sub and the Burlington sub is the same. Salty fucks.
I am seeing it on Facebook as well. As a Vermonter, I am embarrassed.
It's particularly strong on this sub.
Are you implying that the people on Reddit think the format gives them permission to be condescending assholes to others?? Hmm never noticed..üòÇüòÇ
NH sub is very similar.
It‚Äôs common for any resident of an area visited by tourists lol
I used to frequent a city subreddit with very similar posts and it's 100% different than the comments here. It's definitely a Vermont Reddit thing.
Idk. Vermont subreddit is pretty rude and nativist.
It‚Äôs definitely a Kingdom thing‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs more than VT and Reddit. I‚Äôve lived in several different states, every one of them has these kinds of assholes.
> the tourist posts have been borderline brain dead in terms of the things they are asking.

yep - for people coming here with lots of money, they sure do not know how to google or use any sort of deductive reasoning...

> We are often treated like a playground for rich tourists, and as such the entire state gets treated like "the help" by these particularly boisterous tourists who unfortunately give all tourists a bad rep.

It's the standard. Remember, a lot of them think Vermont is not for us, but for them. 

> This is honestly a psychologically complex thing and I think "be nice to tourists" and "fuck all these tourists" are both oversimplifying a very complex and emotionally charged issue that requires more finesse and emotional intelligence than either of those mindsets possess.

This is the most honest and correct take on the issue.
Yeah many of the tourist posts on here give off "I'm coming here, you need my money to live. Please serve me" and then proceed to ask the absolute dumbest question imaginable. 

Especially with the eclipse. There are so many "what is the most secluded high elevation hiking trail I can find" posts.
>Or asking something that indicates that they are a Karen who is going to flip their shit when they get here and realize just how hard it is going to be for them to have all the amenities they want and need.

I have this vivid memory of after Hurricane Irene when a woman from NJ, who was stuck at her rental near Killington after Route 4 washed out, was endlessly calling emergency lines and spamming FB pages DEMANDING first responder attention to get her and her family down the mountain IMMEDIATELY!!1! Absolutely no recognition that a main east-west artery was temporarily nonexistent and that therefore EVERYONE ELSE WAS ALSO STUCK. Stuff like that is almost certain to happen along various dirt roads traversing the eclipse zone on Monday (especially with all the snowmelt we'll have) so yes, if we can knock a little sense into anyone coming to this group to ask dumb questions, might as well try to do it before the fact.
Thank you for saying this. I‚Äôm in the service industry and it is a very accurate take.
Very well said!
+1 for vermonner LOL

I think it still goes back to "if you cant say anything nice". Then the annoying questions will be met with either helpful answers or silence. And silence is much better for our reputation than asshattery.
>This is honestly a psychologically complex thing and I think "be nice to tourists" and "fuck all these tourists" are both oversimplifying a very complex and emotionally charged issue that requires more finesse and emotional intelligence than either of those mindsets possess.

Both of these things are a single, overlapping circle. 

Spot on take.
The state is a playground, this is the mf usa. It‚Äôs not yours.
"I'm coming up for the eclipse what is the best hiking trail" has been posted like 6 times in the past day
wIlL iT bE mUdDY In vT iN aPRiL?
Pretty sure sales at antique shops are what keeps the state education fund afloat.
It's ok, we all get frustrated sometimes lol üòä we're all human, and we're dealing with tough conditions right now! I'm also pretty grumpy when my power is out, like today...
[deleted]
Don‚Äôt answer then
Ya but the shitty people in this sub don‚Äôt operate in the sunlight. Someone who is moving here is interacting with real estate agents, doctors, dentists, restaurant workers, neighbors. And they‚Äôre all normal people. The only power the little bucket crab cynics have on this sub remains in this sub.
[deleted]
I had a side hustle one summer at one of the more privileged summer hospitality spots and got berated by a guest who wanted to bike from Burlington to Middlebury on a bike path along the lake the entire way. I had to explain multiple times that this‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt exist.
Tourists don‚Äôt do this it‚Äôs a strawman caricature that people invent for their 2 minutes of hate to feel in control of their lives
# THIS.
Maybe you should leave?
Aww shoot -what‚Äôll we do with all this chlorophyll?
That‚Äôs why I agree with the posters saying it‚Äôs Reddit and not Vermont. I‚Äôve met nothing but nice natives since moving here‚Ä¶but generally I don‚Äôt frequent the basements of the people who troll around here
Ya but this sub spends half its time dreaming up the ultimate asshole tourist caricature to vent against. It‚Äôs really sad
Purchase them on either side of a working farm for the views, and then spend your every waking moment trying to get the State to close down the farm, to preserve the environment.
ROFL

You would have to hit Powerball to afford 2.
üòÅ
Who is stopping and asking for directions in 2024? And rudely on top of that? Vermont is not some remote wilderness, and this isn‚Äôt 1990.
> Of all the subs I follow, this one has the most bitter people.

Thank you.
"but I'm a 5th generation Vermonter....."

ü§£ I love VT people, even the bitter ones.
> "If they're not like me, they're not welcome to VT"

I HATE that!
You are not superior to anyone for exiting a vagina inside imaginary borders

And most people do. Not all, of course, but even the ones who do things like pull over to take a picture are pretty non-offensive!  This sub is mean.
People in VT act like they‚Äôre the only people with outdoors.   A lot of the visitors are from NJ.   They had Action Park.  That‚Äôs more dangerous than anything in VT.   Google it.
Vermin.
Sad, waste of life
Bingo. The mods of this sub need to step it up a bit
Sometimes sayin' nothin' says enough
This. There is a vocal minority of absolute deplorable people on this sub. They do not walk among us.
You don‚Äôt own the Sun, you don‚Äôt own the moon, you don‚Äôt own Vermont. You own the little bit of space you purchased or you rent. Outside that, deal with it.
Lol for real? I won‚Äôt even try and change your opinion but this is straight up selfish.
You shouldn‚Äôt be proud of that trait
It's just tough when the hospitality jobs that make that tourism possible don't pay their workers enough to afford housing. I have a coworker who commutes in from over the NY border, and there are people in my town who are working at the supermarket and living at the hotel, because all the housing either belongs to AirBnB landlords, or is priced far above what a working class person can afford. These problems are the result of wider economic processes that most people have no control over, and they're not unique to Vermont, but it's not gonna engender good feelings, when you can get paid 2 to 3 times the federal minimum and still be priced out of housing.
You can certainly cater to tourists while on the job. There is no obligation to do so while not on the clock and/ or browsing on Reddit.
You're certainly allowed to have your opinions, I'm just asking that you not contribute to giving our state a bad name...
Maybe you should leave
Two different worlds
> Vermont doesn't belong to anyone

Especially New York. 1777, never forget!
Maybe if the tourists put in the smallest modicum of research effort and didn't act like everyone living in VT is there to serve them people would be less rude
Sure you have. I guarantee you‚Äôve never done more than glare at a tourist and they prolly had no fucking clue you were even doing it. Pathetic.
If it weren't for flatlanders, we'd be the Alabama of the northeast.
I'd be happy if you took your rudeness to people IRL and see how that works out for you!
Make them. Like what are you gonna do about it? Put your money where your mouth is and physically remove a tourist from the state. Fucking anonymous cowards man
You should leave
Unfortunately Burlington has been overrun by junkies. Walk down church street and there‚Äôs hobo‚Äôs sleeping on the sidewalks and shooting up in the alleyways in between, needles everywhere. I work at UVMMC, that‚Äôs the furthest into Burlington I go now unless I have to.
Moved .2 mi from battery park about 6/7 months ago. I like it here a lot!
Chill for the bmw paying the sales tax? What about how taxing works do you think that only the wealthy pay taxes? Chill on the back roads.
"They give us money so you have to put up with their assholery" we must serve them !
Are you psychologically predetermined for serfdom? What kind of slave obeys logic is this.
> The Vermont economy does take in a lot of money from visitors. Look at all those ski areas, retail shops, ice cream, coffee, restaurants, and gift shops. $penders!

This is why I am trying to ramp up what I am doing on the side, get people into building shit, create exports! FINE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS!
Have you see twitter?
Well, THAT narrows it down...;)
I‚Äôm a tourist who has loves visiting Vermont (particularly the NEK).  I‚Äôve never had a bad interaction and often leave wishing my community treated each other better (if even just for show). But I‚Äôm not ahole to the people I am visiting. If I was I‚Äôd expect to be treated like an ahole. This isn‚Äôt a Vermont thing and this has nothing to do with Vermont‚Äôs revenue streams. If you behave poorly anywhere you should expect to be treated poorly.
There's a difference between being kind to tourists and rolling over and taking it from shitty tourists. Part of this mindset comes from the fact that we engrain this belief in Vermonters that we have to put up with asshole tourists in order to survive. Partially true, but psychologically not surprising that it breeds resentment. 

But Believe me, putting a few rich assholes from CT or wherever in their place is not going to break the state's economy ffs. I say tourists get out what they put in - approach every interaction with kindness and when they start screaming at you for the fact that our state doesn't have a Target and a public bathroom every 10 feet flip em the bird and leave em to figure their own shit out.
I see this all the time online like it is some kind of burn? Is this some kind of might makes right fallacy..like if i was the bigest fish i could say wtf ever i wanted? i mean only a masochist would spout thier inner thoughts on things like we do here in polite..or worse company,lol. IDK i got bad filters when im home and shields down/mask off.

sorry but it might be one of those nights for me cause its been one of those days,lol
Yankee attitud-oodle
You should charge.  Everybody wins.
I came.
It‚Äôs true. I am scum so I know.
you'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Right! Go to tik tok or Facebook if you want normy vibes.
Take one look at Burlington and ask yourself why Vermonters don‚Äôt like transplants.
That's because we don't like aliens. 

The alien crisis is going to come full force once the AARO opens up more investigations to the public.
>It's not a Vermonter in real life thing, it's a Vermonter on Reddit thing.

I dunno, I know plenty of Vermonters who bitch endlessly about tourists. The difference is they mostly do that in conversation with other Vermonters instead of directly AT the tourists. (Exceptions here too obviously, like we have our road rage moments like any other place in the US.)
I feel like people come to this sub to vent to other people who understand where they're coming from. I don't condone it, but I sort of understand it.

As a Vermonter, you're part of a relatively small club in comparison to other states. We don't get much representation in media or pop culture, so it can sometimes feel like we've been forgotten about. So, while many of the issues facing our state aren't necessarily unique, it can make them feel more personal. 

We're a rural state. We have a lot of people who live fairly secluded lives, cut off from others with whom they could talk and vent their daily frustrations.

We're an aged state. There are many people who live in areas where they may not have anyone of their generation that they'd feel really gets them and their struggles. 

So, they come to reddit, where they know they'll find an audience who'll listen and all done anonymously so they can really let loose. 

Idk, that's just my theory. Yeah, I wish people were as friendly as they are in real life, and some people are just straight-up assholes, but at least on reddit, we can choose to scroll right past the negativity and even block people should we so choose.
It‚Äôs not at all uncommon for subs to be annoyed by repeated low effort questions that treat the user base as an internet search when the questioner demonstrates zero effort at researching the topic first.

For example, this was so bad in my kayaking sub that they created an auto response with some responses about common questions.
Nope. I‚Äôve experienced it and I have had friends experience it. I know it‚Äôs a minority of you, but there‚Äôs a definitely a slice of your population that doesn‚Äôt like flatlanders.

No. It‚Äôs real. You did not live in Vermont with out of state plates in March/April 2020.  It was heartbreaking.
I agree, this is one of the nasiest, most gate-keeping local subreddits.
Dunno, it does kinda seem to be a Vermonter in Real life thing... left for work in Northern California, came back and was pretty much called a flatlander to my face by strangers from the NEK while in a temporary n-hood (5S)... there are more than 40 mountain ranges in California; from 2-10K feet hikeable high, not including the ones that line the border of the state: Cascades, Sierra, and Mammoth, that i frequented with various gear (hike, ski, shoe, climb, camp). 

Everyplace good is riddled with tourists, good and bad. I'm just glad we finally got a day of winter this week. I came back here for the winter, dammit! Maybe I'll go to the PNW where the trees are green all winter. It's all brown and whiney and crimey here now. 7 is a strip mall with semi trucks, the notch is not funny anymore and the politics are mind numbingly idiotic.
Can confirm. CT resident and the CT sub can be sooo toxic. I‚Äôve been to Vermont idk how many times in my life and never had a bad experience.
Dude I grew up in Windham County in the 90's before the internet and people bitched about New Yorkers and out of staters all the time.¬†
> this one is salty AF, especially in contrast to actual real-life interactions in VT.

that's what u/ElDub73 is saying.
People who move here are not automatically Vermonters.
Every city subreddit is at least 75% bitching and moaning
There may be some of that going on, yeah.
I love the ones that start out innocent and nice, and then with the slightest critical response they turn into absolute shitty monsters throwing around that tourist card like you're saying. Like sick dude, thanks for showing your true colors.
Are there so many?  How many?

If you look at the last week in this sub for posts that actually get travtion, you really don't seenthat many stupid tourists at all even you just assume the tourist is dumb without reading. 

I can find like 5 posts from a vermont native giving a  list of "tips" for visitors, but only one post asking if there will be traffic from New York on Thursday. That's a dumb ass question I won't argue, but the ratio doesn't seem to be what you're saying.
We get it you hate tourists, don‚Äôt deny it now your history shows. Look how much it bothers you while the people you are talking about don‚Äôt give a shit. üòÇüòÇüòÇThis damn state isn‚Äôt yours people can come and please as they want.
Exactly. It's easy for people to be on their high horse right now, but come Monday there will be a lot of "main characters" who need to be tended to NOW despite being amongst thousands of others who are in the same exact boat as them. Killing those people with kindness doesn't really work.
Haha we had a wedding on our property that weekend. Had over a hundred out of staters get stuck. We explained to them that with the backup generator they had and the well, that they were actually fine. Our property is the town emergency shelter. It‚Äôs the best place to be. They still flipped out and called 911 over thirty times complaining about being stuck. 
Hilarious.
Hope she was LAST.
Yeah I'm sure one interaction on the Internet is really going to overpower the decades long reputation Vermonters have built through in-person interactions.
Never said it was mine. But it IS my home, and I DO pay more in taxes than some random person on a vacation. Not to mention didn't your parents teach you to play nicely on the playgrounds you were visiting? I'm guessing not.
Also VT emergency personnel are begging people to not go hiking on eclipse day.
Why would anyone feel compelled to answer a question like that‚Ä¶.six times in a day.  Some folks just don‚Äôt understand they don‚Äôt HAVE to engage.
Get off your high horse General Lee, let people have fun.
Look I get you, and of course OP is ultimately right. Everyone should be treated with kindness and respect regardless of the situation. 

I just *get* the rage at tourists. For the most part they are extremely obnoxious and seem to think of us as zoo animals whose primary purpose is to put on an act to make them have a good vacation.
> Ya but the shitty people in this sub don‚Äôt operate in the sunlight.

like fuck I don't!
I honestly dont give a fuck about the rest of the country. 

But I do care that only 16% of Vermonters can afford the median price of a new home. There are no clean villains here, no one is doing anything wrong. 

But the fact remains that there has been a massive influx of people driving prices up who come looking for a place that doesn‚Äôt exist.
It‚Äôs okay for you to have an opinion. It‚Äôs okay for me to have an opinion. My opinion is drawn from 20 years in the service industry.  I don‚Äôt feel hate. Sometimes annoyance but not hate.
It was definitely a tourist who was upset over so many people driving over the 3 covered bridges in Bennington. She thought they should be preserved as antiques and only have pedestrian traffic.  I told her they are preserved and maintained, that's why they can have hundreds of cars using them daily; it's how we cross the river.
Nope. If I'm not here to bring discomfort to tourists, they won't be encouraged to go literally anywhere else.
99% of this sub is complaining about non-Vermont people. It‚Äôs exhausting. Even Burlington‚Äôs subreddit is so much better
Good tip
more like 1 with the way things are going.
Places in Vermont are still very reasonable compared to anywhere near or inside 95 in MA...
Yeah, I don‚Äôt disagree with that.
> You are not superior to anyone for exiting a vagina inside imaginary borders

you act like it is a bad thing to have a reverence for the place you grew up in or the communities you are apart of. There is no superiority complex - it's a matter of seeing things change for the worse, and be othered by those who claim we other them.

Get treated like you're the "help" a few times and be talked down to by some guy in a BMW because you're "simple folk" and unsophisticated to their epicurean ways.
Was the ‚ÄúBorn and raised Vermonter‚Äôs opinion‚Äù part of my comment hard for you to understand?
There is only one real mod here, the rest are too busy preening and polishing their self-made pedestals. They probably won't even see your comment ü§£ü§£
Agreed. They can post mega threads for common topics (hello Eclipse, leaf peeping, ski season), auto remove low effort posts, and cut down on unhelpful/mean spirited comments. I don't know why they aren't!
> The mods of this sub need to step it up a bit

why?

so the rest of us towneys can be treated like inbred servants to the affluent flatlander class?
> They do not walk among us.

Like fuck they don't. They live in your communities and work jobs here. 

Stop trying to erase the Vermont Native.
And some of us coming up literally live on the Vermont border. We just need to come up a little further north to get to the totality. Some of us are your neighbors, separated by a little imaginary line. Be cool, guys!
> You don‚Äôt own the Sun, you don‚Äôt own the moon, you don‚Äôt own Vermont. You own the little bit of space you purchased or you rent. Outside that, deal with it.

elitist much?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm only nice to strangers when I‚Äôm paid to do it‚Äù
> I'm just asking that you not contribute to giving our state a bad name...

you know if it did - maybe some of the housing would come down in price. You know cause we have all this demand and no supply...
You literally just got here
But why do yiu have to answer them? Can't you just scroll on by and let someone else answer? 

And...maybe they are just excited about visiting and want to interact with "locals."
Not pathetic at all. It feels great and it's a good thing to do. And yes, I've done a lot more than glare. I'm sure you see the irony in your own internet-tough-guy response. Lol .
You say this like NH doesn‚Äôt exist
Chester A. Arthur, Calvin Coolidge, John and George Dewey, Vermont had a fine history before we locked ourselves into thinking all we are is a playground for out of staters.
Ok
You misunderstand - I've been doing that, for several years now. It's worked out great so far, I recommend it!
He wouldn't because then he'd get his ass kicked lmao
Maybe you shouldn't be in a service industry job if you don't like serving people?
[deleted]
But we do have a (crummy mini-)Target. In fact there will be \~3 minutes of eclipse totality from the parking lot outside the Target! Two problems solved. ;-)
I saw.
https://youtu.be/6xclyDmL9ts?si=HILOo9RawLKALCrw
Any community.  Williston, South Burlington, so many are full of snobs.
[deleted]
Fair enough. 

Bitching about out-of-state drivers while on the road doesn't count though, right? :)
You call them pussies haha
Nothing wrong with coming here to vent, especially about shared problems! I'll happily join in complaining about the weather or the cost of inspections or the state government's most recent screw up, or anything else. Honestly, seeing people complain about issues they are having to an extent helps forewarn me, as a relative newcomer, of issues I may face later on.
Oh, apparently you missed our 15 minutes of popular culture fame on SNL:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nKcUOUYzDXA
Wrong in the wrong town!  Many towns are very friendly.  A few are not!
Yeah the local skiing subredd has become flooded lately with posts that are basically. "Where do I go for this storm" "what skis do I buy" with no actual info. Of course they are going to get flamed with snarky and purposly incorrect info
It‚Äôs honestly like that on every specialized sub. It happens on bug, animal and mushroom ID all the time. It makes me wonder how many people actually know about the search feature. It happens everywhere. Not unique to this sub at all, but I understand the frustration.
LDub checks out for kayaking sub. No one cares how high you run the LW.
Bingo!
VT thinks they invented hills
at least you try....
> gate-keeping

lol
I read it as ‚Äúall of Reddit is like that, not just this sub‚Äù; I agree the wording is open to interpretation
I know plenty of folks that moved here that have adopted the Vermont lifestyle, and i know plenty of people born here that moved to burlington to act like folks from other states.  Not sure where i said people that move here are automatically Vermonters though...
Small mindedness does not impress
With Town Meeting Day getting replaced by Australian balloting in places, it's probably going to get worse because now there's no outlet for people to bitch and moan about roads once a year.

Genius of the green mountains here, no shit you don't see them they got voted down and filtered out. You just weren't around for when they 80+ tourists posted the same question within 3 hours of each other.
Being ‚Äústuck‚Äù and without amenities can really trigger some people. Hell my own wife spirals anytime we lose power meanwhile I‚Äôm all giddy firing up our wood cookstove and whatnot. Luckily my wife understands that calling the power company incessantly is unnecessary and a dick move.
Every little bit helps.
Are you assuming I don‚Äôt take care of a place I‚Äôm visiting. Bold assumption.
We live here, so we see those warnings - perhaps they don‚Äôt because they are not here.
If it makes any difference to you I‚Äôm not referring to you in a lot of these comments. You generally seem pretty passionate/productive in your posts even if I don‚Äôt always agree with your opinions. The shitty people I‚Äôm referring to are much more dark and cynical
[deleted]
You sound like a real great contributor to the state
Winters in Vermont are relatively mild compared to Siberia.
Reverence for the place you grew up in !== trashing outsiders.

There‚Äôs a reason why songs like ‚ÄúAmerican the beautiful‚Äù and ‚Äúproud to be an American‚Äù celebrate the country and don‚Äôt spend all their verses trashing other countries and painting foreigners as some sort of evil caricature.
[deleted]
Likely because they aren't paid and don't have the free time haha but the stickied posts seem like low hanging fruit
There are tons of removed comments (maybe some take downvotes harshly? it's not like mods can control downvotes)--and is it just me or do I see similar all the time in other state subreddits? https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1bvrcnd/comment/ky2zk3y/?context=3

Apparently you don't notice the sticky posts, though right now we're further drafting an eclipse one which is kind of presently superseding the moving/visiting sticky which is almost always there. The join subreddit welcome message literally recommends r/NewToVermont for anyone visiting or moving to the area. The posting guidelines literally say "If you have a question about moving or visiting, please search the subreddit before posting to see if your questions may have already been answered."
Idk how posting mega threads for common asks and removing low effort posts from people asking the same questions would be treating you like an inbred servant?
Doubt it. Most likely living in basements collecting unemployment. Or they don‚Äôt have the balls to talk this way to people face-to-face. In my experience all natives have been very friendly in-person.
How is that elitist? I‚Äôm telling the poster that the eclipse does not belong to them. It‚Äôs incredibly selfish to complain about a day of inconvenience for a rare event that brings joy to countless people.
Oh I'm not, I'm only interacting with people upset about the folks clowning on clueless tourists who are too lazy to use the search function.
Weird LARP
I have, no ill effects in almost 10 years.
Oof there it is
You literally just moved here and still have this attitude to people, nice. Really bucking the recent transplant stereotype!
Twitter is wildly more toxic. Reddit is actually very helpful if you avoid the cesspools which is fairly easy imo
I can't think of a more magical place to enjoy this celestial event than the UMall parking lot.
I sCummed.
fuck those ayy lmaos!
Exactly, you get a pass for that :-D
I have found that the towns that are least friendly are those with a lot of people who moved here from out of state.  They are very clique oriented, bossy and try to take over everything.
I can understand someone wanting to have some personal info, but at least show me you tried.
r/Icecoast is just awful.  Totally useless.
As they should.  Reddit isn't for the lazy.  These people are too lazy to learn anything.
Twomb is one of those people, he‚Äôs all about local this local that. I‚Äôve seen it on ice coast enough.
Agreed.

It‚Äôs also a lot less likely to bother me personally if it‚Äôs something like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm looking for a good baseball glove‚Äù or a toaster or a whatever to buy rather than if it‚Äôs someone asking about tourist type stuff.

But that‚Äôs my bias.
lol.
Being a Vermonter is earned over time, not automatic.  Some never become one.
You're obviously from somewhere else.
LOL But at least we do get spared having to sit on terrible chairs and listen to the self-appointed One True Citizen of \[Town\] pound away at the same points over and over to beat everyone into submission. It was \*awesome\* to have to suffer that for hours and hours in order to be able to vote.
That's 4 posts in 3 weeks. Not sure what point you're making
Sounds like you had to be actively looking for them to see them then??

People looking for something to be mad at seems to be the theme of this post.
The national guard landed  in the yard and had a nice long chat about just how fine they all were lol. 
We also tried to give people the heads up that if they wanted to leave they had to go NOW and I heard so many people say ‚Äúoh if it‚Äôs that bad we‚Äôll just leave later‚Äù 
Meanwhile my dad was shoveling trenches into the side of the driveway to save it. It didn‚Äôt work. The culvert at the bottom of the driveway ended up a mile down the road. üòÇ good memories
VEC has a nice site for our outages. For example I can see I'm supposed to get power back in 2hours and 25 minutes
 Of course you do have to have a working smart phone and cell signal.
Knowing when you are getting power back is reasuring.
It's friday afternoon, I'm done work in 20min, and there's no way I'm going to engage in this bullshit debate with you.
As I said, no clean villains.
I don't want the state to grow. Maintaining a small bubble economy is what made Vermont so likeable. If I wanted to live in a state that's nothing more than an extension of the Massachusetts suburbs, I'd just live in NH or Mass.
Huh?
[removed]
Even if there are sticky threads tons of people will just ignore them
>There is only one real mod here
well that's just my real life interactions with tourist class. I used to do a lot of IT work for a resort and maaaan - those people freak out. "WHY ISN'T THE WIFI GIVING ME GB SPEEDS?!", "WHY CAN'T I TORRENT?" or when I get there to fix something, "YOU CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT WE NEED INTERNET FIGURE IT OUT NERD!"
Bunch of angry chucks

![gif](giphy|fwL2rPfgjMuRuAqzlZ|downsized)
Educate me. What's wrong with my statement?
I've lived in VT for 21 years, they just weren't all consecutive :)

I maintain that people who don't wish to serve others should not be in the service industry. Please note that I didn't say that customers are allowed to be assholes to service employees.
[deleted]
I mean, asking a question on Reddit *is* trying. I like to answer a lot of those questions, otherwise I just ignore them.
It is pretty fun to look at people posting about storms. Get warned that there will be wind holds. And then see those same users make a rage post a day later that there are In fact wind holds.
I mean I mostly just talk about it in the context of clowning on people from NJ who try to act like locals and gatekeep the mountains
Refer to the other guy's screenshot, you really don't have to try. Have a coffee you seem a bit lost.
I think you‚Äôre the one just looming for something to debate lol
Ours often doesn‚Äôt have a time to restore listed which just adds to the anxiety lol
Make a good faith effort to follow [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette).
There are other mods that are moderating too.
you have no idea how much moderation goes on here. It is more that the literal nazis require more attention than ignorable lazy potential tourists.
some folks are locked into the service industry because of a lack of education and vocational training. It's not their fault they have to deal with shit bricks constantly belittling them with their elitist attitudes and over inflated self worth.

See the problem really is people with big money - they think they are above everyone and because they have that precious resource of cash, they can do fuck all.
I'm saying twitter is more toxic than reddit which is actually not that toxic. Do you have a reading comp problem?
Yeah but it's funnier to write "big snow NJ" in the comments
r/technicallythetruth
Or this classic:  "I like to ski 'blues.'  I'm driving 6 hours, one way, and I usually ski the Poconos.  But now I'm a mega pass evangelist and will downvote you for saying that Stowe is worse now that Vail took it over.  I have never been to Stowe.  What place will have the fewest people like me at it at 9 am on a Saturday? Tell me exactly how the snow will be in six weeks?  So stoked for the gnar, brah!  Where can I buy Heady Topper when I'm here, dawg?"
Lmao gate keep the mountain from asking questions? Ever think we are just very spoiled to be able to go out and ski or board everyday. People paying all that money to go out and ride ,traveling distances have questions big whoop.
I don‚Äôt get ‚Äútry to act like locals‚Äù, what makes you special tell me. Can you give more context try to act like locals how.
Also you ski or ride at any mountain ? Well dur durrr most of those workers aren‚Äôt from Vermont. Mass nj New York, yes there are some from Vermont but not everyone. Imagine only people from Vermont skied the ‚Äúlocal ‚Äú mountains. They would all be closed in 2 years. Use that big brain of yours. They travel up here from there home state to run the mountain for you.
That's 4 posts in a month. If that is enough to get you all worked up and complaining...then you need more than a coffee. .maybe a good hike. You know any good places?
You wouldn't be so overworked and sensitive if they did their jobs.   I'm not trying to listen to you defend them, i was giving you props for actually managing to do a thankless, payless job, on top of having a real life.  kudo's man.

Edit:  You mean to say that there are others with the title, that think delegation is moderation.
wow.....
[deleted]
In agreeing with you in that point. I think localism is stupid in skiing. Most of the time some dude in icecoast gets all high and mighty about casual skiiers or jerries it's usually some condo owning clown from NJ. It's fun to clown on them
Wow!  You have some kind of chip.
You're going out of your way to be toxic to prove your point. grow up?
Just trying to tack on some roof racks
While I was tacking on some roof racks, I heard a large thud and didn't realize until I saw the glass had cracked. Not sure if it was heat or the metal warping. I still need to tack on the front racks. These were cheap racks that I got and aren't an exact match for the car, so I borrowed my friends welder and i did turn the heat down to around 16.5. Also did cover them with cardboard so not sure what caused it 
Man that‚Äôs a terrible idea
Wait, you're just welding the brackets for the rack to the sheet metal roof? That's a terrible idea for like a dozen different reasons.
The sheet steel on that roof has no structure to it at all, it‚Äôs going to warp all over just from the welding and it‚Äôs going to warp even worse when the rack hits its first bit of wind resistance.
You always think you see the dumbest shit on the internet and then you just keep scrolling and find something even dumber
Wait, why are you tacking your roof rack on top of your roof?
Yeah put down the welder man, you‚Äôre a danger to not only yourself but anyone who would be on the road with you. This is idiotic.
My theory is a drop of spatter hit the glass and caused thermal stress that basically cracked the glass. I am assuming you tacked without covering the vehicle to stop spatter from damaging anything such as paint or glass?
Wow. Every piece of this plan was a bad idea. The whole thing. 

You using 1/8" 7018 too? Maybe spray transfer mig?
I pride myself on being able to weld just about anything, but I chose to use sheet metal screws and urethane to put some Homebuilt roof racks on my old car. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Please don't have kids
I don‚Äôt think you should touch a welder
lol THIS is why I follow this sub. Bubba is everywhere.
What the fuck are you doing?
Can you repost this when you're done, so we can keep roasting you?
How bout don't weld on fucking cars
Was this car even meant to have roof racks? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs supposed to be welded on
I think there‚Äôs a crack on the rear window
Use Rivnuts to mount the rack!
I‚Äôm sorry, all due respect, this might be one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve seen. Rip üíÄ
Glad you folks are getting a kick from my dumb decision. The welder has been returned, and both racks will be bolted down properly and safely. Thabks for the helpful advice
The fact you are just welding directly to the roof is fucking cooked‚Ä¶. wtf
You do know that the black strip on the side edges of the roof are just weather strips. 

You take that out and there is a channel that roof racks are generally designed to bolt into.

You literally just get or make the right type of mounts and they bolt in and then you fill the rest of the channel back up with weather strip again.

Then if you want to take it off one day you can without damaging the car in any way. At worst it costs you some new weather strips.
Wait let me get this straight, you were welding a roofrack directly to the roofskin on your car? 

These were cheap racks and now they have cost you a couple of hundred in a rear screen and a fucked roof.

Welding the wrong rack to the roof is a pretty terrible idea, one of the worst I have seen today.
Holy fuck this is stupid
You need to give that welder back to your friend.
This has made my day
I‚Äôd call this redneck engineering but I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs good enough for that. At least they would have just used sheet metal screws to mount it.
Well that fucking sucks

I'd bet it was a piece of spatter. Glass can shatter from heat differences and that's more true for tempered glass
A valuable lesson has been learned this day
I‚Äôve welded like once in my life and I can see that this is a terrible idea lmao, that bracket gonna rip your roof off and potentially hurt somebody behind you
Don‚Äôt smoke crap kids
#Dumbass
When these racks and whatever you've strapped to them fly off on the highway and kill someone, I hope the DA uses this post as 'Exhibit A'.
It could‚Äôve been spatter

Also could‚Äôve been the fact that you have a defrost wire running through the back glass and it could‚Äôve arced from having a bad ground
I'm sorry but you must be dumb as hell if you think this is an ok idea. Holy shit..lol
This is insane try to Claim this as vandalism for insurance
This is some ghetto shit. That cracked window fits in well.
And I thought I‚Äôve done some dumb redneck shit with my welder‚Ä¶
Please stop DIYing. It ain‚Äôt your thing‚Ä¶.promise
You are putting the lives of others in danger with this
Lmfao no. And never weld again.
I‚Äôm not sure what highlights how simple minded you are; the fact that you did this, or the fact that you thought no one online would find anything wrong with you doing this.
I‚Äôve installed universal racks like this and I always just drill the roof skin and install a rivet nut so I can bolt the rack down, you might look into doing something like that for the front
It's gonna be hilarious when this guy doesn't listen to anyone on this thread and ends up welding the rack to the doors and can't open any of them.
Window frame warped out of shape and put excess stress on the glass leading to failure at the edge.
You do realize cardboard is flammable? As farmable as paper. Not to mention welding on a car is not a good idea at all. And it seems pretty clear you should step away from the welder. What happens when the rack breaks off on the highway because you are not even tacking to a clean surface?
If you get this welded on, you should really test it by actually trying to rip it off with your hands.  If you can, that means whatever you strap up there could have come off and fucking killed someone, even then I'd be sketched out by it.
why did you think you can weld a roof rack on that's now even how roof racks work
This is an expensive lesson that won't be forgotten.
One time my nephew thought it was a good idea to use my mother‚Äôs regular vacuum cleaner to siphon gasoline out of his car so he could get the lawnmower going. Same kinda sweet and dopey, but kinda devastating results. At least a new vacuum was easy enough to get. My dad didn‚Äôt have to drive it to work.
Do not do this üòÇüòÇ if you wanna rig something up, you can drop your headliner and drill holes down into the car and put a backing plate and hardened screws. 

The amount of stress my roof rack sees when I have my bike on it and the wind gusts while driving 60+ is insane.
Lol this is glorious.
How much meth did it take to decide to do this?
Get an anti zap for the battery too. I kinda think they‚Äôre a gimmick sometimes but have witness and ecu get fried from welding
Please tell me you drive a Nissan
So fkn dumb
On the bright side if he finishes this job and goes to use the rack he'll have his ride upgraded to a convertible
I thought I was in r/idiocracy when I first saw this, but no.
No fucking way this guy posted this‚Ä¶
wtf, who does this??
Man, I wouldn‚Äôt have done that.
dawg lmaoooooooo
Don‚Äôt feed the trolls.  Too late.
I'm pretty sure that's why they make weld blankets?
r/askashittymechanic
The money you saved by diy will help pay for the new glass
You deserve this you dumb fuck
I was welding on a bench and heard a noise. A car window on a shelf behind me had copped some spatter and popped.
On another note, is this a shitpost?
(Cringes) ouch, that's gonna leave a mark.


Edit: glass breaks. That's what it does.
You can see a small mark, and the lines of the glass radiate from it.  Can‚Äôt share images, so check my profile. You dun fucked up
Omg üò±
I weld on trucks. You have to put cardboard or something to protect that glass. Also, if you didn't put a surge guard on your battery you might have fried your cars electronics.
Broooooooo noooooooo
Yeah, don‚Äôt do that.
Holy shit dude, bolts
Gonna cost as much as the right racks now
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Jus get truck if u need the space that badly ü´£
Dude you‚Äôd be so much better off bolting that shit in as opposed to welding it.
Spatter will insta fuck up glass.  My girlfriend put her phone down by where I was welding and 20 secs later same as you. But I second not tacking/welding anything to that roof.  Roof are very strong as a unit, but not just a random part of the skin.

I‚Äôve never attempted to weld on cars but I‚Äôm gonna attempt to guess maybe the heating and cooling of the tacks pushed and pulled a little too much and put too much stress on the glass
Someone doesn't have a father figure in their life and also doesn't do any research before going thru with whichever idea pops into OPs head.
I did this on my truck, angle iron welded to the roof first and then racks to the angle‚Ä¶ way stronger, less flex. 

Not sure what you have planned to put on the rack but my 4x4 XPro seems to sit on it without issue.
That's what I get for buying cheap
This is why you see mattresses on the highway.
The back glass breaking probably kept the car from burning down. It's not hard to burn through sheet metal that's basically a glorified beer can; the headliner sitting right under that spot is a tad flammable.
My brother in laws dad took photos of a crash that happened on the trans Canada and the guy welded the 5th wheel hitch to the wheel well tubs of his pickup truckü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ the whole thing ripped off and the trailer rolled and the truck flipped too.
I don't know shit about welding.  That glass is shatter though is it not?  This has to be rage bait right?
who welds a roof rack to a car? The metal up there is like 0.12mm thickness anyways
This is one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve seen on this sub.
Just when you think you‚Äôve seen it all. Chef‚Äôs kiss right there
Cause OP is straight up brain dead.
Imagine being the family that got crushed under a load because they were driving behind this maniac on the highway
Can confirm spatter will break tempered glass. And melt into some windshields‚Ä¶
Yep, I cracked my phone screen with splatter once. It was sitting a decent distance from where I was working, on my work bench. I was so confused when I picked it up as I hadn't dropped it or anything. Took me a bit but I figured it out.
I am also assuming that he did not disconnect the battery before doing this which can lead to incredible amount of power running through the electrical system. In which case can cause an overload of power through the window defroster and cause shattered window.
I've only seen spatter melt into glass and become embedded.
I did tape on some cardboard around the glass, so I'm not too sure why it cracked
I would really hope it's tig or short circuit
Spray transfer? On sheet metal?
Yup that's the move, giving back the welder and bolting it on. Not risking anymore glass
[removed]
Bubba Likes It.
Nah, more like weld on cars properly to not do shit like this, otherwise I won't be able to put bull bars on my car
bro just get the right racks for your car or figure something else out for whatever you‚Äôre transporting‚Ä¶ DIY is not your thing and someone else is gonna pay for your mistakes down the road if you follow thru with this mickey mouse shit
Yup, I'm going to give the welder back and bolt the fucker down. Not looking to risk any of the other windows
Or when he opens one door and a giant ball of flame shoots out as the headliner and smoldering foam under it ignites with the oxygen infllux. 

Good times.  ( Õ°~‚ÄØÕú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Never heard of it but I did disconnect the battery before I did anything. Def look into it before I do anything else
I just disconnect the negative when welding on vehicles
You think you can weld to sheet metal on expensive cars?
No realy that part of the roof is not made to suport racks
Correction, thats what you get for BEING cheap. 

Cardboard and tape‚Ä¶.just deflecting some spatter downwards, maaaaybe but likely just cause a fire. But on a job the spatter will sit on and burn through? 

Put the tools down, sell them, and just pay a man. Now this job had cost you whatever you‚Äôre already into + glass and installation. 

Still cheaper to do it yourself? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

(Edit: spelling mistakes)
The cheap racks themselves are the terrible idea. The welding them to the fuckin sheet metal roof is the terrible idea...
Thats what you get for being stupid.
Just what part of this is a good idea?
I‚Äôd look at rivnuts I think it‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called. Can literally install anything onto your car spoilers u name it idk about roof rack that would seems structurally more tricky. But if welding does the trick then hey..
This is why there are shoes for adults with Velcro
when under pressure I think a beer can is probably more structural than the roof of a car
Have you ever looked inside those frames? It's full of insulating foam.

That stuff is more flammable than sawdust. He almost burned up his car.
Just had to rewire a shop because a guy renting a bay of the garage was welding on the door frame and the interior of the car caught fire. Luckily he only got some slight burns on his hands, from trying to put out the fire I think. It went up quick and did a lot of damage, fire department cut a big hole in the roof and two other cars were damaged. Of course they had no fire extinguishers in the shop.
Yeah, kind of hilarious h√© still wants to do the front side aswell.
At least he‚Äôs also dumb enough to document the evidence of this himself.
I was just thinking, I hope OP documents himself strapping the first load down so we can all see the glass shatter and car crumple from his ratchet strap.
This is a crazy idea. Happy far out Sunday.
Eitherway, enjoy your new ECU unit (and window).
That's regular glass. Tempered glass reacts very differently... Like this car glass. It shatters.
Cardboard. Famously resistant to burning lumps of metal.
Because you got spatter on the glass somewhere regardless of your tape and your cardboard. The tape ain‚Äôt stopping spatter at all and there‚Äôs a good possibility spatter will go through your cardboard too.
Ya know.....a polymer will hold super well, without the damage you caused? 

Fire blankets are cheaper than glass?
No no. Structural. Has to be up to code.
I don't think OP is capable of Tig with an idea like this, LOL.
It's a joke. You know, because he's welding a roof rack to his roof directly and in doing something so stupid he blew out his rear window.
Yeah, you wouldn't want to risk breaking another piece of glass. 

The other people on the road that might be hit by debris or the motorcycle rider that might crash when running over your loose shit? Fuck em bro, can't risk the glass...
[removed]
That‚Äôs not how that works, that‚Äôs not how any of this works. Put down the welder please.
Discover pop-rivets
Welds bill bars to the fiberglass bumper
But your not ‚Äúdoing it properly‚Äù
Nonsense.  Every modern car has a roof rack system available for it.  Even obscure cars in weird countries have roof rack systems available for them.
Nah bro, DIY is super my thing bc I'm broke. But doing it safely and smart is how I should be. Everyone here told me how stupid I'm being, do taking their advice which is bolting it is how I learn and grow as a person
Should be fine to be honest as long as the ground is good
Needs to just drill some holes and bolt it up.
That's fair, shouldve drank after the job is done
This dude short bus smart.
Bro. Slip ins ftw
Underrated comment right here
this is why i wear crocs
üòÇ
I've had metal melt into tempered glass on my work vehicle. It didnt shatter. Also tempered on worksites havent shattered. My guess is the window was pressed from the edge from warping and it wasnt splatter.
Lmao when you put it like that, I guess I need to buy some welding blankets before I do the front roof rack
Hahahahahaha deep breathe ahahahahaha
Yeah that's what everyone is saying, just gunna see if I can borrow a welding blanket or buy one for this job
Going to be hilarious when he loads it up and has the whole thing rip out of his car when he hits 45mph
Bro this is all typed, go outside
Even self-tapping screws would be better than what he's doing. Honestly I might prefer them for this case because the pop rivets might loosen due to repeated jostling, especially if he's not sure about how to install them like many people are the first time they use them.
The type of thinking that went through your head  to do this is the kind of thought process that has probably kept you from being able to afford the proper roof rack in the first place. If you‚Äôre going to be into DIY learn how to use google before you try something you know nothing about. Or even better accept you‚Äôre not DIY capable with everything.
You've already got a long list of excuses. No need to make up more
One of the happiest days of my 40+ adult life was the day I discovered slip-on steel toed boots.
You should scrap the welder before you do some more dumb shit. At least bolt it to your car if you‚Äôre going to put that on the road before it flys off and impales a poor kid right in the dick
I‚Äôm seriously hoping this is satire, you should not be welding racks to the thin sheet metal roof! Roof racks are designed to be connected at structural points, which you are currently not on, this is also going to rust, the vibrations from driving conditions, wind and weather are not going to fair well for this, the tacks are eventually going to break‚Ä¶

You should have more integrity than to be this stupid, not trying to be rude, but you‚Äôre risking people‚Äôs lives here‚Ä¶ not only that, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs regulations for this kinda stuff, if something does happen, you‚Äôre insurance can possibly find you at fault for modifying your vehicle in a way it‚Äôs a road hazard, leaving you financially /criminally responsible for any damages.
At least some damp rags you could find laying around you house
Jesus fuck dude.
You know that roof racks will cost you more gas, since the drag is increased, right? In many cases it's quite significant.
If you insist on doing the front one, jut bot the dam thing down. That's going to be safer than welding!
A blanket isn't going to protect the already broken glass smh. People like you are the reason why others think welders are knuckle draggers.
you can make a shitty one with a few layers of paper towel or cotton fabric; just be sure to regularly soak it with water, or if you want to go a little safer water saturated with baking soda.

That way it'll factor in nicely with the jank shit you've got goin on.
Give up your drivers license while you are at it.

And again.
Nah I just bought cheap cause the car ain't nothing special. I do flat bed trucking which isn't the highest paying job on the market, but I t allows me to live comfortably, afford my hobbies and still save up for my child. Not everyone is going to know everything doing anything and this is no different. I'm not a welder but I took up the chance to learn and try something new. And I made a mistake and learned from it. Which is why I ask on this site, to receive some knowledge and grow from it, mistake or not. If I were to accept I am not DIY capable then I would never grow, for mistakes is the best lesson to learn from. So many people want me to quit and stop, which I understand, I've created a situation where other can be hurt and I aim to correct that by directly bolting on the racks. I will not stop or give in, that's pussy talk.
If I had to make em up I'd be talking to your mother
That poor fuckin kid.
Take his dick and impale it! The olllll‚Äô dick impale.
I mean, the glass is already broke now, so might as well just stay on it. lol
Poor poor kid
Won't somebody please think of the children!

I will have a mark iv one day. This is its place holder.
True that, I own many suppressors, a Wolfman an an LPM torch and the LPM mach-s 30 cal,  a HUXWRX Flow 5.56 and the last one I was planning to get was 2x 22 cal suppressors. I almost wish I would‚Äôve started out with a couple of 22s for the bad ass AR-22s and the plethora of 22 pistols I have. I decided to get the 22s last because they‚Äôre pretty cheap and readily available. I‚Äôm actually glad I did that because the popular suppressors are getting harder to find with the wait times being what they have been the last 10 months or so. Ive bought 4 in the last 10 months and the longest wait was 56 days. The other 3 came back in about a week. I also did an SBR with a rifle I already owned through a form 1 and that took 8 days. So people are going crazy buying this stuff now and most places have pretty low stock.

Guys stop. Before you make me buy a ruger and 22lr can
I have several suppressors but I shoot a suppressed TX22 Compact 90% of the time. It‚Äôs just fun, which is why I started shooting decades ago. Surprisingly, it has never had a misfire or jam.
Your pistol is awesome

I felt the same way so I got one this year. Ruger as well with a Huxworx flow22

What length did you cut it too?
Waiting on my sparrow üò© they said 6 days to 2 weeks and I‚Äôm over a month in üò§ but the last one took over a year so I guess I can‚Äôt complain yet üòÇ
Have the same MKIVSSH. Can‚Äôt get it to run with Aguilla. All the special parts. 

Need to buy a different ammo but it sucks it struggles. They look perfect.
What about the ones with husbands and wives and girlfriends and boyfriends?
What do you feed that?
Got several but in .223 üòÇ
Agreed, that said the urge to shoot inside is too hard to resist sometimes lol
I would like to know what your real world experience is with the optics. I am near sighted and wear contact lenses. I find myself having a hard time and have resorted to iron sights.
But silencer or another .22??
100% agree. I think I need another 2-3 .22 cans.
Is it generally agreed that Ruger is the best for this, both with pistols and rifles? Seems I usually see Ruger Mark pistols and 10/22 rifles for this purpose, with the occasional Browning Buckmark.

Too much quiet fun!
Agreed. It‚Äôs way more fun than my rifle cans
I'm literally waiting on my form 4 to be approved for a rimfire can. The wait is killing me.
Thanks, now I have to throw my Walther PPQ 22 and Apex micro in the trash.
Califffffffffoooooorno
What optic plate ?
You‚Äôre not wrong! I need to scoop up a .22 suppressor and setup. I‚Äôve got a 10/22, although I‚Äôd have to get it threaded. Sick pistol btw!

Agreed
What do you all think about Banish cans?  Are they reliable? 

I recently saw an ad by Silencer Central has a BOGO sale- buy any Banish can >$849 and get a free Banish 22k V2. 

I'm looking for a big multipurpose can for my Sig p320 and getting the .22 rimfire can would be a nice bonus. 
Hell, I'd even go out and buy a .22
Hi.  I live in a country that doesn't have much in the way of guns, and while part of my brain would *really*like to own one of these, I can only really think of one use for it.

This is a Maker of Death.  Apart from silently extinguishing the life of a premeditated target, I'm at a bit of a loss what you'd use it for. 

Suggestions?
dont tempt me with another build please üò≠üò≠üò≠
Noice rig mate.
What is this gun???? 96/22? Didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing
That back porch/deck and view looks familiar. 
Nice buildon the rifle.
That thing looks weird and goofy, yet oddly appealing at the same time. I‚Äôll take two.
That is pretty awesome
I love this thing
Sheesh thats a beauty
Got a similar setup on my 10/22, but running a gemtech mist
If Ruger was smart, they would bring back the 96/22. 

10/22 magazine fed rimfire lever gun is such a good suppressor host. 

Been wanting one for a while but they always go for $1k+ on Gunbroker. I got other projects for 1k so can‚Äôt justify it now. Excellent build tho, love it
Homie is the lever what actually opens the action? But otherwise semiauto?

Can this be had for under $2k?

Agreed
Wow, that‚Äôs fantastic!
What suppressor is that?
Tell me about that stock.
How worthwhile is the volquartsen? I have my 22 suppressor approved but still haven‚Äôt bought a host for it and I‚Äôve been going back and forth between a few different options.
oh man you went balls to the wall with the volquartsen stuff

Greetings! From a fellow Mask and 502 owner
I have the identical setup. Love it as well!
mini mamba is pure sex
I have questions.
Neither Antonio Banderas nor Sly Stallone stand a chance against this man
The man the legend, arndog is on here too. Love the CGS Siren, Carbon Fiber tube always seemed so cool for a rimfire. 

Love your contributions to the silencer forum on arfcom.
Sweet!!! Any of them co witness
Is the volquartsen worth going straight to and if so, which would you choose between the mini mamba and 4.5‚Äù if you could only choose one? I‚Äôm leaning towards the 4.5 because I like the idea of being able to mount a light to it.
Is that a mustang on a 2 inch barrel I see near the bottom left?
a man of culture i see
Recommendations for pants-off silencer experiences?
and off
Looks great! 
I keep getting weird FTFs that are apparently specific to the comp model.

Do you know if Taurus‚Äôs customer service is any good?
its good to see that when small rodents try to take over theres a good few of us that can handle stealth operations against them ü§£
sick build, do you happen to have that sig brace anti-spin attachment?
I‚Äôm looking to turn my 10/22 with a oculus 22 into what you‚Äôve got there. After scrolling this post, it‚Äôs all pistols lol. Should I suppress my buckmark first?!
How are you liking the Tailhook? Would you recommend it over the SteadyBrace?
tempting to just start collecting every color ruger mark iv üòÇ
Good taste

thank you and shout out to Rey Cobarrubia in your Customer Sales & Service for helping me purchase the pistol!
what grips are those? and do they fit the 22/45 lite cause man theyre nice
hows that swampfox? i was planning on putting one of their micros on mine before i settled on the 508T
Mind sharing some details here?
my man
that one day was yesterday so you should do it now

hell yeah brudder
im more of busty dark elf tomboy with tanlines kinda guy
How did you get ahold of a two tone one? I‚Äôve only seen black and FDE
P322?
How do you like mini scorpion vs Rugers?
what trigger is that?  tia
based and green pilled
Can go on anything
Throw that baby on whatever gun you have in a caliber that will work with the suppressor. As long as it has a threaded barrel to work. I put my 9mm can on both my handguns. I can even put it on my AR. Just have to get the adapter.
Can go on anything (taking into threads and caliber of course)
I‚Äôm just hoping that Ruger gives us more of the ISB suppressor for the take down‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe they aren‚Äôt pumping them out lately. I wanna get my hands on one so bad. Lol
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MONTHS AGO
leave
silencershop edition, its made to 3"
maybe those people shouldnt have husbands, wives, gfs, and bfs and just stick to one person! 

cant imagine being married to multiple people while having gfs & bfs
everything
Yes.
Beautiful rifle man
So you can target practice, hunt, ect.. without losing your hearing.
A ruger 96/22. At surface level it's a lever action 10/22 and was discontinued many moons ago. The only parts directly interchangeable with a 10/22 is the magazine, and even then they're not a perfect fit. They really use the 77/22 magazine and barrel but the remaining parts are proprietary. 

I modded a kidd barrel to fit, and machined the rmr adapter myself.
No it's a lever action. So like any other lever repeating action lol. If you shopped around you could probably complete this for 2k. Good luck finding optic mounts for them. The receiver pattern is not the same as a ruger 10/22 so the mounts are not interchangeable. I had to custom machine this rmr mount. I made it last year when I was working as a cnc machinist before I came here to ocl.
Once you hit master prestige level 25 you get to unlock it üëç ü§£
You gotta tell me about that thing. I love my mark IV but this picture has me wanting to spend some money. Only hangup is that it looks heavy, and I need mine to be 7 year old friendly.
It‚Äôs standard issue once you become a member of the ‚Äúno bang otter gang‚Äù.
Sidewinder grip assembly from Enhanced Systems in AZ. Takes glock stocks. It's a neat little sbr for sure. Check em out, they have some neat shit like suppressed desert eagles too lol
Dead air mask. I like it, it's heavy tho. One of the first suppressors i ever bought back in 2018 when I had my own ffl.
I talked more about it under this same thread. The grip assembly is from enhanced systems in az. Takes glock stocks, and I currently have it setup for the cobra fab stock.
This started life as just a standard mk4 but over time I replaced the internals, bolt and upper with vq parts. I enjoyed it, and actually have been semi looking for another to pick up.
If you aren‚Äôt sure about spending a lot of money, just buy a mark IV lite. The trigger isn‚Äôt the best, but it smooths out pretty good after a few hundred rounds. Light as hell, very reliable, very accurate. I‚Äôm on the fence about building something around a Vol, but your standard mark IV with a can will definitely make you happy.
Credit card debt is temporary. Drip is eternal.

Using a mount that was printed by a guy here in the MKIV section. The Gowutar dot sits just low enough to use the stock sights.
IMO it‚Äôs not worth it.  Adding Volquartsen parts to a standard MKIV delivers the same accuracy.  Not going to lie the Mamba‚Äôs look cool though.  

I prefer the 4.5‚Äù Mamba for better accuracy and ease of mounting a light.
Yes it is.

Bolt action 22. Sure semi autos are fun and all. But the added quietness of bolt action makes them so much fun
Then you‚Äôre doing it wrong.
thanks, i like it, lol

I havent had to use their customer service yet, I don't think its that bad from what i have heard. they had some early on bad barrels and replaced them with out issue from what i remember. I wonder if you need a lighter spring or something because of the compensators weight, you would think taurus would have figured that out
My co-worker just confided in me that she moved to a differnt apartment complex due to an agressive racoon at the trash dumpster in her old unit.

I was like, I could have taken care of that for  you.
I do not. I put that on until i sbr it. Brace came off my rattler and it has been sbr'd
Simple answer, yes. This is the lightest 10/22 ive ever owned and the silencer is one of my OCL Titaniums. I started with a cheap 320.00 ruger 10/22 charger and ordered the chassis. 4.5 in barrel
I don't have the study brace so I can't compare. But I can see what they were trying to do with this, it's basically a stock, nice piece of metal very solid. 
When I was ordering I didn't really know what I was getting, I'm glad I picked this one
As you should!
Thanks man.  It‚Äôs a great little package.
Rey is the man!
They are from LOK grips.  I think they were 1911 grips I had to slightly modify to clear the bolt release or something.  Look under the 1911 grips

Thanks.  They feel great too.
It's alright. I'm not gonna say it's worth more than I paid. First one I got had a crooked reticle. This one has some reflection issues where in high light I see like two reticles. Don't have that issue with my Holosuns.
Basic Ruger MkIV Target.
Sent the upper to Maddmacs Precision Tactical in Georgia. He cut the barrel to 2.5‚Äù and threaded. Then added one of his in-house made optic mounts for the rear dovetail.
Absolutely i wanna be like the cool guys
I guess I know why they call it 50 shades of fde. 

It's not two tone it is fde the lighting makes it look 2 tone.
Yessir
https://www.keeptinkering.com/product-page/taurus-tx22-sao-short-stroke-trigger

Hands down better than the Tandemkross... 
And a hell of a lot less expensive...
very nice. Im wrestling with getting one of the Silshop ones or just cutting a tactical down. I kinda want to chop one to like 2" but im not sure if it would run unsuppressed that short.
Lmfao
I want one ü•π
bro, I used to get pussy, but now she left me after seeing this post.  Thanks a lot
im sorry a suppressed Deagle??? thats crazy i gotta see this
I‚Äôm not too concerned about spending a lot of money, I‚Äôm more concerned about the product being worth the money that I‚Äôm spending if that makes sense.
ü§ùüèºI see you have a dot for yours. Even more exquisite ü§ùüèºmine sure did come like that out of the box. I was under the impression that they all did. Yours didn‚Äôt? But which holosun is that? 4/507k? C? I‚Äôve been holding out on a dot because I‚Äôm unsure which one would fit well. I don‚Äôt want to get a 4/507k and it‚Äôs too small. But a C would be too big.
Nice!
Thanks!
Yea honestly a large part of wanting one is that they just look really awesome lol. The other thing is that I don‚Äôt really like ending up with a ton of extra parts laying around and it seems like after buying all of the volquartsen parts I may not really be that far off from just paying the ~$1300 for the black mamba right away.
I‚Äôm curious how that sounds. I can only tell a slight difference on a full length mark iv barrel. Still not uncomfortable to shoot without ear pro, but I‚Äôm curious if that short barrel really makes a difference. You‚Äôve got some nice set ups there.
I mean that‚Äôs the most expedient way of getting both kinds of drip‚Ä¶
I see. Thanks for the info!
I‚Äôve never gotten FTFs like this. The bullet nose goes into the chamber at a 45 degree angle, then the slide slams shut midway down the casing, and it needs to be manually removed. Happens once every 1.5 mags or so even with new mag and recoil springs installed.
I see. Yes the SteadyBrace is basically just a rectangular block with a slight hook on one end. This seems to be much better in terms of surface area.
Thanks for the referral
That definitely is it then lol and maybe cause I also have my screen brightness all the way down since I‚Äôm reading in bed. Great little pistol man. How do you like the venom?
the nice thing about the SS version is that the barrel diameter matches most 22 cans so theres an even flow line from the can to the gun
I was going to come in here and tell you it sucks and yadda yadda yadda, but that‚Äôs just not fair. I would be lying. 

I really just don‚Äôt want more gunbroker competition bidding on these when they pop up lol. Been watching for 2 years and seen about a dozen sell for $1k every time.
They're not cheap unfortunately. I'm about a grand into just the base rifle üòÖ
Kentucky Ballistics has one or two videos showing his off.
Yep, mine shot high and that‚Äôs exactly why I got the Holosun üòÇ. Mine is the 507c and I love it. Clear, first battery lasted a year and change and it didn‚Äôt hinder the performance on the 502 the added weight. It does come loose here and there but its easy to tighten back down. I dont think you can go wrong if you got one man!
It‚Äôs definitely not hearing safe in the short configuration.  I rarely ever use the short mode on pistols especially with short barrels.  Rifles on the other hand is a different story.
Have you tried polishing the feed ramp?
interesting, the way it jams almost sounds like weak mag spring but even new mags do it, and you changed the recoil spring but I assume with factory new, I wonder if wolf or somebody makes a lighter recoil spring, you might search because they are cheap enough to experiment with if anybody makes a lighter spring. you could try [THIS](https://shoptaurus.com/shop-by-model/pistols/taurustx-22/lakeline-tx22-stainless-recoil-assembly) spring setup from Lakeline LLC, they make nice stuff, I upgraded my G3c with their spring and guide rod setup. [Tandemkross](https://tandemkross.com/sentinel_steel_guide_rod-taurustx_22) makes a kit too. and [THESE](https://gallowayprecision.com/assembled-stainless-steel-guide-rod-for-taurus-tx22-pistols) guys make some kits.
I like the venom. For its price it does pretty well, not exactly hard use being on a 22lr. I'd get another one especially with vortex's warranty if it does ever break.
Ahhhhh i didn't think about that. Thanks for the heads up.
The pre requisite to being into NFA is hating money
Lmao! Mine does too. Not used to the suppressor height sights. I appreciate you! ü§ùüèºI did hear mounting for these were a nightmare ü•π and easy to break the plates. I wish someone came out with metal versions, or something more rigid. That‚Äôs my only complaint about this thing.
No sir. Would using only Mothers Mag polish work?
I appreciate the suggestions! I‚Äôm currently using a TandemKross trigger and a Galloway 13lb recoil spring. When it works, it‚Äôs awesome! Just frustrating it keeps having issues when it‚Äôs almost brand new still. 
Could a weaker recoil spring maybe help things? I just picked 13lbs because they said that‚Äôs OEM weight.
Thanks! I appreciate you. Currently in the market for a Dot for my 502. And my 10/22 charger lol I have some more HW to do.
I cant remember which plate and screws I used but I was actually able to do it myself! May take it by my in house gunsmith to see if he can clean my threads or work on a fix but its well worth it man!
thats just it, a lighter spring could help but it could also make it worse, a lighter spring will speed up cycling and make sure the slide moves all the way back but if your mag spring doesn't shove the bullet up fast enough it could make it worse. a heavy spring slows the cycling down and depending on how heavy may not allow the slide to go back all the way and pic up the round from the mag. that's kind of why I said a spring kit so you can play with it. I am a 1911 guy and have bought spring kits to play around with different weights and there are a few companies that sell kits with three different weight springs so you can tune the pistol. search and see if anybody makes a kit and I would start with lighter, good luck and if all else fails call Taurus I guess, wish I knew more about the TX22 but mine has been 100% reliable.
I've got quite a few of vortex's sights. I do they they are solid and you get what you pay for.
Nice! Wish me luck! lol
That makes sense. I think it makes sense to try some lighter recoil springs before sending it back to Taurus. Thanks again for the replies!
You're welcome, good luck!
I (kind of?) figured it out. The suppressor, even in short configuration, is causing it. But the error is this:

https://preview.redd.it/bmrwh3tyccwd1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=9709a703292a9b44a556c44ee614c80b42687861

I have no clue how to fix it. Stronger recoil spring? Weaker one? The whole reason I got it was to use with a can so that really sucks.
Gratitude 
I was trying to pay for my groceries this evening in Essex and the card readers were all malfunctioning and wouldn‚Äôt accept Apple Pay. Debit cards were working but I didn‚Äôt have my wallet with me. As the worker told me that there was nothing she could do, and I was preparing to unbag my groceries, a man who looked to be in his mid-20‚Äôs stepped in to pay. I was hesitant but he said he had spoken to his wife, who was smiling at me a few feet away, and he said it was no problem. I offered to Venmo it back to him but he refused. It was dinner for my family, including my daughter, and you saved me at least 45 minutes which kept our whole evening on track.

Thank you again and know that I will pay it forward by donating the dollar amount of my groceries to my local food shelf. I, like many of us, was having a terrible week but your kindness brightened my day. We have a special place here and people like you are the reason. 
There is/was a broad issue with debit transactions in the area. I am very heartened to hear this story, thank you for sharing. Vermont strong! Even if the country is seemingly in shambles.
Random acts of kindness like these help us go through these difficult times. üôÇüëç This is the standard and example we should ALL set. Not rounding people up to deport them. ‚òπÔ∏èü§¢ü§Æ
Great story. And why are grocery stores not taking cards?  Happened in our town today too
That‚Äôs so nice! One time this summer I had a quick conversation with someone next to me at the gas pump and when I went inside to pay,  the clerk told me that he had already paid for my gas! It was such an unexpected surprise, and it made my whole week honestly‚Ä¶ I wish I could find that guy to thank him
Love to read this. Be a good neighbor and pay it forward ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is why I have my wallet on me. I cannot scan my ID so I don't trust leaving my wallet at home. 

This is a sweet story. Pay it forward
I work on the front end at a grocery store in the area. Verifone did a remote POS update about 2ish months ago and we've all been having Apple Pay / Google Wallet issues ever since. At the moment it appears to SPECIFICALLY be MasterCard cards on ApplePay/Google Wallet. We've also been calling for weeks about the issue and we can't get a straight answer at all ü´†
Hanford Milton was same
Happy to hear about the kindness. I always carry my checkbook with me and think I will continue that.
Thanks for sharing your story. This is the second inspiring story I've seen on Reddit in the last 15 minutes. Just what I needed.
People. This person is expressing their gratitude for the help of a complete stranger. What the fuck does Donald trump have to do with this? Seriously? To op, you sound like a good person who was gracious for receiving help. You didn‚Äôt blame the store or the employee, and you didn‚Äôt act like you were entitled. So this is karmas way of thanking you.
***"Make America Kind Again"*** is one of my favorite t-shirts and it's time I start wearing it again.   
Stories like this make me so proud to be a Vermonter. Maybe Vermont can set an example that hate never made anything great.
I had a similar problem at Hannafords yesterday.
THIS‚Ä¶.   üò≠ü•∞
Nah. 

And if your wife divorces you,  she's still nta.
Lol. A terrible week. üòÇüòÇüòÇ get over it.
Unless it's the felon in chief who needs to go back to Russia...
Why are you making this post political?
I think by deporting illegals you‚Äôre being kind to the rest of the taxpayers
Cards were working, Apple Pay through my phone was not
It‚Äôs been paid!
I leave home without my phone all the time, never without my wallet. Fabulous to know there are still folk out there with hearts of gold.
I agree, it was a good lesson. I know my license number but you‚Äôre right about scanning it. Certain types of stores require it üòé
Ugh, thanks for the update. Almost everybody takes Apple Pay so I usually don‚Äôt care when I‚Äôve temporarily misplaced my wallet. I‚Äôll definitely be more careful moving forward.
Hannafords had a system wide issue yesterday. Affected stores all over Vermont and New Hampshire.
Good call. I keep a single check in my wallet but, well‚Ä¶
Glad it helped you too, friend!
Thank you for the kind words. Some of the commenters inferred that my bad week was due to the election and they were correct. You‚Äôre right that my main point was to share a moment that lifted my spirits and express gratitude, but I don‚Äôt mind the political discourse. If even half of the president elect‚Äôs policy ideas get enacted, it will impact all of us. It‚Äôs on a lot of our minds.
I got a text yesterday saying that Hannaford isn't able to process WIC transactions right now. I wonder if it's a related problem.
Hannaford
You will reap what you sow. What‚Äôs coming is coming for all of us.
I'd rather he stays here to stand trial, but I guess it's not going to happen now. (>.<)

You need this explained? Ok:

It‚Äôs a reasonable assumption election results were the worst thing to happen to most people in r/vermont this week. In case you missed it, 2/3 voted for a candidate that lost to an opponent that plans to dehumanize and persecute anyone that opposes them as ‚Äúthe enemy within‚Äù.
Tribalism and identify politics. Everything must be made political because they have no real identity outside of their chosen political team.
In fairness, I kind of did.
Do some research on how much money immigrants contribute to the economy. And it won't be immigrants attempting to cut medicare, medicaid and social security these next four years. That will be the GOP.
I'm all for a humane, respectful, rational and sensible immigration policy, which, yes, would include deportations. That makes absolute sense of course, every country needs (and has) one, and that's exactly what Biden proposed a few months ago, it even had bipartisan support. But Trump killed that because it didn't suit his purposes, and that's definitely and clearly not what we're looking at anymore based on what Trump and his surrogates have been saying. What they have in mind is - like almost everything else they do - clearly based on cruelty.
Totally!
It‚Äôs quite possible that the people who helped you were trumpers. It‚Äôs possible that some of the people you value and share memories with feel differently about politics than you do. I want people to understand that we all want freedom. We all do. We just disagree about how to get it.

It will be interesting to see if the Trump DOJ re-evaluates the case of mishandling classified documents by President Biden once he leaves office and is no longer shielded by the doctrine of not prosecuting current presidents.
Correct
If what you say is true, why didn‚Äôt he do that during his first term?
No friend. This is way beyond politics and what‚Äôs coming will impact all of us.
read closer, he said illegals. Illegal means you have done something against the law and there are consequences for breaking the law... or at least there should be. Also that would be the far right GOP. Moderates just need to stand up. Far right and far left politics are a no win for anyone but themselves.
Illegal immigrants do not pay any federal taxes .
ü§û
Several Democrats also voted against that bill.  It was rejected with bipartisan support, including a no vote from our independent Senator Sanders.
Sure it‚Äôs possible though highly unlikely given the makeup of Chittenden County. My problem with MAGAs is not that I don‚Äôt think they have any legitimate concerns, they absolutely do. My problem is the person they turned to to solve them. He and his surrogates have made clear that they intend to remove any and all checks and balances and that is not good for any of us. Only trump and the billionaire class will win, the rest of us will suffer. And before you say it, yes billionaires do well under democrats too. I don‚Äôt like democrats much more than conservatives do.
I'll take a look when I get back from the WalMarts
Not much grounds to revisit anything. Biden returned the docs as soon as he realized he had them. Pence was in the same boat if I recall. Both collaborated to return the docs in their possession. Trump only got in trouble because instead of openly collaborating and returning the documents, he hid them and lied about having them over and over, and obstructed justice in the process.
There's a problem in that Project 2025 reads quite Hitler-ish.
Too bad we haven‚Äôt seen any Left politics at all. Everything ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù in the US is still very conservative to the rest of the world. We‚Äôve become a far right laughing stock because nobody wanted to play hardball on the democrat team. We let a man convicted of 34 felonies win the presidency. If 34 felony convictions doesn‚Äôt come with ANY punishment, there is zero reason to think that crossing a border illegally to better your life should be anything more than a trespassing citation. If any person is denied a job from her on out, based on having a felony, the people should burn this entire country to the ground. Absolutely none of this makes sense. Breaking the law clearly isn‚Äôt even against the law anymore. Treason is no longer illegal. HAVE WE ALL LOST OUR FUCKING MINDS?!?!?
Shouldn't be any borders at all. Someone wants to come here, they can. Who the fuck cares. They need to establish residency before using any tax benefits anyway, who cares.
Great job on your research. Brilliant!
They pay in nearly $100B per year
WTF do they pay when they buy something that has a federal tax on it?
Point is: it would have passed had Trump not intervened.
You don‚Äôt think half of the population has any legitimate concerns? How about the ability to feed our families? How about not raising the tax burden so high  that it prices people out of their homes? How about not starting and funding wars that bankrupt us and cause inflation to skyrocket? How about not flooding inner cities with refugees which completely displaced the neediest population pushing them out of their cities and into ours because corporations need cheap labor, which affects those at the bottom of the wage scale even worse than those at the lofty educated top? This is why Kamala lost. Because she never made a single attempt to put forth any solutions to all the problems that she helped create? The funniest thing I keep hearing is the wealthy educated liberal class tell the working class to suck it up and get a better job or more education. Some people love what they do and do it despite the fact that they barely make it (farmers) and have a completely necessary job. Others don‚Äôt do well with education. It‚Äôs the lefts version of let them eat cake. I really can‚Äôt believe someone would actually say that. Most people don‚Äôt want to spend every waking minute working to support a family they don‚Äôt get to see as a result. Having a mortgage and kids made me go from voting for Obama twice to conservative because it was easy to be liberal when you don‚Äôt see how bad the government is at everything. Or how completely captured by corporations the media is. Or how badly our education system is while being inundated with leftist ideology.
Except it's still illegal. The crime is possessing/mishandling classified documents, and its a felony for a good reason.  Covering up that crime is another crime. Taking documents as a senator and vice president and saying "oops, sorry" when caught isn't a punishment or deterrent. 

I want/expect those at the highest level to be held to the same standard as an 22 yo E5 or other government employee who will do jail time and have their career ruined for that same violation.  

It's my hope that Trump is held to that standard when his new term is over.   For some dumb reason, we won't prosecute sitting presidents who clearly break the law. 

Giving a pass for illegal actions isn't helpful and simply sets a standard that bad actions are acceptable.
2025 was fake news written by Democrats to try to throw the election.  We all know how that turned out.
This is so true. The Overton Window is so far right.
a few million taxpaying citizens...
There are no general federal sales or use taxes in the United States.
We won't ever know.  It never made it to the floor for a full vote.
Right, but I think that DoJ usually looks for intent. And all three - Biden, Pence, and even Trump had he cooperated - could have reasonably argued (and did I guess) that they did not know and had no intent to conceal (plus I imagine they can probably argue that an assistant was handling the document and not them directly - however good of an excuse that is, it's still the reality, I doubt these guys carry their own docs).

Trump took it a step further :-D. Even had an attorney sign a letter that everything had been returned when he knew damn well it hadn't! The shit he's pulled is unreal, how he's not just walking around free but elected POTUS is something I'll go to my grave without ever understanding.

I would hope that a govt employee in the same case would be treated the same way.

Unfortunately our standards seem to have disappeared below the Earth's mantle ATM. Seems like there aren't any bad actions that aren't acceptable these days, in fact it almost seems like you're rewarded the worse you get...
Like Joe and Hunter! Who ACTUALLY did something WRONG!
Who would ever write a book that thick with attribution for fake news?
This doesn't make any sense.

It was written by the Heritage Foundation, a long-standing conservative "think"-tank.

The provenance of it is very well known.

Why do you think it was "fake news"?
It was on the Heritage Foundation website!
What?
What is the Federal tax on gasoline? Oh right. Immigrants never drive cars.
The Heritage Foundation has been publishing written policy resolutions and comprehensive recommendations for U.S. government reforms since 1981.

Center for American Progress (CAP) and Third Way are two prominent Democratic aligned think tanks that publish written goals and policy recommendations.

The same stuff happens on both sides, just one is far more publicized and weaponized.
Easy‚Ä¶Democrats!
you said who cares
That's an excise tax --- not a sales or use tax, which is what I was posting about and which are more inline with your "when they buy SOMETHING" post. 

There are also federal excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, but if the "something" your illegal immigrants are buying isn't fuel, booze, or smokes, then they are not paying any taxes to the federal government, nor are they paying federal income, social security or medicare taxes.

That being said... you keep saying "immigrants", but you replied to a post referencing "**illegal** immigrants". These are not one in the same and it's xenophobic of you to think they are. Legal "Immigrants" built this country - and are the backbone of our current nation. There is a difference.
Yep, but they've never built a shadow government in advance before.
Yeah, why? I don't pay taxes to new Hampshire, does it mean I can't hop over for cheaper booze once in a while? It's all just lines on a map some government hoity toity came up with anyway.

This is my cue here to rant about how much I hate cast iron. No putting it in the dishwasher‚Ä¶you have to do some esoteric rite to ‚Äúseason‚Äù the thing‚Ä¶ oh, and it weighs as much as a Buick. For sure there‚Äôs other cookware that gets similar results that does not require allll the special TLC.
Politically, howevs..I‚Äôm 100% on board for mocking Vance.

Really got him there

wow showed him!
I dare say not a real person... How long have you worked here? OK, good. What do people order for doughnuts? OK, good. You don't want your face shown? OK, good.

Dude is some kinda weird robot.
It seems daunting, but it's not that tricky to work with. Seasoning isn't some weekly ritual, you do it once when you get the pan, and then again each time your in-laws put it in the dishwasher. Like three times a year max.
But you get a unique flavor with cast iron, AND some iron leeches into your food!¬†
I‚Äôm a big cast iron girlie myself. But every time I go to use it and it‚Äôs not in its proper form of seasoning I go to my all clad stainless steel instead. üòÇ
Bacon will season it.¬†


Grilled cheese.¬†


¬†Repeat.¬† ¬† Repeat again.¬†


¬†Cook an omlette on it.¬†¬†


Abuse¬† from time to time.¬†


It will take care of itself.
It‚Äôs super easy to clean and keep nice. When I‚Äôm done cooking, if there‚Äôs anything stuck on I pour in a couple cups of water and let it boil, then give it a quick scrape off with the spatula while boiling. Then it goes in the sink, sprinkle on some kosher salt and give it a quick scrub with a chain mail scrubber to get off anything really stuck on and then rinse it off. At that point it‚Äôs clean, and if it‚Äôs looking a little dull I‚Äôll just wipe the inside with vegetable oil and leave it on a low burner for an hour or so. This pretty much keeps it in perfect condition to cook. It‚Äôs no harder than cleaning any other pan really, just scrub it with coarse salt instead of soap. On the plus side you aren‚Äôt dealing with a nonstick coating that will eventually break down.
You just clean it as normal with soap tbh. No seasoning necessary.
And now he‚Äôs the vp goddammit
I‚Äôm Infamous for making something cheesy in it then throwing it in the oven to forget it exists. üòÖ
Wait‚Ä¶ you think that adding layers of cooking stuff without washing the pan is the ‚Äúseasoning‚Äù? Oh no lolllllllll
Yep.. It's an embarrassing day for America. And MMW trump won't live through the next 4 years, and I am in no way implying or encouraging an assignation. The dude looks like hell and is the oldest president ever and is super unhealthy. And we all know the toll a 4 year term takes on each and every president.

The scary part right now for me personally, well just one of the many, is that Vance will become president by default during trumps term. And that is something to be afraid of. I think he would push the project 25 narrative much further than the orange idiot would. But I could be wrong.

Either way I'm pretty disappointed in 51% of American's right now. But the difference is I'm not going to throw a tantrum, riot in the street, or storm the godamn capital. I'm going to be pissed, annoyed, let down and dumbfounded over the next few days, but I will move on and just keep working and living. That's the difference between a normal American and maga.

Edit for clarity - trump would be the oldest president ever should he make it thru the next 4 years
I believe he does that AND reuses his condoms
Just put the oven on 500, turn on the fan, open the door and - voila - reseasoned!
Keep having this discussion with my boyfriend‚Ä¶ he insists they don‚Äôt need to be washed (I wash them when he‚Äôs not home) and that the crust on the walls is ‚Äúsupposed to be there‚Äù ü§¢
Iron skillets are not that precious. They get seasoned, like it or not.
I bet their food tastes better than yours
Removing all coatings  via a wood fire allows a fresh start on seasoning.
Seasoning is a process where you spread a thin layer of oil onto a clean cast iron pan and then bake it at a high temperature. Seasoning is not a buildup of oils that you just leave on the pan without washing it hahaha
I honestly thought they meant that they let everything build up and don‚Äôt wash it ever. I season my cast iron every few months, but I wash it with Dawn after I use it.
Yes, and ordinary use seasons a pan
It was difficult having to sell/leave the house you hand made all the metalwork for.  
I had done everything custom at my own place.  16‚Äô roller gate for shop entry, two man gates with sun designs.  Fenced in front porch with CNC‚Äôd  spacers, and hand forged spikes.  French gate doors that are vine trellises with planter pots with drainage at the bottom of each door.   Snake latch for front entry.  Custom beam brackets for the entry overhang.  I made planters for garden use with drip systems. I also had. 20‚Äô swimming serpent sculpture of caged rock as a front yard display piece.  
That's beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
That dragon is beautiful. What a smart use for those rocks to add the texture and color of scales!
I love all of it. That would be a tough one but hey now you can make more awesome metalwork at your new place!
Every artist needs a new "canvas" every once in a while.
My God the absolute quality of craftsmanship In these photos is outstanding, bravo.
I hope the buyers will enjoy their new home !
Did you do the glass work also? It's fucking awsome. I have a few pieces I'd like to put glass in, but that isn't a skill in my toolbox yet. Any suggestions on where to start as far a learning resources?
Opportunity to build more at the next place!
If they don‚Äôt write in the contract they want all that amazing work, I‚Äôd be tearing it out on my last day! (0_0). Taking THIS with me!
What part of Arizona?
So stunning
Not a loss, an opportunity to create something new and better for your new digs
Saw this in r/stainedglass. So so good.
You are a master craftsman my friend I home the new owner appreciates all your work
Wish I had half your skills bud.. excellent work. Sorry you have to give it up
Why did you have to sell?? I could never
Now you have a new canvas.
Lovely work.

I also live in a cold climate, and that giant cactus in the front really tickles my fancy.

Im a metal tradesmen myself, and i really appreciate all the work you did here.

Top notch.
At least you can upsell and get your money's worth. Come up north and try it again.
I love everything. That's some serious attention to detail. Gotta be hard to say bye to that saguaro, but now you get a blank canvas
Beautiful, do the new owners appreciate it ?
Sick house!
What an amazing talent. Think about the beauty and function you've left the new owners to enjoy!
Wow beautiful work!!!! I would fee the same ....but .... you will have a new canvas !! And make more spectacular creations!
Isn't this why they bought the house!?

Me too
take a stained glass class.  Finishing one project from start to finish will be enough to understand the basic tools and processes.  These gates I sorta did an experiments process of sandwiching the glass panels with silicone and CNC‚Äôd patterns.  The first two man gates gave birth to more easily removed steel panels that held the glass.  These designs are solid, but if the glass was broken, I found it required re printing the cnc patterns and re sandwiching the glass for a full replacement.  So in terms of of longevity I would further the design by making the steel that sanwhiches the glass thicker so when you pull the steel plates apart they don‚Äôt bend out of shape, and you can replace the glass and re sandwich the same steel CNC‚Äôd panels.  Or even further, have the soldered windows sit cushioned somehow without having actually glue/silicon holding it in place.  Allowing to easy removable and fixing as needed
Ty!  And yes, ideas are in the works
We signed for house as is.  I would have as well but we were getting a really good price for the sale
This was in the Scottsdale area

Haha, we needed horse property and middle of Scottsdale wasn‚Äôt going to work for horses.
One day I‚Äôll have enough time to do that
Ty!
I‚Äôd love to deck a whole house out with style again
There‚Äôs some sweet saguaros on the new property so happy I still get epic desert vibes
They haven‚Äôt taken anything down so I think that counts lol
They‚Äôre probably flippers.   Gonna paint everything a shade of gray and list it for 50% more than they paid.

Actually he needed the shop for his own purposes
statistical likelihood is the new owners are blackrock investors that will tear everything down and build some soulless modern rental property out of it
Imagine what their grandkids will tell their kids about that great work!
I figured as much. Absolutely beautiful work dude. I lived in Scottsdale from birth to 27 and did some welding but nothing like this.
Actually it‚Äôs a muscle builder who turned the shop into a epic gym
That would be depressing.
I hate that.¬†
Ty
I sold a house with a bunch of custom metal work and the new owner kept it all when she turned it into an airbnb. Cool to see my work survive and knowing that other people are enjoying it. She actually just listed the house for sale for a lot more than she paid, but she's selling it as a "successful airbnb" and is trying to sell all her furniture and decor with it.
I hate it too. I don‚Äôt want to enter a discussion about politics because it gets real nasty real quick. But, what I will say is this: November is 2 months away. Don‚Äôt like it? Let‚Äôs do something about it.
Why does this keep happening?
Somehow over the past few years I have had to replace the lower control arm (and whatever other necessary parts) on both the driver side and passeneger side (twice each). I'm not a bad or reckless driver. I'm honestly super cautious because one of the times these broke I was on the freeay and I've been paranoid and extra cautious ever since. Yet somehow I'm replacing one of them on average every year. What could be the cause? I do live in southeast Michigan which is known for having some bad roads but I usually drove on roads filled with potholes so I don't think that's it. I do drive about 60 miles each day to work and back so maybe the high mileage has something to do with it but i feel like this has happened more than it should. I'm just tired of having to get this same repair done and also feeling nervous that it's gonna break any time I drive.

If you keep having ball joints come apart, you need to start buying better quality parts.¬†
https://preview.redd.it/uvvt8qixg6vd1.jpeg?width=808&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=642e355f475d52110491b42ecbd8db48350c1d41

So that‚Äôs what left of your lower ball joint. It should be all shiny and smooth like it has been living in a tightly machined socket with a film of grease to reduce friction. Clearly it has been compromised and corroded. That corrosion slowly wears the ball down making it smaller, until it‚Äôs small enough to pop from the socket (outside of this picture frame to the left still attached to the steering knuckle) and the Ka-chow you‚Äôre getting towed.

You can shop for better parts. Preferably lower ball joints that have a grease fitting so you can periodically pump fresh grease in and push out any contaminants.

Additionally, try harder to avoid potholes. That‚Äôs a tall order in Michigan, but those repeated jolts and shocks from dropping into and popping out of potholes does a lot of wear and tear on ball joints.

Another preventative would be periodic inspections. If you lift the car off its wheels you can test the ball joints and hub bearings for play that would be an indication of wear long before they fail and strand you.
When you replace the control arms....are you replacing the ball joints also? cause there control arms do not come with the ball joints
>maybe the 60 miles a day

no, absolutely not the cause. 

Looks like the ball joint is the failure point. at first glance I would have said your knuckle failed to hold the ball joint in but looks like the ball joint might just be of cheap quality and separated. make sure the shop is replacing the arm AND the ball joint, if not potentially having to replace the whole knuckle/wheel bearing assembly.
Forgot to mention but it's a 2006 honda accord if that helps.
I would be suspicious of the quality of ball joint they‚Äôre buying. Parts stores don‚Äôt always have the best quality of parts. I would buy an oem brand Honda ball joint. Looks like it failed at the ball joint itself.
Did you  try a different parts supplier? Shocks working and alignment in spec?
Bet it‚Äôs the part supplier. Years ago I worked at a shop and we replaced 3 brake calipers on a Honda accord three days in a row. Found out they were being improperly assembled at the factory. I‚Äôd look into getting a different brand replacement part.
In your case the cause is likely the lower ball joint rubber boot was torn, and the ball joint dried out causing it to wear and fail. Unlikely related to aggressive driving or northern winter.

The lower ball joint does NOT get removed with the lower control arm on 08-12 accords. They are pressed into the steering knuckle from the inside of it. Replacing it is a big pain that requires lots of work and specialized ball joint press kit. If you did not explicitly state this to your mechanic and pay big money, that lower ball joint would NOT get done no matter how many times you replace the lower control arm. No sane mechanic would do this lower ball joint job for free.

To answer your question why this happens: this is a double wishbone suspension, so the lower ball joint is a loaded ball joint. It constantly loads the entire weight of the car on that wheel. Being a double wishbone, steering is also accomplished by this ball joint spinning in its socket. When its rubber boot is intact and it is greased well, it is designed to practically go forever without fail. I've seen 150k, 200k mile accords with lower ball joints tight as new. That is PROVIDED the rubber boot did not get damaged. The moment that rubber boot gets damaged, water and dirt gets in, grease leaks out and dries, and the ball joint start going metal to metal. It constantly spins under the weight of the entire car every time you steer, and it wears itself out very fast. Once it wears it self enough to pop loose from the socket, this happens. As you can see in the picture, your ball head is completely dry and heavily worn.

In summary, in ANY double wishbone vehicles, keep that lower ball joint boot intact! This not happening depends almost entirely on if you tore that boot from maybe some random road debris.

This can be prevented via annual inspection of the lower ball joint. Inspection procedure would include inspecting the boot for tears and leaks and using a pry bar to pry around the ball joint for clunk. If your mechanic does this yearly then the issue would have been caught.
Need a new steering knuckle and ball joint. Hole for ball joint is wallowed out
This keeps happening to you?

Are you Homer Simpson or something?
Just a thought here. That looks like a Honda/acura setup. The ball joints should be pressed fit into the steering knuckle, if the bore of the knuckle is worn then the ball joint won‚Äôt be tight enough and be prone to come out easier than it should.

Edit on closer inspection that ball joint pulled right out of the socket.
KACHOW!!
HOW OFTEN DOES THIS HAPPEN ?!
That ball joint either had no grease when it was installed, or it came off of a 200K mile car in a junkyard and was already dry and worn out before it got put on yours.
Once a year jack up your front end and try and wiggle the tire at 12 and 6 (ball joint) and 3 and 9 (tie rods) if it has play (movement) replace corresponding components.
Looks like that ball joint has been running dry for quite some time.

If you‚Äôre commuting 60 miles a day (16k+ miles per year) in a typical urban setting, you‚Äôre going to want to get some decent serviceable ball joints, and visit a shop for a lube, oil, and filter service about every 10-12 weeks on average. (Approx 3000 miles)

Don‚Äôt believe the manufacturer literature that says you can go 5, 7, or 10k miles between service with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù driving, as their definition of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is not the way that most folks use a car.

Instead, most people fall under ‚Äúsevere‚Äù driving conditions, which they define as things like:

Frequent idling for long periods of time

Stop-and-go driving in heavy traffic

Sustained highway driving in hot temperatures

Sustained highway driving in freezing temperatures

Short trips (less than 5 miles) in normal temperatures

Long-distance trips at speeds of 50mph or less

Regular trips along steep hills or mountains

Any trips along dusty, muddy, salted, sanded, or gravel roads

Any trips that involve towing a trailer or a camper

Any trips that involve transporting items via roof rack or car-top carrier

Those all shorten the maintenance interval recommendation significantly.
[deleted]
It's not 100% clear to me what the failure mode is. Did the ball joint disassemble? That is to say, is part of the ball joint left in the knuckle?

If the ball joint disassembled, buy better ones and don't steer while stopped. If the ball joint is entirely pulled (in one piece) out of the knuckle, I'd replace the knuckle too.
Is it possible that ur control arm broke last time and the ball joint broke this time? That ball joint doesn't look 1 year old. Regular maintenance inspections should catch these before they fail like this. If you are having a shop look at the car when you have oil changes and such. I would recommend a different shop. This should be found by any shop but also if you had refused the work than it's on you.
I'd look into replacing the knuckle.  If the ball joint has been sliced through that thing more than once,  then it's probably not getting a proper grip on the new ball joint after install.
Do you keep reusing the same part? ü§£
Holy shit dude, please buy better ball joints or find a mechanic who actually knows what theyre doing, this shouldnt even happen ONE time let alone multiple üò≠
I see a lot of rust dust at the bottom of the ball there. I‚Äôm betting there was good warning here. That clunk over bumps wasn‚Äôt nothing after all!
Show us the outside of the wheel . . . .
What is the quality of the parts you‚Äôre using?
Stop hitting the curb
Don't buy cheap parts when it comes to road safety, also always torque to specs if available.
Who is installing the CV axel? They aren't getting it seated correctly.
Looks like cheap no lubrication parts.
That is a ball joint problem, not a lower arm. The ball joint fell apart. Two reasons: part quality (if you ever replaced it) or you need to pay better attention to suspension conditions especially while driving on roads covered with potholes. Drive save.
Dude.... I've been driving Accords for 25 years. I've had ball joints go bad, but I've never had one let go like that. My daughter drives a 7th gen sedan like that, and it's got 300,000 miles on it. It's never had a ball joint totally let go. You gotta fix those things when they start knocking and squeaking. Those things should be looked at for play whenever you rotate the tires. I personally inspected mine every 6 months, minimum. Those things don't just fail overnight. They give plenty of warning signs like knocking and squeaking, and you can feel it in the steering wheel.
Keeps happening?????
You NEED to buy OEM. Aftermarket has gone to complete shut. None of them are good. NONE!
parts quality issue. Do not cheap out on this type of ball joint, their a terrible style where the shock is constantly trying to pull the ball joint out of its socket, compared to others that push it into its socket.  they tend to go from bad to toast quite quickly.
Kachow
You might want to replace the cv axle and brake soft line as well‚Ä¶
Broken ball joints are common for overweight drivers. Try losing some weight and if that doesn't work, grease the ball joints.
That‚Äôs a nice angle kit you‚Äôve got there
Cheap parts. Buy OEM, not cheap crap. Don‚Äôt buy any parts even if labeled as OEM off Amazon, they are probably not OEM.
If this KEEPS happening where the balljoint falls out of the knuckle, you need an oversize balljoint or a new steering knuckle. Balljoints are pressed in very tightly and should not under any circumstances just "come out" unless the hole they press into is worn. Everyone in here saying "get better parts" is slapping a bandaid on the real problem
What your TEMU Chinese lower ball joints keep failing.....who woulda thunk it!!!!!!!!
Don't buy suspension parts off Amazon
The old adage (when you buy the cheapest part you get the cheapest part)
Bro is this a ford focus
you don't like notice the steering going to shit and the clunking over bumps or any other warning signs that there's a lot of slop in the ball joints until it completely fails??  

are you jumping speed bumps??

aiming for potholes??  

this isn't normal.
Common problem on these accords. Only use an OEM replacement ball joint. Aftermarket ones wear out and fail quickly.
That ball joint has been toast for a long time. Dry no grease, rusted, control arms strut mount busing collapsed. This brings has probably been making all kinds of noise for a while.
Food for thought, has the car been wrecked previously? Or do you have an alignment printout? It's unlikely that normal wear will cause poor enough alignment to cause a failure like this, but a bad repair after an accident can cause angles to be significantly off and result in part failures like this.
Your photo shows the lower ball joint failure. On your car, the lower ball joint and the lower control arm are two separate parts. Perhaps you replaced the lower control arm and not the bal joint? That ball joint really looks quite old.
Replace your mechanic and see if that fixes the problem.
Look like u need a good quality control arm
Accord? Are you getting the correct balljoint for the trim?
Get your lower control arm from TRQ or 1A Auto, i just replaced it 1 1/2 years ago. Get a whole set; lower control arm with ball joint , axle , sway bar, tie-rod and strut shock, for both sides : rent all tools for free from Auto zone, get some arms and do it. I did it 1st time in 2016 ( mil. 90000 , its 2010 nissan) and 2024( mil.187,129) . It will work for sure. Its been 14 years i gave been driving my car and fixing it on my own. Never ever been to any mechanic.

If you're buying the parts from an auto parts store and not from the dealer, then that's your problem. The A/M parts are made of Chinesium materials, for the most part they aren't made the same. Spend the extra $$ and buy OEM parts.
So alot of honda accords have been coming into my shop and people have either had bad ball joints or a new one recently installed have this issue. What I have found is the ball joints are a one time press into the knuckle. So if this happens again I would say change the knuckle and lower control arm. The knurling on the ball joint doesn't grab tight enough to the knuckle, or the lower control arm gets wallered out making it impossible to keep it secure. Yes it's more expensive but in the last 2 years around 40 of them have been towed into our shop with the same issue.
If your wheels are aftermarket and do not conform to factory specs for offset and diameter, they could be creating too much load stress on the lower control arms. This can also lead to wheel bearing failure. Otherwise, the torque issues and the grease fitting being serviced are good practices to follow.
7th gen accords are notorious for balljoint failures, made much worse if using lower grade aftermarket replacement parts. Need to use a high quality balljoint.
Is it all those potholes and curbing that sneaks up and jumps in front of you like its a Halloween Horror house?
car needs to get a good nights sleep - poor guy is just exhausted.
Ball joints is a lifetime part for 85% of the population üòÖ. Just saying
This is a ball-joint failure. It could be that you're buying really cheap ball-joints, but I'd bet it's because you're going around corners too fast. You say you're not aggressive, but that's highly unlikely based on my experience.

When you drive aggressively, especially going around corners too fast, you're putting excessive loads on the suspension and steering components. That will wear them out much faster, or even cause them to fail outright. If they're not sealed (they need lubrication) and you're not lubricating them, it's even worse. 

If we assume you're putting in quality parts and they're being installed correctly, the problem is the driver. 

Based on what I can see in this picture, the ball has separated from the socket, and isn't lubricated at all, it looks completely dry. That tells me it wasn't lubricated from the factory, and is almost certainly the cause of the failure. 

Have them remove the ball joint as it is, and post some pictures of it. I'd like to get a closer look.
my control arms I replaced did come with the ball joints, but yes you could replace those by themselves if you wanted to.  But wow, that is impressive. Really glad I did mine as I was getting cupping issues.
Weak parts is my guess. Did they grab the lower control arm and stuff from a junkyard?  Have them install new high quality parts
Use better quality parts (OEM if you‚Äôve tried different aftermarket brands) and get the vehicle inspected regularly (joint in the photo is rusty/doesn‚Äôt have any signs of grease + it would have made clunking noises before separating).
Hi there, is this a 2006 Accord Hybrid?
Are you getting the OEM replacement or aftermarket?
Wife is trying to collect insurance.
Impact
Take it to another shop
What is your driveway situation? Do you have a pretty mean incline, dip, or any transition the car goes over on a daily basis?
Better quality parts and never ignore knocking noises from your front suspension. Every oil change your car should have a brief inspection with more focus on the front end. Find another mechanic.
Rock auto baby, never fails. Get manufacturer parts, not cheap knock offs
You didn't tie your shoelaces properly
Everyone‚Äôs just saying buy better quality parts, but I assume you paid to have the work done at a shop? Was it the same shop for each repair? If yes, it‚Äôs time to find a new shop, they were likely using cheap shitty parts or maybe not even repairing it correctly. A new ball joint and control arm should last at least 100,000 miles.
A big factor in ball joint life span is the CORRECT SPEC. TORQUE for your vehicle. 

Books will lay out steps, whether or not to torque under load (on the ground or on the lift), lb-ft rating for ball joints and sway bar linkages, etc. 

Had a shop install new LBJs/UCAs: they torqued them so tight my steering wheel would not return to center without my hands doing so. They said, ‚Äúnew ball joints just need to wear in, it‚Äôs normal‚Äù

Went to the dealership to have some accountability and proper torque ratings. No problems since üëç
You got the Lightning McQueen model.
Keep happening ? That ball joint looks toast. Had mine fail in my is300, Tore my whole fender up.
Looks like you can take very sharp corners.
Need a different mechanic.
That ball joint has never seen grease.
kaCHOW - 


it needs to stop rizzing up the passer-by Porsches
Perhaps your shocks suck and your balls are paying the price. And I‚Äôd double check your rubbers in the other control arm contacts. As well as the strut mounts. Also, where is the control arm? Inner or outer?
If you can, replace those ball joints with OEM parts. These are pretty common failures in hondas. 
Also be sure to check them out every now and then (10-20k kms).
Just got these bad boys replaced on my 2009 accord euro.
I had a constant fear that this would happen to me as well.
Aftermarket honda axles are known to pop out the intermediate shaft . Get oem axles
Better mechanic, better parts.
Looks like it pulled through the knuckle. Have the front steering knuckles ever been replaced?
That looks like a worn out ball joint that should have been replaced a long time ago.  It seems to be happening due to a lack of maintenance.
Honda world. From 2003 to 2007. 
Never could understand.
Find a different mechanic.
Don‚Äôt buy your parts from wish.com.

Seriously though I don‚Äôt know the vehicle but make sure you know where the replacement parts come from
If this keeps happening man idk what to tell you. Lol
Gotta give props to that cv axle and the boots.
F@!#
Are you greasing the balljoints?
Did you change these yourself each time? If not are you sure your mechanic replaced everything he said he did? That ball joint is dry and rusty that's not a good sign! Where's your control arms? That's not good either! Did the flat bed driver just drag the car up the ramp with your wheel chicken winging like that and dragging the front of your car all the way? 

1. if it was you who did the work hire a mechanic.
2. If it wasn't you fire your mechanic
3. If the flatbed driver drug your car like that punch him in his damn mouth and put em on mega blast cause that's flagrant as F@%k.
Happened to me, did you add the locking pin on the ball joint ?
Time for a newer or different car or mechanic or both.
Looks like your mechanic just buttoned up the car rather than just replace the parts. In all my years of working on cars, I have never seen something like this happen repeatedly,  unless you like the smack curbs or hit massive deep pot holes
Is it just this photo or do you have ZERO Bushes/bushings on the first joint up from the ball joint?? Thats your problem
Because manufacturers decided grease fittings were stupid‚Ä¶and they decided that because owners didn‚Äôt bother greasing said fittings!
  Honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a part fail that was greasable. Because I actually keep up with maintenance.
Honda life unfortunately
It‚Äôs at this point you should really be looking at your installation or we can classify it as ‚Äúoperator error‚Äù
Kechow
Buy better parts and change shops if your not doing the work yourself.... Maybe the installer isn't doing it to torque spec or maybe the parts utilized are junk
Only buy oem suspension components unless you trailer your car places
Is this a honda accord‚Ä¶.
Probably because u don't maintain your vehicle
Good news is you need tires anyway so no loss on the tire.
This has happened before ?
Lack of lubrication and and rusted 
Nothing to so with factory torque. Probably cheap parts
Get a new mechanic and maybe look at filing a lawsuit, none of those parts are a year old, and I live in southwest michigan
You or someone else is hitting potholes or whatever and then you or your mechanic are not using good parts.
That thing is holding on by the brake line lol
I can‚Äôt tell if it is how this vehicle is sitting after being broken or not but is this vehicle stock height or lowered?  If it is lowered it can have an impact on suspension components.  Also never go with the cheaper suspension replacement parts it is worth it to pay upfront for better parts.
Not properly installed lower ball joint. There's a snap ring that is supposed to hold it in place.
You keep buying Hondas! The things have faulty design
How do people not feel or hear the rattling going on as these parts are failing? I just don‚Äôt get it. You really shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to have a car.
As a fellow Michigander, it's the roads. Not you.
Buying cheap, low quality parts, and treating them like an item replacement will never last very long....
That ball joint looks rusty af
Is it a chevy?
Cheap parts or bad driving
Ball joint issue. 

Buy higher quality parts or go OEM if you don't know the aftermarket scene.
It's a fine time to leave me losses wheel, with 3 happy wheels and a crop in the field.

I've had some bad times, Lived through some sad times but this time my loose wheel won't heal.

You picked a fine time to leave me loose wheel.
Lower control arm and ball joint failure
That ball joint looks very dry,do they have zerk fittings and if so have you been adding grease after installation and lubing them regularly? How old is this balljoint? It could be a parts quality issue. 

You should be checking for front-end play every oil change to prevent this from happening.
You need to stop buying cheap parts
Besides buying quality parts that ball joint looks dry with no grease
Yeah, I agree those ball joint have like zero grease on them. Again, very poorly installed.
Drinking and drinking
Where and how much u spend on the joint last time u replaced it.
Those lower control arms and ball joints must be made of chinesium
Shitty parts and shitty mechanics usually will cause that
‚Äú‚Ä¶.. keep happening?‚Äù 

How many times has that happened?
looks like a 7th gen accord, typically i‚Äôd recommend Moog but some ppl have said their quality has gone down. I went with Sanki 555 their oem they are pretty thick. I‚Äôve had them on for a few months as of now and highly recommended by others. Can find them on PartsGeek for a decent price.
Lack of grease when installed 
Some mechanics won‚Äôt grease them when they install new steering/ suspension parts so that they have to get them replaced again in a year or two. Just enough to not be warrantied. There is assembly grease on some part manufacturers which is never enough. Also being in a cold climate you may not have grease that is rated for your temperature.
This why you need to rotate the air in your tires.
This reminds me of the honda ball joints. They always do this here. Very dangerous.
Wow that‚Äôs painful to watch. Good thing my ball joints for 10 years ain‚Äôt like that. And it‚Äôs not even replaced yet. Haha!
KA-CHOW
That used to happen to me. Turned out where the ball went into the steering knuckle was slightly out of shape allowing it to slip out. Getting knuckle from the auto wreckers solved the problem
Can you please send me a link for the angle kit you're running? I want the same üòÉüòâü§†
The spindle is trashed the hole that the ball joint is pressed in is wore out.
I would go with manufacturer specific parts. Sometimes, aftermarket and manufacturer parts can be made incorrectly. I have used both types before, and they have lasted for the life of the vehicle. Also the parts may not be installed correctly and torqued to spec.

Other conditions can also come into play the conditions of the road you travel on to and from work, family events, etc.
Wasted strut/spring bearings will play a role, when combined with substandard parts. 

If they're locked up solid they impart a hell of a force to the ball joints, not enough break them but allow the entry of dirt when suddenly shifted add time to that.
Just FYI, I've never seen a ball joint with the nut facing downward. The ball joint should face upward with the nut side facing the CV axle. The weight of the vehicle should rest on the ball joint not the nut.

Could be pressed in wrong or designed that way from the factory. Just my .02 but I've never seen them facing downward with the vehicles weight being put on one nut.
Don‚Äôt get cheap shit off Amazon or eBay. Get quality name brand parts. Usually if they‚Äôre more pricey they‚Äôre better built
Whats  the name of the shop you got  "*work*" done?
Has it ever been hit? 

Not one person asked.
Either cheap parts or poor install or massive poyholes everywhere. Ball joint should last 10 years, bushings may wear out sooner but control arms should go at least 5 years
Time to get a new car
Amazon counterfeit parts are like this.
Shitty parts and shitty mechanic
That lower ball-joint isn't part of the lower control arm. It's is its own part of on that vehicle.
I had to replace passenger side lower control arm every year until I switched to twice as expensive part.
Are you lowered? If so, that could be your issue.  You could be low enough to throw off the suspension geometry stressing parts...
Was it an '06 ford focus zx3?
Is it always repaired at the same place? If so, don't go there anymore.

Looks like an 03-07 Accord. I have one as well. Lower ball joint is a very common failure point on these cars. Always use Sankei555 lower ball joints on these cars. Every other one doesn‚Äôt hold up. Can speak from experience with Moog, lasted me 6 months before they started creaking but luckily I caught it early enough to change them
You need a new steering knuckle and balljoint
Chinesium parts ?
I mean‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs literarily never happened to me ever‚Ä¶ sooo‚Ä¶
You can't park there
Stop buying car parts off Amazon, and if you can't do the job yourself, find a quality auto shop. Unfortunately, the second part will be the hardest. Finally, I found a quality shop after fifteen years, and they only get the jobs I don't know  how to do or don't have the time. Sadly, you can't trust almost any shop, and for the love of all that is holy, stay the hell away from dealerships.
Sorry this happened to you man, been there...
I've owned vehicles for 30+ years. My first was a Ford Festiva. I've even owned a Saturn.

Not once in those 30 years has anything like this happened to me once, let alone more than once. Wtf?

By how dry the ball joint looks, it might of been squeaking for some time before it broke
Cheap parts equals junk quality and early catastrophic failures. Most mass aftermarket parts quality is absolute garbage
Take a pic of that round part on the end of the control arm.  Look for odd marks and clean metal that would indicate a fresh break.

You can also look for hammer marks and other damage that might have happened during install.

Go with known quality parts from a known source.

-a mechanic
Lower ball join retaining clip isn‚Äôt on it
potholes. speed bumps etc. anything like that taken at speed is bad. any sort of sudden and forceful upward motion of the wheel is essentially trying to pull the ball joint apart (for this particular suspension configuration).
Time to get a different car....
Stanky leg
Oof, that looks like some serious suspension or steering damage. A few things could be causing it:

- Worn out parts like control arms, ball joints, or tie rods.

- Hitting potholes or rough roads could be stressing the suspension.

- Previous repairs might not have been done right, or cheap parts were used.

- Could even be an issue with the axle or CV joint.

I‚Äôd suggest getting the whole suspension and steering checked out to stop this from happening again!
For starters, ignore all the comments about nut torque.

The nut is still there, the pic is blurring when I zoom but it looks like a castle nut and there should be a split pin as a safety.

Regardless, this is not your issue. The joint is still fastened to the stub axle/hub.

I see a lot of rust around the joint. 
I've only ever seen this on cars that haven't been maintained. The joint usually creaks loudly when turning the steering and on suspension compression when it's like this.

That joint is DRY. There is no lubricant in it. No GREASE. 

It's torn out from the press fit into the hub. It's pressed in with a special tool, then secured to the control arm with a lock nut. Either a Nyloc nut, castle nut and split pin or a "peaned" metal lock nut.

Either the joint was damaged when fitted by being BASHED in with a hammer and all the grease leaked out and road spray got to it. 

(Maybe the roads in your region get salted in winter which would greatly exasibate  the wear factor from having no lubricant)

 Or, the joint was a greaseable type, which I doubt, but once again it's hard to tell from the picture, and it wasn't pumped full of grease after being fitted.

Or, the ball joint's rubber sealing boot was damaged at some point by debris on the road  which allowed it to dry out.

Regardless. It's the brown rust stains on the control arm and the joint TEARING OUT that tells the story.

Is this Vehicle a Ford?  Or ford affiliated company such as Mazda?

This type suspension configuration is prone to this if there's a lack of maintenance and regular inspection a year apart at the absolute maximum. The ball joint on this type of set up is bearing all the vehicle weight for that corner. The top ball joint is not. This is a typical ford set up. 

Even getting an oil and filter change WITH a safety check once a year can save your life and possibly someone else's.

Any mechanic doing a minor service should inform you of this extremely important safety issue. 

If you're doing it yourself just a visual inspection, and with the car jacked up UNDER THE BODY and the wheel off the ground to "unload" the suspension on this set up....place your hands top and bottom of the wheel and alternatively pull and push with force to try and tilt the wheel back and forth to check for ball joint wear. Also, get a metal bar around a metre long, like a tyre lever, and place it on the ground under the tyre and lever the wheel up and down to check for movement.

We usually have an apprentice or another mechanic in the Shop to do this while the mechanic who's doing the inspection watches for movement.
honda: good engines, shit body parts
Whe. You install cheap Low Ball Joints
Driving cars for about 40 years now and do all my repairs mostly with cheap parts. I never had a ball joint come apart but keep on driving when they're not good anymore would've caused that.
It wants to be a drift build
Must be a Honda
What angle kit is that hro
Off the bat I‚Äôd say it looks like the mechanic didn‚Äôt put in the cotter pin on that lower ball joint. Those shouldn‚Äôt break that quick, even with high mileage.  Since it‚Äôs happened twice go to another mechanic. Have them inspect your suspension and install new ball joints. With the information given this seems like the ball joint was installed wrong
If it's consistent with lower balljoint pulling out, probably need a new steering knuckle that holds the brakes and is what mounts everything together. The hole is crooked or stretched. Buying factory parts may be best instead of having local shops do it since they get parts from parts stores which are oe replacement but not factory original
Fix it and trade it in. Not worth it.
How is that even possible?? it doesnt even look like theres room between the knuckle and cv joint for the ball joint to fit! ...... That poor brake line :(
A1 Auto
You should manage the assembling torque.
I can tell just by looking that this is a 7th gen accord, 03-07. These are notorious for ball joints leaving the chat- it‚Äôs happened to me twice on my 04 accord. I highly recommend you use Honda parts. Prior mine leaving, I was using moog which used to be a good brand, but not so much anymore. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth the extra fee bucks.

Edited: typos
You're not getting it inspected enough. Totally preventable. Either you're the just *only the oil change, don't upsell me! " person, or the shop you go to is incompetent.   Pick one.
Bad parts and looking at the lower part of your front bumper u tag kerbs that doesn‚Äôt help and if you tag kerbs u probably go to fast over speed bumps which also won‚Äôt help and yes potholes will make this happen more.
Try MOOG lower ball joints
Neglect
It‚Äôs just an old ball joint
kachow
well for starters that's not your control arm the ball joint is what broke. The ball joint on your car is pressed into the knuckle and connects to the control arm. Nothing wrong with your control arm. You need to start taking your vehicle into a regular shop for service that will inspect your vehicle on a regular basis. Quick lubes don't inspect suspension parts during service.
I honestly thought this was a joke post at first. Sorry OP. I'd be paranoid about driving too if my tire came off, repeatedly.
"If it wasn't for bad luck , the Dukes wouldn't have any luck at all." - Waylon Jennings
The shop either has a mechanic that has been working on cars for a total of 5 hours or the replacement parts they are using are trash.

Lowered car?  Incorrect geometry
That‚Äôs pulled out of the housing.
They are retained by C clip.
Did your mechanic forget to put that on?
Leaving this out would create the mess I see in the picture.
Try trw or dealer ball joints
Also check tire balance
Even if you cant feel it a bad tire can wipe out ball joints and hubs
Ignoring a bad balljoint, how to turn a $30 repair into a $3,000 repair.
Lower ball joint as mentioned many times already...and it certainly doesn't look like it's been changed at all recently.
Someone is doing something horribly wrong. Glad youre still alive.
I just recently hit a Pothole going 120kmph so hard it blew out the tire but none of the 20 year old dinky suspension components gave way, probably your mechanic put in cheap replacements?
Sounds like poor parts quality, and if this specifically keeps happening, poor upkeep.  

Failing ball joints should absolutely be caught before this happens.
KEEP HAPPENING?? Either you‚Äôre using cheap parts or the mechanic that is repairing it is doing it wrong. Or perhaps you live in an area with potholes the size of wash basins.
Cuz you keep refusing maintenance at the lube shop

I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre lowered or not but if your suspension is out of alignment it puts more wear on your lbj. I know from experience üòé
You're clearly turning far too harshly. 

Unless you live on a street with loads of right-angle bends.
Buy oem parts! Go to the dealer and ask their part department for the part number/ brand

Ford uses motordraft 
Dodge use Mopar
Etc.
Go find the oem brand of your vehicle's parts.


Then go to rockauto.com and order the part because it will be 1/2 price of the dealer.

Omg I feel you.  I'm starting to wonder about mine. Not sure where you live but I'm in the US and considering how many people are buying parts that likely come from China off Amazon I feel that we need to bring some mandatory safety inspections back like we have smog checks...
So what happens  when this part breaks like you had happen while on the freeway ? What goes on with the car when it does break and any advice like how to handle the wheel and car if it would happen to me ?

Looks like an accord.  Seen a lot of these pictures from the 2000s years.  Don't use cheap aftermarket replacements.  Only OEM.  There are a few aftermarkets that get suggested, but they are critical, as you are well aware, so don't cheap out.
Not a mechanic, but my ball joints have grease fittings on them, I usually pump a couple squeezes into them every six months or so, but I drive 30,000 miles a year
Better parts and stop hitting the potholes..
Also no quick lube places. Go to a shop that does a courtesy inspection. You‚Äôll catch this before it happens.
Opt for the better quality ball joints.
I have 2 accords that I have put 300,000 miles on so ive been through alot of ball joints. You can get name brand Honda ball joints that last. I recommend those https://www.ebay.com/itm/364370041610?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=v__db6icq4i&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=EG2xKRYaRkG&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY
Your tow truck driver should have removed the tire before dragging it up the falt bed. I have had this exact scenario happen to me, my cheap ball joint broke while driving my honda accord. My tow truck driver and I took my wheel off to prevent bending my quarter panel pulling it up the flat bed. My tow bill was $125
Are you sure you got them past the nub on the shaft when being installed? There is a nub or slot on  the shaft of the ball bearing that the support bolt has to sit in for proper function at the strut bracket.
Wait‚Ä¶ keep happening? Seriously, you need to sue the car company, the parts manufacturer and the mechanic that keeps replacing them‚Ä¶ OR
Just drive faster! You are babying the car. Yeah that‚Äôs it, go faster.
What is the vehicle(make/model)?

What was it on headbolts? Torque to spec plus one half turn. To prevent your heads from lifting off the block.
You sure you replaced the control arms and your mechanic didnt just press out the ball joints? Cause its easier to replace control arms than using a press to push out the ball joints. Im sure he pocketed the difference

What model is that I‚Äôve never seen a cv axel or whatever the boot thing is called go through the middle of a strut support like that? Also you have something rubbing like a mf on the inside of your rim?
Overtightened nut on ball joint
This failure has nothing to do with assembly torque and everything to do with the press fit of ball joint to strut. Too much clearance or no locking adhesive or both. Parts quality and assembly procedures are at fault.
That ball joint didn't come apart. It came out of the knuckle. You need a new steering knuckle.
Stop buying the cheapest part and get some with warranty so at least next time you won‚Äôt have to buy it again and again
Guys, it pulled the entire ball joint out of the spindle. The spindle is worn out, not the ball joint. Replace the spindle
Seems to me, that the snap ring for the ball joint wasn‚Äôt installed correctly or at all. Who knows. It could be that the steering knuckle is worn out from the first incident, or even before. Replace steering knuckles, and ball joints as well. That‚Äôs what I would do.
It‚Äôs not a sports car. Stop driving it like one. Stop hitting things. 

It‚Äôs a 4banger Nissan. Relax on the road.
Someone is breaking one of the mounting areas for your lower ball joint unless that's failing
I bought the snapon u joint/ball joint tool. When you put that ball joint in some guys like just using a air hammer, which is wrong. You want that impact to drive it in. A press works good too but IMO impact for ball joints are needed. Just how was taught though.

Edit: Napa parts arr TRASH. I do dealer only if I can avoid it
You could possibly have bad struts which would cause the other parts in the suspension to wear out faster due to the struts not being able to absorb the bumps and vibrations from the road.
1: Buy better ball joints. That thing looks 20 years old, not 1.

2: Have the struts ever been replaced? If the damper is blown the spring could be bouncing putting extra load on the ball joint.
are these oem LCAs??
Cuz your on ya phone again!
Because you're not inspecting your car properly. It's obvious that joint was bad for a LOONNNGGGG time.
Alot of times this happens because mechanics use their impact gun on suspension components and let it REALLY rattle on there, causing the threads to cross and pull. Chances are it was a cheap part + whizzy gun = threads gone, thenwhat happens is you go over a big bump or hit a curb and it goes FLYING
03-07 accords, Kachow, you gotta use OEM or senkie 555 ball joints
This KEEPS happening? As in, you've had more than one ball joint separation like that before? Buddy, that ain't normal, Michigan roads or not (I grew up in NW Ohio and my dad was born and raised in Detroit, so I'm familiar). I worked as an equipment mechanic out at a cattle ranch in Nevada for 5 years that had 14 miles of rutted out, heavily washboarded dirt roads leading in and out of it. I hammered the living piss out of my Silverado going 50-70mph over that shit like it was a trophy truck down in Baja, and never had a ball joint failure like what you're showing here. A couple of suggestions:

1. Buy OEM quality parts, or go to a shop that does. Cheap stuff will increase the likelihood of failure tenfold, and suspension components are not where you want to try and save money (ESPECIALLY ball joints, which can cause you to lose control and crash if they fail). Pony up the dough for good parts.


2. Learn how to listen to your vehicle's suspension when you go over speed bumps, potholes, etc. Parts in good shape should have no play in them, and should make virtually no noise when going over bumps. There's no way your suspension wasn't rattling and banging like hell before this happened if you're driving to the point that the ball joint is physically separating from the LCA like that. Or, giving you the benefit of the doubt, maybe there was no noise - but the quality of the ball joint was so bad that it just said "see ya!" and snapped in half without any warning signs. Doubtful, but if that was the case, see #1 above. 

Good luck. I hope this doesn't keep happening.

EDIT: Looking at the photo again, it appears that the entire ball joint got pulled through your hub. Some ball joints bolt in, some are press fit, some use a c-clip to retain them in the hub, etc. I'm not sure what kind your vehicle uses, but it's possible that it wasn't installed correctly the last time it was replaced (missing c-clip, for example), or your hub might be shot as well from the previous failures. The bore that the ball joint fits into could be worn out of spec, allowing the whole thing to slide through over time. I'd have a reputable shop check over your front suspension very, very carefully.
Nice angle kit
I‚Äôm surprised of all the bs I‚Äôve encountered never this
![gif](giphy|WApIcl7whuH3W)
Definitely the nut behind the wheel.
But some lottery tickets
Looks like the retaining ring is MIA. See the groove on the top of the socket?  

Edit: Never mind that, after a close look I see the remainder of the ball joint in the hub.
Over or under torqued bolts ‚Ä¶ bad mechanic ‚Ä¶ bad cheap China parts from eBay ‚Ä¶ a lot of variables here. I‚Äôve started doing my own work and have no redo issues so maybe learn to wrench your self ‚Ä¶ very useful skill!!!
Does someone dislike you?
Lemon, get a different vehicle üöó
Stop going right
Where you‚Äôre going you don‚Äôt need roads. Or answers.
Id be inspecting the steering knuckle wear the ball joint presses in for damage. Wonder if the first mechanic while cleaning rust out was too aggressive with it and compromised the knuckle itself
Junk ball joints
Junk ball joints
Mucho problema
Stop using cheap parts.
Buy Moog parts.
Stop driving into pot holes, try to avoid as many damaged and indented parts of the road as possible
Kachow!
There appears to be nothing wrong with the control arm. The ball joint bolts to the control arm and by the pic, it is still attached, the problem appears to be a poor design (the ball joint presses upward into the knuckle, but the weight of the vehicle is pushing down on the ball joint pulling it out of the knuckle) and this is made worse by either a low quality part that is separating, worn out knuckles that don‚Äôt actually hold the pressed ball joint into place, or poor installation. I would suggest getting the knuckles thoroughly inspected by a GOOD mechanic. ANND be very cautious of pot holes, speed bumps, etc because of that poor design.
Yikes
Bro buy a new car at this point.
What the fuck you mean it keeps happening? Lmao shitty mechanic plus shitty parts?!
Idk man. I can't buy that that ball joint and lower arm is only a few years old. Are you pulling junk yard parts or from cars you found in the ocean? ü§î
You‚Äôve clearly been driving the wheels off that car
Replace the ball joints.
I see no problem, those tires are definitely still in good shape
Because you don‚Äôt use Dr. squatch on your balls.
Because you either drive like a crazy drunk driver bouncing up and down curbs or you don‚Äôt properly maintain your vehicle.
Omg, the ball joint just fell off of the housing? That's a üí©part quality - good ball joints do not fell off even if they are so loose like a hole of my ex. I've had some examples of customer cars where we changed the ball joints and some of them arrived with ball joints so loose that there was no plastic insert inside  but it still did not come apart.
Because your car, Is. Speed. KACHOW!
Kachow!
When you install a new ball joint you have to then grease them up, depending on the design. That is not a step to skip
Rock Auto
i get you that car was clunking and rattling for like a year before this happened
you should be buying ball joints from a Honda dealer only.  There are plenty of online Honda dealer sites that offer discounted pricing.  hondaautomotiveparts . com or similar 

Don't buy aftermarket chassis parts.  That's a hit and miss, which IMO is dangerous.
That ball joint never had the c clip installed on the top. And likely, there is damage to the lower ball joint hole on the steering knuckle. I would agree with the others and say you need to find a new mechanic.
Look like to me they didn‚Äôt install the C clip which holds the ball joint to the knuckle
That happened to me on two different vehicles. Ball joint work each time solved the problem.
That‚Äôs a weird looking arm. Poorly designed. What make/model/year?
Oh I see,  the same guy that was building Boeing planes with fake parts also worked at the car factories.
Car broken need fixing fix it then better not happen again üëÜüèªüôèüèª
Bad driver
Bad mechanic 
Cheap parts. 

Could be one, both,  or all 3. Ball joints should last 100k miles.
Maybe the knuckle is bad, I have never had this happen
What kind of car is this?
Kachowing
Keep happening? How often has this happened?
Clearly the car is cursed, get a new one and pass the cursed car to someone else. /S
Dude your ball joint is separating use an oem part but by now you probs need a knuckle and bearing and speed sensor. Maybe even axle if the outside joint was damaged
Hell of an angle kit I‚Äôd say
Looks like it could be because it is broken and needs to be fixed to perform properly
Kachow
What car is that?
I haven‚Äôt seen it posted here, but I would move on from the vehicle/ make and model entirely as this could end badly for you
Hard to tell without any details. Make model year? Where did you buy the parts? Maintenance interval of ball joint?
the ball is strangely rust colored? also there is a space between the ball and the swingarm?

I had the same problem when I fell asleep and hit a guardrail!!
That‚Äôs what happens when you turn your steering way and hold it against the stop too long.
Kachow
Stop doing burnouts
The wheel isn‚Äôt supposed to be that way
Joints needs to be lubricate regularly, the problem is not with part or the car. All joints make a sound before they fall if you have heard it and ignored it the problem is you.
It could be cheap parts,same happens with CV joints
If you buy cheap ones they don't last.
Got them Bluetooth lower ball joints I see. Very nice. üëç
I don't see any sign of lubricant on the part or in the grease boot. If you keep using the same part you'll have the same problem. Try using an OEM part next time.
Kind of looks like it lost the retaining clip
![gif](giphy|mvyvXwL26FfAtRCLPk)
I had a 2005 Malibu and I had to replace control arms annually as well. Dunno what caused it with that car but it was a royal PITA.
That looks strange, wondering if ur steering knuckle has become worn out where the ball joint seats.  It looks like the ball joint came out fully but there‚Äôs still a sleeve on the knuckle..  hard to say from the picture but my guess is at this point that knuckle isn‚Äôt holding the bj well enoug
Maybe the problem is you.
You ov cut your springs to lower it bad struts puts pressure on ball joints and other suspension parts ov you have bad struts as they are old as fk and so is that ball joints you can tell by the rust unless the new ones never had grease if it's serviceable.your axle is ruined too and that 50 dollars brake hose should be changed no point gambling causing a caliper to go bad taking out the pads and rotor 50 bucks you'll need a wheel bearing soon too
Inspect the spindle as well, I would replace both control arms and the spindle to make sure it‚Äôs good. And bad roads can shorten the life of the suspension components. The roads in the country I live in are shit and broke a ball joint on my 3/4 ton diesel Chevy from potholes .
See what happends when you don't  let Jesus take the wheel
Someone is trying to put you away
Quit Duke‚Äôs of Hazarding it.
Cheap parts and not getting inspections done. My mechanic checks my car over for things like this whenever I get an oil change (they don't charge me extra for this). When I replace parts, I don't usually get the cheapest part, I get what my mechanic recommends. It's good to have a trustworthy, competent mechanic. When you find one, treasure them.
Mine had done that before but it was the mechanic forgot to place a pin. That pin had a purpose and I figured that out quick.
Lubrication?
Better parts or something else has been bent or damaged in a previous accident
Because your poor
Curbularly challenged
Bought tires from Pep Boys once (they were the only store that had the size i needed).  A few months later, I tried to rotate my tires and found they broke two lug bolts, and the rest were put on so tight (with impact gun) that i could not remove them, even with a half inch break-over bar and a cheater pipe extension.  Glad i didnt find out on the side of the road with a flat tire‚Ä¶..
It just really wants to be a drift car.
Maybe getting too close to the curb at 40+mph?
Did your suspension fail for the same reason or for different reasons.  That's important.  The failure shown in the picture is a failure of the left front lower ball joint -- not the lower control arm.  Lower control arms are typically replaced due to cracked rubber bushings.  Ball joints are typically replaced due to play or complete separation of the ball and socket joint (like as shown in the picture).  It's important to understand that it is common for cheap aftermarket ball joints and lower control arm bushings to fail in under one year.  I saw it all the time when I worked as a mechanic.  Do not buy the cheapest aftermarket part.  Best to pay a little bit more for parts.  Also, some ball joints do not come pre-lubed.  The mechanic has to manually lube the joint through the zerk fitting (if it has one) after installation.  Also, the ball joints that have a zerk fitting are supposed to be lubed regularly (but not overfilled).
Kachow
Either they didn‚Äôt grease the new ball joints, or/and they used 10$ ones from like aliexpress
2016 Honda accord is why
https://preview.redd.it/k2vxvzecbzvd1.jpeg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d9e88ff1212e9452c2fc269ea6325ccae43dd9b

Relatable. This was almost a year ago on December 23rd. It took several months until repairs started and another for repairs.
Kachow
It sounds like the repeated control arm issues could be due to a combination of factors. Living in Southeast Michigan, the potholes and rough roads put a lot of stress on suspension components, even with cautious driving. Over time, alignment issues, worn suspension parts, or using aftermarket components might lead to more strain on the control arms. With high mileage and frequent exposure to bad road conditions, it‚Äôs likely accelerating wear. I‚Äôd recommend visiting a reliable [auto repair shop](https://matrixautorepair.com/) or a trusted mechanic for a thorough suspension inspection to identify any underlying problems, check the alignment, and ensure you're using quality replacement parts.

4o mini
And find a better mechanic
Quality parts and make sure it‚Äôs torque properly , id say 80% of mechanic shops don‚Äôt torque anything
>to start buying better quality parts.¬†

See that's how they get ya. They know a lifetime warranty is meaningless if the product fails and it ends your life.
But I bought the highest quality Chinesium off of Amazon!
They look like originals with that aging on them.  Mechanic probably charged you and didnt swap them
He placed the control arms, not the ball-joints
And avoid potholes
Are stiff aftermarket shocks bad? Bc I took my pilot to Honda and they said it‚Äôs probably not worth it to replace bc they look fine but they still create a lot of annoying clugging and are concerning when I feel every little thing.
Yup, comes down to part quality. OE or high quality aftermarker ball joints can often last 60-100k miles or more on lighter vehicles. 

Even some better-known brands like Moog have let their quality slip. I got their front control arms and had one ball joint develop significant play in just 4k miles.
I'm surprised more people didn't point that out. That ball has been neglected.
It‚Äôs also a bad engineering design to have the spring arm constantly trying to pull the ball joint apart instead of together.
I found that a lot of ball joins have BARELY any grease in them especially when they have a plastic insert.
But i installed a descent quality one in my car but i never pulled the boot off to add grease and it was making noise on day one...... I finally found the source of the noise because it got loose.
>...you can test the ball joints and hub bearings for play that would be an indication of wear long before they fail..

Not always. Some cars (erm.... 3rd Gen TLs...erm) just blow lower ball joints without warning. I'm talking solid feeling, zero play, zero squeaks and next thing you know.. ka-chow. Scary
Right, the ball joint separated not the control arm.
I've always gotten it repaired at a shop so I would assume they replaced those as well
Every lower control arm I've bought has come with a ball joint.
I posted a main comment, but I am wondering if it is cheap parts + an awful transition at a store they frequent, their house/driveway, work etc.
This is the correct answer

Edit 
Always buy oem or high quality parts for suspension components
Thought this car looked familiar. Within the 7th gen accord community, Sankei 555's are the top recommended ball joints to use. This is a common failure on these cars and using cheap ball joints will cause issues like the one you're experiencing. Buy the 555's online and find a shop willing to install customer parts.
Also, just in case, replace the axle, it might got bent
Typical in the VII, i had two of these suckers, in one i had the same thing happen on both sides in two week prior. If you start to hear squeaking noise from the wheel, then you better replace the ball joint, or you will end up in the same situation, also use better part brands like 555 and sqeeze some lube under the rubber cover before installing. If you want this car for ever, replace whole front suspension, also check you power steering cooling hoses (small metal tubes behind right wheel), they rust like crazy, and before you know, you have to fill it up every 1-2hrs or worse, change whole power steering mechanism. If you got some questions about that car I can say, I am a whole walking encyclopedia about 2003-2006 Accord's üòÅ
I had this issue with a 2009 Honda accord multiple times. It started when I got bigger aftermarket wheels. 

I put back the original wheels and haven‚Äôt had an issue since. I‚Äôm not sure if that was the cause but I went through 2 ball joints in 3 years with the old wheels.
Yeah, that's why it keeps happening. Accords are notorious for wheels falling off.
Trim level (DX, LX, Value Package, etc)?

Engine (2.4L L4 or 3L V6)?

Looks like a sedan but I can't be sure.

The MIGHT be the correct [OEM Ball Joint](https://www.hondaautomotiveparts.com/oem-parts/honda-suspension-ball-joint-51220sda305?c=Zz1zdXNwZW5zaW9uJnM9c3VzcGVuc2lvbi1zcHJpbmdzLWFuZC1yZWxhdGVkLWNvbXBvbmVudHMmbD0xJm49QXNzZW1ibGllcyBQYWdlJmE9aG9uZGEmbz1hY2NvcmQmeT0yMDA2JnQ9bHgmZT0yLTRsLWw0LWdhcw%3D%3D), but I can't be sure and [this ](https://www.heeltoeauto.com/roll-center-adjuster-zero-bump-steer-kit/555-oe-replacement-ball-joint-front-lower-honda-accord-2003-07-sb-6314-555.sb-6314-11111.html)appears to be the correct Sankei ball joint. As another poster mentioned double check the work orders to **ensure** the LBJ was actually replaced in prior repairs.
I drove a 2008 dodge avenger for a while and the front left tire came off 3 separate times, I have pictures that look identical but the car was blue. I don‚Äôt know what the deal was, but hopefully this is the last time it happens to you
Honda is kinda lame and makes you buy the entire OE control arm to get an OE ball joint.

I use Sankei 555 ball joints when available for Honda, as they may actually be the OE supplier but they're also great ball joints.
Hell was it all torqued to spec?
Yup. Garbage parts everywhere, many say Rock Auto is better.
No I think that's the boot, with the ball poking out the top. I thought the whole thing came out at first.

12 and 6 could also be wheel bearings too.
Ball joint is pushing rust, no? Edit: and dry as a bone
Going over railroad tracks at the speed of sound,  too.  Also, street takeovers.

Keep on speeding the mechanic needs work
Read the post and they state how many times and about how often.
That uses quality parts
It takes me longer because I torque damn near everything to spec. I had a bad habit of overtorquing early in my career.
After many years of living in a country where it‚Äôs uncommon for mechanics to follow manufacturer torque specifications, I‚Äôve come to believe that for regular car parts, precise torquing doesn‚Äôt make a significant difference as long as you use common sense
I disagree. I would say 90% of shops torque your oil filter well beyond spec.
You're being sarcastic, right? You mean they over torque everything right? i swear any time any shop does anything on a car because I'm short on time or its just a bridge too far for me to want to deal with if I ever need to get that bolt off again I need a 15 foot cheater bar to break the damn thing free. I had to fight to get the plastic covers off the cams and remove the dipstick. 10mm bolts, book spec was 8.7ftlbs. I know rust exists but nah that doesn't get me to attaching an 18 inch breaking bar to get them loose. Most shops just squeeze til the airgun stops and over tighten it. Says 10 ft lbs? Lets go to 100!
This failure has absolutely nothing to do with correct toque.
One of the senior techs that trained me said ‚Äújust because it has a spec, doesn‚Äôt mean it needs to be torqued‚Äù.  Nowadays, as a senior tech myself, I agree.
A lot of people don‚Äôt understand why torque specs exist.     Rated clamping force is typically only met once the hardware is at a certain stretch point. That stretch is made by getting the hardware to the proper torque.  

If you over torque a bolt, it will be beyond its rated stretch and will fail prematurely.  

If you under torque a bolt, it will not meet stretch req and will not hold properly.  

If you think it‚Äôs ok to guesstimate (you won‚Äôt be anywhere near close, just trust me) you are a fucking idiot and I wouldn‚Äôt trust you to change my tire.  Get a damn torque wrench on it.
This failure is all about quality parts though.  Torque would have nothing to do with how this part failed, albeit good practice to torque suspension components whenever possible.
Torque wrench is need with an aluminum block but for torquing a ball join‚Ä¶ you can see the ball fail and the nut is still there.
Never neglect the balls
I was about to say that ball looks dry as hell. I‚Äôm wondering if that ball joint wasn‚Äôt greased from the factory.
It looks like there is rust dust that has been "leaking" out for a while. Seems like it would have been making noise.
Absolutely true yet I have seem many many many cars and SUVs with ball joints exactly like that
Ugh this has me worried now. I have an 08 TL with just over 200k km (125k miles) still with the original ball joints. I know the TL ball joints are infamous for failing so I keep asking my mechanic about them every time I go for an oil change but he's adamant that there's very little play if any so he doesn't recommend replacing them yet. I wasn't aware they could fail without warning. I even had him order the parts to do the replacement, but once he saw them he basically refused saying he would feel bad taking my money for something unnecessary.
I just commented here with my 06 TL ball joint experience. I didn‚Äôt mention in my comment the moments before I left to get lunch‚Ä¶

I went outside and got in my car, but something just felt off. I got out and pushed on the driver front side of the car. Heard a squeak noise and said ‚Äúfuck it, it‚Äôs probably fine‚Äù. Then heading back to work after picking up my food about 15 minutes later, it just broke. Destroyed my fender too. I called AAA to get a tow truck and they said maybe 2-3 hours. Then I called the non-emergency line as the car was still somewhat in the road. About three hours later, an officer shows up to help with traffic control. People were HONKING at the officer despite him having his lights on and there clearly being an accident. 

Another hour went by before the police dispatched tow truck shows up. I called AAA and told them not to come lol. The tow truck guy who did come didn‚Äôt charge me which was cool. He got a nice tip though. 

My car was sitting next to a broken down Gaurda (the money transport company) truck in our joint parking lot for like two weeks before I got the stuff to fix it. 

Unrelated, that truck is still there two years later. And it has been there since before I started at this company about three years ago ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Untouched.
never assume 

look at your old invoices see what was replaced
Same place for both times? Maybe it‚Äôs time to find another shop
Not for your one. Probably a Honda and your ball joints are installed on the knuckles. Changing control arms won't change the ball joints.
Never assume is right i had a shop do mine brought it to another shop for alignment and my lower ball joints had 100% free roam meaning first shop botched job horribly (looks like a older accord you have this happen to my 09 accord)
My control arms came with pre installed ball joints.
I refuse to put cheap suspension parts on for friends. period, no exceptions. I'll do cheaper engine mounts and such but steering, suspension, brakes are no place to skimp with "temporarily permanent" replacements.
I second this. I installed the 555s on my kid‚Äôs 07 accord. No problems after a couple years.
not just great ball joints, they are THEE ball joint, super popular, and reveared with Honda guys.
Rock Auto is awesome.
I saw someone write maybe they were junkyard parts, but honestly I‚Äôd probably trust those more than a new one at this point!
Ohh. I see. Damn cheap parts
You‚Äôll hear a wheel bearing, usually to the side you are turning. Some ball joints will pop when they get bad enough also.
From a reputable source
I wonder how long temu brake pads last?
Literally every nut and bolt on the car has a torque spec from the manufacturer. On my cars (race car especially) I follow the torque specs to the book on everything. And on my race car, I even use viz-torque paint so I can visually inspect after track sessions to see if anything came loose or backed off. 

It literally takes a few extra seconds to set a torque wrench, and with plenty of torque-to-yield bolts and safety equipment, it makes no sense to cave-man unga bunga when you can do things professionally with such a small amount of effort.

And please just tell me upfront if your shop doesn't torque stuff down to spec so I can take my business elsewhere. I don't need my brake calipers to come loose at 120mph because some unga-bunga was too lazy to read the spec.
The ol' German torque spec Guten-tight
"E-tight" is what a guy I used to work with called that; asked what that meant, he'd say "exactly how tight my 30 years of experience tells me it needs to be". Which in practice is about how I did most brake and suspension work, though I had four torque wrenches for various things, for internal engine work and lugnuts and so forth.
Agreed honestly it's the part quality that counts cheap suspension parts suck
I torque everything now and repairs last abit longer. But a experience mechanic can definitely know what needs to be tight or very tight. Over torquing some parts can definitely reduce their lifespan but yeah it all comes down to common sense. Ball joints and axle nuts are the things I always make sure to torque properly and I can say in my experience repairs have lasted abit longer than when I didn‚Äôt but I am just a diy mechanic , if there‚Äôs a tutorial on YouTube from suspension to engine work I am all hands on.
Common sense does work, but its quite entertaining when the new guy thinks we just hammer the parts together until the nut stops. We got a dealer guy, and he was quite slow but he did toque everything. I even watched him use a crows foot to torque a tie rod jam nut. He got tired of being outrun by everyone and the first car he tried to skip torquing he just hammered an outer tie rod into the knuckle. As you can guess, it didn't go well. He split the knuckle and was asking how we all did this without breaking anything.
Torque specs matter on internal engine components. But suspension? The dugga dugga a few times will be good.
Id say 100% I didn‚Äôt know how little torque it‚Äôs needed for oil filter and plug. If you go by torque specs feels like you‚Äôre leaving it loose
That‚Äôs what I meant they don‚Äôt torque anything to specs specially parts that don‚Äôt need to be torqued with a 300ft lbs air gun.
Beat me to it

You know that thing was screaming well before this happened. 
People gotta pay attention to those squeaks and rattles.
Or it‚Äôs an aftermarket grease-able design that either did not get grease, the wrong type used and it washed out, or over greased and the boot tore and got compromised with water. Regardless it does not look good.
That's a good technician!
Solid advice to never assume but I would guess the shop would be eager to replace it all to bill more rather than half ass the job for less. Unless OP came in already looking to pay as little as possible.
It depends on the car. On my car, the balljoints are actually integrated into the lower control arm, and one needs to replace the whole unit.

OP's appear to actually be pressed into the knuckle, and bolted to the LCA, so they should be replaceable (and probably wouldn't be included in the LCA).
Careful with that. Is got down voted because they thought I work for them lol. In all seriousness they are legit. Great selection and pretty good prices.
SOMETIMES you find better parts at a junkyard, and you can probably get them cheaper but make sure you have your own tools and it depends on how hard it is to take off. I know someone who relies on junk yard parts a lot, hell he practically rebuilt his car using junkyard parts..
But seriously, some new parts don't hold up like they used to and they are cheaply made. It just sucks that things like this happen. 
And roads are not car or truck friendly anymore. And some states use cheap asphalt because they want to save money but of all the money these states make, you would think they would do it right the first time instead of just wasting money.
Probably just old/worn out. OP didn't say they ever replaced them, and it's common for those Accords to have vertical play in the ball joints after awhile.
Fun fact most mechanics have discounts at the dealerships
Make sure your mechanic is from a reputable source to. Research the parents
Well as long as the parts are quality the source really isn't my problem
More like Break pads. Am I right!?

Ok I'm leaving.
Temu sells brake pads?
They probably fall apart before they are worn out
I had a couple of calipers come loose at my shop. Some apprentices were not torquing bolts down. When I discussed it with the Forman in front of my boss, his response was, "I just gun them until they don't move."

I immediately responded with, "we should always torque down the bolts to spec. There is zero reason not to. We should also be teaching these guys to follow the service manual to avoid issues."
Proper. Yes sir. How it should be.
‚ÄúUnga bunga ‚Äú? Surely you mean ugga dugga.
Or the US spec. There ooga-boogas.
Beat it to the balls
But the radio goes to 11
Look, it‚Äôs not my fault I wear tie-dyes and smell like weed everywhere I go‚Ä¶
Good mechanics usually don‚Äôt have to buy from stealership, they can order from warehouse suppliers that provide for their (the dealerships) shops (and parts departments).

Some parts departments will give you the commercial discount if you ask nicely. Or lie about where you're getting the work done üòÜ
Try sourcing quality parts (eg. reputable brand items) from any chinamegastore and see what you get...
They also make mechanics
Go on...
I've been wrenching as an amateur for over 40 years.  One of the first tools I bought was a torque wrench.  My dad taught me well.  I don't think people understand how it works.  It's not like putting a screw into wood where tight is all you need. With bolts, on a moving vehicle, too loose for the application and it'll work itself free. Too tight and you might strain the bolt and cause it to sheer off at the most inopportune time.
I like your style.
Must be French for ugga Dugga.
Is your mechanic fucking beetlejuice?  Its "ugga duggas"  not ooga boogas lmao
two grunts and a groan
Use it in a sentence: It‚Äôs about 5 ooga oggas
Beat beat beat.
My radios always at 11 and I periodically have to do reluctantly quiet drives just to check for ‚Äúthat noise‚Äù
Sometimes going to the stealership is the only option.
And look at the quality of the aftermarket stuff. It's not all bad, but when you ask for a cheap control arm you get what you pay for. In this case could have been more costly than another control arm.
Mannnnn fuck Napa. The amount of wrong parts they send us is annoying as shit. Nothing is worse that getting ready to finish a job, comparing the parts and realizing it‚Äôs wrong then having to wait for a new one.
Are the parts you get quality parts?

Yes? Then they are quality parts.

No? Then they are not quality parts. 

You're misreading "as long as the parts are quality the source isn't my problem" as "any source is quality". That is not what they said.

*As long as the parts are quality,* the source isn't my problem.

Are the parts quality? Yes? Then the source is not their problem.
Get the bulk pack. Most of mine were damaged on arrival.
üòÇüòÇ spooky season bro
Don't forget to say click afterwards.
üòÇ gotta start using this with my plumbers
Stupid autocorrect. I meant THREE ooga-boogas. But honestly, for a ballpoint, I think you spec'ed it right. Should be 5.

Edit: ball joint, not ballpoint. Damn I'm a failure and this Stoopid phone is pissing me off. üòÇ
Yeah, but losing a control arm at speed can be a much higher cost via comparison.
So... here's the weird thing, of the public facing national party stores, I've found that while Napa will send a wrong part occasionally, when the parts are correct they tend to be the best quality.

AutoZone tends to always send the correct part, but yeah.....

O'Reilly's tends to be right in the middle.

Sadly, since I'm a shade tree that is turning wrenches for my neighbors, most of the time I'm getting things from AutoZone because it's the cheapest (unless the difference is within my F&F cost, then I eat the difference and get the better part). My favorite is when the part is ordered from China, it's like Russian Roulette.
you wanna know what's worse??  when the store closes at 8, but the car doesn't start going back together 'til 9 and at about 9:15 you realize it's the wrong damn part but you need your car to get to work tomorrow morning @ 7.  ü§¨üò°ü§¨
Just gotta keep an eye out for reboxed sub quality parts from some retailers. Though your point is still clear, good part = good part.
That‚Äôs ducking ridiculous!üòâ
Bro, you are just having a hell of a day so far, aren't you?
Exactly my point
I mean I personally don‚Äôt get a choice where it comes from. That‚Äôs up to the service advisor but whenever I see it‚Äôs a Napa van that rolls up I let out a little sigh and just pray it works lol.
Total bullshot
Yeah dude. And another poster corrects me. I guess it's ugga-duggas?

Failing at life. üôå
Oh christ, a little loopy today and my quick reading skills backfired. Sorry about that.
I read through your messed up post after messed up post... and while it gave me a good laugh, I felt it.
What‚Äôs up with snowboarders?
I‚Äôm a skier, never snowboarded although kind of curious to try one day. Yesterday I was passed by a snowboarder going extremely fast and almost hit a group of people with no regard. As he came over the hill he just yelled at everyone to get out of the way. I know snowboarders feel you always get blamed for everything but come on!!! What was even crazier is this snowboarder had skis on. Obviously, a skier wouldn‚Äôt do that.
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
You know as a reformed skier myself.. I have seen the light. Gave up standing in the middle of the slopes, man that was hard to quit. Now I‚Äôm shredding and have developed a more refined vocabulary consisting of the word ‚Äúgnar‚Äù. One board is better than two skis.
52% of all on hill crime is committed by snowboarders.
![gif](giphy|64jkJBwQL1cYfDwkOc|downsized)
This is top tier
In all seriousness, standing in the middle of runs, just over a hill/gnoll/blind spot is a hazard. I don‚Äôt care what you‚Äôre on, if you‚Äôre standing there, you‚Äôre getting a holler (or at least a stop and I‚Äôll let you know that‚Äôs a terrible place to stand, for all of our safety‚Äôs sake). If you‚Äôre going to stop, go over to the edge by the trees. Also, remember, speed is relative. When I‚Äôm on my board, I like to go fast. Just because it‚Äôs faster than YOU would go, does NOT mean I‚Äôm out of control‚Ä¶food for thought.
Almost\* Not saying that your guy was as me, but I find it very hard to snowboard anywhere at my enjoyable pace without eventually reaching a grouping of skiers taking the entire run to do horrible turns in an unpredictable manner. This happens way too often in the park and on non-slow / learning zones. I ride the same way I drive: looking constantly around me to avoid a collision. Now, I calculate well my carves based on a prediction of how other riders will ride around me. I try to pass at more than 1m/3ft for safety margin reasons. However, just because I sped near you doesn't mean I could have hit you (except if you suddenly snake me, which according to the mountain safety code, you'd be in the right). If all skiers and intermediate snowboarders especially would be more aware and less eager to appropriate the entire 30m/90ft width of the run especially in the park and black runs, my fast carves would not be that close. If you are going to carve throughout the entire run, at least leave the edges clear so that fast riders can also enjoy the sport (My hypothesis also applies to skiing)
Well played, sir. Well played.
quality shit post
You got me good.
Snowboarder is right. Shouldn‚Äôt be standing there.
U had me !
Man I made the mistake of going to a local mountain yesterday without realizing a ski race was happening.. I've never encountered more entitled people in my whole life. I was cruising down some greens as I am new and was getting swarmed by skiers, and I swear it was like they didn't even realize I existed. They would cut straight into my line and I would just have to figure it out to avoid colliding with them. Then I got to the bottom of the hill and they all would just unclip and leave their skis sitting everywhere, it was like snowboarding through a mine field of assholes.
I‚Äôm just jealous of people who still afford to get on the hill and complain.
Seriously.  If I want to ski perpendicular on the slope out of blind corners without checking for traffic and get hit it is *their* fault for going fast and enjoying themselves the way they see fit.
I'm in tears üòÇ So good!

A life of crime
Last week at Park City I had a skier crash into me from behind on a cat track. She was a beginner, and nobody got hurt, but she came from behind and just bear hugged me until we both fell into the snow bank. Then, on a green/blue run to the lift, a trail merged in on my heelside. I was doing some super slow carves and after the merge, a skier came flying in from behind, almost hit the back of my board, and screamed at me to watch out. I yelled back that he was above me and out of control, to which he called me a fucking dumbass. Sounded like he was around 17 years old. Now, I'm not saying incidents like those couldn't happen with another snowboarder, but I've personally never experienced it.
Get out of the way tho
Skiers that stop under whale backs or burms are straight assholes. I've had so many close calls because your family wants a picture in a blind spot or turns in a trail. And don't get me started on the 6 year olds that go into the big park, just to ruin the lip of every feature.
My worst snowboarding accident was a skier in a downhill tuck CRUSHING me while I was on on a heel side carve.

It's not the board(s) it's the operator.
Most "snowboarders" never actually learned how to snowboard properly.  That's what's up.
It isn‚Äôt a skier v snowboarder thing‚Ä¶
1) the kid could have been a total Asshole. Many people who ski and snowboard, believe it or not, are also assholes! 
2) you could have literally been standing around in a known natural hit‚Äôs landing (don‚Äôt ever be that guy)
3) You say came over the hill, were you standing around in the landing of a Jump in the park?
Skiers are always practicing how to jerk off two guys as once.
I actually think it's pretty even between idiots on each side. For every anti skier post or a skier taking out a boarder video in this sub, it's the same in the ski sub. We're surrounded by idiots everywhere
[deleted]
Snowboarders are reckless?
Some skiers do that. An asshole is an asshole. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre on a board or skis.
[deleted]
I'm new to snowboarding but my experience was one kid on skiis alone on a big hill I didn't see anyone watching him the kid was like 8 or 9 im assuming and I was on my heels trying to learn going from heels to toes but in this instance I was taking a minor break on the side line and a small child on skiis goes right past me and skin the tail of my board I almost fell because it caught me off gaurd xD but like where tf was this kids parents and or gaurdian or teacher if he was doing lessons
There‚Äôs a lot of teenage boy snowboarders who act like little jerks and get way too close.
There are idiots in both sports.  Yes a ski would do that.  The first step is to get over yourself
No difference between skiers and boarders.  You have the ass holes in both sports.  

I've seen plenty of skiers make terrible moves, it isn't relegated to snowboarders.

You sound like a child.
I know that terrain parks are usually designed for snowboarders but I never stopped to wonder if runs can be designed more for boards than skiiers. Is that a thing?
You just gave me the rigmarole with that one! Touch√©, sir!
You can‚Äôt Ollie on skis. Watch out below loserssss.
5 out of 7 people enjoy snowboarding, the other 2 are liars

OP leads a life of crime
Best to just do what they say. You never know what kind of crimes they can commit.
That was me, and their called snowlerblades.
What's the deal with snowboarders (based on this one interaction with a single snowboarder I had)?! \*Seinfeld voice
Knuckle dragger
Crime
Skiers do that, too‚Ä¶ Skiers and snowboarders are a great analogy for different types of people‚Ä¶ You will find people that are respectful and people that are disrespectful everywhere you look‚Ä¶ Sometimes it matters what you‚Äôre looking for‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand the conflict having grown up as a skier then I was a skateboarder, and when I saw snowboarding, of course I was into it‚Ä¶ As long as you respect the mountain and the people enjoying it, it doesn‚Äôt matter how you slide down the mountain‚Ä¶ I wish this perpetual conflict would end because both sports are hella cool‚Ä¶ For the snowboarders that don‚Äôt think skiing is cool, check out Candice Thovex. If skiers and snowboarders can‚Äôt find common ground, for example, the mountain?!, then who can‚Ä¶ I hope we can all work to end this perpetual conflict that seems to be based in ignorance and misconception‚Ä¶ Share the mountain. And show some respect‚Ä¶ Then go commit some crimes.
"As he came over the hill" would seem to indicate the group was stopped on the downhill side which I was taught never to do.
Definitely stolen skis
Can just start blaming tubers?
Snowboarderness is orthogonal to dickheadness.
Where were you standing? One of my local trails has a steep drop and a curve right at the same time and I had a group parked right on the inside of the corner just past the drop. I almost stopped and talked to them about finding safer places to take a break. 

If you‚Äôre going to stop or if you know you‚Äôre slow, you want to be aware of visibility. If the uphill skier can‚Äôt see you you‚Äôre gonna get taken out eventually.
Gotta love people who have no reading comprehension. I read through your post and when I got to the end, I was like, "wait, what?" 

![gif](giphy|a0Lgc1JvbfS4o|downsized)

It made me laugh and I immediately went to the comments on this one because you are going to be hammered by people who just don't get it.
showboarding is a mindset, meant only for hooligans, punks, and disney channel jocks
snowboarders have no regard, but all skiers are completely regarded
Holy shit- literally happened to me yesterday at Dodge. Two skiers a meter apart stopped in the middle of a run having a conversation, that part of the run is maybe 15 feet wide at most with rock outcrops on both sides. Went right through the middle of them with the loudest ‚ÄúMOVE‚Äù as I passed them. Why do they seem so oblivious???
Urchin or nothing!
Quality shitpost
We‚Äôre always in a rush, either fleeing the scene of a crime or trying to get to criming. Get out of our way!
I gotta say, I‚Äôve seen skiers do stuff like this a TON more than snowboarders.¬†
I feel like nothing has anything to do with skies or a snowboard. Some people make good decisions while others do not. Some people are assholes while others are not. Some people are just fking morons and some people are not. 
The person on a snowboard sounds as if he fits all three and then some. 
Keep your guard up while out on the hill. These people are dangerous
Bro, that *IS* crazy. Why would he do that?
Wow two snowboards on each foot!!!
Snowboarder obviously crimed those skis.
This.. only about Cyclists.
As somebody who had skiiers repeatedly force me over on a cat track while the snowboarders alerted me to their presence, I'm not sure I understand...
There are snowboarders that are shitty people and there are skiers that are shitty people.
Had an inverse experience last week coming down a bottlenecked run. Bunch of snowboarders standing side by side chatting away and blocking almost the entire run. Everyone was going around them and yelling to move off to the side. They all held up their poles and yelled back like old men telling kids to get of their lawns.
they had us in the first half, not gonna lie...
I think it depends on the person, the closest I‚Äôve even been to death was from a skier doing about 100ks an hour (not joking was at the bottom of a racecourse) and he missed me by about 4 mm

The course was closed, and we were having a meeting during training at the bottom
Not every boarder is a dick, but 95% of the dicks on the mountain are going to be boarders.

I don‚Äôt make the rules, just how it is
Technically a board is one big ski, so aren't we all skiers when you think about it
Your anecdote combined with other skiers anecdotes makes for what appears to be a fact.

But really, Skier or snowboarder, assholes pull stupid shit on the mountain.
I mean, the scenery is JUST TOO GOOD to pass up a selfie opportunity, so of COURSE the right thing to do is to plop down and take a selfie smack dab in the middle of the steepest post of the run - and EVEN BETTER if it‚Äôs a blind drop off, so no one can see you sitting there until they are almost on top of you‚Ä¶But ya know, you‚Äôve gotta get the angle right so that everyone can see how awesome you are and HOW STEEP the slope is that you just plopped down in the middle of for your selfie‚Ä¶.
Shut the fuck up nerd!
Lmao love this
Saw a statistic the other day, and idk if it‚Äôs true, that skiers cause 72% more crashes than snowboarders or 72% of all crashes
I yell aswell, get the fuck out from the middle of the slope, its not a picnic zone
What sucks the most are the skiers trying to teach small children to ski on blue runs. Never seen anything so unpredictable in my life.
I‚Äôm actually a skier that snowboards. You can tell because I never yell at people to get out of the way.
snowboarders dont have poles like skiers do, which help propel you forward on flat terrain. It takes a lot longer for snowboarders to reach the same speed as skiers without poles since snowboarders rely purely on gravity or their back foot, which is a pain to unstrap and restrap when already moving. When skiers block snowboarders path, snowboarders have to slow down, lose their momentum and then often fail to reach the same speeds again, making us fall behind our skiers friends. 

I‚Äôve rode with plenty of skiers as the only snowboarder. Skiers often forget that we lack poles and will often stop somewhere not conducive to snowboarders. I see it all the time and then end up having to hop or shimmy or worse, unstrap a foot to go marginally uphill, and by then my skier friends are gone bc they forget snowboarders can‚Äôt just stop in a dip or flat terrain! 

Hope that helps. And it was probably me yelling at you to get out of the way!
Ban skiers.

This is why I read from right to left.
I read the first half and skimmed the second. Glad I saw your post because I went back to actually reread it before responding.
Damn I read almost the entire post but stopped right before the end and did write  outa whole thing. Now I feel like a dumbass
It‚Äôs the slow traverses where they gang up to block the way so we can‚Äôt go flat out
For real, what's up with skiers making a sudden stop in the middle of the slope in the narrowest section then just looking around like they're lost?
You know what they say, twice the boards and half the fun.
A few days ago I had to cut a corner through the trees because a group of skier kids (about 10-15 of them) with an instructor(!) blocked the entire run. So I did just that - yelled that I‚Äôm passing them on their right and the instructor just gave me a look like why am I even snowboarding there.
‚ÄúTwo skis good! One ski better!‚Äù
How many crimes do you crime a day though?
Gnar dude!!
Despite making up only 13% of the... Ok I'll stop.
99.9% of crime at Alta and Deer Valley is committed by skiers
Skiers aren't criminals, they're petty thugs.
[deleted]
I think it‚Äôs closer to 100%
100% of statistics shared by a skier are made up.
That‚Äôs a statistic I‚Äôm proud to be a part of.
NGL, l fell like this once and slid down the hill and it was one of the most memorable runs l've had. l had a smile on my face the whole time l was sliding down lol
If you‚Äôve never penguined down the hill you‚Äôve never lived
It‚Äôs cool you can use the board as a spoiler to keep you from lifting off.  You‚Äôre basically a human F1 car.
I saw some knuckleheads doing this last weekend. In the middle of the trail.  Who‚Äôs fault is that when you plow over them because they wanted to be stupid.
I did this last weekend (sans my skis) after some idiot (also a skier) landed a jump on me (normal groomer, not park) and popped me out of my skis.
Yea, part of me really wishes he would have ran them over. lol. It‚Äôs so annoying when people do that
My biggest pet peeve as someone trying to improve is that on the blues I have trouble connecting that 2nd or 3rd toeside(without stopping hard on heel or traversing somewhat blind to scrub speed) as I dont want to catch at speed so people will see me do a few decent turns as theyre speeding behind me, think im going to do it all the way down and blast past me a few feet away as Im stopping myself heel side. Im quite scared at this point that im going to get hit which makes me constantly look uphill, stop at any crowd, waiting for big gaps that sometimes take minutes, and often Ill let someone pass only for them to then stop right in front of me and wait for me. I go then they blast past me 3 feet away. 

I try to stay to the sides of the hill but its often the most bumpy terrain and where I see the fastest people blasting down to avoid the middle crowd. Obviously these people are good enough to dodge me 99% of the time but I know its a recipe for disaster. This has led me to only be doing powdered blacks recently which I love but dont seem to help me improve much due to the forgiveness of powder.
Exactly! You described my point better than my point was described by me at a time before this.
> gnoll

Oh shit are you snowboarding in a DnD campaign?
I ski but I do the same thing, never hit anyone, and never get close just to antagonize, but several times people have got mad at me for going fast near them... they always say "you almost hit me" yeah *almost* lol.

I like to kill em with kindness but in a sort of confrontational way. Not gonna back down or apologize for getting close but will usually say "hey I'm sorry I upset you but its everyones mountain".
Ski racers are, especially high school age, are the definitely the spoiled brats of the ski hill, no chill and a serious sense of entitlement.  They definitely feel, as athletes they‚Äôre not only entitled to own that part of the mountain, they are also better than everyone else because they ski fast lol.  What‚Äôs hilarious is once you get them off their race track, put em on top of a cliff, or some difficult free ski terrain, they‚Äôre back to being the clowns they really are.  

Obviously in generalizing, there are lots of chill kids who grew up racing and crush it and are nice to be around.  Same thing with country club kids, plenty of cool ones grew up golfing at fancy clubs, many are dildos‚Ä¶
Yeah.  I am not spending $200 to go wait in lines.
Did you get her number?
Hahah just reread the last part!
Oh for sure. Especially the one recently where the skier went right into the landing of a snowboarder.
I have no idea which side is more respectful on the mountain, I just know that snowboarders are cool and skiers are dorks.
Whoosh
I know, I was just having fun. There are jackasses on both sides and awesome people on both. I don‚Äôt care who I ride with.
Yeah, we should be each individually talking about what a problem all skiers are
Punctuation is a thing; you should try it.
lol, re-read my post (second to last sentence especially) then read some of the comments. Absolutely right, idiots in both sports.
Re-read my post and then other people‚Äôs comments‚Ä¶. This was obviously a joke. But you are right, assholes in both.
Parks are designed for skill levels. I‚Äôve seen both sides (skiers and knuckle draggers) hit all sorts of shit in the park. But again, if you‚Äôre not at a certain skill level, please stay out, or, at the very least, stay off to the sides. Situational awareness is key. Going over rollers is fun but in the park, rollers are landings. If I land on you and break my leg and give you a concussion because you‚Äôre in the fucking landing, it‚Äôs your fault. Don‚Äôt ever stop on a knuckle/roller out of sight of the drop in. Stay off to the side in a safe zone if you want to watch. And for gods sake look uphill.

EDIT - I‚Äôm speaking in generalities, NOT directly at you, sir.
Gullies, baby!
Why not?
Yes they do, that was the joke. It was literally a skier. Yeah honestly I love both. Also watch the crash real. Great movie although very sad. Snowboarding is awesome.
Absolutely correct. In reality I wish he would have ran them over. Huge pet peeve of mine.
I didn‚Äôt think of that. That‚Äôs probably accurate. He looked sketchy too. Had a mask and all‚Ä¶.
Oh yeah I know, it‚Äôs so funny. In reality, most snowboarders are cool cats. As are skiers. But definitely jerks on both sides.
It‚Äôs unbelievable. I swear, snowboarders with poles are the worse kind of snowboarders.
Or maybe skiers are twice as much boarders as we are
well there‚Äôs just more skiers than snowboarders lol
I yell to tell them where I am relative to them, so as to lesson the chance of them turning that way.
I just don't stop with them in those places. The skiers I ride with mostly know better.
I was pulling up my murder socks a bit
It's actually required training before you learn how to faun walk in hard boots. Any skier who tried to boot up before completing it gets scooped up by interpol and made to snowboard as the criminal they are.
I love the skiers that love to gather up where the lift drops you off. Great place to stop and shoot the shit and make plans for apres ski. 
Or run over the back of your board in the lift line, because the closer they get to you, the lift runs faster maybe?
My personal fave is to stop and look around on top of the knuckle or downslope at the bottom of a jump. 
Skiers are dorks man.
How about the skiers last weekend that stopped in the middle of a flat on a trail after a steep drop.  Forcing my dumb ass to dump speed to not hit them (they were 3 wide!) then skate like a dope to get past the flat.
Its all those random turns. It confuses them. Lose their sense of direction.
If your lucky there's two or three of them standing next to each other, but ofcourse a good half ski offset so the path gets even more narrow.

I've finished my board week in Austria 1h ago and I must say it's only skiers blocking slopes or edges.
They actually are lost. Skiing gives you Alzheimer‚Äôs, so they literally have to stop because they can‚Äôt remember where they are or how they got there
My Dad has always done this and I never understood why... He always stops just after the first section and just before the best section of any slope and ruins the flow. I've at least gotten him to move off to the side any time he does it.
Its because, its our mountain and so we survey our land   and all that we see is ours.  *Nants ingonyama bagithi baba / Sithi uhhmm ingonyama* rafiki skis by
during my last trip I was going down the summit trail and towards the end of the trail I had picked up a lot of momentum and was going pretty fast in a straight line, caught up to 2 skiers who where not going as fast but taking up the ENTIRE width of the trail side by side, trail was pretty narrow here, I kept yelling at them that I was trying to pass on right but they just ignored me so I had to come within inches of one then just to pass those imbeciles. Swear they would have rather gotten in a collision then let me pass.
69% of all statistics are made up.

Get that downforce‚Ä¶
[deleted]
Lmao, it happens when you catch an edge or skid out during a turn, it's typically not on purpose
Don‚Äôt even get me started on what goes on in the park.
Honestly, sounds like you aren't quite ready for those runs. If you can't consistently turn you really shouldn't be going down any blacks.
Sounds like you need to learn to look up hill.

You're not blind when you're traversing on your toeside, because you're not going downhill, you're going cross-hill. Look cross hill. And use that opportunity to look up-hill and behind you, so you can see where people are coming from, before you do your heel-turn.
Trust me, everyone blasting past you can tell you‚Äôre not an expert. We read your body language in milliseconds and are calculating all the potential possibilities as we find a path past you. Everyone has a line, and with some degree you shouldn‚Äôt go outside your line unless you look up the hill to check to see if you‚Äôre entering someone else‚Äôs line. If someone passes by you very closely, it‚Äôs likely that you went outside your projected line and that‚Äôs why we were so close.
üòÇ
That brings to mind my theory about why ski areas outlawed snow boarding a couple decades ago. It was to get rid of teenage boys on the slopes.
This is a universal truth.
I remember growing up when a season pass to my local resort was $250 with a few blackout dates around Christmas and New Years. Now the cost is just insane.  $1500 for an Epic pass and I don‚Äôt even wanna know what a new gear setup would cost me.
lines? not like your at Disney waiting over an hour to get on a roller coaster most I‚Äôve ever waited at most resorts was what like 10 minutes?
Well she was about 20 years older than me and with her husband so no
Haha are you east coast or west side
nah I'm good üëç
My bad
True but enough to cause the mouth of a discrepancy?
I‚Äôm there and gone long before yelling would benefit me.
Man you hit the only two gripes I have with skiers on the head. 

I've gotta hassle them to move out of the way of the lift ramp. And I have to hassle them when they start scraping up my board in the lift line with their metal tips.
Holy fuck there‚Äôs one run where I‚Äôve had this happen multiple times. Only time I wasn‚Äôt completely livid was when it was a kid
This makes me think, why isn't there a rule or part of the snow code that's like skiers on the right on traverses, snowboarders on the left? 

I'm thinking similar to general rules of the road, slower traffic on the right, passing on the left. Skiers of course could still pass on the left and be a fellow criminal. Perhaps it will lead them to see the light and live a life of crime. 

But if they stop on the left, get their pass revoked of course.
I feel your pain
70% of the time, it works every time
There are lies, damn lies, and then there are statistics.
One snowboarder is a tragedy. One million snowboarders is a statistic
40% of all people know that.
With a 420% increase annually
That's what going to the mountain is really all about! Getting out there and just having fun.
Is this really a thing? Or is it a conspiracy by skiers to make normal snow go-er downers look like mindless monkey animals?
Yeah, Im not the most experienced but definitely can hit some very steep runs if the snow is good. I've had people pass me on challenging runs and its very normal, my legs were tired and didn't feel like pressing hard so I just yielded and let them pass, didn't bother me at all.

If someone isn't comfortable with that kind of thing, might want to keep practicing turns on the harder parts of blues until you have confidence.
I can consistently turn most of the time but I dont like having speed on groomers as I lean back and the board slides out on me toe side at speed. In powder I can send it and leaning back helps so in powder im fine and if I fall no injury.
Oh my heads on a swivel but not much yiu can do when on heel side and a skiier jumps onto the blue going 50+ and you havent checked in 3-5 seconds.
I appreciate it when they do what I do - yell "passing left" or "passing backside" before I catch up to them, while leaving them as much room as I can.
My issue is I look(most of the time) like I know what im doing when im riding but I make sudden stops when I feel off balance at all so Ill do say 5 good s turns then I see a hard spot Id rather not chance it on so Ill continue a heel side where someone may have been expecting a toe turn. The person whos been keeping pace with me can see that but the sender who only saw the 5 good turns doesnt expect me to stop all of a sudden for what they see as no reason. Its annoying as it makes me have to look uphill A LOT more than I see others do which slows me down even more leading to the vicious cycle of stop starting and being off balance as Im white knickle riding what shoukd be easy terrain for me.
It's all relative I guess.  Enjoy the mtn.
I have had too many people make a random turn just as I tried to pass to assume I am that superior.
This was at Smuggs upper chilcoot.  All adults.  I think one had a yard sale so they all stopped to watch.
Touch√©
Statistics are only as good as the questions being asked.

And if the questions are lies, well, then... *huff*puff*rabble*
That is definitely a statistic.
Oh you know that annual increase will be at 420%!!!
Oh I see I've found the "I never actually hit the trees" crowd¬†
Gotcha! The trick is to not lean back then haha if you stay more centered on the board in the groomers you have a ton better control. Say maybe 40% weight on the front foot at least
Well then your riding to close to them. That‚Äôs your fault.
Yeah its just that when turning fast my legs out manuever my body and I end up accidently carving out of control across the slope about to fall off the back or if I adjust it feels like the weight change will force an edge catch.
Do you NEVER pass people riding  down the middle of narrow cat tracks? Alerting them helps, and I appreciate people that do the same for me.
I steer clear of people I don‚Äôt know.
39 hour approval. First suppressors 
Certified through Silencershop Monday at 5pm. Got emailed approval this morning at 8am. Thought it was just internet bias of people getting short approvals.  It's either not,  or I'm very lucky.  My FFL just kept saying "That's fucking crazy". DDC enticer LTi and Rugged Obsidian 45
This is getting out of hand. Approvals appropriately measured in **hours.**

Lord I have seen what you do for others üôèüèª
Dammmnn. Next we'll see people getting approvals for forms they havent even submitted yet
Respectfully, fuck you. 
-A trust owner.
Nope. I refuse to believe. üò°

Edit: Oh, for individual Form 4s? Congrats, and fuck you. üòÜüëç
Damn even the Subaru owners are getting their cans before me :-/
Alright, I am ordering more suppressors to see if I can catch some of this luck. Also my tax refund was just deposited this AM.
Now do trusts

I want to know what the NFA branch changed PROCESS WISE to do this kinda stuff.  I understand and work on gov cloud and service systems that do this kind of "approval workflow".  I feel like they are doing backgrounds faster and absolutely just E-stamping it through unless something insane comes back via NICS/NCIC.
Individual or trust? Waiting for my FFL to certify and submit but the website is apparently down for Eforms.
Nice. Congratulations. I hope they start catching up with trusts soon.
My local shop has been posting some of pics of approved stamps that were stupid fast.  I thought they were full of shit lol.
I know I‚Äôm supposed to be happy for you‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not lol, enjoy your cans
I submitted mine last night because of all the approvals since ATF had issues with their site. I hope I can get in on speedy approval like everyone on this sub but 39 hours is nuts
Eat shit good sir. Congratulations for rubbing it in our 285 day and still waiting assess (me)! Have fun shooting sneaky beaky like
Proof these shouldn't be regulated in the first place
I think this is appropriate in this case

This is making me want to buy another can lol
Are the quick approvals also for trusts? Or only individuals?
We had a can get approved in an 8 hour day on Monday.
Im just waiting on silencer shop to certify my form 4.
This is fucking horseshit
I‚Äôm literally waiting on my suppressor to come in the mail so I can start the paperwork, this is an insane turn around.
Alright, there's been too much of this happening, something fucky is going on, we just don't know what it is yet

Edit - congrats OP, and fuck you
I hate you
Was this through a trust or individual? My FFL said trust takes forever, I don't want to believe that.
Can someone start gathering hard data on the new individual approval times vs. trust approval times? This is totally unfair. I‚Äôm happy for the individual filers, but it makes no sense that the ATF can demonstrate expedient approvals on one side and not the other. There is some kind of political motive here that is disrespectful toward taxpayers. They need to be called out.
This is the way it ought to be. Well, except for the $200 tax stamp, but still hope it stays this way, forever. But I doubt it. What could‚Äôve possibly happened with the Anti Fun Trooper‚Äôs policies, software, etc. to change wait-times from 9-12 months to a few hours?
It‚Äôs all downhill from here my dude.
I submitted mine over a week ago. WTF atf?!
That‚Äôs fucked up but I just got the last one I waiting on and hope this is the new normal for everyone. At least until the NFA is repealed.
Was going to buy a new firearm soon but seeing all of these short approvals I think I am going to  buy my second can instead just to see how long the approval takes lol. Got my first one last year and it took 275 days.
Nice,  was this like personal or through a trust?
Fuck you
ATF where stamp???? üòÇ I need my last Friday stamps to come through.
u/okthatsfineman boutta buy another can with the non existent money I have ü§£
Alright, I am ordering more suppressors to see if I can catch some of this luck. Also my tax refund was just deposited this AM.
Let me know how you like the Obsidian 45, I just bought one as well.
Damn that‚Äôs awesome let me go submit my two I have sitting!
Sonofa...!!!

Congrats brother, that's f'n awesome.
Would love your input on that enticer. Considering one for my DDM4 PDW
Sweet, mine are ready certify, apparently my dealer is overwhelmed..and I haven't set an appointment
Is it me or have I seen more and more people getting approved within 2 months or less
So wait I‚Äôm confused‚Ä¶.  You blew the ffl dealer and he let you take the cans home?
I heard on here that silencershop kinda sucked for getting fast approvals
I now have a glimpse of what it would feel like to have a co-worker hit the lottery.

Congrats OP

üò∂
I gave you a thumbs down out of jealousy
Your on a watch list I think
Cap üß¢üß¢üß¢üß¢
ü´£üôè‚Ä¶In the name of the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit‚Ä¶
What's the secret? Took me 8 months on my last suppressor and before than 5+ months
This guy is either walking around with a four leaf clover and horseshoe up his ass or he sold soul to Satan.
39 HOURS?!?? You have to be fu$king kidding me!! 

I waited almost 14 months for my first can, the last one I got a few months ago too took 8 months.
This reminds me of the first week the PS5 came out. Thinking we might have a chance at getting one I went with my ex to wait on line at a game store with about 40 other people. 5 minutes in the store worker make an announcement they just sold the last one of the week and everyone is pissed and cussing. This dorky rich-looking family exits the store cheering with their ps5 box held high, evidently unable to read the room. This little  Latino kid comes out of nowhere‚Ä¶ the crowd is watching at what we assume is going to be a snatch and grab‚Ä¶The kid just smacks the damn box out of the spoiled rich kid‚Äôs hands directly into the ground, then kicks it as the kid tries to lick it up. He then moonwalks backwards while giving them the finger. I was fucking losing it. üòÇ

So OP, watch yourself.. We‚Äôre all a varying mix of happy for you and REALLY f‚Äôkin jealous‚Ä¶
I'm holding back the urge to tell you off.  After many cans, the shortest of which has been 208 days, I could only dream of a 39 hour approval.  You must have been the first form in the stack of a new ATF processor.
Although semi salty over my 11 month wait for my first can, congrats man! You got the approval time that should be standard imo
What unholy acts did you preform to pull that off?!?
Damn,  I wish I had the $ right now to buy a couple more cans...
Damn that‚Äôs speedy. I am at a week and NICS says my background check has already gone through.
I hate you, with all due respect
I hate you
Wtf!!!! Crazy!!!
What the actual fuck!!!!
Frustrated eforms is down right now‚Ä¶
Do you recommend ordering through the silencershop website, or a kiosk at a local gunshop?
Did you enclose a pic of an un-wiped butthole or something?
Well thank you for convincing me to spend $800.
Day 280. That‚Äôs some bull!!!
Got me checking my email every hour.
I'm waiting to certify mine so I can hopefully get on this train üò´
It's not a long wait, but it's been since September :(
Meanwhile my form for from 1/24/24 just sitting there
Man wtf
Fuck youuuuuuuuuu üñïüèæ 



And congratulations buddy üá∫üá∏üçæ üéâ
Hoping so hard I‚Äôm next in line. My first suppressor literally took over 500 days. That entitles me to a quickie, right? I submitted my form on Friday
All of these short wait times is tempting me to make a poor financial decision...
Geez like going to the local auto parts store and they say they'll transfer it and have it for you tomorrow afternoon lol. Pay leave go to work, home, sleep back to work and voila pick em up on way home üòÑ Something like that

Congrats man they sure are pretty
Congratulations and fuck the ATF!
I have both of those and a sparrow sitting in the safe at the shop and have been since beginning of december ü´°
Sent paperwork in for mine on Feb 2 and was approved on the 29th. First one I‚Äôve ever had but even I know that 20 days is still insanely quick.
Huzzah!
Congratulations and fuck you
I should've filed as a individual.
So never a physical tax stamp with this? Just an image of an approved one? I haven‚Äôt looked into the process in 15 years causensait times were such bull. Back in my day, trusts were free (major malfunction) and tax stamps were that. Actual stamps. Not images of stamps. Well I‚Äôll just send an image of $200 then. Lolz
I just got my first one back in just over 24 hours ü•≤
I think yall have convinced me to do individual and not a trust.

Should be same day honestly, how is a firearm inherently more dangerous than a metal tube?
This is fucking bs.  Wtf
That's faster than the damn F3 I'm waiting on to even get started.
Wtf. 

I filed form 4 as a trust on dec 4th. I emailed nicsliasion a couple days ago and they said they haven‚Äôt even gotten the request from ATF yet.
This is getting out of control. What‚Äôs next, no approval needed? Buy em like like their ear pro? What a backwards world.
Now is the time. They are working hard to pad those numbers.
Who sent you the email?  Currently waiting a month so far after my first form 4 was approved.
I am buying one outside of my trust to see how fast I get it done   That‚Äôs crazy fast
Lol what ? It took me a year to get my first. What am I doing wrong?
The standard deviation in approval times is gigantic.
Can‚Äôt even get my to certify since last Friday attempted 14 times
Sonofabitch‚Ä¶260 days n counting on my form 1 and 185 days so far on my form 4. üò≠
What state are you in?
I waited 8184 hours for mine. Whats actually infuriating is i 100% believe the atf is doing this only to temporarily mitigate legal arguments challenging the constitutionality of the NFA
I hate you.
Wtf I literally just got off of year wait for approval
How is this possible when they're doing batches from 2023?
9/12/23 waiting like üôÉ
It takes generally about 8-14 months to get approved for a silencer
I‚Äôm about to submitted rn and eat ramen for the next 3 weeks hoping for some luck
Trust or individual?
Hate from SC
With all do respect, go fuck yourself
Curious, what was your control number?

I also certified 2 form 4s on Monday around the same time.
Also 96 hour gang.
Trusts have to speed up a little bit with this kinda turn times right??  My wait just started. And I regret not going individual
And I‚Äôm going on 9 months for my MK18. This is some bullshit with all do respect lol
Enticer gang!!
I've waited 34,272 hours for mine.
I'm torn between wanting my current 78,490 minute wait to be approved and wanting to get another can submitted so I can maybe get them both approved on the same day.
Man fuck this I‚Äôm buying something THIS WEEK
BOOO THIS MAAAN
Still waiting on my eForm since August
I think u got my rugged obsidian! Lol dammit
I wish they'd batch approve, they'd probably be 3x faster,  as aren't we all sitting on a few cans at once anyway.  I had 3 cans in jail and they only approved 1 after 1 year and ignored the other 2.
This is getting fucking wild
*me at 12 days* hey god, me again
What the fucking hell!
Congrats but what the actual fuck
Fuck me, it took 8160 hours for me to get my last two suppressors. I'm happy folks are getting cans, but I'm salty it took me so long to get mine.
Fuck you so hard
Back in my day... we had to wait years to get an approval... this new generation has it easy üòÖ
Trust or individual
My last one was 7 mths ü•≤
I really regret doing a trust, wow.  I didn‚Äôt even have anyone in mind, just got a blank single shot trust in case I ever wanted to add anyone, because at the time the wait was like 140 days vs 170‚Ä¶. Now it‚Äôs like 40 vs 170‚Ä¶

Hopefully it gets processed as quick as an individual, but I‚Äôm sure anything attached to a trust gets thrown in a separate pile. 

Def going individual next time.
That is fucking crazy
Trust?
As of yesterday at 3pm. The atf shut down eforms website. There is something going on in the background we don't know about. But I belive they are trying to clear out the back log.
Is there somewhere I can check my status or do I have to call the ATF  NFA branch? I bought mine in January
I‚Äôve been seeing a trend of new Eforms being approved quickly. Is this legit or is it some kind of reporting bias?
welp.. Silencershop sales just went up ;)
Did you file as individual or a trust?   Pls say trust‚Ä¶.üòÇ
good times when it takes longer for shipping and SS to get their paperwork ready than the actual approval time
I‚Äôll hit the 1 year mark in 46 hours ü•≤
Wow!  I just got one approved in 4 days and I thought I was lucky!
I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of people getting theirs approved in a week or less even someone on the we like shooting podcast say they knew someone who got approved before they left the shop, crazy!
Currently at 23 days and all I want to do is put that obsidian 9 on my SP5 and just jump with joy.
I'm at *8,640 hours* and still waiting...how crazy
Damn, nice bro! I just got mine approved in 18 days. Maybe they're speeding up or something idk.
Maybe buying multiples is the key... mine took 6 months
Oooh I hope mine gets approved quick but it‚Äôs already past 39 hours for me üòÇ¬†
If we start measuring by hours then I‚Äôve been waiting 9,288 for mine.
I‚Äôm at 26280 hours. I‚Äôm convinced that the ATF hates me or forgot I exist
Last one took me 5496
I mean it could just be a 4473 but here we are...

Bro I literally said the exact same thing on Monday when I submitted.
Yeah I‚Äôd like to get in on this
Efile or Silencer shop and do it as in individual.  Trusts are still taking months.  Pay the extra $200 next month to move it to the Trust while you use it for the next year.

Count me in on that. I‚Äôm sitting at 172 days
305 days‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm happy for everyone and just angry that this proves it can happen this fast, the fed bois just choose not to.
This is some straight horseshit. As much as I firmly believe the trust is the right call I am very much regretting it.
Yeh, fuck all them idiots filing as an individual. Trust master race (except our wait times are atrocious)
Ditto
FiRsT iN fIrSt OuT
4x 105 days here as well
Do trusts take longer or something?
Local gun store that does suppressors said the last three individual purchases have been sub 40 days.
I concur, hahaha

My guy,  that's a Ford
Yes
üò≠
Literally what I said to my buddy on Monday after submitting.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering‚Ä¶  what suddenly changed to break through the eform gridlock? And if individual applications are suddenly moving forward uninhibited, what‚Äôs causing the bottleneck on the trust apps?‚Ä¶ my guess is it‚Äôs something absolutely ridiculous. There‚Äôs no reason any govt application, permit, etc. should take longer than a few weeks.

This is good news that we should take with caution. It‚Äôs the way things ought to be, but generally isn‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs be ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù.

Pretty much all individual
What did you order?
ATF made a statement at shot show that (in light of the Texas vs ATF), they will begin pushing individual through at record speed, as they told the judge approvals are sub 30 days across the board (blatant lie). So now they are approving individuals to lower their overall median, but no change to the time it takes for trust they said. Almost wonder if this is their attempt to keep silencers on the NFA list, because I think everyone knows they SHOULDNT be....

Filed individual.
Bought it for the AP5 and expected to use my 12 month wait time to source a USP45. Now I'm in a bit of a pickle haha.
So funny story with that one. Ordered a polonium 30 originally but the shop waited 30 days to tell me they didn't have any. Substituted the Enticer LTi for a little more but they gave me a steep discount on it. Looking forward to running the shittiest 7.62 I have through it.
That's crazy. I live in a pretty small farming town that just happens to have a kiosk. The dealer told me his shortest time so far was 6-8 weeks so I told him to start an approval times score board.

It definitely took some time to get to the point of certifying.
Fair. Have an upvote so I can spread the wealth.

Be a good noodle.
It's the rabbit's foot I got a the skating rink when I was 7
Buy another one to try and average down.
Please don't throw mine on the ground. I haven't had a chance to break them myself yet.
I uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh paid them money?
I actually ordered through a different website to a Silencershop FFL and he just brought it into his system, I bought the stamp through the silencershop website and used the kiosk. It was all so easy I don't know how it could be messed up.
Would have loved to mushroom stamp the finger prints but the FFL was giving me weird looks at the kiosk.

Dang I‚Äôm only 6008 hours
Im 2k in now
Just got my first can a few days ago after 4400 hours.. have an ef1 trust at 5400 hours :(¬†
My first can took over 15,000 hours!
6,220 for me
How? Did you add an extra number in there?
Well, this is awkward‚Ä¶. Yeah, the truth is, we had a whole NFA meeting and decided ‚ÄúSpartan7900? Man, we HATE that guy!‚Äù So we burned a printout of your form in a trash can out back in a little ceremony we made up on the fly. Agent Magnum delivered a fiery, rousing speech riffing on variations of ‚ÄúF@‚Ç¨K Spartan7900!‚Äù
You need to email NICS my friend.
If it makes you feel any better, I've been waiting one less month than you.  

Then again, I got my approval email earlier today.  Sorry.  :(
Mine took 4,080
LOL definitely saving that for the meme bank.
Didn‚Äôt notice but love my Enticer. Great for a bolty.
Gonna need you to walk me through your exact 39 hour routine prior to approval üòÇ
Why move it?!
The future libertarians want.
Except people with trusts lol. I'm really starting to regret the trust.
The way it ought to be.
I had two approved yesterday. Submitted 1-17 and approved 2-27 Total of 41 days.
I waited 8 months for my first can a few years ago. The ATF expedited my second because the FFL was closing, so it only took 3 months.
Dude, I am in the same boat with you. Filed on Feb 8th under a trust.....now seeing super fast approvals and knowing my shit will probably take a year. Its just not cool.
Can you buy straight and then convert to a trust?
What's the problem filing as an individual? I genuinely don't understand lol.
Embarrassing because I drive an f150 üòÇ

I just had one approved yesterday (RC2) at 33 days. But 39 hours is crazy

I will buy and JUST MISS this trend and have to wait 7-9 months‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs my fear.

On my list for sure; a 46 Cal, dedicated 556, maybe another 36, hummm‚Ä¶
Are you doing this where you have like a kiosk???? 

Is that how these are getting done so quick? 

What the fuck is going with all these people getting approved so quickly. I might just grab A 22 LR and a 7.62x39 can.
Ok.  I guess I‚Äôll keep an eye out for the next 5 months or so lol.  I filed same way as you but didn‚Äôt get lucky yet.
Haha no just bad luck I guess, I have a trust with 3 RPs. I hit the three year mark in January, I‚Äôve tried calling and emailing but I just get the usual ‚Äúit‚Äôs pending‚Äù
They do make a good argument, that spartan guy sucks
100% worked for me
That just means there is hope
Go to work,  take a few naps. After enough naps,  they approve.
What‚Äôs travel time to the Ariel Rios Federal Building (99 New York Ave, Washington DC) while carrying kneepads and lipstick? From OP‚Äôs listed address? 

That ‚Äòroutine‚Äô may be a real short checklist.
Consider it a fee to cut in line.  I just did it and turned it around in 25 days.  i am going for another round this weekend.
Especially if you have to pay the 200 all over again
I moved to a purple state with great 2A rights, it is how I feel everyday. At least before too many certain people move over.
I‚Äôm a pretty staunch left learning woman and I also want suppressors.
I didn‚Äôt get one. It‚Äôs just me.
Fuck off bro lol
I certified in January (so I shouldn't really even be complaining) and I will say I \*have\* noticed the Trust wait times come down [here](https://www.silencershop.com/atf-wait-times), but just not to the same extent as Individuals.
You can transfer from individual to a trust but it does require an additional $200 stamp. You are allowed to posses your can during the transfer. So you *can* (potentially) have the best of both but it will require an additional $200.
the hypothetical what if scenarios, mostly. 

For me- I would like to not have to worry if I leave something in my wifes car when I borrow it, or if I leave something suppressed outside of the safe (like a bump in the night firearm).

Chances an ATF agent is in my home are super slim, but I'd rather my wife be 100% legally allowed to handle my NFA items/have possession vs. chancing it. Plus I can add friends/family to the trust if they need to borrow something, house-sit, etc. and then remove them afterwards.
I may be wrong, but without a trust, they can't be used/in possession by others. Maybe it's harder to transfer them when you die. I was told to get a trust so I did single shots for my 2 cans. There's plenty of people here who have way more knowledge on pros/cons of trust versus individual
I saw that lmao
AFAIK just not transferable easily if individual but it seems to affect times quite a bit.
Hell yeah! I have a YHM Turbo T2 and I love it. They‚Äôre really well made and stand shoulder to shoulder with suppressors literally 2-3 times the cost. The T2 is definitely a gassy can tho, but that won‚Äôt an issue on the R9. Solid choice.
Great reviews on it. It‚Äôs longer than I‚Äôd like. But just put a law folder on my PDW.
I've been wanting a .22 can to round out the collection and then move to a dedicated 556. The Enticer 30 will be the 556 can until then.
Yeah, Local FFL has a kiosk
I was told I was ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù at the background check. I sent a letter to my local congressman (I live in a very 2nd-Amendment friendly area), and I was approved in 3 days. It can‚Äôt hurt to try. I was skeptical, but it worked.
Send an email to: nicsliason@fbi.gov

Give them your name, name of trust and details of your submission

Form 1 or 4
Permit number
Date submitted

I just did this Sunday, Tuesday they replied saying my case was resolved or something and yesterday, I got 7 of 9 stamps approved.  Filed as a trust and waited about 6 months for cans AND SBRs

Just remember to be polite as much as it might sting
That's insane. It took mine 9 months and I had 7 RPs. There's no reason yours should take that long
See, it‚Äôs that sort of self-awareness that we detest. We hate looking in the mirror; why should we help somebody who can look their reflection in the eye?!
Answer the actual question... who or what did you fap to my guy...?
Well there‚Äôs your problem, you gotta go to the facility in WV
You efiled a form 4 as an individual and only waited 25 days?
with all the crazy, i really dont want to wait 180+ days to find out the ATF has now changed all the rules that says they can do what they want after the next Supreme Court ruling or Congress reacting to an incident with stupid.
Not with that attitude you dont!  /s
Chickens for KFC
Yeah, it just kills because right after i filed with trust,  wait times for individual dropped.
Damn, then I'm going to have to pay again if I ever decide to move my single shots into a larger catchall trust.
Do you know if I can file as an individual now even though my other cans are on a trust?
Individual applications are getting speed up.  I just had one go super quick and I am speaking to others seeing the same.
In Sweden of all places you can buy a suppressor off the shelf as long as you have the coinage. Look at all the hoops we have to jump through¬†
Others can use them if you are there. Transferring when you kick the bucket shouldn‚Äôt be too bad. Just need to have them listed in your will. Then whoever gets them does a form 5
so others can use them while you are present, I got some of mine for home defense. What if I'm not there and the wife needs it?
Yeah,  it does look huge but it's quite light.  Won't be able to shoot for a couple weeks but I can message you with my thoughts
I‚Äôll definitely check that out, thanks!
What do you hate more? Competence, self-awareness,  or dogs?
üòè
Obviously Ripley
I figured this wasn‚Äôt worker-bee stuff and that they went straight to the head office to get things done that fast
Yes.  I canceled my Trust form, reapplied with individual last month.  Will move into the Family Trust next month and they can take as long as they want
Sorry but I‚Äôm not a single issue voter. I agree with a lot more left policies than I do right by a long shot. And if you think republicans will protect your guns. Boy are you gonna be surprised.
Of course because it is in left-leaning people‚Äôs interest to disarm themselves
It‚Äôs ok, I filed as individual because at the time it was faster than trusts.  1 year 2 months later I got my approvals, and having now formed a trust, need to pay more money to transfer them into a trust so my wife and dad can legally bring the stuff to the range without me
Correct. For my personal situation a catch-all trust makes sense, I don‚Äôt have a need for single shots. If yours are already in single shots then there may not be a need to move everything to a single trust. For me I think any trust is better than individual (except for wait times üò¢)
Yes. Each NFA item is its own approval process and is not tied to or affected by other submitted or approved items.
Yeah but you have to jump through way more to get anything to put it on
Shoot then take off can before the fuzz shows....
Yes.
So when you sold your soul‚Ä¶ how does that work? Is it just like in the catchy guitar song??
Oh you‚Äôre definitely going to the head office, but that‚Äôs just what they call the dimly lit room in the basement of the WV building
Can‚Äôt tell if sarcasm.
I'd eventually like to get my collection to the point where it's worth doing everything under a single trust I can add family and friends to.  Right now I'm just waiting on my first two NFA items so single shots are fine.
And act like your ears are ringing really bad when they show up.  

"You shot this without a muzzle break?"

"WHAT?  SORRY MY EARS ARE RINGING!"
Asking for a friend...

&#x200B;

It's me I'm the friend...
It is sarcasm
I believe you can withdraw & reapply under a single trust but then you‚Äôd be at the back of the approval line. Would save you a future $400 though.
Phew okay. Remember this /s. It‚Äôs helpful. Because one never knows.
Why is my cars engine shaking like this? 
Had a big issue where the car stopped running yesterday night, oil levels were really low and I haven‚Äôt replaced the oil in this vehicle in almost a year now due to financial troubles. I just put a quart of oil in and this is the result. Is there anything I can do to stop this or what is the problem? Is my engine ruined?

You're about to launch a connecting Rod into space
Saving $30 just cost you $4000.¬†
There's an old saying "it's expensive to be poor".   This is a perfect example.

Your engine is probably goners at this point.  What could have been a $50 oil job turned in to a multi-thousand dollar engine replacement or used vehicle.  

In the future, and I'm sure you know this already, it'll be far more advantageous to stop using the multi-thousand dollar piece of equipment and find another way to get around rather than drive this one in to the dirt.
It sounds like a 60's 3 cylinder tractor diesel with pistons made out of wood.

It's gone, ceased to be. Toast.
That sounds like a spun bearing. It means your financial troubles will be sticking around for a bit. 

You may need an engine, or another vehicle if that is the faulure. Just a fyi, i get the cost of living is high, but being frugal doesnt mean you ignore/dont worry about things, youll need to put more time in yourself to make sure things financially work out for you.
Your engine is dead because you didn't maintain it. Engines don't run on hopes and dreams.

I love how everyone is commenting on how bad the ecotec engines are. This one has gone 40k miles since the last oil change, has no oil in it, still running, pretty good if you ask me. You can't shit on the product when all the owner did was neglect it and not maintain it at all. 

And to the owner, when you do this to your next car, the result will be the same. Even if you refused to change the oil, you could have checked the level and at least topped it off. It takes A LOT more than gas to make a car go.
I was scrolling through my feed when I briefly got distracted by my newborn.  Did not see the post before I heard it.

My mind thought I was going to turn back to my phone to see an M60 sending rounds down range... Lol
how and why would you POSSIBLY run low on oil for a YEAR? im sorry but some people should stay away from cars there's just no way man... insane
It's cold. Bring it inside with some hot water bottles and a blanket. The trick is to warm it up slowly so it doesn't get frost bitten or have long term damage. 

In all seriousness though that engine is Fucked with a capital F. Start shopping my friend. Also consider the expense of putting a new engine in. You already have everything else that goes around the engine so if it's still roadworthy, it's worth considering at least with the new and used car prices I'm seeing.
That engine is DONE. A few 12$ quarts of oil here and there would have prevented this. Replacing the engine will exceed the value of this car.
That shit is done
1 thing you never do to save money is skip out on oil/fluid changes, they are a necessary cost and will end up causing thousands of dollars in damage if left undone.

$30-50 just cost you several thousand, just like that.
How many miles are on this oil change? What is the year, make, model, engine?
You haven't changed or added oil in a year?? Jesus christ.
Send the engine to the 'I Do Cars' guy on YouTube. This should be a good one.
Don't worry it'll quite down soon.
Sounds like spun bearings. It sounds like all the internals(rods on crankshaft, pistons) are just slapping around and about to explode. If your engine just stopped running while low on (extremely overdue) oil you likely ceased it and have ruined the internals. If your oil is as overdue as you said it was to other people, I wouldn't even bother sending it to a shop to be looked at. It's destroyed. It needs a full rebuild.  You'll be wasting your money having it looked at. Cut your losses and sell it for parts (will take forever) or have someone pick it up for scrap metal, they may give you upwards of 200$ for it depending on the size.

I'm sorry this happened to you, truly. It's no fun when this happens but let this be a lesson to take oil changes seriously from now on.
Ever heard the saying "penny wise pound foolish"? 

Because skimping on oil is a 100%  picture-perfect example of that. 

You saved 30 bucks on oil and a filter doing the job yourself to now have to spend probably 5,000 to get that vehicle right.  That engine is toast and wont take you very far anymore. Knocking like that is terminal.
You‚Äôre gonna want to snag a second job within walking distance of your house and make a friend who can pick you up for work in the morning for gas money and drop you off.

You‚Äôre about to need a new engine or a beater to get you around in.

If you live in a moderate climate you can look into a moped, helmet and a leather jacket
Yeah that engine is done. You should‚Äôve at a minimum kept the oil level full. A quart of oil at Walmart is only $5
Lollllll those financial troubles are about to get worse!
You didn‚Äôt change, or at least check and top off the oil

Now shes fucked and your financial troubles are a lot worse‚Ä¶
40k on the same oil? I‚Äôm surprised it didn‚Äôt explode 10k miles ago. 

You should have changed the oil at 6k miles max.
You need a new engine.
Its the pistons wanting to come out and play
Your engine is pretending to be a small anti aircraft gun!
Uncle Rodney ? That you?

Send this engine to Eric at I do cars. I‚Äôd like to see this disaster torn down.
oil is cheap, engines are expensive. you‚Äôre going to learn the hard way.
Saving the money and not changing your oil has cost you your engine.
Thats a dropped rod by the sounds of if the block is gone due to the rod. Whole engine will need to be replaced.
You need a new engine. Would have been a lot cheaper to drop $50 on an oil change
Because it's an ecotec
Putting off maintenance just cost you a new engine.  That thing is about to blow.
I guarantee I can find the money for an oil change in the history of your financial transactions. You probably blew all your money on food, or some other habit you have, and blame it on "financial troubles". Well, guess what? NOW you're about to have some REAL financial troubles. 

Stop making excuses and get your oil changed next time. Engine's toast.
No oil change in a year? I honestly don‚Äôt even feel bad
Sounds like you spun a bearing. I‚Äôm assuming this is a colbalt/sonic/cruze? Eco tech motors are in pretty much everything from the colbalt to the equinox. 

Engine is toast. Will need rebuilt or replaced and any other advice is pointless. There‚Äôs no fixing a knock like that. Especially if you put oil in it and that‚Äôs the result. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
Oil changes are cheap, engine changes are not.
Perfectly normal lol
Neglecting preventative maintenance to save money is just a "double it and pass it to future me" situation.
Based on your comment and post history I‚Äôm glad this has happened to you. OP, sort you life out
Detoxing.   Get it back on the beer.
It's literally $60 max for an oil change at a quick service place. How can you not budget that in over a year??
It's a GM ecotec 2.4 LE5. 

It happens to all of them if you aren't changing oil every 4000 miles and checking oil level every other fill up. They're awful, terrible engines. Even if you do change your oil religiously and replace the enormous amounts of oil they all burn between changes the large static timing guide between the intake cam sorocket and crank sprocket will sometimes break and send bits of plastic and metal all through the oil and kill it anyway.

Demand and therefore prices for used replacement engines is insanely high for these. Add labor and it is absolutely not worth it. That car is toast.

Go buy yourself a used Toyota or Mazda.
Moron. Youre ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and full of ‚Äúmoney troubles‚Äù because you want to be. Ride a bike until you grow up.
What do you mean by stopped running? Like it overheated? It shut down on its own?
That engine is toast.  That $80 in oil changes you skipped just cost you $4,000.
It's cold and the engine is shaking.  Needs heavy duty jacket, gloves and a hat and size 33 booties
I watched this without sound and thought "maybe a worn motor mount" turned on the sound and was like "NOPE, not good"  sorry, but that engine is toast.
Do you happen to own a bicycle?
Good one genius. You completely killed your engine lol. You really couldn‚Äôt spare 40-50$ to do your oil change?
Amazing what a 5.00 quart of oil will do when it comes to prevention, ain‚Äôt it?
It's got way too much power
When owning a car, the only thing you must do as a vehicle owner is PUT OIL IN THE CAR, Car will last FOREVER if you put OIL in. It‚Äôs so simple man. Rip that is smoked sorry brother
cars are part of your needs if its to get you to work and you cant walk or bike there. You need to attention to your needs. Even topping it up with the oil at Wesco for like $8 is perfect until you have enough for an oil change or learn how to do it yourself. Its easier than it sounds and saves you a lot of money and stress. It's understandable tho. I lost my first car because nobody told me about the importance of oil changes. Cars are a learning experience no matter your age
Sounds like you‚Äôre gonna have to start using some 10w-40 in that thing now
from your comments and the video i would say with like 80% certainty that you have a severe knock and that engine is toast. 

first thing i would do is pull the plugs and see if you have any fouled out with the thinnest desperate hope that maybe you are down a cylinder or two and cleaning the plugs could fix it. youd be able to tell right away if the plugs were fouled out, they would be all black on the ceramic. 

otherwise to check if you have a rod knock youd have to drop the pan which is gonna be way more work. if youre not even putting oil in your car i can only assume you dont know how to do that or change your plugs either so realistically either find a buddy who can manage it for you or get a bike. 

lesson here is oil is a lot cheaper than an engine. this was 100% preventable and if you actually leave this situation having learned that, it might have almost been worth it.
Bro... a 5 quart jug of oil is like $15-$20 at walmart, that engine is done for unfortunately
I get it. I've been homeless on and off for months. But I have literally scrapped together spare change to buy engine oil. If I don't have my vehicle I have nothing. Oil changes are always priority. I will not eat for 2 days if it means I can afford an oil filter and some oil.
We need Eric from "I Do Cars" to tear this engine down
Yeah‚Ä¶oil isn‚Äôt an optional item.
You messed up
Knock, knock... Who's there? That engine is about to deliver a used baby rod.
What you are hearing is engine failure. The engine failed from lack of oil. This is a terrible way to learn this lesson. You could make you feel any better, millions of people have learned this lesson this same way.  
At a minimum, you should be checking your oil level with the dipstick under the hood once a month.  Going to long without an oil change is not what caused this catastrophic failure. Having no oil in the engine and running it is what caused it.
It's so frustrating that many, maybe even the majority, of the cars in junkyards are there simply because no one changes their oil. We need a government PSA ad on TV or something. It'd save billions of dollars in waste.
Oil change??  People, he didn‚Äôt have any oil to change!!  üòÜ I have a 2016 Malibu 4 cylinder turbo and it goes through oil like crazy.  I just check and add and get an ‚Äúoil change‚Äù every 5 or 6k.
Bro has all the time n money in the world for video games and only fans but can't spend $30 on oil... You brought this on yourself fool
Wow great advice thread for what my boy asked about
Give her some engine honey and pray to whatever God you believe in but it probably won't help (might make it quieter but won't fix anything). Chances are this engine is gonna completely fail sooner rather than later
Learning how to do an oil change can reduce the cost by almost 1/2. You could have done an oil change every 7k miles with synthetic and been fine (7k is pushing it but it would have worked) and cost you around $30-35 each time.

Instead you ignored it for 40k miles and killed your engine. If stupid had a picture in the dictionary...

This isn't about financial woes. This is simply something you just *don't* do. It's like not eating and wondering why you are dying.
Engine is ded
You basically bought some stocks when they were high, didn‚Äôt pay attention because (insert excuse) the company went out of business and now they are worthless . Analogy aside, when an engine ‚Äústops‚Äù from lack of oil, it seized and that means that all of the tolerances are now marred and out of spec. Hence the connecting rod bearing ‚Äúknock‚Äù. That motor is completely worthless even to use for a rebuild.
Oil check needed cylinder just not firing and a bit of engine knock to boot me thinks
Almost musical beat there
Rod knock most likely or even missing a cylinder.
No oil, this engine is beyond saving. Your car is totaled
Ain‚Äôt got no gas in it
Because it's one cylinder is doing its best to keep you moving forwards
What did the mechanic say?
nice machine gun
Engine about to go BOOM!

Damn I bet that oil change was like draining spoiled milk out of the pan.
Knock knock!  Uncle Rodney is here!
It‚Äôs cold.
Welcome to the life of taking public transit. You do not save money by neglecting maintenance.
Sounds like an old-school biplane!

You said you only added a quart of oil...did that get the oil back up to the full mark on the dipstick? One quart low is within a reasonable range.  In 30-40k miles I'd worry just as much about the oil filter degrading or getting clogged up.
If you can't afford to carry out a basic service on your vehicle, you can't afford to own a vehicle full stop. Perhaps spend that few dollars you saved on engine oil on a new bicycle.
my oh my.
What financial troubles were remedied by saving $30 and were worth this situation?
Done for
Scrap it get a new car
Churning butter again.  She be a toasted engine.  Sorry.
It's petrolfied.

I'll see myself out.
No oil change due financial issues? It's like 50-70 bucks!

Quart of oil to almost empty motor? That's like... 10 bucks!

New motor for 1.5-3k, or "new" car for 4-7k? Yeah, that's easy, no financial issues there I suppose.
Jesus Christ
Check your oil levels. This could happen with too little or too much oil.
Is that a Michael J Fox engine?
Wellllll $40 oil change in the driveway just turned into a 1.5k+ at the shop
Knock sensor is no good. Probably motor mounts also
My neighbor has a Subaru that was making noise just like this. His father came by and complained that they knew nothing about cars and that they shouldn't have owned one. Soon after he brought a mechanic with him who, from what I saw, changed the oil over and over and over again over a two day period in the driveway basically flushing the motor imo, until the engine was as quiet as a mouse. I was flabbergasted. He wasn't someone I really spoke to as he didn't answer my hellos so I didn't want to ask what they did exactly to get it running so beautifully.   Not saying it will work with yours though...

"ecotec"
Fuck me ! That‚Äôs a goner!
you need to replace the part that goes vroom vroom. That  Ecotech requires oil changes every 500 miles.
people really neglect their car to this level ? or this is just troll, cant tell whats real and not anymore
Rod knock, you need a new engine

If you cant afford a few quarts of oil here and there you cant afford to drive
It needs another beat... turn it up
Yeah‚Ä¶ that engine is absolutely done. There is zero chance to fix it, case closed.
Your shit is cooked, never skip oil changes
I'm surprised it hasn't created its own inspection port by now.
Engine is toast
That's rod knock.
Havent replaced the oil due to financial troubles? Holy shit. Must be some major $ problems.
Good luck.
Its cooked. Junk it.
Big oof
What is this car‚Äôs year and model?
Oh man‚Ä¶. I was going to say your motor mounts are bad, but then I turned on the sound and realized that your engine is toasted‚Ä¶. It sounds like an old tractor engine, and not in a good way.
I had this exact thing happen to me with nearly the exact same noise. The engine is bad. Is it a Hyundai?
Looks like it‚Äôs bus life for you
Are you sure you put the oil in the wrong hole?
That's the sound of death. Sounds like it's about to seize up

Bye bye engine. Stop treating your cars like shit.

Five quarts of oil is $25. 

I get hard times, but you do not fuck around with your engines oil. Doordash for two hours to get money for an oil change.

I'm sorry to say but your engine is toast. Unequivocally toast.

Cmon man, times are tough but letting your car go over a year without an oil change is just asking for problems to Happen, and I‚Äôm not an expert but I‚Äôm sure this is going to cost you a lot more than a years worth of oil changes to fix
Are you the dude that broke down in the Costco gas station behind me a week or so ago? üòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You can buy the oil, filter, some rags, crescent wrench, strap wrench and catch pan for like 100-120 bucks. You can then keep the tools, and from then on just buy oil and oil filters for like 50 bucks. Oil changes are generally easy to do and youtube will teach you everything you need to know. Put 5 dollars a week away for your future oil changes so you can always afford to do it. Drive the car up onto pieces of wood in a stair formation if you can't afford a jack and jack stands, or simply borrow a jack. That way you can get under the car. 

Always use jack stands or something besides a jack if going underneath a vehicle, that way if the jack loses pressure and you're under there you don't get crushed. My life has been saved by jack stands for this very reason.
Car is done.

Don't get a new car since you can't afford this one.

Bike Lane is your new route to work.
Time for new engine
Perhaps, the motor mounts needs to be replaced because they're worn out!
If you treated kids the way you treated this car, your kids would be dead and you would be rotting in a cell.

Oil is the only thing that keeps your engine from shredding itself. Change. Your. Oil. 
Check your oil. Keep it full, because every car burns some oil, it's just part of how they work.

Next time, DIY it and buy the cheapest filter you can get and use Walmart brand oil. Cheap out if you need to. That's fiscally responsible. I mean hell, dollar tree oil is better than what you've done, and that's saying something.

And if anyone tells you not to "waste money on oil changes" you need to not listen to them, just stop trusting them because they have no aptitude to make such an irresponsible suggestion.
Because it‚Äôs turned on
Because it's cold! Throw a blanket on it. Buurrrrrr
Your pistons are toast.
Have you forgotten to feed the little midget that rocks your pistons? He sounds angry.
Car is headed to the junk yard. Rod knock. Don't take care of shit don't expect it to take care of you.
Havent change the oil in almost a year?! I could understand if this isn't your daily, but wtf. It is better to spend $30 on oil once in a while than spend on an engine swap.
Please change your oil next time. I say next time because this engine is done.

A friend of mine killed his first car (a Mazda 6 that was well-maintained by my brother before selling it to him) because he thought oil changes were too expensive. We said, "Maintain it, keep up with regular maintenance, and you're set."

Fast forward, the car is dead after like half a year, and a few months later, he dropped $1200 on a crappier, rusted-up car.

Oil changes: $30+ every 3 months or 3k miles, depending on the vehicle. This is much cheaper than the $1000+ you'll spend on a new engine or a crappier car. If you can afford to put gas in your car, you can afford an oil change.

Long post, because this post made me remember that situation, and now I'm annoyed.
It's ready to fuckin GO
Rumble young man rumble
To stop it, turn the key 30 degrees counter clockwise. Then fill the window instead of the gas tank and have a dart.
It sounds like there‚Äôs a giant hole in the side of your block
A YEAR!? You went a year without changing your oil? Oh my gosh I can‚Äôt even right now. Trying to save 50 dollars max has now cost you A. Either a new engine/anything else broken from what you‚Äôve done or B. You get to spend the next 72 months with a car payment and hella interest. I don‚Äôt even feel right going 100 miles over my oil life and you went a year that‚Äôs crazy. But I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that can be done here, rip your car hope it had a good run. The replacement/repair of the engine will be the cheapest choice but also won‚Äôt be cheap because it‚Äôs an engine.
Dog, you blew it up. Checking and adding oil wont break the bank. Now a 5k engine will most definatly break the bank.
I had a friend where this exact thing happened. For some reason, he refused to change his oil- even after my friend and I taught him. Then, one day, he sends us both a video of his engine shaking and banging. Funniest part was, he kept recording the racket for like two minutes and had the nerve to report back an hour later that the car wouldn‚Äôt start. 

Whatta fucking idiot.
Oh Crikey. Scrimping on oil changes is false economy.
Why does it sound like this?
This guy's been doing Amazon deliveries with a 40k mile oil change interval?! Yeah it's dead.
Sick drum beat
Sometimes you run across those videos of someone removing an oil pan and seeing almost solid sludge. I‚Äôve always wondered , how does someone let that happen? Now I see how, this is insane lmao
Yew kilt it
Valve tap
It‚Äôs just shivering because it‚Äôs cold, try taking out the coolant
Wow this is some orgasmic sounding engine. Why do modern engines sound so smooth and quiet? I want more of this. proper diesel sound
That engine sounds like a metal drummer playing blast beats.
New soundtrack for the upcoming Madagascar movie?
Ecotechs are known for vvt solenoids when oil is not changed or gets too low which could cause a misfire and stalling.
It is scared. You should do something to comfort it!
Could be engine mounts
I think it just needs to achieve the self aeration process to do this you put it in neutral and hold the gas down until it bounces of the Rev limiter then you hold for 15 - 30 seconds it will be very clear once it reaches aeration mode
This post is a joke guys.. Can‚Äôt you see? üòÇ
Because it‚Äôs an ecotec. Hate those engines or at least the 1.4L
It's a noisy fuel pump forcing fuel through very small orifices of the fuel injectors... also sounds like you have a valve overlap issue. Replace the VVT solenoids and look for a fuel pump advertised as quiet. VVTs can be off-hand and inexpensive plus... anyone who can turn a wrench can replace them.
Watch a video about it
Engine mount has failed
My piece of shit focus did that.  Changed the motor mount, tranny mount and wishbone at the bottom and it was like a new car.
Check oil level first. After that I would check for an exhaust leak and perform a compression test. That will tell you if you have anything to work with. Just by what you are providing it sounds grim.
Might be a motor mount
Is it American? If so that‚Äôs your problem, build quality
That'd be an engine misfire. When it's a damaging misfire the check engine light will flash. Have it scanned, see what cylinder is misfiring then replace that ignition coil or pack and change the sparkplug if it's needed.
I would assume engine mount
Spontaneous crankcase ventilation.
Or at least through the oil pan
This right here.

A car is a huge investment, the largest one the average person will make after a home. Take care of it and it will take care of you. Neglect it and it will cost you.
Probably more like $60 for a full proper change but yeah‚Ä¶

A top off of 5w-30 conventional coulda been $15‚Ä¶
Pour some tussin on it
OP probably should have used his tattoo and OnlyFans money on some vehicle maintenance.
Even topping it off with more oil for a couple bucks would have prevented this, even without a $50 oil change. They ran it with no oil
Pining for the ~~Fords~~ fjords, you say?
Sounds like my V6 right before the piston blew through the block.
This is an *ex*-engine! It is no more!
You are taking about the nonsensical raving of a lunatic mind. Dead is dead!
Spun bearing? Ain't no bearing left!
If I ever get a car, it will be electric. Fuck this ICE crap that self-distructs for random reasons. At least battery degrades slowly and engine doesn't die overnight or, even if the electric motor dies, it's not as expensive as the entire car. 
They could have easily added safety checks, low oil, engine stops immediately. How hard is it? The immobilizer does the same when starting car, if key not recognized.
But of course, they let your car get ruined and are glad to sell you another.
TBF, the Ecotec is notoriously bad but its even worse when you don't maintain it properly. I tell people all the time with the Ecotec how important it is to check the oil often in those because they consume oil.
The engine on my 2010 Malibu at 130k seems like the only thing holding it together right now. But I change my oil regularly
For real; this engine‚Äôs got some chutzpah- she‚Äôs a fighter!

I mean, Jesus, 40,000 miles without with an oil change?! I‚Äôm seriously impressed that she‚Äôs even still chugging. 

Give that baby a medal and a military funeral, cause she‚Äôs served honorably.
I see we have similar feeds.... You and I
Op just didn‚Äôt say anything anymore so yeah probably 40k on that oil
200,000/ 2012 Chevy Malibu LT, with a v6 engine I believe
I found this channel lastnight through rainman ray and then spent 4 hours mesmerized watching him take apart failed engines

strong compulsion to change my oil today. hasn't even been 1k miles.
And for good!
Appreciate you actually answering ops question instead of making another lame joke
I‚Äôm replacing the ecotec in my son‚Äôs encore and it‚Äôs $4000 for the engine and $3000 to install. Was lucky to find someone to do it because first 3 mechanics said no way and another wanted $13k
Thank you for actually answering the question as to what's wrong. 

OP said it is a Malibu. So idk if that's an eco motor or not.
I had the same experience lol, good thing I searched before making a redundant comment!
Because it's dying.¬†
I take that back, heard it with volume. Holy moly lol
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You do realize that you don‚Äôt HAVE to reply to threads when you‚Äôre just talking out your ass, right?
Lol
Another logical scenario is to the center of the earth, you are correct on that statement.
A car isn't an "investment", it's a liability.
A car is a utility with regular upkeep that depreciates over time*
While your point is good, cars are not investments and too many people already seem to be under the misconception that they are. They're a tool, one you need to take care of, but absolutely not an investment.
their profile history is pretty entertaining for sure
An ex- parrot. He‚Äôs joined the choir eternal.
I'm in no way an expert but as both an owner of an ecotec with 270k miles on it and a totally rebuilt 2.5L Perkins D913, this sounds ominously like the latter before the rebuild. That's a scary thought.
It‚Äôs gone to sing with the choir angelic
It is an ex ~~parrot~~ motor
what v6? somethings telling me vq
OP: Well i'd better replace it then
It didn‚Äôt self destruct for random reasons. 

Engines aren‚Äôt ruined overnight. OP said the oil change was neglected for a year (and more importantly, 30-40k miles). 

The EV equivalent of replacing a bad engine isn‚Äôt replacing a bad motor. It‚Äôs replacing a bad battery.
Owner neglect is NOT a random reason. It's a complex machine, you have to take care of it, change the fluids, etc. There is more involved than just hop in and drive. I'm sorry a father or grandfather never taught you this.
Hoooo boy if you think electric cars don‚Äôt have a different set of extremely expensive problems, then I would recommend you stick to a bicycle. 

Watch how fast your car gets totalled if any damage happens to the battery.
This is one of the worst takes I've read in a long time. You should sit down with yourself and think about what has taken place here today

Most modern cars have literally everything you mentioned here and OP ignored each and every one of them. If you think electric vehicles are immune to gross negligence causing expensive repairs, you're very much mistaken.
"I insist that my next car immobilize itself when the oil is low ". 

Don't worry sweetie, it will...
lol yeah, there are absolutely zero expensive repairs or issues with an electric.
lol electrical issues kill tons of cars, good luck
lol electric vehicles have plenty of problems too. Driving through a puddle can brick it, you can find yourself stranded if the charging station you counted on is out of service. 

And there are warning lights‚Ä¶ most ICE cars have oil change reminders, they all (should) have low oil pressure lights, and many have low oil level lights. You don‚Äôt want to immediately shut down the engine if one comes on though, because what if it‚Äôs a failed sensor or broken wire and the oil is fine? What if you‚Äôre driving your sick mother to the hospital and just need to go another mile?

The issue here is ignoring the warning signs until they can no longer be ignored. It‚Äôs not a problem with ICE verses EV.
If your car was low on oil, and decided to stop in the middle of nowhere (or worse, while moving on the highway) it‚Äôd leave you stranded at best. Seriously injure or kill you at worst. Pretty much all modern cars have alarms and warnings, as well as a detailed maintenance schedule for you to follow. You can even get a service package with a new car that covers all maintenance for the first 100k miles for free. 

If someone decides to ignore those warnings, or ignore maintenance in general, they‚Äôre going to break things - and that‚Äôs not the manufacturers fault. I like older cars, so every car I‚Äôve ever had has been used, and I‚Äôve had to figure out what they need with my mechanic - but with a little time and care, I‚Äôve gotten many hundreds of thousands of miles out of cars with pretty basic maintenance. All told, I‚Äôve put around $15k total into all of my cars combined over the last 10 years, including all maintenance and repairs, but not including gas. 

Electric cars are definitely simpler, but they‚Äôre not free of problems. Less to go wrong, and batteries degrade slowly, but once it goes bad the car is basically totaled, and there‚Äôs very little you can fix yourself if something breaks. I‚Äôll get one someday but for now, ICE cars are cheap, reliable, and get the job done.
I love telling EV customers it‚Äôs gonna be 3-4 weeks before we fix their minor problem. It wipes the smug EV smile right off their face and they realize they made a terrible decision buying one. Also it didn‚Äôt self destruct for random reasons. The operator chose to destroy it by not changing the oil.
Ok sounds good.
Tell me you know nothing about cars without telling me you know nothing about cars. Lol
Most engines (especially Honda Toyota) last well beyond 200k with regular oil changes, and scheduled maintainence that comes out to about $300 every 3 years (belts sparkplugs engine air filter) everything else you gotta replace on both like brakes tires wheel bearings
Id imagine drive motors for cars are 3-5k. Which is similar to an engine or trans. I work on forklifts and theres plenty of failures that happen to the electric ones.  Alot of software issues can cause driveability issues or prevent startup of unit. Youre going to experience similar issues no matter what. But if you just drive local it may be a better choice than a ice setup. 

But you cant compare it to this failure. Like, OP just had to pull the dipstick and add once and a while. Not every manufacturer will have a vehicle no start or limp for a oil pressure switch.
oh yeah let's just shut peoples engines off while they are driving on the highway, that's safe. 

most modern cars have low oil warning light but it's on you as an owner to check and maintain a vehicle.

if your roof collapses after you let it leak for 30 years is it the roofs fault or your fault?
Just wait til he figures out that batteries self destruct randomly and catch fire and can't be put out
$1-5k for a motor that could‚Äôve been prevented or $15-20k for a new battery pack in 10 years that is inevitable. Which one sounds like a better decision?
Look at the cost of a battery replacement on a model3.. 20k is a lot for a 30k car
Those Malibu are AWESOME. If you trade up to a 2016 or later, those come with the same engine in them as the Cadillac ATS. You can even get them with the 4 cylinder turbo, which, as long as you baby the gas pedal, can pull in close to 40mpg. The new line of GM Ecotec engines are really good with regular oil changes. I love the engine in my 4 banger Camaro, I'm at 80k miles with ZERO issues and it runs like new still and the previous owner was pretty bad about maintenance from what I could tell, so they take more of a beating than people let on. I hope your 2010 Malibu keeps kicking ass past 200k miles.
That‚Äôs how I feel with our 2011 dodge avenger. Fucker got tboned and totaled out in 2022 but we are poor and kept it and put two new doors on it from a junkyard. Car looks ghetto as fuck but runs and drives no issues at 160k miles. I‚Äôd take it across the country *once we change the ball joints*

It was dumb to get rid of a car we have done all the maintenance on since 2017/30k miles, and used car prices are stupid. Doors were $100 total.
Holy fuck you were right!!!
literally called it lol
I watched a van run like butter after a 40k mile oil change. It was belching blue smoke beforehand and chugging like it wanted to commit suicide. Fresh oil makes one hell of a difference.

Customer got lectured just like OP.
How many miles do you have on the current oil change?
Is that not the 4 cylinder? It looks small in there
It literally says ‚ÄúEcotec‚Äù on the engine cover
for real bruh, this subreddit ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Financially, sure. But more broadly speaking it is still something you invest in. Especially if it allows you to get to work and make money. It‚Äôs just indirectly an investment if it facilitates other sources of money
It is an investment when you need it to commute to work and couldn‚Äôt without it
I'm not sure about that. I got my 2008 Toyota Yaris brand new for $16,500CAD in 2010 and it's been basic maintenance only until 2022 when I did the clutch and brake rotors, and now it's back to just basic maintenance. Doesn't burn or leak oil, or coolant. Haven't even had to replace the water pump yet. (170,000 miles). Original suspension showing no signs of wearing down.

Yea, eventually it will lose out to the rust battle as all cars eventually do (very little rust right now, touch ups done every year), but it costs me so little to drive I absolutely consider it an investment. It would be more expensive for me to pay for a bus pass, bus ticket, or cab for the same cost per use I get out of it on the regular even including insurance costs.

Math shows that I could put $2000 per year into my Yaris and keep it on the road another 15-20 years and still be waaaaay cheaper than buying a new car at these outrageous prices.

Now, I do take meticulous care of my cars and do my own maitnence, oil changes, intake manifold gaskets, knock sensors, brakes, and whatever else I have the tools for so that saves me a lot.

If I could still get a brand new 2008 model Toyota Yaris, I  absolutely would. Thing's been a frugal nerds wet dream.
It‚Äôs a depreciating asset.
Id say its both
A car is an investment the same way higher education is an investment, it gives you access to opportunities you would otherwise miss.  You invest in yourself and your abilities, in this case the ability to travel freely and not be dependent upon cabs or public transit.
They don't mean investment as in 'Thing that will appreciate in value' they mean investment as in 'Thing that you put money into in general'. And a car is the second most expensive of those behind a house.
Economic Boot Theory applies to Cars

A good one you take care of can last you years; but shitty one that you constantly have to fix is gonna suck up funds

Not good money wise and you don't want your car to break down in the middle of the high way

It's not a financially sound in the sense you'll make money; but financially sound that you will reliably only have to spend a certain amount at certain times
>They're a tool

Private transportation is 100% an investment.  Take two electricians, one who buys a work truck and one who takes the bus, which one is doing more jobs and earning more money? 


An investment doesn't have to be an asset that you intend on reselling later, it can also be money put into a process or consumable that helps you achieve goals that you otherwise could not.


Even an education, degree, or certification is an investment because it's time and money that you commit in order to unlock higher potential earnings.
Anything that can make you more money than the cost of said thing is an investment. If OP needs a car to get to work then it is definitely considered an investment.
If a car is your means of making money (getting you to work, towing shit, deliveries etc) it absolutely is an investment.
Cars aren‚Äôt investments they are purchases, a car is a durable good that provides a service. People who call them good or bad investments are financially challenged. The are the same people who think public transit and the post office should be making a profit.
If it gets you to a job that pays you more that you couldn‚Äôt otherwise get to that‚Äôs an investment
Not all investments make money
Right. Cars are liabilities.
Under capitalism we convinced people literally everything is an investment it's stupid as fuck
Indeed it is.

As far as similar cost goes you mean?
Year long OCIs are the standard now. Waiting a year on good synthetic is totally fine as long as you have <12k on it
Year long OCIs are the standard now. Waiting a year on good synthetic is totally fine as long as you have <12k on it
How often does an EV have bad battery? Once in 8 years maybe?
How often can an ICE car can have low oil? Multiple failure types, so it can fail even when new, if owner doesn't check the oil level. You see the difference?
Why does it allow starting next day and keep driving with low oil? It has oil pressure sensor. No excuse, it should have stopped running to protect engine.
Actually, and unfortunately, many people drive this way with no thought of maintenance.  But for these people there is always a warning light or message that should prevent catastrophic damage IF HEEDED.  But there are always people who just keep going and then just scratch their head in the aftermath.
Do you know what a selfcheck is? Car knows it has oil problems, why does it allow you to drive it next day, with low oil? You don't see the issue here?
They decided that it's ok to just glow a light and let the owner worry, rather than prevent car from starting at all.
It should just show message, "engine oil failure. Car cannot start" and stop.
> then I would recommend you stick to a bicycle.

"fuck this chain driven crap that self destructs for no reason! I only put 4,000 miles on this bicycle and the wheels are all bent up from riding around on dry-rotted flats, my sprockets have no teeth left, my chain has rusted into a circle and after the seat rotted off from being left in my pool for a couple weeks the rusty jagged seatpost perforated my colon!"
Dude, do you not know about bicycles??? Fuckin tubes blow, tread wears out, they have brake pads! So much trouble!! My guy needs to try walking, absolute game changer
Aren‚Äôt car washes bricking some EVs too?
Why does it start another time if it has critical failure? Why doesn't it beep all the time when damaged, like it does for seat belts? You should not be able to continue driving except until you come to a safe stop. Failed sensor, failed wire, doesn't matter, you should get it checked by service.
It shouldn't cause a 4000$ issue because someone thought everyone know what those warning lights are. People ignore them, don't even know what they mean. People drive carelessly. A train would also stop if it had engine problem, this is not an argument, we have sick people on train, let's ignore the engine fire and keep it running.

The car manufacturers include all kinds of gimmicks, compressors, pumps, alternators, sensors, high pressure lines, cooling pipes, exhaust systems, abs, airbags, radars and cameras, all crammed in a tight space and you need proprietary tools to work on engines. They are designed to fail and you are the sucker paying for it all. They make a very good living off your back, there's an entire industry specialized in it. You think doing regular maintenance and fluid chages is the norm. It should run like a laser printer. How many times you service a laser printer in 10 years? None, change toner and keep running it. This is how reliable it should be.
Ask then to simplify the design. Not all pumps need to be driven by motor, they can be electric. Pumps shouldn't have brushes, even fuckin power drills are brushless. Make it last 20 years for fuck's sake.
When a hose fails that liquid spills on the motor, wires, causing potential issues. How many years does a hose last when it's subject to vibrations, high temps, pressures? Less than 20 years? Bad, find better design. That should be the mindset. Not that hosed are consumables, change every x km.

I woukd rather have an electric car, know that range is 70% as when it was new, or a module of battery failed, needs to be replaced and decide whether buy new car or repair, than having random crap pop up every 3 months.
What common issues do you run into like this? I don't play on the EV side or the industry
Why kinds of problems are those usually? I don't drive an EV or hybrid.
After stopping, the car should no longer start, just give warning and message of problem, then stop. Just like the immobilizer does. Is it a hard concept to grasp? It's a severe condition, engine failure imminent, what is wrong with you people? All functionality is there to implement it, they even have capability to cut fuel (immobilizer does this) they just didn't bother implementing the safety feature.
Look up what a "core-charge" is. You can also easily find perfectly fine pre-owned units out of wrecked cars for $5-7k, again, before you even recycle your dead battery, which still has tons of value. Look up how much a full motor replacement on any comparable ICE car built in the last 10 years and tell me how much cheaper it'll be than $5k
I am actually looking to get a small truck with 4wd or AWD due to my lifestyle. My poor Malibu has some broken pieces of plastic and scratches around the bumper trying to get to campsites on trails it had no business being on. I will say of all the chevys I have had the most durable one was for sure my 08 impala. Have had some coolant system related issues with my malibu in the past
I‚Äôm sorry are you asking how many miles have I traveled on my most recent oil change? If so I want to say roughly around 30-40k miles
[removed]
ü§¶ I'm dumb
It‚Äôs the ultimate tool for humans to save on their most precious resource‚Ä¶ time. Maybe dramatic lol but it‚Äôs insane how drastically different schedules/free time becomes without a car.
Bingo.
Right, like college is an investment.
it‚Äôs kinda wild how this is getting missed haha. The insane amount of TIME (ultimate resource) owning a car saves is nuts. You invest in this tool because it makes basic survival like 1,000,000x easier. It‚Äôs definitely a shit investment if you don‚Äôt give it like the 3 things outside of gas that it needs lol.
Yeah it seems like the commenters here have spent too much time on WSB... or are unaware that in the English language, words' meanings can vary based on context.
If they're comparing it to a house purchase, which is an investment that will generally appreciate in value, I assume that's exactly what they mean. You could call it an "investment" into your quality of life, but putting it in the same discussion as an investment like a home makes no sense.
r/discworld
Given that I was replying to somebody comparing a car purchase to a house purchase, I was under the impression this was about a financial investment. Those are two very different things, a house purchase is in no way equivalent to a car purchase. A car will almost always be worth less than you paid unless it's a very exotic vehicle and even then no examples come to mind. I'm sure they exist but they do not come to mind, meanwhile I know more people who've invested in housing and profited than I can count on both of my hands. I guess I see your point on a vehicle being a potential investment into your business, but I don't think that's really important when you're trying to compare it to investing in a home.
An investment into his quality of life I suppose, but when compared to a house by the person I'm replying to I feel that implies financial gain within the asset being purchased. A house and a car just aren't comparable within that subject in my opinion and so it makes it sound like a car is some kind of financial investment which is terrible advice in my opinion.
Yeah. Homie‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt that he‚Äôs poor. He‚Äôs just tryna play life on easy mode without the cheat codes. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not a legit strat
Oof.
Fucking hell op deserves this. Hope he has to ride a stolen bike.
wow... this is sad. always hurts me to see people actively refusing to put in the work to be a good father to their children. especially if it's because they're too lazy to care
It absolutely isn't. Manufacturers may *say* 10 or 12k miles per oil change, but they're also planning on selling you another car sooner than you're planning to buy one.
30-40k mile OCIs are not
Every vehicle I have owned has a warning light for anything that will cause critical failures. Majority of the time you are warned well before an issue happens. ICE and ELECTRIC vehicles both have recommended maintenance intervals. Ignoring those intervals is why a major of vehicles have catastrophic failures.
Life doesn't hold your hand on everything. I see what you're saying, but sometimes you gotta put in work.
Wait eletric cars need a new battery every 8 years??? That cant be. If so, they seem like an awful investment. I have driven old volvos and i havent needed a new engine or had any problems with it, ever. Just regular maintenance. First one had a 33 year old engine at the time i bought it, second was 23 year old and my current one is 13 year old. Zero problems. Nada. Just take care of your engine.
This person ignored the warning light, obviously. Have you generally had really bad luck with cars or something? Not meant to be an insult at all. If so, I've been there hehe. Drove beaters for so long, problem after problem. Finally bought a new car (2019 Mazda cx5) and I'm loving it. No more trips to the mechanic every other month for random shit thank god
My vehicle is 24 years old now and would have gone through 3 EV batteries in that timeframe and with my mileage. Original drive train aside from wear parts. All the maintenance that myself and the previous owner have put in, as well as the original cost of the vehicle, is likely less expensive than two of those new batteries, heck maybe even one, let alone the starting cost of a new EV. Sure, gasoline engines aren't perfect, but if you understand it's a mechanical tool requiring maintenance and not just something that always runs because there's gas in it, they treat you well (there are always exceptions).

If you don't want to look at a dipstick, buy an EV; some people, like myself, enjoy maintaining an ICE vehicle. Everyone is different, and vehicles cater to the lifestyle of the owner.

I like EVs btw, not bashing on them at all. Just wish they were cheaper lol
My '92 Lude and '02 Monte Carlo SS run and drive perfectly. Why would such old cars be in great condition you may wonder. Because I'm not lazy. Because I pay attention to them. Because I work on them and spend the money I need to, to keep them running. The OP didn't care about their car, which is probably newer than both of mine, and they killed it.
How about this ... $45000 for a Hyundai Ionq replacement battery???? A person's battery got damaged by a muffler on the road that popped up and hit the battery tray from underneath. It's a true story. Brand new car.  Electric cars could be less maintenance but just aren't yet.
You sure are a confident donut aren't you lmao
So you have absolutely zero concept of personal responsibility then. 

"I DIDN'T CHANGE MY OIL FOR TWO YEARS AND NOW MY CAR DIED. THAT FUCKING DEALERSHIP BETTER PAY FOR A NEW ONE FOR NOT FORCING ME TO DO MAINTENANCE!" Grow the fuck up, it shouldn't be on manufacturers to make sure you maintain your vehicle.
because calling in a tow truck just to replace your oil isnt very easy
More sensors, more computers. More complexity. Adds even more cost to a product that is already too expensive. 

I can get a tire gauge from Auto Zone for $3 and check my tire pressure weekly while filling up with gas. I've got literally nothing better to do while the pump runs. But no, Nanny Sam decided my car needs tire pressure sensors in each wheel to tell me when a tire is low. How much do they cost? About $200 for a set, plus installation. 

This is why the average new car now costs $50,000. Sensors, cameras, computers, fracking RADAR in the bumper. Adding layer upon layer of crap we don't really need because some folks are too stupid or too lazy to perform basic tasks. The resultant dumbing down of the human race.

Seen the movie "Idiocracy?" It's billed as a comedy but is really top notch social commentary. We're almost there.
I was gonna write a long explanation about how you are wrong, but I agree with you. These cars can absolutely deliver messages to the driver. They are built to purposely make a person go to a mechanic for the diagnosis. 

People shouldn't have to hook an external device to a car for an explanation of or an error code.

This is a really easily solved problem by just doing the maintenance. Also, I haven't had a printer last 10 years without maintenance, no drill of any kind is gonna last 20 years if you're actually using the damn thing.

You're really set on "It's all fucked up and I'm mad because YOU didn't stop me from fucking it up!"
It's kind of amazing how you can write so much and say so little.

Have fun in your EV, don't get stuck in the middle of nowhere because your super ultra safe maintenance free car decided something is wrong and now it wont drive - or god forbid you blow a tire. 

Enjoy that multi-thousand dollar 8 year battery replacement interval, hope you don't go cheap and end up replacing cells every few months. That adds up quick.

Meanwhile my 2006 2.5l VW w/ 221k miles is still going strong with no engine or transmission issues - because I take care of it and I'm not some helpless dweeb. It even got hit by a big deer in Utah! I didn't need to get it towed, just drove home and fixed it myself.

Can your EV drive away from an accident? Or does your babysitting computer tell you it's got a booboo and now it can't dwive?

üôÑ
Are you under the impression that electronic parts don't glitch/fail/short? That wires don't corrode and fail apart? That electric cars aren't absolutely loaded to the fucking tits with sensors? And that when those sensors fail they don't always tell the computer the correct thing? 

I make almost $200,000/year as heavy duty mechanic and over 80% of the work I do is on electronics. They fail more than anything else and can sometimes take days to properly diagnose without just throwing thousands of dollars of parts at them. Vehicles with the most electronics are easily the least reliable and most expensive to maintain/repair. There's a reason people still like the old school pumps,ICE, geared transmissions and greased bearings. I've seen pumps last over 40,000 hours without failing as opposed to electric controlled valves that rarely make it past 1500 hours.

You don't own a car, have zero experience with this stuff and should take a step back and learn before you talk. People here are giving real thought out answers.
To be fair this engine came out in 2007. I'm not sure what type of EV anyone would have been able to buy in 2007 that would still be running today... ICE used to be the only option it wasn't until recently that EVs are a thing
A printer is not comparable to a literal 1-2 ton mass of metal that has to move at incredible speed for hundreds of thousands of miles with near zero failure rate. All vehicles are insanely complex systems, EV or not. Engineers work extremely hard to make sure these systems are repairable and reliable to a point, you're required to do maybe 1% of the work they did over the lifetime of the vehicle to keep it running.
You are making me nervous, I‚Äôm driving a 45 year-old car right now.
This is not a common issue, if you're referring to the OP. But on EVs, batteries are extremely temperature sensitive, think about it like a giant version of your phone battery and look at how much your battery health has dropped in the likely short time you've owned it. Discharge it or charge it incorrectly a few hundred times and its toast. Things like that, not to mention the massively complex cooling systems, regenerative braking, etc. Its just as complex if not worse than a ICE vehicle, they're just newer and we haven't seen how they behave at 15-20+ years old.
Literally anything on an EV takes days if not weeks to fix. On the Mach-E‚Äôs we see a bunch of IPMA modules
Im using what it would cost for Tesla to fix this issue. It‚Äôs estimated at 13-28k for battery, labor, and misc parts. Sure you can find a wrecked one, but you can‚Äôt guarantee the condition of the battery.
R.i.p
Please tell me you meant to say 3000-4000miles, not 30,000-40,000 miles. If you actually meant 30-40k miles you are in the wrong subreddit. Your question needs to go to r/askashittymechanic
Really saved yourself some money on that $60 oil change huh lol
30,000 - 40,000 miles! Wtf!?
30-40k miles...... oil is cheap esp. when DIY. Engine is expensive Rip.
Dude that‚Äôs wayyyyyyy too long for an oil change. You may be out of luck with this one‚Ä¶
Your engine is toast
Yeah it's done, if you didn't get an oil change because of financial troubles then you will be in major financial trouble now abusing your only transportation to this point. A 30$ oil change every 5-10k would have saved it
Rip. The oil likely turned into jello consistency at that point (literally).
Holy hell, unlike Jesus this one ain't coming back 

When I discuss EVs with people, the ones most likely to say they'd "NEVER buy one" are the very people that should really consider buying one.
Oh my fuck it's a miracle it made it this far.
![gif](giphy|YRhGAu0NZ6euNRuHb6)
you have got to be kidding bro? That thing is blowed up.
I mean...what did you think was going to happen lol? cars don't run on magic. You just destroyed your engine to save a few bucks on an oil change. That's absolutely bonkers.
Holy hell, you realize your supposed to change your oil every 5-6k right. Your engine is literally telling you to shoot it right now because of this.

Probably nothing you can do that wont cost you thousands at this point......
F
What. This has to be a joke? I've heard of people going 50, 60k on one oil change but I'd never think to see anyone do it...
Well, time to turn that car into metal scraps I guess.
Oh boy...
I'm not being judgemental. But why have you gone so far without changing the oil?
Holy... It's gone. I've never said this to anyone, but next time, buy an electric car, I don't think you should own a car with an ICE.
that's one way to destroy a motor
Holy fuck dude
You neglected the minor maintenance so long that it grew up and realised its full potential as Major Maintenance. 

I hate to tell you this but you are solely responsible for a grenaded engine my friend. I too am poorer than fuck, but much like food is not an optional expense when you‚Äôre a human, maintenance is not an optional expense when you have a car. You HAVE to fit it into your budget the same way you HAVE to fit in food and water, if you want to keep a working vehicle.

There‚Äôs no option. What you‚Äôve got there is a pet you‚Äôve bought but not fed for a year. Obviously it‚Äôs dead. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had to learn the hard way, I really am, but this was preventable. Even when I was homeless and lived out of my car, I‚Äôd sacrifice eating sometimes to make sure I did semi regular maintenance on the car, because if it died, I would be in an even worse situation.
Jesus fuck man¬†
That engine is done
Basic math: an oil change costs $40 if you do it yourself.

You went the duration of ten oil changes. That's $400 in oil and filters.

The 3.6VVT is an expensive engine. Roughly fifteen times more expensive than all that oil that would have been.

So every time you skipped an oil change interval, it cost you an extra $600.

That's $600 you drained from your wallet every single month over the past year.

You don't just let your kids starve to death because you don't have the money to feed them, so why would you do that to your car? Especially if your work depends on it?
Your car is fucked
Ok. Normal oil changes are good for 5k-10k miles depending on a lot of factors.  Going this far over causes sludge build up and lack of lubrication. It could be a bad valve terrain or the engine spun a main or rod bearing. Overall, the situation is not an easy fix and I recommend having someone look at it.
Holy shit!
dear god
Jesus Christ
In the future, if you're genuinely stuck for a long time, you CAN extend between oil changes if you use the best oil and filters.

25k miles max in one year, mostly highway/longer range driving. AMSOIL Signature Series with AMSOIL EAO filters. Pennzoil Platinum oil is good also, and FRAM Ultra filters. 

30-40k is nuts; your engine does sound like it's toast. Too long between changes and that knock is *bad*. You're looking at a bill in the thousands even from a very cheap mechanic for a replacement used engine, or a rebuild.
That's what I figured, but it's been almost a decade since I worked in a Chevy dealership, seen a lot of engines since then lol
2.4L LE5, there was no 2.5L 4-cylinder for seventh gen Malibus
Nah, it‚Äôs all good. This post is kind of all over the place
Or without proper public transportation üëÅÔ∏èüëÖüëÅÔ∏è
Yeah I‚Äôll go ahead and trust the rando on the internet and not the 245k miles i have on 10k OCIs with black stone reports to back it up üôÑ
The batteries are usually warrantied for 8 years or a certain amount of miles. That doesn't mean it's no longer good after that. There are quite a few going at 200k+ miles with 75%+ battery capacity remaining. 

How much life you get out of the battery depends on how well it was made, what chemistry it is, and how you treat it. Kind of like how long an ICE car lasts depends on how well it was made, how you maintain it, and how you drive it.
It's probably closer to 10-15 years (half guessing here)  but yeah batteries slowly lose their max charge. Think of your phone battery not lasting as long after a few years but on a longer scale. At some point you decide when the battery capacity is annoying enough to get a new one.
It's not a true story. What you're quoting is click-bait from a listing mistake that a dealership inadvertently passed on to a customer. The part was meant to be listed at $6,000 CAD but was inadvertently listed as $60,000 CAD. [Here](https://www.wholesalehyundaiparts.com/p/hyundai__/BATTERY-SYSTEM-ASSEMBLY/17238066/37501GI351RM.html) it is corrected.

Why would a $60k CAD car required a $60k CAD battery replacement? I swear to god, common sense is dead.

You have the right to buy an older car that doesn‚Äôt have all that stuff.  But yes, it makes buying a new car expensive.
Barefoot is a thing, your feet will grow calous to compensate. But op will probably stand in a marsh until they're nice and fucked up.
Click bait. None of them void the warranty. It says it won't cover "physical damage"under warranty like broken wipers and charge ports.
I actually own a car. You even admit making very good money on newer cars (loaded with electronics) which proves my point. You admit electric valves last only 1500 hours, on what, newer ICE cars. I know I'm on this mechanics thread and you are all biased, but it's embarrasing really, how you admit bad car design and still argue ICE cars are better.
Electronics can also fail, yes, but not as fast as the damn rubber gaskets, seals, hoses under pressure and temp variations. Also electronics glitches can be detected with computers and modules replaced. Wires can corrode, but same happens in every car. 
Electric cars have fewer components and less pipes with various fluids (some under pressure), like oil and gasoline/diesel. 
Anyway, time will tell which is the better design, electric cars are just getting started.
And the battery tech hasn't come into picture fully either. These evtards are just the initial wave of adopters. In 10 years when ge is making that battery that runs on rust and electrolysis, coupled with that hydrogen engine they have. Exhaust is steam. And those iron or sodium oxide batteries will render lithium ion obsolete. Well get twice the range and four times the lifespan, while they're still paying off those tesla. You guys don't look at those gigantic ass Li bricks and think, yeah, that's as good as they're gonna get? Fuck that lol let it simmer for a decade.
I genuinely have no knowledge of EVs. I do machine work and work on diesels, like the furthest things from EV. I don't have much of a grasp on any part of that industry.
> Im using what it would cost for Tesla to fix this issue.

And, of course, ignoring the core-charge, which would recoup thousands of dollars. 

Seriously, compare the dealership replacement cost on a new engine for any comparable modern vehicle. You'll find the EV isn't *that* much more.
I second this motion.
30,000 miles on a fully synthetic oil change on an older car isn't unheard of. I remember when Fully Synthetic Oil came out, they were talking about how it would last "forever" but still ***recommending*** 15,000 mile oil changes.

But of course you need to check your oil levels. Running with ***no oil at all*** for any amount of time is a good way to just destroy your engine.
30 for full synthetic at Walmart¬†
Hell if the dude had even just been topping his oil off this whole time the engine might still be with us, dying much faster than it would with a proper oil change (never changing out the dirty shit + filter likely causing whatever problems led it to eat/lose the oil and get this knock) but still alive. As bad as it is to not change the oil dude probably coulda saved his car by keeping a $2 funnel and a $20 jug of oil from Walmart in the trunk
To be fair it was on 6-8 oil changes üòÇ
Even the Amsoil guys are like, "Brother, that's way too long."
Shit even if he just swapped the oil and left the same filter.  Im shocked it made it this far.
Given the mileage, I would probably do it at shorter intervals than that. Like every 6 months. At minimum change the filter and top it up.
[deleted]
don't encourage people like this to change oil at 25k intervals, lol.

  
he didn't have enough money for an oil change, he isn't spending thousands on a new motor. If he owes money I'm this, which he probably does, he is going to have to declare bankruptcy and start riding a bike. 

  
I guess they don't teach kids this stuff in school...

Can we not shoehorn politics into everything? There are plenty of other places where you can argue about them without having to make an issue like this about it.
This. Warranties are there for legal reasons. They don‚Äôt care at all if you take your car through a car wash, but if the vehicle is damaged because of a car wash gone haywire, they won‚Äôt be doing a warranty repair because it wasn‚Äôt the fault of the vehicle.
This thread is rife with click-bait and oil industry propaganda people are just chewing up and swallowing like crazy.
Your very first comment on this thread you said you don't own a car, and that when you eventually do, it will be electric. 

>Electronics can also fail, yes, but not as fast as the damn rubber gaskets, seals, hoses under pressure and temp variations

You have no idea what you're talking about. I see hoses/gaskets/seals last 10s of thousands of hours with no failure, time and time again with very little maintenance. Ya sometimes parts break prematurely but a 50$ hose is far better than a $4000 proprietary module that can only be fixed by the manufacturer. You only hear about this stuff because ICE vehicles are the norm and abundant.

For example, I bought my wife a 2024 RAV4 gas. The most common problem of these vehicles (whether gas/hybrid/PHEV/electric) is the main infotainment/Computer glitching. It can glitch out and render the car useless just by parking in the sun for too long. You know what that part costs, no matter what the error is? $8,000. Older cars that aren't loaded with radar/lidar/tpms/trac control/blind spot sensors don't have these kinds of issues.


>Also electronics glitches can be detected with computers and modules replaced

Completely untrue. If that was full proof then I wouldn't make so much money. Computers constantly fail/misdiagnose themselves/can't see the problem.

You're arguing with a 10 year mechanic. I've seen it all dude. I have no reason to be biased, if I had it my way I would tell everyone to go electronic and id be filthy rich, having people waiting in line to throw money at me until their stuff is fixed. 

As of right now, electric vehicles are not the "cheaper/more reliable/less maintenance over time type of vehicle in any way. Sure in the future that might change, electric will get better but it's not that great right now.
Yeah Toyota is making the right decision imo. Hybrids just make the most sense given our infrastructure and current tech. Small Li batteries and a ICE engine to maximize range. Hell, make plug in hybrids. I totally agree, I think we'll look back at Li batteries like we do now to NiCads.

I think its even reflected in used EV prices. They can't even give them away with how fast the tech moves, and a replacement battery can total the car.
They may have advertised 15k oil changes, but I sure wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. 30-40k miles is a sure way to kill a motor though no matter what quality of oil you put in there.
Just because the oil lasts forever doesn't mean the filter does üòâ
I just did my third oil change on my '23 HRV at 41K. Doubtful this is a late model vehicle.
What state? It‚Äôs $50 here in indiana
And you're telling me I just spent 70 on it yesterday
[removed]
U can get the cheapest oil and filter at Walmart and it's going to be cheaper than replacing that motor or car.
Most expensive oil change, is the oil changes you don't do
Now you're gonna be broke and have no car
There is a 2.5L for *8th gen* Malibus (2013-2015 model years), but not for 7th gen Malibus (2008-2012). 

OP said this is a **2012** Malibu, so it‚Äôs a 2.4L LE5, or LE9 if it‚Äôs a flex fuel car.
That's why teenagers should have cheap shitty cars. I fucked up my 2005 equinox because I drove it hard and didn't take care of it. When it fucked up, I thought I had shitty luck with cars. We all learn how to take care of cars eventually.

And the rest of us make mechanics rich.
Have you seen undecided ? Already have lithium iron phosphate batteries that don't degrade in capacity for 5 years. 30 percent more energy storage. Yeah pr whatever, still, renders the shit on the road already obsolete.
Yeah, id personally only do 10k max, if I was struggling for money bad. But I do 5k religiously, with OEM filter and Pennzoil. Cheeper to spend $120 a year, then 3-6 grand every two or three.
It's the cost of oil, a filter, a beer and 30 minutes in Alabama. But, really, the shops where I live usually charge about $30-$40.
No it's not?

Walmarts website shows Castrol 0w/20 full synthetic *high mileage* for $25 (on sale from $28) in stock at a Walmart in Bloomington. Which is apparently the highest COL city in Indiana. The most expensive one in stock is Valvoline, restore and protect and it's $30.
Florida
Bro it's 40 here in michigan. Tops. That's with a quality filter.
Texas
Where did you spend that much? 

Walmart is *by far* the cheapest place to buy oil. Usually go to O'Reilly's for car parts is there typically lower cost than other Auto stores. But even their 5qt oil is $10+ more than the same brands at Walmart.
Oh the oil in it would be absolutely fucked and killing the engine quickly, it died from lack of oil though and any oil at the right fill level is better than no oil. It‚Äôs a terrible idea to never change oil and will kill the engine but when the cause of failure was no oil then keeping it topped off would have prolonged this failure, we‚Äôd likely just be seeing a different failure really soon though 40k miles is at least 8 oil changes ago this engine was gonna be fucked either way even if it would still be running now
Oh shit and those axial flux motors, fucking genius, one of those per wheel and it's a fucking rocket. I can't wait to see the used car industry in 20 years. This one goes 0 to 60 in 0.4 seconds.....
All my cars get changed at 5k or one year, whichever comes first. Some get changed more frequently if they are used for short trips or towing. If the car was running pure highway driving I might stretch to 10k, but 15k+ is stupidity.
Canadian tire, bought a 5l jug of Castrol fully synthetic long life stuff
[removed]
oils expensive af here in ontario walmart is cheaper but I compared prices recently and it's like $5-10 cheaper than canadian tire for 5l
Oil is consumed by an engine partially because of blow-by, when some oil from the crankcase slips past the piston rings and in to the combustion chamber, or air/fuel mixture makes it past the piston rings and in to the crankcase. It‚Äôs the reason why engine oils have deacidifying chemical additives. Unburned fuel and water (a natural byproduct of combustion) can mix and form an acid that etches metal and wears away at gaskets. 

Depending on how good the manufacturing process was you can have an engine that loses very little oil between changes, or you can have a real oil burner. My ex-wife had a Toyota Yaris, and the owners manual claimed that oil consumption up to one quart per 400 miles was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Yikes. I wouldn‚Äôt expect an engine to burn anywhere near that much oil simply due to everyday use, but it‚Äôs still good to check your oil at every fill-up, and top off as necessary.
1939 Edition of ‚ÄúOut of Vermont Kitchens‚Äù: found in my grandma‚Äôs house
The 1944 printing. Complete with handwritten recipes, illustrations and some neat pictures of landmarks.
What a beautiful find -- the sketches are amazing! Do you think it's in good enough shape it could be carefully scanned? I bet your local Historical Society would love to get a digital copy.
take this on over to r/oldrecipes, they will love it! This is a very cool find, love the penmanship and the little emoji like graphics in the twisty rolls!
Oh the hand drawn ads! Love the Pico Peak one. I remember spending the night sleeping in the basement of that church with the Episcopal youth group and I had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and I walked in on the two chaperones having adult fun time.
As a sixth generation Vermonter, how is this the first time I‚Äôm hearing about pork cake?
God I love how they phrase instructions in old cook books.

‚ÄúYeah just cook all that stuff together don‚Äôt mess it up.‚Äù
Shrimp casserole‚Ä¶ classic Vermont cuisine.
Didn't you see that it was copyrighted in 1939? Now you've put that material all OVER the Internet. You wouldn't download a cake, would you? 

I'm sure the Internet police will be there soon.
Oooh! I think there is a copy of that at my parents house. I will have to look next time I go.
I teared up on page 269, my mom had the EXACT same hand writing!
I‚Äôm a Vermonter, this is awesome! Thanks for sharing.
this is such a gem! it's like finding a time capsule of flavor. the handwritten notes just add so much personality...
Wow will you believe me if I tell you my mom, who was from Johnson, had the same book!!
That‚Äôs awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
I will have to try pork cake. I bet bacon could be substitute.
What an awesome find!!!

You‚Äôre joking. I saw this at goodwill a while ago and didn‚Äôt get it and I‚Äôm kicking myselfüò≠

Beautiful find! Delicious dishes in there too.... üòã
My husband‚Äôs family lived in Burlington for generations! What a beautiful book
I have a very similar book from the 1950s - Fanny Allen in Colchester
We have this same book in our North Hero cabin! It‚Äôs such a neat piece of history!
I've got an old copy of ma's country cookbook
Rutland Vermont? I bet my grandparents could have had copies of this at some point. So weird seeing things like this cause every now and then you find stuff that‚Äôs near where you are and being so use to things on here being cross the globe. It‚Äôs an interesting feeling to have something so close.
It‚Äôs actually in fantastic condition! The cover is the only part that‚Äôs a little fragile. There‚Äôs some stains on a couple of the pages (I think I know what recipes my grandma liked the best) but for being 80 years old, it‚Äôs in good shape.
It‚Äôs still in print
There really is a subreddit for everything
What a special and timeless memory ü§£ü§£
I have also never heard of pork cake. I make a lot of different foods so I‚Äôll have to try this one. I know I‚Äôve seen salt pork at Price Chopper so it‚Äôll be one more experiment!
Me too! What is a citron. Like the fruit?
Consider yourself lucky?! ;)
The recipes didn‚Äôt scream Vermont to me.
My Grandmother‚Äôs Apple Pie recipe starts, in her beautiful writing on a pastel pink card with butterflies on a corner, ‚Äú1. Go to store and buy 2 frozen crusts (don‚Äôt bother making your own - too much time).‚Äù
Those Vermont fisherman worked tirelessly to bring in the shrimp catch from the sea ü•≤
The ghosts of the trinity mission and women‚Äôs service league will have my head for this.
I had the same exact reaction to page 197.  Looks exactly like my grandma‚Äôs handwriting ‚ù§Ô∏è
it's been through many editions and printings, I've seen several copies of it.
Salt pork and bacon are pretty interchangeable. Salt pork usually doesn‚Äôt have the smoky flavor that bacon has, but if you are using regular, store bought, bacon it should be nearly indistinguishable. (If you are using a locally smoked bacon, it will still work, just have a different flavor)
I think it actually might say 1 can of shrimp! The line above it says to add one can tomatoes, and Mrs. Dunaway's "n" appears identical to her "u"
I live for savory baking so I looked into this today. This was helpful: 
https://www.ohs.org/blog/pork-cake.cfm

What‚Äôs interesting is I think the recipe you have will make a better cake. Salt pork is perfect for this type of thing as it‚Äôs basically a slightly sweet pork belly. Not to mention, I think the instructions included in this recipe are really just about how to keep your batter wet/cake moist so if you combine with the above recipe, it should be a great cake. 

We‚Äôll see! Let me know if you track this. I‚Äôll DM you my final results if I try it out. I‚Äôm curious too!!
Yep, it‚Äôs a heartier, dryer lemon. It makes sense as it‚Äôll bring out the warming spices without making it like pork-lemon cake (gross).
You know why there are no shrimp in Lake Champlain? Because of this recipe.
I'm craving brown bread w/ ghram flower, butter, and tomato conserve. Old school New England food, yum.
I agree. In the 1940s, frozen foods were much less available than they are today. (Home refrigerators had tiny freezer compartments). Canned shrimp would have been the most available form.
I'll DM you my result too!

I just remember someone in here telling this story about being at SHOT Show and their Uber driver EDC'd one of these lol. I still think about that guy all the time.
Which Daft Punk album is this from
I only recently learned they were taken out of production. Really sucky.
I really hope that with SiCo acquiring Zev, the release the Non NFA version of this gun.
I've been asking this since these came out. 

Is there any way to thread the barrel on one of these and put a second suppressor on it purely for retard purposes?
How do these compare sound wise to a regular pistol with a suppressor?
Mine light primer strikes
You steal it from Robocop?
I bought one when they first came out. I think my serial number is under 200 on both the can and gun. Interesting gun that I wish got a second revision. Really was hoping that smith and wesson would make a version after they bought gemtech. 

Still hope that silencerco or someone else will make a new version of it at some point. Maybe one that uses a sig fcu. Just something with a better trigger as the stock one sucks. There is an after market spring option but it hurts ammo compatability. 

Mine usually comes out at machinegun shoots at the club I'm a member of. Something not as fun to shoot but interesting.
Just be aware a holster doesn't prevent it from burning your leg if you decide to use it on a shooting training course. Had to put a towel under it.
Excuse my autism but what is it?

Congrats, man! It's a wonderfully satisfying feeling when you finally get that dream gun.

I legitimately thought these never made it past concept due to never having seen one other than a stock photo

I really like mine. I got it for $1700 (including tax and shipping, it was $1400 before it) in February brand new. Two years ago the store wouldn‚Äôt sell it to me and I went back to the store to see if it was still there and sure enough.

They wouldn‚Äôt sell it to me because I was out of state, even though I had my work‚Äôs FFL and SOT and my boss was willing to call and/or email them to tell them to form 3 it. And I was willing to pay whatever shipping was going to be. The employees said it was already there for over a year and I was the second or third person to ever look at it.
No you need the 22 version now by silencer co
That‚Äôs one I want as well. What‚Äôd that one cost you
On my list....
Where are y‚Äôall getting these? I‚Äôve been looking for one of these forever

Fun times. Here‚Äôs my baby.
LUCKY
You got one of my unicorns too‚Ä¶ I should have bought one when they came out.
Wish SiCo still made this
You should have asked. I‚Äôve got 3 that I‚Äôd love to get rid of. Trigger is shit
Are...are you RoboCop?
Nobody has said what gun this is
Good luck, I tried one of these and they were not good
I enjoy mine! Welcome to the club.

I love mine. I would love to see a .45 version
Niiiiiiiice
Dead or alive, you‚Äôre coming with me
Super cool
Do they make a shoulder holster for this thing yet?
These guns look awesome but do they actually function and /or suppress well?
I saw one in a store in Oregon last week on the shelf. Very tempting.
What is this? I see people sharing pics of theirs, but I scrolled quite a ways down and didn't see who makes this.
I remember when they could t give theses away.
Wait I have questions wth is this?
They would go on sale for 799.00 after the release periodically. I wish I had gotten one just because it‚Äôs different. I heard PSA is doing one in 300 blk tho lmao.

Here‚Äôs my Maxim 9 with a Trijicon SRO next to an Sig Sauer P365 with a SilencerCo Omega 9K suppressor. I have not taken the time to send mine in to SICO for warranty. I‚Äôve been having light primer strikes since I got it.
Seen a lot of mixed reviews on these as far as reliability but damn they look cool.
I have a maxim 9. Worst gun I own. But it looks amazing and it‚Äôs hushed so that‚Äôs cool.
Honestly, though what the fuck is this gun?
https://preview.redd.it/acu1xz11jxsd1.jpeg?width=2979&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c663de959847273be5b134b4602f3b728199927

Sold mine some time ago.        Didn't suppress for crap.   Heavy.  Bulky.     I was honestly expecting way more functionality out of it.
I have an autosear in my maxim 9. Don‚Äôt recommend if you want something useable.
Yeahhhhh I‚Äôm not that big of a baller
Take baffles out of one and make one extra long?
Yeah that‚Äôs for sure a flex post
ü§£ü§£
Still wish they released that roller delayed 3 lug version. Would be a fun range toy
I really really like that. I can‚Äôt find a cerokate to do it people are afraid because you can‚Äôt get parts if something happens
1. Goes hard 2. I guess I didn‚Äôt realize how massive it is in videos but that‚Äôs a big bitch
Damn you matched your gun to your car interior perfectly
I bought some Glock mags while I was waiting for it to get out of jail
So I‚Äôll tell a little secret‚Ä¶ I worked at a mom and pop gun shop and it came in and I got it fairly cheap. I was at the right place at the right time
What holster are you running here? I've always wanted a red dot compatible holster for mine.
I may or may not have a holster for it ü§£ü§£ü§£
Random Access Memories. Instant Crush.
I hope they release a gen 2 version, imo keep it integrally suppressed but just improve the trigger and see if they can make it smaller or quieter given modern 3d printing tech.
I would say no but I guess anything is possible
[They‚Äôre very comparable](https://imgur.com/a/LKLOnJj)
Really good honestly. I was very surprised on how good it sounds.
I shot a box of ammo through one at a range day.  Seemed to be as quite as regular pistol with suppressor.  Only issue is that I had to stop and allow cool down before finishing my 50 rounds and they had to let it cool down again before next shooter.
Send it in for warranty.  They fixed my light primer issue.
I second this
It‚Äôs a silencerco maxim 9 it‚Äôs basically a Glock with a built-in suppressor
Silencerco maxim9
I can promise you they made them haha

Now*
Got to look on GB not sure

Pretty sure It's a maxim 9.
My thoughts exactly.

My buddy tried to get me to buy one when he bought his back in 18. So glad I held off because, as he says, the novelty wore off real fast. His just collects dust and hasn‚Äôt been outside the safe in years.
It's amazing. A super accurate Glock.
Just out of totally curiosity, what was the number they had on it?
SilencerCo
Read all comments haha
I‚Äôve shot it maybe 100-150rds no problems
It's like a jag. It's not about it working. It's about looking cool.
Wait, ya'll mother fuckers are using your shit?
Shot caller
Bought one brand new back when they first came out and bought one slightly used on GB for a decent price two years ago. Better to be lucky than good I guess.
What the heck would happen during a Cerakote job?
They are easy enough to tear down. I‚Äôve done two so far. ¬†Here‚Äôs one of them: ¬†https://imgur.com/4Hce5ya

The one pictured is a custom one off but check out [furycarrysolutions](https://furycarrysolutions.com/range-holster/?revpage=2%20)
Nope. They literally told me this is not a fixable issue, and they no longer stock any parts for this firearm.
Maxim 9
Not really‚Ä¶ it has a non reciprocating barrel. 
Glock barrels move.
They‚Äôre pretty highly sought after. Gunbroker it.
I couldn't see honestly. The tags were so small and I refuse to buy glasses. I didn't want to pick it up cause I might have bought it.
Yeah I just saw maxim 9. I want one so bad but discontinued. Reminds me of the dominator from psycho pass.
Who wants functionality when it can be cool
Wait, you aren‚Äôt?
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
They said they are worried about tear down and reassembly
Borderlands looking ass whisper gat.

That's really great work, I like it.
That's pretty dope. üòé
That‚Äôs really fucking cool
I could probably make one if I can find a scanned cad model
GunFighters makes 1 for it
With the stamp it was 1k
Thanks
Ok
You are getting downvoted by people who don't know what they are talking about. You are right. The only parts it has in common with the Glock are the iron sights and the magazines.
Didn‚Äôt say they weren‚Äôt.
Just said I‚Äôm glad I never dropped my hard earned cash on one.
Isn't that the point of the Maxim 9 anyway?
I'm too poor to have this kinda shit, all mine I flush.

I'd pay that fo sho.
Nice, not a bad price at all. The 2018 pricing was definitely an anomaly due to the SiCo free can promo.
So pretend im a fucking idiot. Why does this one need a stamp?
I know. It‚Äôs Reddit internet karma‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be okay.

In one sense I get where they‚Äôre coming from. ¬†Maxims are few and far between and they probably have little to no experience with one.

On the other hand it‚Äôs not rocket science. ¬†
I say this as a compliment - that looks straight outta Borderlands
Did the dude on r/ar15 do that for you? I'm assuming so, as it looks just like his white bullpup style.
That‚Äôs awesome!
That‚Äôs so cool.  Legit looks like it was pulled from a comic book.
I‚Äôm being dead serious lol
Do you not see the integrated suppressor on the front ?
Fun fact! This art style is called Cel Shading. Its one hundred percent borderlands and fvckin awesome
Thank you, I am a huge borderlands fan. I love the way it looks. The guy who did it is on this sub and he did a phenomenal job.
I‚Äôm not a 100 percent sure, I think so, he does other cel shading projects that are very borderlands inspired, his work is amazing. I saw a couple of projects he did and expressed interest, he hadn‚Äôt done a Maxim 9 yet but wanted one for his portfolio. He made it a really easy process.
Im not familiar with this gun at all , i had a feeling but it was just a fart. Thats heckin cool tho, war boners for everyone
Adrenaline is a helluva drug
I know you all at some point thought has someone ever done it. 
In case your curious or interested in his life:

Marco Siffredi's life was brief but filled with extraordinary achievements. At 22, he became the first person from Chamonix to climb Everest and the first person to ever snowboard down it. Despite skepticism from some older climbers, Marco's philosophy was clear: embrace the daring while you're young. His daring spirit earned him several firsts, including the Nant Blanc on the north face of Aiguille Verte at age 20. Marco‚Äôs descent records spanned formidable routes in the Alps and the Himalayas.

Born in Chamonix, Marco was no stranger to the mountains‚Äî **his brother died in an avalanche** when Marco was just 2. Despite this, he was drawn to the mountains. At 20, he made his first notable feat by snowboarding down the Nant Blanc on the north face of the Aiguille Verte (in the Alps and one of the highest peaks in the Mont Blanc massif). By 1999, he was tackling 8000-meter summits, preparing for his ultimate challenge: Everest.

In May 2001, Marco made his first successful descent from Everest, becoming the first person to climb all the way up with his snowboard and ride down. Beyond Everest, Marco‚Äôs other remarkable achievements included first descents on the north faces of the Tacul and Chardonnet, the west couloirs of the Aiguillettes du Tacul and Col du Diable, the Diagonal on the south face of Mont Maudit, and the south ridge of the 6034-meter Tocllaraju in Peru.

Unfortunately, on September 8, 2002, Marco attempted his second descent from Everest via the Hornbein Couloir. Tragically, he never returned, and his disappearance remains a mystery, with his tracks vanishing at 8,500 meters. Marco‚Äôs fearless legacy endures, echoing his belief in living boldly while you can.

A true shredder.

Dude was never seen again. Shredded into the abyss.
He has actually done it the previous year but then tried again in 2002 on a more difficult route
Definitely was the skiers fault.
When I‚Äôm ready to go let me heli up and snowboard off a massive cliff.. sounds nice
They never actually found his body, so he‚Äôs still up there strapped to his snowboard.
https://www.snowboarder.com/transworld-snowboarding-archive/the-disappearance-of-marco-siffredi
People die constantly just walking up this mountain, I know what I should do: snowboard down it in full mountaineering gear and ice boots
Man, if he only knew how many upvotes on Reddit he got
Legend.
Not one person mentions the pain in the butt of hauling your snowboard, bindings and boots to the top of Everest too. This dude went out like a legend.
No helmet :X
These stories remember me each time that i am lucky: for a rush of adrenaline i just need a little jump or listen how much i have to pay to ride one day
So afterwards he didn't like getting his picture taken anymore?!
![gif](giphy|YnvjNtAuhrLb3EIPmb|downsized)
No helmet no oxygen no fucks given
He died in the lodge 2 days later, drowned in a tsunami of pussy

The random capitalization bothers me
Legends say he is still shredding down the mountain to this day..
Obviously inherited his massive genitalia from his cousin Rocco.
How's the snow all the way up there? Any powder? Or just crust and ice?
His tracks were still visible when they did his funeral. went down towards the hornbien couloir which even the best climbers dare to take on. 
From wiki "For the first 400¬†m (1,300¬†ft) vertical, the couloir inclines at about 47¬∞, and the last 100¬†m (330¬†ft) is narrower and steeper with about a 60¬∞ average incline"
What was his plan? Did he have a pre planned path or line down or did he just wing it?
He‚Äôs the main character undoubtedly. What a G.
How many bodies are on Everest?
What‚Äôs weird to me is that all these high peaks look like normal mountains relative to the surroundings. Haven‚Äôt climbed Everest of course but when I went to the altiplano, you were already so high up that the mountains didn‚Äôt seem so bad. 
 So other than the lack of oxygen seems not much different than your regular back country?

I think he did it once and then perished on the second attempt.
Look at him, at the top of Everest with no O2 tank like a legend
There‚Äôs a Polish guy who went down K2 on skis a few years ago, google Andrzej Bargiel K2 if you want to see it.

I feel bad for his parents. Both children lost to the snow
> his disappearance remains a mystery

Does it though?  He either fell in a powder well or ascended to heaven like Mohammed.  I guess my comfort with statistics keeps me from finding that too mysterious.
What a legend
Legends never die!
Looks like he would leave grandpa frozen in the tuff shed.
Did they film the first climb/descent? what an amazing documentary that would be
Thank you for sharing. That was very interesting
There's not a lot to celebrate with this level of useless self-exhibition
Personally I choose to believe he hit a massive jump and just ascended to the heavens to become the snowboard god

Sounds like a gambler. Will just keep going until he can‚Äôt.¬†
That is my problem with such "achievements". It's 90% luck and 10% skills. He got lucky once and he tried again for no reason whatsoever and just proved that it's mostly luckiness based, because he couldn't repeat it. Which is obvious for normal people, but I guess that is why such people exist and even choose to take such risk to make an achievement. There is so much that can go wrong in such conditions that he could have made zero mistakes and still died.
Alright I fuckin snorted out loud you got me
I‚Äôd rather I die the park so my family can sue Alterra üòÑWhose down for a class action?
Someone‚Äôs going to dig him up in 2000 years still wearing those clothes and some early 2000 snowboard graphic
He went all the way to the top of Everest to avoid buying the Ikon
FWIW, most people who die just trying to climb Everest also die on the way down.

About 3/4 of the deaths on 8km peaks happen on the way down, often after summiting.
I think your trying to say he died a legend
He had Cartels dude, shoulda been fine
Love Monarch btw
Less than 3 people total have ever died snowboarding off Everest
I mean he did successfully snowboard down on the first one. He died trying it again on a harder course
Wether  ski or snowboard.  I can tell you that  a mellow glide over a stretch of glacier instead of hiking out from a mountain is so worth hauling some gear.
Probably had sherpas do it.

Is there a particular reason why?

Unfortunately, that meant himself, too.
I bet you‚Äôre right. Those guys don‚Äôt get paid enough
I'm about 11-12 years younger than this dude and also from Europe: I only started wearing a helmet in 2009, as the trip I took back then (at 18) just made a helmet obligated. No helmet? No trip. Before that, I didn't wear a helmet either. Unless you were going to the park, you didn't do that. And when I was like 15-16, we didn't wear a helmet in the park either. Nor any other protection. It was only when I was 18 when I decided to go for both a helmet and a back protector. My younger brother, a couple of years younger, never had any lessons without helmet. When he started, they gave out a free rental helmet to all younsters and later, that became obligated to be able participate in skischool. In Europe, at least, Austria, the big turn around in wearing helmets must have been in the same periode, somewher early 00's up to 10's... In France however, even last year, I saw a lot of people on the slopes without helmets. Even instructors.

Jokes on you I'm going to scalled myself to death with hot coffee in their cafeteria. You know... The classics
Either way that‚Äôs gonna be legendary
Lots of reasons can add up, but typically fatigue. Especially in the case of people who summit and die on the descent, they often get summit fever, push further than they should, and run out of energy to get down.

Even when that doesn't happen, descending is inherently a bit more dangerous because each step down is effectively a small fall downward. You're at the mercy of gravity every step you take, it only takes one small slip and with your momentum already heading down, you can easily end up in a fatal fall.

Think about climbing a ladder, then think about trying to descend a ladder with your back to the ladder as if you were walking down a staircase. Which sounds easier? Probably climbing up.

Maybe you could mitigate that danger by down climbing rather than descending, which is to say basically climbing in reverse with your face against the mountain, and in some spots in big mountains that is necessary...but you don't want to do that the whole way down because it would take forever and a lot of energy.

Also, being in the death zone about 8km is a bit of silent killer, it is constantly sucking the life out of you but it can be easy to not realize how much until you finally just hit the wall, or you run out of adrenaline, or whatever.

And *then* you add in the factor that most of the people on Everest these days aren't there because they're great mountaineers, but rather just because they paid to be there, and it's a recipe for consistent disaster sadly.
Exhaustion, HACE, HAPE, running out of oxygen, etc.¬†
*‚ÄùIt is not death that a man should fear, but rather he should fear never beginning to live‚Äù*
French instructors almost never wear helmets, lol
Yeah even in Australia it took a while for people to get used to the whole helmet thing, even though it was written into law by then
> In France however, even last year, I saw a lot of people on the slopes without helmets. Even instructors.

Kids in ski school have to wear a helmet, for a while now.

But yeah, still a lot of helmet-less riders here. Although it's getting better.

I'll defend them....... in this one aspect at least. Follow it to the logical conclusion, if they were liable for any jabronie hurting themselves in the park.. no parks! woo. Similar with opening up terrain. Be responsible for yourself brah
It aint no fun if the shareholders cant have none
This is the most dangerous aspect of climbing everest. Aside from the avalanches and crevas that for form. Weather kills alot because it's hard to find shelter if your not already near it in a reasonable amount of time.

If a storm is forming and coming for you on the mountain it could be less than an hour and you could easily be a 3-4 hour walk to shelter that might save you.
You‚Äôre the best, thank you!
FR, careful what y‚Äôall ask for. Make the operators liable and snowboarding will be about as fun as a car ride on a designated track.

Take a little risk. But also take a little responsibility.
Agreed, well said

Just do road runs bruh, they free, and you can sue the Lorax when you spill!
Thats crazy. Now I‚Äôm reading about the trash problem on Everest. Is that AI generated based on our convo or just a coincidence?
"in this one aspect at least"
Yes AI is generating the trash
Don‚Äôt forget about the üí©
Is what AI generated?
I meant to say AI is recommending posts about Everest since I mentioned it yesterday
An absolutely absurd copper job from last year at my old job 
8‚Äù copper pipe header. All lap welds welded with pure helium as a shielding gas and purged with argon. Hydrostatic tested each spool and had a TON of rework due to low quality filler rod prone to cracking. My least favorite job but by far the most interesting. 
What service was it for? A distillery?
Til you can weld copper lol. As a beginner, how would you manage the temperature? I can imagine you have to pre-heat bc it conducts heat so well.
Hey I make ground straps similar to the one pictured here!
Also, interesting jobs like this make for good stories to tell.
Used to see shit like that all the time building broadcast towers, tons of cool copper in the transmitter buildings.
You were probably talking funny for a week.
How much in Meth is that in Copper?
Electrician here. This shit got me foaming at the mouth
Woulda been a hell of a lot easier to just bust out the 8" propress jaws
Should you make a mistake at work. Then it should preferably not be at a job like this.
If its gonna be just water, what was the reason for welding and not brazing?
Goooood, I would totally get back into aerospace welding if could only weld exotics, carbon and stainless can pound sand. I loved welding copper, especially welding with high grade helium. 

Looks great, keep it up!
Ever heard of brazing rods ? It‚Äôs pretty easy to
Show us some passes/finished portions of this!
Somebody spent some money. I would hate to foot that bill.
Some methhead just came looking at this.
What on this green and blue earth was this for?
do you remember what rod you used. we do a few different copper alloys and none of them are anywhere near pleasant
Photos of finished product, or at least welds??
I bet braiding the ground was the best part lol
That's a big Alp horm
Yeah, but....look at all that copper!
Wow that's wild. Copper is super fun.
Was the finished part TIG welded or silver brazed?
Looks just like the place I used to work, CEC
That is some very large copper
Beautiful
I want a clean shop like this
It‚Äôs funny how the big fittings are just scaled up versions of standard pieces. Idk why I thought they‚Äôd look different it‚Äôs just funny to see it scaled up perfectly.
If this is going to a power station my guess would be it's an exhaust manifold for a string of diesel generators, or one really big one.
Why not just braze didn't realize copper welding was a thing. Is it supposed to be stronger than a braze?
moonshine
As a fitter this looks ridiculous. Those fittings are designed to be soldered or brazed.  Something is way out of spec.
We fabricators are on a strict ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù basis with what we build. We get a print and build what‚Äôs on the print and then when that‚Äôs done we do it again. We just don‚Äôt need to know. üòâ
I've welded a lot of Copper-Nickle-Aluminum alloy but never pure Copper
Who knew NIBCO made such huge fittings?
The Duff Beer special
You should see where I work lol so much copper in each Machine they cost 30 mil each
Is that like $30k in copper?
Looks like regular 1/2 copper to me
That warehouse looks exactly like the place I used to work. Wonder if it is lol
That must be so heavy‚Ä¶
Damn I had to double take to make sure that wasn‚Äôt my shop. Looks nearly identical.
This is so cool, do you have more photos
Do you work at Taylor Forge?
This is mainly for mechanical contractors work.
Shocked those flanges get around the 45¬∞ when finished
Wow what an interesting job. Have you any more pictures?
Very cool
A crackhead baiting station.
I honestly have no clue. Some energy company I think. It was gonna have just water going through it.
Looks like broadcast to me, but I might be wrong.
Carlton Draught tank beer install for a pub. 

Aussies get it.
Nah, it was for some kids Altima
Waste water
For copper you need to have a shit ton of heat, pretty much have to have the parts glowing red to be successful. A big job like this would need constant heating to keep it hot enough. I find that Oxy is better than Tig for copper, as a reducing flame will pull out oxides and hydrogen gas from the puddle making the welds less brittle.
I think it is more akin to brazing, than welding.
Preheat and high amps
To put things into perspective, some thin wall stainless piping like .060" you can blow through it pretty easily at like 60 amps. But the same copper pipe you have to work to form a puddle with 160 amps. 180 amps you can get a decent puddle going. It takes an incredible amount of amps compared to most other commonly welded metals.
One problem with copper, when you weld it (or anneal) ,  it softens up quite a bit.    
I played with it for project, even tried different quenching techniques to see if I could return some of the temper. 

I was playing around with 99.999999% stuff leftover from a process in my company.
I've found copper is kind of similar to Stainless, but more watery, and less "filly" like stainless is.

Stainless will fill in and freeze pretty nicely, where as Copper will run in, and if you don't come out will start to droop the puddle or undercut.

You can also weld Cobalt which is neat, but WILL fuck you up if you breathe it.
There's a lot of welding talk here when the fittings are very clearly brazing 'end feed' fittings!
Is that just a couple cables stripped and braided?
What would you call them? (Or where can I order them?)  I like the idea of that vs what we currently use.
Yep, what's crazy is it's actually a coax "cable" between the transmitter and the antenna.
I would talk funny after welding a pass from all the helium so I would go to the weep hole on my purge and huff argon to reverse the effect. Big brain move
Enough to fight off 40 cops while masturbating.
Yes
You may want to get tested for rabies
Oh there were many mistakes made from all of us on this job lol
I‚Äôm honestly not sure
Yeah, I‚Äôm getting sick of carbon and stainless at my current job. I wanna weld exotics really bad! Sometimes it feels like I‚Äôll never get the chance to.
Nah 10" Press fittings
I‚Äôll try to find some pics but the welds themselves were not that pretty haha
I really wish I could tell you but even I don‚Äôt know exactly where it went or what it was intended to do
Silicon bronze
I‚Äôll have to go digging for them and post an update
Tig welded
Silver brazed? Were you thinking SiB?
Not out of copper that‚Äôs way too expensive! Stainless would work fine. A lot of exhaust manifolds are cast iron. My guess is something food related maybe a brewery.
Honestly I‚Äôm not sure. This job came into the shop when I was still relatively new to the industry. I just did what I was told
Very very heavy
I do not
It‚Äôs the pipe used for flooding the engine room on a nuclear submarine.
San Francisco?
It would drive me crazy to build something like this and not know what it was for
I'm dying to know why they'd make this out of copper rather than anything else.
I honestly assumed this was for one of those hipster restaurants that try to make themselves look as steampunk as possible. Like they are some hidden secret slapped together in the basement of some grungy industrial area in a post apocalyptic hellscape. But they serve stuff like pink lemonade margaritas in ball mason jars,
Company I'm at does a lot of this stuff but generaly 3 or 4 inch copper. We do chilling units and machinery cooling
Huh, water... I'd have guessed that this was a high power coax cable for a TV station or radar system.
This is the way.
You can do either. Brazing will be easier but you can weld copper with enough preheat and amperage.
In welding you melt the base metal, in brazing you do not.

Straight copper to copper welding is prone to cracking; you have to keep it very clean.

Copper to brass less so, but still difficult.

The high thermal conductivity means you need to preheat to get puddles of any size, to allow for any flowing or wetting before freezing.
Literally a copper weld right there to the right of the flange in the picture. Dont need ‚Äúdimes‚Äù for brazing
Bingo! Preheat and maxing out the miller pipe works 400 and you get a puddle flowing. Pain in the ass though.
So hot and quick like aluminum?
The heat transfer is crazy and it works both ways. For instance put an ice cube on a piece of copper and an ice cube on a piece of stainless of tue same thickness. Its amazing how much faster the ice will melt on the copper piece.
Copper can only be work-hardened. There‚Äôs no other way to get it stiff like pipe.
Everybody puts their own spin on them, but yes essentially that‚Äôs it.
Dm me, I have an Etsy store I sell them on. Not sure if I can technically post the link here
Not in most broadcast, it would be hard line (copper line with nitrogen) connecting the antenna to the transmitter. 

Coaxial cable would be on shorter towers with hard line in the transmitter.

Edited to add: even in the hard line it‚Äôs a copper tube center, it‚Äôs wildly expensive.
Criminally underrated.
But it looks like you got it sorted out in the end
that stuff was weird. whenever i did it i remember not really seeing a puddle at all you just kinda gotta guess. and that stuff takes a ton of heat and i remember the weld looking like shit until you wire brush the hell out of it
So it was brazed then.  Why bother with tig at all in this case?  Seems like a huge waste of time.
Depends.  Sometimes they use water injection to cool the exhaust first (example when the generator is underground and the heat will cause issues) and they need the copper because its resistant to the chemicals they also have to spray in that demineralize the line.
Oh, okay. There is a place nearby that does the same exact work. They also make huge manifolds and piping for cruise ships and Naval ships. They do a lot of Cesium welding.
That would probably be inconel or something similar, actually. Plus, you'd be frikkin drowning in paperwork for the job (SUBSAFE documentation is worse than aviation.)
Happy cake day
[deleted]
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, San Francisco‚Äôs survival is attributed to the SUBSAFE program.
I've built so many structural components and wondered just how the fuck this puzzle piece gets turned into a building.
I made parts for the DoD for a while, and quite a few of them would be titled something like "wing, left" and it would look like some weird bracket. That is all the information we would get, so it was fun trying to figure out what the parts actually were.
It usually has to do with expansion and contraction due to the temperature of the fluid within. Source: I‚Äôm a plumber.
Was thinking the same, used to work at a place in Aberdeen that made a lot of offshore pipe assemblies, and CuNiFer was used for the habitation piping.
I've built 6 inch incoming water risers for a liquid feed plant before.  If you knew how much those fittings were you wouldn't think that. lol

Then the copper itself 2 years ago was i believe 3800 for a 20ft joint of type k.  the 90s were like 5 or 6 hundred and i forget the companion flanges, maybe close to 1000 a piece.  It would be badass, but I seriously doubt many people would spend the money on it if it's not necessary.
At my welding school the assistant teacher would practice copper Tig sometimes. He described it as brazing as well. I've never tried it.
Maybe you don‚Äôt melt the copper when you braze but my apprentice sure as hell does.
Kinda, but even higher melting point and thermal conductivity.
Welding this thin copper would be like tig welding 5/8 or 3/4 aluminum
yeah,  that's what i was finding.  just playing with it.  no real projects  other than personal entertainment.  before i did any research I even tried quenching in water, and oil (separately)
Hard line and rigid line are types of coaxial cable, although way bigger than what is typically thought of as coax. 

A running joke my local ham radio club has is that if you are needing to water cool your antenna feed lines it's either time for an intervention or a commercial license.
You can take a picture even if it's scrap though lol
Honestly? I don‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt write the procedure and I didn‚Äôt know much about copper or the industry at large at the time. Just a matter of doing what you‚Äôre told to do
Inconel and yeah that paperwork bloooooooooows. Every piece of rework is a full blown nightmare
Current submariner (Canada) and can confirm. Anything first level is crazy. Even the washers for a bolt will be serialized and have documentation leading all the way back to what batch of raw ore from what mine on the date it was dug.
As a hobby machinist, Inconel is an amazing material, but fuck is it difficult to work with.
Why does this require inconel?
Thanks for that, I hadn‚Äôt even noticed
I‚Äôm guessing you take everything literally with no room for humor.
Yeah, it was. The Thresher and the Scorpion were both before SUBSAFE (and why SUBSAFE) happened.

I've never been convinced it would have mattered for Scorpion, though - I've always been in favor of the "torpedo run/explosion" theory, and there wouldn't be much you could do in that case.

Rest well, brothers, we've got the watch.
Yes.  And running ballast pumps like mad the whole way back.
Yea, work order would say Northrop Grumman or Lock Martin, so you knew it was something cool.
I started out in machine shops making waveguide components for Radar systems. 90% didn't even have a description, or even for what department of the military on it. Just a long ass part number. The few that did...yeesh. parts for B52s, cruise missiles, Tieconderoga class cruisers.. ALmost all of it was military.
In this case probably has to do with whatever they are pumping and material compatibility. In modern power plant there is no copper. These are called all ferrous metallurgy. It makes corrosion control chemicals a lot easier because what is good for ferrous is not necessarily good for cupric and vise versa. That is all to say I wonder what this is for. Maybe a large potable water system?
They like to use pure copper in nuclear stuff. Which lines up with him saying it was for an energy company.
Im well aware how expensive this stuff is. But I promise you that you‚Äôd be surprised by how much a restaurant will spend just to create a look that they think will draw their desired crowd.
I mean, you can braze with TIG. But you can also just weld aluminum.
hah!
You‚Äôre right, when I think of rigid it‚Äôs the 6‚Äù-8‚Äù hard line we‚Äôre putting up, when you say coaxial I immediately think of the 7/8‚Äù to 1-5/8‚Äù coaxial/flex line.

I once put up an EW20 line at 1500‚Äô in Iowa, at the time it was the biggest elliptical line made. Came on a semi that needed a huge crane to offload it.
Just out of curiosity, did you break down the base metal and just use the silicone bronze as a filler?  If so then im wrong, you welded this.  If that's the case, the engineers probably had some kind of reason for choosing this process...makes me curious.
Well, as a former submariner and a SUBSAFE inspector, thank you for doing it the right way; but yeah, it really is a pain in the ass.
That's incredible
Didn't know Canadian subs had first level stuff. Totally makes sense that any "modern" sub would, just surprising you call it the same thing as us. Figured each country would have their own program and naming conventions.
Well, I'm a mechanic and ex-nuke, not an engineer, but my understanding is/was that it was preferred because of a combination of corrosion resistance, ability to handle pressure variations and movement, less activation under radiation (in the reactor compartment) and weight.

Inconel wasn't used everywhere, but a fair amount of engine room piping was inconel - it was kinda the "default" for primary (reactor) piping.
As someone who has worked in a DoD SCIF, most secret stuff is way less cool than you'd think.  I was super disappointed.  üòî
Can confirm, installed a load of galvanised conduit for a restaurant that wanted to look "industrial" barely a fucking cable in 15 bundles of pipe, and none of it gets anywhere near when you could actually use it for a cable run
I meant copper, thank you.
Navy doesn‚Äôt want any repeats of the Scorpion or Thresher.
Oh yeah - and I just figured out what that job actually reminds of...

[Take a look at this amazing jerry rig!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/s/gR1R4Pld9m)
There‚Äôs a great podcast episode about why sub safe protocol exists.
I think it's because we also follow the same subsafe program. I'm guessing the Brits do too, but they did have some un-subsafe stuff that had to be retro corrected. Like having haul and backup valves both activated by the same IPB.
Inconel is used in the primary cooling loop of reactors as it works well at high heat.

Many steels and such would start to creep or react with the coolant, not inconel though.

However weight is never the reason inconel is used for anything, that stuff is heavier than steel due to being a nickel base alloy.

It's also a bitch to work with as it work hardens a lot.
As someone who works at USPS, we have a bunch of Lockheed and Northrop stuff.
You can weld or braze copper. The difference is whether you melt the base material or not.
Or even the Hunley
That picture is oddly impressive
Money hoes like those places will snag every contract they can, even if it doesn't fit their current biz.
This. In my experience ( high end kitchen sinks) the puddle moves like stainless but you have to feed your filler some what like aluminum. Its actually pretty easy to weld as long as you can manage the heat properly, as it leaves the metal so quickly. ( Tig welding 16 gauge copper required around 160-240 amps which is much higher than most other metals of a similar thickness)

It was an interesting job as it helped with my puddle control and welding theory in general.

For anyone working with tig welding copper sheet metal, I recommend cutting strips of the parent material for your filler metal over using copper welding rods. 

Copper IMO experience seems to vary batch to batch. Copper welding rods tend to be a darker shade that is noticeable after grinding/finishing. This only matters if you are needing a consistent visual finish between welds and the base material.
I know. If (I'm assuming) they need to be able to break that rig down periodically and they're not dealing with extreme pressures, it makes a surprisingly reasonable amount of sense.
The hardest part of welding
Found this in my lunch pail. It's hard but this makes it a little easier.
Yes, as a welder I too struggle to read, haven't quite nailed it.¬†
Super cute. Sorry to be the one to ruin it for u. Butttttt. My son already told me I'm the best dad ever. Please don't let this ruin the sentiment
Get some magnets and put it up in the lid of the tool box. Got one in mine and makes me smile everything I look at it.
I once worked with a dude who had a polaroid of his family glued to the inside of his hood
I keep the notes my daughter gives me in my hard hat. I also have an American girl doll hair tie on it and a reindeer that hangs in my car to keep me safe on my travel. I work on the road 4 days a week
That‚Äôs why i gave up the six figures and long hours. Wasn‚Äôt worth it. Got out of welding because i couldn‚Äôt hold my newborn some nights because of chemicals/fumes lingering on me. This job ain‚Äôt for everyone but i got respect for those that do it
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying üò≠
I feel your pain man. The time goes by so quick and at the end we all wish we could have spent more time but on the other hand, if we don‚Äôt work, a good life isn‚Äôt always possible so we have to take the bad with the good. You‚Äôre right with your comment, it makes it all worthwhile and your son will learn your same work ethic for his future family. Much props my fellow welder
Awe. I wish my subordinates were this nice.
Man this hit me. I just finished a 10 hour Saturday, got my own work to do tomorrow and I haven't seen my son awake with over a week. This is a tough week and I'm getting to resent the job, but we do it fir them.  My new goal is to get into a shop that finishes early so i can be home before 6pm
That's why we do what we do, whatever job that is. I raised four and discovered another one when she tracked me down when she was 38. Still haven't met, happened during the Chicoms plague
Reminds me of when I got traveling jobs as an Ironworker out of hs . I still lived with my parents and my mom would always hug me goodbye and give me a letter tell me positive things because i would be gone a month every time . She didn't understand what it was just that I worked in heights . I always felt sad and guilty because if she could see what the hell I was doing or if I got hurt she would have been crushed I was risking it like that for a check
Hold on to that letter forever
Wait a minute‚Ä¶ how can you be the best dad ever if I‚Äôm the best dad ever? Something isn‚Äôt adding up here‚Ä¶
Hit right in the feels. Great kid awesome dad
Kids are only kids once, You can always make more money.  Everyone‚Äôs circumstances are different but make sure you don‚Äôt chase the $$ and miss the real prize at home. 

( this isn‚Äôt a dig at you)
That's the shit that either makes us go home and stay, or it makes us work harder so we can try to go home early.
Wear a respirator so you have more time to spend with them
i‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying‚Ä¶
i didnt come here to cry
Best support system you can ask for bro
Give it 10 years... it'll turn around.
I worked way too many hours when my kids were young. 60-72 hours a week.  I didn‚Äôt see them much as I wanted. Now work 4 8s and I‚Äôm home all the time.
ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ that‚Äôs WHAT TF it‚Äôs ALL about!!! Sweet kid!!!
Oh hahaha, it welds my heart.
Who put these onions here???
Wait, you guys have energy and enough mental fortitude to do stuff after work?
Hold up! I hold the title of BEST DAD EVER! 

What is this NONSENSE!?!?
Got me all messed up. Bout to go to the bathroom and fall apart for a little bit.
That‚Äôll get you in the feelers‚Ä¶ I know the little notes I got always made my day.
Dang bro. That made me want to have kids.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
Exactly why I quit welding for a living. I feel for you man.
Sounds to me like you are a good daddy.  You are working because you are a good man trying to take care of your family
You adopting?
Damnnnnnn!!! ‚Ä¶ reading that note gave me tears ‚Ä¶ you are vary a lucky father and very loved ‚Ä¶ now if you would excuse me, I‚Äôm go out and play with my kids now ‚Ä¶ thank you for that.
So wholesome, I can't wait to be a dad.

Also, why did this get marked as NSFW? It's like the most wholesome thing I've ever seen on Reddit.
Got a note like this from my daughter and I haven‚Äôt had to hold back tears like that in a while
I mean, you could introduce your child to your Trade - have 'em welding Tee Joints and Lap Joints with nothing more than a Shade 9 Hood, some Lapco Gear, quality gloves, and even their own Steel Toed Boots and Welders Hat.

Do some neat little "Home Fabrication Projects". Sky's the limit.
if anyone ever asks to go band for band with you. just pull this out bro. damn near got me this one
Bruh‚Ä¶. That is invaluable!
I thought the welder wrote the letter
I‚Äôm a toolmaker but also struggled to read, am I a welder as well?
This wins! ü§£
I feel like we might have some other claimants checking in also lol
Thank you showmethecameltoe that‚Äôs is so wholesome
I too had a polaroid of a stripper I met in Edmonton.
Why couldn‚Äôt you just try to switch to a union? They‚Äôll give you the option to work locally with OT being optional.
Save it for under the hood, man. We gotta make sure the boss remembers who's in control.
its probably just tHE VENTILATION IN THIS DAMN SHOP AINT WORTH A FUCK. Lol
The one upside of the shop is the super early start. The one downside of this shop is the super early start. Haha

I feel you. Excited to see them but beaten up tired
Not taken that way at all. When you care about your kids you always have that doubt of whether what you are doing is actually the right choice. But you have to feed them
Yep, super important. I work in entertainment/art fab and there are all kinds of trades working in the same area on projects too large to move around from department to department

Like ten different careers worth of environmental contaminant all at once
Hay I've been working on my handwriding okay
same
I was SURE until the correct use of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù then I knew it couldn‚Äôt be.
Yes. Not only am I the best dad, but also the bestest son.
im the bestest dad, i have a mug to prove it.
I'm not even a Dad, my friend's kids said this to me! To be fair, I think I'd be a terrible father. My friends bring their kids over because I let them get out all the urges to shoot arrows, set things on fire, ride dirt bikes, etc; then when the kids want to do it back at their house, the parents get to use the excuse of "We only do that stuff at Necro's house, we'd get in trouble if we do it here, etc."
Also show me the cameltoe
Close enough
Saskatchewan vs albertan welders
Not the Edmonton shout out I typically look for, but hey, take what you can.
None in my area. I work 15 minutes from my house. Closest jobs for unions are 1.5 hours away. Nowadays I‚Äôm QC/CWI so I‚Äôm chillin.
Exactly mate. You are doing a great job and setting a good working mentality for the kids !
I'm happy that you tried your best.
There can be only one.
I‚Äôm the best dad I have TWO shirts that say so.
Ironically, the note she left was similar to op‚Äôs.
She‚Äôs a tough go on the SK side üòÇ

Natural beauty 
Just drove up and looking for a place to stay tonight. Would prefer to only see locals who look like Rockwell paintings. Currently parked in the middle of Rt. 7 and need your suggestions ASAP.
Breathtaking. Everything is just simpler up here in Vermont. Slower. More saturated.
Would also love directions to your favorite secret swimming hole for my trip up next summer.¬†
I don't think it's saturated enough. Slide that saturation slider up.
Hey, OP, can you give me the exact coordinates of this picture? I want to drive slow as fuck getting there and block traffic so I can post a picture on my IG. Also if you have any suggestions of what to do in and around Stowe, I would love it!!! Coming next week and I haven‚Äôt planned a fucking thing! Is there a train from Burlington airport to Stowe? Or should I rent a car?

Can you make it any more artificial please? My head only hurts a little bit ;)
We're so blessed to live in this beautiful completely natural state of natural beauty.
I like to go to that spot to paint. I am trying to get them to build a covered bridge across the road so it will be even better.
Excellent work all around. That includes the comment section.

Amazing post! Natural beauty! Gorgeous! Can you tell me how far from Stowe this is I‚Äôm coming up from NJ soon and want to make sure I hit all the hidden gems on my way to our favorite little (air)B&B.
I love this place! Everyone I follow on tiktok says it is THE place to be during peak foliage. I was trying to get there last week, but the tour bus I was on got stuck in some place called the Notch, so I wasn't able to make it.
Now back up and have your boyfriend take a picture of you with this as a background. Make sure you're wearing an oversized roll-neck sweater and high boots, and toss your hair. You *do* have long auburn hair, right?
It's too bad the red leaves aren't popping.  But I do love how the grass is so...so.... neon. Must be the warm dry summer we had. Chefs kiss to the editor

Shame they had to knock down the house and now the property is a Superfund site. That's what happens when millions of people take too many HRD photos of a location. Tourists, do better.

Yeah, natural if you‚Äôre on acid. Lmao
There is absolutely nothing natural about that oversaturated photo.

I really love the JPEG artifacting in the air this season.
I'll send you the one I read about in USA Today! Blessed to be able to call VT our third home.
Can you warm up the water in the swimming hole before we get there? I'm not up for a polar plunge.
Don think they can. If they do they might go plaid.
I want yo ride my bicycle down that road in the middle and ignore the honking cars behind me. After that I‚Äôm gonna get belligerent in some town way too close to 89 (cuz that‚Äôs the only part I‚Äôm comfortable in) and yell about how I am the economy.
My fianc√© and I are planning to move here never having visited before. We both have high paying jobs and work remotely so real estate prices shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. So long as we aren‚Äôt near any stinky farms. We would love a lot of land that we can post no trespassing signs all over to keep out the gross locals. But will need some locals to travel great distances to provide essential services at poverty level wages. We love the idea of Vermont, but are expecting it to be exactly like the urban area that we are coming from at the same time! Does anyone know any good nail salons, spin classes and spas for my fianc√©? Also looking for recommendations for grooming and doggy day care for our French Bulldogs.
Actually you can‚Äôt drive there right now.  The road is closed for the exact reason you stated.
You and your group of 7 should all rent e-bikes and ride them in the road like a motorcycle gang going half the speed limit and refusing to let cars pass. And don‚Äôt forget to stop often to take selfies.
Sorry, this one location was officially shut down by the town. Road only open to folks who live on it.  Thank the Insta mob for that one.

It‚Äôs the Aerosmith home on Cloudland Rd near Woodstock. You can get a great picture from the rd easily since it‚Äôs a back road with little traffic. Can‚Äôt go down the driveway though as there‚Äôs a gate. As for Stowe, ride the Gondola and hike the mountain there. Also nearby is the Ben and Jerry‚Äôs factory.

At least people moving here bring tax revenue versus people buying investment properties and vacation homes where the state never sees a dime of income tax from them.

I'll admit though (as one of those transplants everyone here hates) the idea that random people can just come wander onto my property with rifles is, frankly, bizarre. The principle of "right to roam" as it applies to hiking and foraging is something I can definitely get behind. But it's dumb as fuck that I have to make sure my dogs wear blaze orange vests if I want to take them for a walk on *my own property* so they don't get shot by a hunter.

Fill up a chunk of 4x4 angle instead of this. If youre just tryin to get away from whippin and youre practicing dumping metal, angle is the answer. Makes a good door stop too
Those wraps and the amount of spatter sheesh. Heating the otherside to pull it back I'd be concerned it crack.
Lol, brilliant. I'm saving this one to show my coworkers. For those who don't know, strongbacking the opposite side of your joint is how stop warpage.

Cheers, bro this made me laugh.
What is the purpose of so much weld on such a thin piece of metal?
Good luck with that
ü§£
Heat straightening never a bad skill to have in your pocket, just in case
[Dog and wedge](https://imgur.com/a/kcYq2o7) it with heat but that weld isn't going to give. It'll have a W shape when you're done.
Why is this weld so big? What's the story here.
At this rate you won't need to use any stock or material, just make the part with wire and filler metal.
That‚Äôs just the test piece so you know what degree behind square to fit the plate

/s
Stop .. hammer time! /s
Wayyy overboard for that angle on the bottom there. Gotta strong back something like that and even still it probably won‚Äôt be straight.
For the homies interested in actually critiquing the welds I made a post where you can see them a bit better 

 https://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/s/rU9xqC9HRL
It took you that many passes to stop yourself from whipping? Jesus man, don‚Äôt ever pick up a legitimate vice, stay clean homie.
My first welding teacher wanted this garbage. I think it was because he was too lazy to teach us how to set anything else up like an open root groove weld.¬†

¬†I just left the class. Left the piece. Left the machine on. Took my gear and left.¬†

¬†Second welding teacher. He gives me a groove or fillet to do. I did it and was all proud of myself. Show him and his response? ‚ÄúNever weld anything flat in my class ever again.‚Äù A real teacher.

ETA, oh this is MIG? Hmmm
50T Hydraulic press will straighten that out, and test your welds  out at the same time
Lol.

So, when planning this joint, how exactly did you believe it was going to work?

What did you learn?
Why is it bad to just heat it up and bang it back square with a hammer?
You know, I'm impressed.
That tack giving some spider man vibes
The welds will crack if you decide to heat and bend in
Wax on, wax off Daniel San‚Ä¶
Lemme just bust out the ole fillet weld gauge......looks good
Hammer it
So after the fifth one you thought ‚Äúhey it aint supposed to do that, and maybe i should‚Äôve tacked them better‚Äù
This is clearly GMAW or MAG not MIG.
One thing I don't miss about welding. That ping as the tack busts
I see no problem here
Heat to large material. Size to smaller ffs. Throw it out and start new.
675¬∞C is the maximum temperature needed to correct distortion. Otherwise you're compromising the structural integrity.
Why in gods name would you put so much weld on something like that?
Just use little heat for long time lol
This can‚Äôt be a real joint! Is it?
Use clamps while welding thin metal
That‚Äôs actually true. I have personally bent steel I-beams using just a torch. It‚Äôll work, but it‚Äôs slow - as in a few hours and several rounds of reheats.
Your boss is an idiot
Way to much weld for the size of pieces you bonded
Whats the point of this? Like foir real...

Here are the A-size rules.

* Max A-size for one side fillet: `A = T`
* Max A-size for one sided fillet with margin: `A = 1,25*T`
* Max A-size for two sided fillet: `A = 0,7*T`

These are the Eurocode 3 values. Also the ones SSAB recommends them in their design handbook (Which I recommend for everyone I can - it's free to download as a PDF on their site. Why wouldn't you get it?).

Unless otherwise specified, there is no point doing other than this. Weld that is thicker than the weakest joining part brings no benefit.

P.S Whoever thought those tack welds would hold this... thing... in place. You are adorable! But you can't cheat physics, thermal expansion and contraction are things that are kind like fundamental to universe that we live in.
Pulled away a little, tot to bad.
Don‚Äôt think the‚Äôll see it.
Dude.. thats like f 100 passes.  Aint no shit gonna bend out. Your boss is idiot
They want it ground flush too, right? 

Yeah? 

‚Ä¶.great
This was self imposed!

But also yes
Me! 

But it‚Äôs just some practice junk that I was running to break my habit of whipping and get a nice steady bead that produced a weld I was happy with
I struck it with my hammer a couple times just to see if that‚Äôs what it needed
You‚Äôre the first!

This was 100% a ‚Äòlook like you‚Äôre busy‚Äô project and I took advantage of trying to improve a skill lol
If it‚Äôs not glowing that means it‚Äôs ok to weld‚Ä¶..right?

(I cooked the shit out of it)
lol, it‚Äôs scrap metal that I was just burning wire on to force myself to stop whipping MiG and get a steady/even stringer bead that melts in a way I like
Strong backing, is that like welding some angle on the back so it can't warp? Can you help a guy out?
sounds stressful
I am the 3D printer now
Oh I know it, this was just a bit of fun shitpost of some scrap where I tried to force the muscle memory of steady stringer beads instead of whips.
That strong back is going to see a chiropractor when you cut it off.
Well I got good at bad habits before with drugs, booze, and shitty relationships; it took me so many passes to get better because I‚Äôm just that good at doing things poorly
No sir, it‚Äôs solid wire .045 MIG at 25.5v
But‚Ä¶ I like this one
When you practice.
Homie, it‚Äôs scrap metal that I was using to ‚Äòlook like I was busy‚Äô while breaking my bad habit of whipped MiG welds‚Ä¶..I appreciate your concern and willingness to hit the specs there but I hoped the ‚Äúmeme/shitpost‚Äù flair would cue folk in that its nothing serious
It‚Äôs more than just no point, welding above material thickness the steal will get hardened from the heat and will actually be more brittle and less strong
Woah woah woah that doesnt look like a 3/4 weld. Ima have to ask ya to grind it out and restart
Better polish that shit too. We are not cave men here after all
More weld always works
I just follow the page to see shit but I‚Äôve never welded(?) (Weldt?) before..

If you had added more tack spots to the base would it have prevented the pull up? Or so many layers would have snapped any extra tack spots?
Why is whipping bad? Genuinely curious, if its bad in general or simply a bad all around habit.
fair enough,practice is good. . i've been welding commercially since the early 80's, have seen some unbelievable shit come out on prints.
I was wondering why ud need such a gigantic weld when your only welding to (what looks like) 1/4 inch material. The thinner material going to break way before the weld does lol.
Throw some Fresca on that baby. Pour some Aquafina please that metal is literally about to die.

Legit.  When you are a welder most people have no fucking idea what you‚Äôre doing.  If they come near and tell you to hurry up, strike an arc. But don‚Äôt let them rush you. That‚Äôs how you get hurt and that‚Äôs how welds look like shit and join like
Shit. 

The best welders are lazy welders. Taking your time is a part of your job and getting it right.  

Set up 3 test peices.  Rotate between those.  Also a cool piece of metal on the back will help the cooling process. Not attached. Just a cooling plate.  

I know what it‚Äôs like to have limited school time and wanna lay as much bead as possible. But learning to do it right is a big part of the job. Breathe deep Padwan. Focus your chakras. Let the force flow through you.  

Or shotgun a monster and rip a Newport. Whatever.
Alright that's fair lol
Basically. In shipfitting you weld a scrap plate or something to the other side of the expected weldment at tack.

Check this ancient video out. It will explain everything. And entertain you too.

https://youtu.be/2vuGlcbDwKY?si=Psghh67KDfknQ_DO
Hahaha first step to fixing it is admitting it! 

Anyway, unless your whips are huge there‚Äôs nothing wrong with doing small ones, just watch your toes and don‚Äôt whip big. I‚Äôve passed many many tests and I almost always whip.
what gas
>It‚Äôs more than just no point, welding above material thickness the steal will get hardened from the heat and will actually be more brittle and less strong

Eh... We can deal with that easy, that's not a problem. A single pass is enough quench harden an area, if the part has enough surface area and the air cool. It can harden enough to make drilling into it really hard with mild bits. This I know from experience, which is why I have good quality stainless bits with me.
Yep, snaps the tacks mid weld and makes you shit your pants, well the first time it happens anyway.
Yes and no. Securing the part so it doesn't move is called restraint, too much and the weld can crack, too little and you get what you see here.


You could also make the base plate bent away from the weld so it gets pulled into position - I'm not sure if there's an official name for it but I call it prepositioning.


The reason any of this is even an issue is due the very nature of how material behaves as temperature changes. Temperature is just the measurement of how much the atoms in a particular substance are moving. More movement means more heat and vice versa. As atoms jiggle around they push each other away, making the affected material expand in size which is measured in volume, or the amount of stuff in a defined space - lookup press fit bearings & gaskets on YouTube for a more tangible visualization.


So, more heat means things expand which increases volume, measured in delta density. Since the base metal is cooler than the arc and molten metal being added, it settles into a shape consistent with it's surface tension and relationship of the joint's geometry. The weld starts to cool from the outside-in but there's a problem. As the outside of the weld (called the weld face) cools, it doesn't have enough malleability to fully shrink proportional to the decrease in temperature, so it shrinks as much as it can and is now in tension, pulling the edges of the weld (weld toes) towards the center of the weld face to equalize the difference in shrinkage to volume. As the weld toes pull inwards, the same process happens underneath the solidified face and all around. This keeps happening until the temperature reaches ambient temperature, affecting a defined area around the weld (heat affected zone or HAZ) and slightly beyond where the molecular grain structures do funny things.


Tldr; welds are hot, when they cool they shrink, when they shrink they create tension, when they create tension they pull in, when they pull in the metal turns into a potato chip.
Welded is correct. Weldt is (in my experience) short for Weldment, which is anything that gets welded.
I think the proper term is welderized. You should be fine if you use that from now on.
There's not any amount of weld that will keep that bottom plate straight.  The more heat you dump into a part the more it's going to warp, the only answer is less weld or thicker bottom material.
Whipping, (back and forth in line with the travel direction) and weaving (side to side perpendicular to travel direction) are generally frowned upon in MIG welding for several reasons.¬†


It puts more heat into the part than is necessary.¬†


It can also trap imperfections inside the welds.¬†


Generally speaking though it's a bad habit to get into because most specs call for stringers which are straight bead welds.


Some people will tell you NEVER to oscillate. Others will tell you it totally doesn't matter. Personally, I believe oscillations have their place. But on a flat filled weld? Nah.¬†
Not as bad a nae nae
Its not bad if u do it right. Passed lots of xrays with a whip and pause, but the increased heat input is correct. Works well for BIG structural stuff where increased deposition rate and heat can be beneficial. Many people will say ya gotta run mig thisnway or that, but in my experience, most welds arent gonna be called out one way or another and if they are, just do it like that. This guy has it right tho, for fillin up stacks like this, straight, fast passes will help keep heat out and maintain a tight weld profile thats easier to get to spec.
In MIG it will generally lead to a weaker weld because you arnt getting the same penetration you would with a straight push (because your concentration point is moving so much all over the place). 

It does have its uses. I do a form of weave pattern when filling gaps but also i run another bead on top so my weave is essentially a root pass.
I thought my whips were better than average but i still figured it was worth understanding and learning the ‚Äòideal‚Äô way of doing it too

I posted a picture of one a while back for reference 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/s/uVVGpCSQqN
92/8 if I‚Äôm remembering right
Ofcorse it can be dealt with, why would you deal with it though? You are better off welding a couple of ribs if you want more strength, welding like in op‚Äôs pick has pretty much only disadvantages (if someone can enlighten me please do).
Same results if you tacked it all the way across? (In essence welding it to the bottom plate first?
Liar! If you‚Äôre anything like me you‚Äôll shit your pants every time. Not just the first one lol
IMO It's mainly down to the fact that a whipping motion creates a varying throat depth fillet.  Basically the CSA of the weld is varying as you whip...taking it out of spec if it's a coded weld.

For non coded welding I prefer it visually as it turns a convex shaped weld into a convex shaped weld (in CSA) so it's more akin to a MMA shaped weld... without the 'boulbous' disadvantages that come with mig sometimes  (visually)
For our welding practice as apprentices we had to do our test welds strict not stepping just consistent pace and cap. I try to explain to people now how big alloy mig weld steps they are getting less penetration and each bead at its max width is the most point of penetration so it looks like a saw blade. When strictly stringers you get such a even amount of great penetration across the whole edge of your weld as the penetration and the cap make it strong i stead of joining butt loads of tack welds with massive steps.
I personally do a tiny weave as I travel steadily forward. Something like 2mm back and fourth cause I think the toes look better that way.

But I'm no mig welder, I'm a stick and tig welder and try my very best to stay away from mig.
Is that not stick? I'm confused
Bruh whipping isnt frowned upon
Ideal is what passes tests and what works for you. If you pass tests whipping then don‚Äôt worry.  

Edit: your whips are fine, your toes are blended and flush I wouldnt  worry.
that is called MAG welding. you used Active Gas. not pure argon.

at least in the books
That is not what I meant. We can normalise the area by heating it above the crystalisation temperature and the material hardness returns to normal.\*

\*Except some very minor losses in carbon and alloy elements from flaking.

When it comes to mechanical properties and strength, well thats what we optimise all the time doing calculations. "Couple ribs" isn't actually always a solution, they can make things weaker in certain cases; depending on the kinds of stress desired behavior from the structure, elasticity is a good thing.
I'm only an apprentice but I think even a full weld would split then snap on that small surface. It's best to (in this case cos it's practice and doesn't matter) just let the plate buckle and heat it to straighten it if you were asked to.
Ok not gonna lie it makes me jump still üò≠
It is by anyone who knows what they're doing.¬†
I‚Äôve never heard MAG used before, google is implying it‚Äôs a bit of a us/uk difference where MIG is used as a catchall term for both in the states
Please explain to me how a weld like this would be better than ribs. Can it be done? Yes. Will it hold? For a while. But why do it, what actual advantage does this have?

Also there is no way you will normalize the steal after heating it so extremely and repeatedly, it will never be the same. That piece of steal right above the weld will crack eventually, if it‚Äôs tomorrow or in 10 years I dunno.
I'd be welding a pair of ribs into the underside, myself

That said, I'm an amateur.
I thought heating to straighten it was a joke‚Ä¶ interesting
Oh baby i know whay im doin darlin and it aint. Maybe learn to control your steps. O can tell you aint a 6010 welder
Doughboy I strongly agree. I've whipped from nisku to fort mac (at least) . Guessing their not talking about smaw.
Even then youd only really whip and pause with mig and thats not used fir structural anyways so its perfectly fine.
setup for this season
a buddy and i built a little house (more like an insulated shack) on the back of a 6x10 utility trailer. been traveling around the rockies and the west chasing snow. currently in truckee, been hitting boreal. anyone know a good place to park?
Any pics of the inside you're willing to share? That thing is awesome
Tell me you have a 69 house number on that thing‚Ä¶

You beautiful son of a bitch, you did it.  Bravo.
This is the coolest shit I have seen in a while! Love it
The top gear boys would be proud
Dream big, you beautiful sons of bitches.
I bet some good crime has happened in there
She‚Äôs a beaut, Clark üëå
This will be a talked about winter for you guys for a long time, way to go
this is fucking sick
Mind sharing roughly how much $ you have in it? Looks awesome. I‚Äôve tried similar and always ended up spending so much I should have just bought something already done and purpose built lol.
That‚Äôs fucking awesome. And the taco‚Äôs doing work up there! (I‚Äôm not even gonna ask about your gas mileage‚ÄîI‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt want to know)
Put some siding on that bad boi
So sick how is towing that on the highways
That‚Äôs a sick setup! I love it.
That gas station in Silver Creek is a pretty good place to stay. Lots of people leave their cars over night there. There is also a pretty nice Rail Trail parking lot on Promontory Ranch Road that nobody would bother you at.
Dedication
The Crime Shack
Got any build photos to share?  We would all love to see the before and after shots!
How do you afford to do this stuff? Do you just find random jobs wherever you go or something like that? Super fucking sick btw
Check out sno-parks for parking
What‚Äôs with the green board? I wouldn‚Äôt use a broken board on the Rockies üòù
Damn that‚Äôs cool. What board is the green one?
Dudes out there with a reconstructed knee, man that‚Äôs some dedication bro.
ü§ù
That‚Äôs the dream right there
I love it. What was the construction like on the shack?  Need to build one for my backyard.
Kudos to you and your buddy!!!

The life I would have lived if I got into snowboarding in my teens.  Instead of my mid-late 20‚Äôs after graduating from College (Sally Mae üí∞), starting a career and getting a mortgage üòû.

The life I will live when I retire in 20 some odd years though üöêüèÇüòé.  My wife suspects it, but thinks I‚Äôm not serious about driving around in an RV from snow resort to snow resort all winter, and making the occasional trip South of the equator during NA summers.
This is the coolest thing ever haha. Just shread everyday.
Your rig is sick

If you are still around boreal you can park at Donner Summit Snopark

Or at Boreal Inn
This is absolutely amazing. I would enjoy life so damn much
Sweet setup! If you haven‚Äôt already, get a carbon monoxide detector
Fucking dope!
Soo fucking good. You boys are living the good life
Awsome. When can I come crash for a night?
This is so amazing

Such a sick setup where have you been taking it?
So awesome! You guys are living the life.
"Don't go changin'!"
Shit you got an ‚Äò09 Tacoma long bed too? 

Jc how‚Äôs it been doing carrying that load up and down the mountain? I haven‚Äôt splurged on any towable camper yet because I‚Äôm worried about the Rockies elevation climbs (where I live)
dang man, setup is fully dialed in...I'm jelly
Trail head of the PCT. Just drive down the road from Boreal. Basically as you‚Äôre coming out of the parking lot instead of turning left and heading onto 80 just drive straight to the end of the road. Source: used to live in the condos/work  at Boreal
Park in the Safeway parking lot in town, probably ok as long as it‚Äôs not snowing. Also check with Boreal they might let you park in their lot over night or at their hotel lot..
Do you need a gf?
Sinclair off I80 in park city!
Legit af
Of all the mountains on that road.. you picked Boreal? Northstar like.. down the road. Hell even Squa around the corner..
Nice!

Damn that's sick!

I need this.

Awesome idea!  Some siding and insulation and that thing will last forever and be much more comfortable.
the dream
Taco gang üî•
Perfect 420 out of 420 would hot box
Ohhh the nitro pow! 
I love that board 
I really want to get a cannon.
Hey I know that gas station! Try their breakfast burritos they are bomb
That is legit. What is it framed out with? Will it shake apart?
69
Hey! I recognize the diesel sign, I live close to there!
Damn I love people like you.
I need to get a diesel heater for my forward fold.
You boys hitting some night sessions? I‚Äôll be up there during the week üëä
This post needs an MTV cribs style video with it
This is the coolest freaking camping trailer setup I‚Äôve ever seen
I can tell that gas price sign was originally only meant for two digits.
Can kick it at Skydive Lodi
Damn‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall done it.
This is inspiring. Did you guys make videos of how you built it. Is it just sitting on the trailer or bolted down somehow?
There‚Äôs parking in tahoe city, CA about 20 min south of Truckee. It‚Äôs by the bus station and has a large lot people will camp in for a day or two as long as your respectful they are cool with it. Hit me up if you need more details. I‚Äôm in the area. 

Sick rig btw.
Stealth camping!
Alright that is cool!
I LOVED M3 back in the day. Sick boards.
Thought that was an ice fishing hut at first lol. That is awesome!
Truckee has some spots u can park for free near the downtown area, reno also has some spots u can park at. Hit up Mt Rose dude! Great pow right now i just went today it was amazing
Better setup than a sprinter van imo
This is the way. Avoid the high costs of accomodation where possible.
That's amazing! I love the design. I think it's so cool how the ramp becomes the deck and how any snow can fall through it.
Oh I am insanely jealous, nice work guys.
Does the truck stop let you stay there for multiple days?
Points for the nitro POW. My favourite board ever for all conditions, and especially overhead.
Dam that thing looks awesome! Not sure what Rockies means to you but Revelstoke has a special parking lot for RVs, you are allowed to park overnight as well.
Basically lived in the sav Mart parking lot on Deerfield during last winter in a truck camper. They do not give a fuck
Do yall cuddle in that after?
Amazing. I would love something like this. Great idea.
Let‚Äôs see the inside!
Where do you shit?
Enormous pow hitting all of Tahoe in ~6ish hours, hope you found a good place to park!
This is awesome. Very cool set up!
do you have to get a special permit for it?? like to tow it, do they make you have some kind of road worthiness test or can you just send it. you can get away with alot of shit in ski towns ive seen it all
I‚Äôd do bunk beds and make more floor space
Need a tv and dvd collection for nights and off days
Idk how much money is an issue but a old RV or school bus you can get pretty cheap and take your time building it and you can make that bitch nice. With separate rooms and kitchen and indoor bathroom and shower.  I see school buses on MP that ppl have started building and for some reason stopped. But you might be able to find a half built one to
‚Ä¶ 69? :)
Brilliant!
Wow!!!
Dudes rock
Good for you üëäüòé
Dude this is like the fuckin coolest shit ever.
So sick, one of the reasons a truck my be my next vehicle ü´£
National Forest around bighorns 4 smaller mountains in a 3hr radius
Can I join? I ride and blaze.
This is so freaking dope. You guys should be vlogging on social media. You‚Äôd get followers and sponsors etc of a little funding would help the cause.
If you make it down to carson pass/kirkwood area, you can park in blue lakes road lot. You will need to purchase a sno-park psss online.  $50
This looks like Silver Creek in Utah

Shitters full!
A newish 5 x 10 single-axle trailer on my local Craigslist is $2,500.¬† You could probably find a used one for less than $1,000.¬† I would use different sheathing than they used.¬† Their sheathing looks like generic plywood.¬† Marine grade would be better, T1-11 would be best.¬† T1-11 is sheathing/siding in one and about $50 a panel.¬† That plywood is going to degrade fast exposed like that.¬†¬†


For the frame, I would go with 2 x 6, but sideways so the wall would be 1.5 width.¬† 2 x 4s on edge for the rafters.¬†¬†


Doors and windows can be found for cheap.¬†¬†


Foam board insulation would be the most effective.¬†¬†


Most of the materials could be picked up at a reseller of used and donated building materials.¬† Habitat for Humanity has resell stores that would be perfect for finding most of the materials.¬†¬†


I would definitely use building straps and ties.¬† You would want the roof to have the strength to carry heavy loading from snow.¬† But you should also clear the snow off the roof regularly to reduce loading stress.


Depending on how thrifty you are, you could probably build a similar setup for less than $3,000.
I‚Äôd assume these guys have no money in the trailer

On their person at all times
Probably somewhere between $5 and $25,000 if my math is mathing, but check back later for more math
well i‚Äôm towing it behind a 2009 taco with RWD.. so not excellent. averaging 9mpg. the current storm in the sierras is making anything above 25mph almost impossible, near whiteout conditions
THEY‚ÄôRE OUTNUMBERED 15 TO ONE, AND THE BATTLE'S BEGUN
it‚Äôs for shredding pow
From the Nitro Quiver range. Think it‚Äôs the Pow model from a few years ago
Logo looks like Donek, hard to see though
Fr!! OP please get one. I knew some guys who almost died when the snow blocked their exhaust in the night. Gotta be safe!
It‚Äôs gonna dump tonight though, might get stuck. I worked at boreal, and we would snow mobile back there. 

Can‚Äôt you just stay at Boreal Parking  lot? I‚Äôve definitely spent night in my car there before when the roads were shit.
I have definitely stayed in lot there.
Bro you got a Christmas tree in the truck bed? Wtf is that üòÜüòÜüòÜ. This rocks.
Incognito
The glove is a smart idea.
Baseball bat for intruders, I like it xD
I could smell this photo lol but it‚Äôs cool as fuck! Be safe out there Brody
Cozy
I just wanna know how the bat doesn‚Äôt knock other stuff off the wall while you‚Äôre driving
[deleted]
That stove is awesome, ~~but please tell me you have a fire extinguisher and CO monitor. If not, please get ASAP. Might save your lives.~~ well done lads, may the snow bunnies be rich and plentiful
How stoked were you when the door fit
baseball mitt shelf?
Baby woodstove is cool af. But get yourself a diesel heater. Set the thermostat and enjoy.
Damn, that'd be a cold ass shower.  Sick setup though.
Aren‚Äôt you afraid that someone‚Äôs going to yoink your water heater?

Also, you should post this to /r/overlanding
Thank you for sharing!
Is that your senior year photo? Pretty sweet! üôè
Rad little setup and cozy home decor haha, sick ü§ôüèº
And the crutches and meds to prove you really are a snowboarder!!!
Incredible
My 14 year old daughter has the exact same snuggie
This guy rolling a cigarette on the back porch/tailgate in a snuggie is the coolest motherfucker in town.
Nice
this may be the best picture i‚Äôve ever seen lol
You guys are nuts!
Do you have a snapped ACL by any chance üòÇ?
F‚Äôing loved my Rome Agent man. Had 2 of them. I‚Äôm getting wistful. 

Great setup. Good on you for making it happen. Keep on trucking
This is definitely one of those pictures that gets passed around the living room after Thanksgiving dinner in 30-40 years.  Iconic.
TG ftw
Careful there! Those RWD tacos will give your stomach the beats. What kinda sauce you running in that bad boy?
Jebus 

Are you making a stop every 100 miles for a $50 tank of gas?
What kind of speed you driving on the highway in normal conditions? Your roof has got to be built to FL hurricane code.
Lol
Yep that‚Äôs exactly what it is, i have that same board
got a fire extinguisher, smoke detector, and CO detector
We need answers,‚Ä¶ do they set it up at each stop & decorate?
Put a sock over the bat, if a ‚Äúplayer‚Äù grabs it- they end up with the sock and you still have your bat ‚öæÔ∏èüß¢
No glove, no love.
Comment killed me from outta left field lol
No, officer!  We play baseball. See, I have a glove.
Man, if you struggled with that knot in the heat of it, you‚Äôd be praying the intruder stays in range
Bug zapper
[removed]
he‚Äôs got both in the other photo
First thing I spotted in the first picture.
So eager to be a know it all that you don‚Äôt even look at the picture you‚Äôre being condescending about üôÑüôÑ
The red thing is an on demand water heater, I believe. 
They will boil ice water before it reaches the outlet. That thing definitely makes a warm shower
So does ne 13 yr old nephew! Small world.
He fucked my mom. Wife too.
looks that way
Nothing like old top gear
If he‚Äôs in the Sierra there ain‚Äôt no $50 tank of gas anywhere. Our gas is still around $6
Right on, in that case have fun my man!
This guy baseballs
Wow.40 years on this planet and the nuggets of wisdom keep coming.
I love the famous sock on my bat video! Lol
What if they grab it a second time?
It's on an open hook it's resting on so the string stays on for the whole at bat!

For real, that does look like the first tennis racket I had, and broke, in the mid 80s. 

Not saying he stole it, repaired it, and was just posting it here to fuck with me, but I can‚Äôt rule it out either.
I think they were maybe just referring to showering outside in the middle of winter with snow on the ground, even with warm water I‚Äôd imagine that would be cold af still lol.
I‚Äôm curious what the sensation of a hot shower in an ice cold breeze
He smokes while huffing gas
Except majority of it being staged and bs
Good gods
Never seen one out here in the snow lol.
Yeah the lack of curtain raises all sorts of *other* questions lol

My main two being: 
Wind?
Privacy?
So? That's pretty obvious. It's still hilarious and way better than current top gear.
Mountain + California prices. No fun
Still‚Ä¶them thars *volcanoes* out there. Prob best just to be safe.
Oh my god forget the privacy part, I didn‚Äôt even think about the wind. Imagine freezing cold wind blowing snow and ice on you as you‚Äôre standing outside in the freezing cold naked and soaking wet lmfao. That sounds absolutely miserable haha.
True.  My main mountain is part of a long dormant super volcano.  But on the bright side you get natural hot springs and you get to learn a bunch of [fascinating geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Valley_Caldera).
Ha! For sure. I love the geology of the west!

My pops is a meteorologist who studied geology and would regale us with lessons as we road tripped through Colorado, Utah, NM, and Wyoming as kids. We never did get to the coast with him, but I‚Äôve been able to as an adult more than a few times and dear god, it‚Äôs like the closer you look the more there is.

Didn‚Äôt know that about your neck of the wood, thanks!

Aimpoint T2 w/Scalarworks mount is great, the iron sights feel like they were made to sit on a HB
A nice flashlight wouldn‚Äôt hurt but that‚Äôs your calls. Love the blue man.
I have an insatiable Kevin Brittingham fetish.
The honey badger is so sexy. Plus I love that you hung a Holosun off of $4000 worth of gun/silencer.
If I remember right the non traditional q color options are blem but honestly the blue is a vibe in itself. Wish they offered more options like this.
That‚Äôs awesome looking
Light and a sling
I need that grip , jeez. Did you have the factory one stippled or does someone sell them that way ?
I've had my eye on the blue badger for a minute now, nice setup!
dang looks nice
This and the wasabi are my two favorite non-clear anodize options they've put out.
They are nice but do you think they are worth the cost vs building your own ?
Nice piece of kit
Is that burst mode?
Where tf can I get one?
Okay I like that color combo‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm building a 300blk currently and I‚Äôd recommend a cloud defensive rein 3.0 it‚Äôs insanely bright and for a handstop id recommend the emissary development handbrake¬†
I have the two items I recommend on my 556 16‚Äù build and they‚Äôre fantastic¬†
The handbrake really lets you crank down on the front of the gun for leverage so you don‚Äôt have as much muzzle rise¬†
If you go with the rein 3.0 I‚Äôd also recommend the trex light bar mount it‚Äôs 4‚Äù long and really helps push the light forward so you don‚Äôt get occluded by the can and also has a slight offset from the rail for clearance of the light bevel so you don‚Äôt have contact between the light and can¬†
Is this q "changing the game" again?
whatever else you say about them, Q has some amazing aesthetics
Kung fu grip on a 2800 rifle?? What a madman. I mean i respect it but madman nonetheless
That‚Äôs gorgeous.
I also like the green honey badger
That's gorgeous.
That blue is chef kiss
Thought I was in /r/plebianar
Man. That holosun just doesn‚Äôt do it on that setup ü§£

Also to the OP I don‚Äôt understand why folks put Eotechs on Honey Badgers. You take one of the lightest ARs on the market and put one of the heaviest optics on there. I think a Holosun SCRS would be perfect for this. It‚Äôs extremely lightweight,  enclosed, gives you that Holosun dot, long battery life, and made specifically for PDWs. And the absolutely best pick is the 4T-Pro as it has everything previously mentioned plus the 4 reticles that are absolutely perfect for 300 blk
Are those Jim Green / Q collab  Chanklas?
I need a pair.
How do you like that hand stop?
I wish those pink bags weren't so expensive.
How do you like the SR? Do you have any other 22 cans to compare to?
What suppressor cover is that? I have the same light mount but can‚Äôt fit a light on it with my BPG cover.
Gay pride month isn‚Äôt until June!
Give pasta
It's like hanging fuzzy dice in a Bentley and I love it.
That dot is great tho
Serious question, got ripped apart last time for this lol. If all your ever gonna do is shoot paper with it whats the reason to put a more expensive optic on it? If you‚Äôre just shooting paper a few times a week the Holosun will be just as good as the Eotech. At least I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference between my two for light use.
‚ú®aesthetic‚ú®
what holosun is that? You'd hate the cheap holo dot I've got on my AK hah. They are some of my nicest pistol dots too.
Kung Fu grip by Die Free Co.
It‚Äôs very short. And the cut out maybe bothersome. You‚Äôve been warned üòÇ
You just need a fleshlight, G sling and discreet ballistics ammo.
The wasabi indeed goes hard. Accepting donations if you want a picture of both color ways together‚Ä¶
To each their own. This post will most likely attract the kevin/q haters but I enjoy the gun. I wanted one in a different color than usual so the Allen Arms Tactical & Q collaboration caught my eye instantly.
Definitely build your own
Building > Buying in most cases. Even having the tools involved in building will increase your maintenance performance.
Its engraved in the lower just for looks unfortunately
Agreed. Great aesthetics and terrible brand image.
I mean it's the exact same price as a Magpul grip?
I like my Kungfu grips more than my Drivenarms CO grips and those are basically one of the Gucci-est grips you can get ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I got all kind of grips at this point from your basic bitch A2 to the Reptilia, Drivenarms, Emissary, BCM, B5, MAGPUL, even got Larue meme ass grip and the Kungfu is the best feeling grip to me

Half of my bro SWAT team running Kungfu grips on their CQB rigs too. It is the future babyyy
I mean, are you running some premium gold plated AR grips on your more expensive rifles?
I mean spending more than $44 on a grip is outrageous. And that‚Äôs at the tipppy top for a driven arms
Ehhh‚Ä¶I would say it‚Äôs like throwing some old BBS styled wheels on a newer 911. It‚Äôs functional and looks good to some but there‚Äôs better modern options out there.
Kill it with fire.
Yup they are. Matching my blue honey badger
I like it better than a VFG, that‚Äôs what I had on first and changed to this one. It‚Äôs almost exactly the same size as the handguard and still have a little space at the end where I can rest on barricade
Mine came free with the gun
Love it.  I do not, in fact I got the Mark4 and a rifle just to run the SR.
u/SWaller89
I made it, send me a message for info!
How do you know how this person identifies üòÇüëÄ
You‚Äôll find that level of snobbery in every hobby.  

Throwing Rota wheels on a 991 Porsche?  You‚Äôre getting some flak.

Amazon rubber strap on a Rolex Milgauss?  Head for the hills.

Etc etc
> If all your ever gonna do is shoot paper with it whats the reason to put a more expensive optic on it?

Because not everyone just wants to shoot paper or plink. Which then flips the hatred the other way; if you actually train TTPs and buy equipment to withstand hard use, you're a LARPer. 

Don't try at all and just buy stuff for fun? Cringe. Train hard and prepare yourself? Cringe. It's just cringe all the way down now, according to the internet.
I just thought it was funny not criticizing. I have a holosun 510C on my Scorpion.
People just like to hate. Great dot imo. I prefer the AEMS.
It‚Äôs them trying to justify an unjustifiable purchase, honestly. To make one feel better about it
I just thought it was funny not criticizing. I have the same holosun 510C on my Scorpion.
how do you like it? 

first thing that caught my eye (beside the blue ano/cerakote)

I have Magpul K grips on pretty much everything that I can put one on lol
I like my Wilson Combat starburst grips. The rest of the ones I have are magpul because they are easy to get my hands on. Might have to check out the Kung Fu grips tho.
You just compare a holosun to BBS?
What handstop
Is this a new color combo they're doing? I hadn't seen it before today.
Tbf, only time I‚Äôve ever seen Milgauss in the wild are on salesfolks‚Äô wrists..
No no I understand the humor lol I just never understood the hate!
You didn‚Äôt properly comprehend my post. I said BBS styled wheels‚Ä¶as in a cheaper alternative. I didn‚Äôt mention knockoff because I don‚Äôt want that term associated with Holosun either. Also my second point is that wheel styling doesn‚Äôt belong on a new 911 either. Some like it though.
The Strike Industries LINK-CFG
They do limited runs of different cerakote or colored anodizing. The blue one is cerakote and the green one is anodized I believe if I‚Äôm not mistaken
You right. I missed ‚Äùstyle‚Äù. Agree
Got my brakes done, then heard a grinding noise
How should I approach the shop who did the work? There was the torx bit grinding into my wheel and a missing retaining clip on my caliper. Do I try to get them to replace the clip and the wheel?

Treat them the way you would want to be treated if you made a mistake at your job. This isn‚Äôt okay but we are all people. If they deny or don‚Äôt help you then it‚Äôs time to get upset. If they offer you compensation and help I think that‚Äôs fair.
I've had a shop ruin all 4 of my wheels. Go in with a calm head. Ask for the manager. Say you're satisfied with the work except for the part where the bit was left and gouged the wheel. Show the pictures, wait for them to make it right. 

One wheel is easier to cover than four. When they fix the issue, thank them and continue to be a loyal customer if you so desire to do so. People fuck up. We have all done it. What sets other companies above others is the desire to make a customer happy no matter what
UPDATE: I'm at the shop now and they said my tire didn't blow up so it should be fine. They're saying no to replacing it. They said " I drove it for several days before noticing it" and the wheel did not fall apart and my tire is not flat, so no damage was done.

That should not be the logic applied here.

UPDATE 2: The mechanic who looked at the vehicle got his tool returned to him. He said the tool looks fine so the wheel must be fine.

 The torx bit is made of a harder material than the wheel is, it would make sense that the tool took less damage than the wheel.

UPDATE 3: They put it on the lift. Said the wheel wasn't damaged. Refused to replace the clip and refused to give me physical documentation that they declined replacements of any damaged and missing parts. Also refused to produce a written statement that the vehicle is safe to drive.
No matter how small a job, even brakes/lube service, time & care must be taken into consideration so customers don‚Äôt have to deal with this! I drill this into my brain everyday I open my tool box! Hopefully they compensate you for this! Also, the caliper retaining clip is missing! Mention that lol
The issue is they forgot the retaining clip on the caliper
You'd think they would have heard that on their test drive...
I was a service advisor for 28+ years. In situations like this, I like to immediately appease, the customers wants and needs, and then offer some other incentive to come back. If this happened in one of my shops, I would replace the rim immediately, And then give you your next couple of oil changes/tire rotations on the house. Replacing the rim is the bare minimum, and a couple of free service visits gives us the opportunity to show you that it was a one time thing, and that we want to earn your business again.
Why does OP get so many downvotes??
Go into the shop manager‚Äôs desk and plunk the bit down. 

‚ÄúYour guy left this inside my wheel and it‚Äôs scratched to hell now.‚Äù 

If he‚Äôs not cooperative at that point, mention a lawyer.
The elusive t30, basically the 10mm of european cars

I read quite a few replies. I say most are FOS! There is no going back and being ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù with this. That is a load of horse $4!T. This dude left a freaking tool in your brakes. This is a life saving system of your vehicle. This guys could have killed you. Any other profession on this planet would absolutely fire this freaking hack. Not only should they replace the damaged components. They should also fire this nightmare of a mechanic, they should also pay you an hourly rate for the time it takes you to get it fixed, and a rental car until it is made right. If a surgeon left a tool in your chest, should he not be fired? Is he not liable for financial compensation? I would raise a complete shitstorm and take that shop out so they don‚Äôt kill anybody with their hack work.
You just got a free wheel!
Just be real w them and be respectful and tell them you did not bring the car in this condition so you‚Äôd like to be made whole. Either professional wheel repair, or a new wheel.
The audacity to complaint about getting free tools
I have been a service manager for over 40yrs. We never like seeing this. But the old saying. SHIT HAPPENS. Techs are human and make mistakes. Not very often thankfully. Go back to the shop and ask to talk to the service manager or the actual shop manager. Remember to be polite. You get more positive results when your polite. Tell them what happened. Show them the torx bit. I am sure the tech is going to say he left it there by accident. They will want to put your car on the rack and pull the wheel to check the damage. If you had brakes done on just one end. Ask to have them check both sides to be sure everything is OK. Or all 4 if you had brakes all around. Tell them you won't feel safe until everything is looked at. The damage on the wheel. I would ask them to have the wheel replaced. A used wheel in like condition would be sufficient. A new wheel is not necessary. I have dealt with this very same situation in my years. They may say the damage is superficial. Which it is not that bad. But it did not go in there that way. And the techs mistake caused the damage. Hopefully they take care of you professionally.
Looks like they didn't replace or resurface the rotors. You can clearly see it riding the edges of the contact surface.
This shop did a terrible job.
God damn you got Mickey Moused.
Yes 100% this isn't even an expensive duck up. It could have been the whole engine. If they are a reputable shop they will eat it and yell at the tech for .5 sec and then get on with there day.
Oh there it is
I would show them these pictures, and yes, i would expect them to replace the damaged/missing parts
[deleted]
‚ÄúI‚Äôll give the tool back if I get a new rim‚Äù
One hell of a record player
We are all human it only takes a moment to do something like that. As others have said go in calm give them a chance at first if they don't want to do anything about it or get rude then it's time to be one of those customers and take it as far as needed.
make a new update post with ur recent interactions with the shop so its less clustered and u can get more useful advice
You need a new wheel courtesy of the shop who left that extended torx/allen looking tool jammed up in there
I would call the shop and ask the manger if a tech is missing a torx bit... Then see if they can send someone out with a jack and lug wrench to get it out, driving with it in isn't a great idea.  Then go from there....

And I was a mechanic for 20 years, whoever left it in there does deserve to get yelled at for a bit...
I mean I get what people are saying about being understanding and all, but its your car. Not only is it the one thing you rely on to get you from point a to point b, but you're not the only person on the road.
You were extremely lucky these errors were easy to identify. You need to hold them accountable and have them redo the job( and fix whatever damage their tool caused). You don't get to mess up like that when it comes to a brake job.
Take that tool as compensation for the damage
Wow.  Just wow
Is no one going to mention that caliper is on backwards and missing bolts? Don't drive the car have some one come and fix them in your driveway or hell do them yourself!!
Be as confrontational as possible. Take some of your buddies with you. Threaten to brutally beat the shit out of the people who worked on your car.
This is the only language mechanics understand.
If they sense weakness they will fuck you over
Free torx bit socket? I'd chock this up as a win.
Apparently, your brake job was performed by an off duty LEO who was working a second job to earn money to cover up for any officers  that were born out of wedlock (See ACAB- AllCopsAreBastards?) .
Since not all cops are mechanics but some mechanics are cops, letting them off with a stern warning should be sufficient. ((In addition to court costs and a new wheel) . Good luck and remember if your brakes squeal like a pig. STOP
Go in and ask for manager or service advisor. Bring the pictures in and show them what you found. Be polite but absolutely firm on the fact that you would like the brakes redone and your wheel replaced. DO NOT let them try to fix the wheel or say they can send it off and get fixed. That bit looks like it did some significant damage and i wouldn't completely trust it anymore. I'm not saying it will break tomorrow but overtime with a hard enough jolt it could break that rim or crack it then you would be responsible for getting a new one. If they do nothing or do not fully remedy it, do not argue with them, just leave and contact an attorney. After the brakes are redone however i would have someone you know or another shop check their work to make sure everything was fixed properly. Whoever worked on your vehicle does not seem to know what they are doing.
What was he using that for? Pushing the piston back?
I just put some new wheels on, and the disc shield rubbed the rim and made a groove. I fixed the shield and touched up the paint on the inside of the wheel. Do you think that rim is structurally comprised?
If you're on the fence, don't say anything. If you cared about your car/your rims, you would be livid and not even posting this. You would have gone back and ripped someone's head off, like a man. Be here you are, complaining, like a bitch.
There is nothing wrong with the wheel. Keep the socket, ask the shop for some free service in the future. Move on.
I‚Äôd put it back in the tire and drive until that tire popped, then I‚Äôd crash it and sue them!!!!
Yes and yes.
You really *scored* on this one.
Take that man his bit back lol
Extra brakes
That escalated quickly
Thank God that tech didn't lose his 10mm socket...
Bahahahaha!!!! 

Love to see it 

But I feel bad for you op. Get cho money back
That‚Äôs where that went
So what happened
I‚Äôm surprised you got all the way home, if it grinded when leaving the shop I would have turned right back around
If I had a guy come in all guns blazing because one of my boys made a mistake.

I'd calmy explain. we will fix it and try and calm him down. If he is hot talking about lawyers and still going on, I'd show him the door. 

Insurance isn't that expensive.
When people say getting high at work doesn't affect their performance show them this.
"Hey  did anyone lose a torx bit for an impact driver when working on my car?"

Yes? Cool, because heres what it did..
Honestly, I wouldn't even bother taking it back to the same garage, what are they going to do, better? No.

Find someone qualified to do it this time; buy cheap, buy twice.
i‚Äôd take it back just like that and demand a refund it could‚Äôve potentially killed u or caused a wreck
Idk man, that retaining clip seems like it hasnt been there for quite some time and those rotors looks like its been there for more than the drive from the shop to your house.
Just don‚Äôt be a jerk about it and treat them with respect and usually things work out pretty well.
That's where that went.
A free tool!
You walk into the shop holding it calm and happy, ask them if any techs are missing this? Don‚Äôt give them it though. Once you get a yes you then say, oh well you should come take a look at the damage it caused to my rim since it is yours. Can‚Äôt deny at that point
Mistakes happen
How should you approach? "Excuse me, are you guys missing a torx bit extension?" 

Actually yeah!

"Well, do I have a story for you that you won't like."
You may first want to go to another completely independent place to ask what the damage and repair costs would be. They can serve as a witness if need be. 

Go to the repair place and calmly explain what you heard and what you found. Ask what they need to do make this correct for you. If you‚Äôre happy with the response let them make the repair. If not go to the competitor and get it fixed and take them to small claims court. 

Also ask how someone could have left the bit in the break.  For the life of me I can‚Äôt imagine how this happened.
That's a Snap-On bit.   Worth about $250...
Get your money back and get a real mechanic to do the job!
Get your money back and get a real mechanic to do the job!
I mean, you took the car to have your brakes done. They forgot a tool after doing a repair. Due to the tool being left through the brake caliper, it cracked both your wheel AND your brake caliper. Both of which need to be replaced. 

They are 100% responsible for this, as neither the wheel nor caliper would be cracked if it wasn‚Äôt for their negligence. 

I would call them up and say hey, yesterday I had a brake job done by your shop and the technician left a tool diagonally through the brake caliper, which cracked both my wheel and brake caliper. My car is stuck on the side of the road now and I need you guys to make this right. That‚Äôs what I would do / and say as politely as I could. Be realistic with your expectations but also let them know what you‚Äôd like done. Don‚Äôt let them for a second act as if this is a direct result of their technician. 


If they refuse to own it or repair it, then I would sue them in small claims court. That‚Äôs all you can do
:0 holy fuck
Don‚Äôt pull it out take it in that way show them the mistake that was made. If you pull it out they may cough this up and try and blame it on you.  I would leave everything as is the wheel is toast at this rate driving with it a few more miles will not hurt anything at this point. Leaving it that way and have them find it the way it was left would be best.  That way they cough up and pay for it.
Clip yes but I doubt they will replace the wheel but seriously wtf who the F knowingly leaves a stuck driver in the brakes and gives the car back to the customer like wtf he didn‚Äôt have a magnet to fetch it like seriously. This happens no doubt but a normal tech would get it out before giving the car back smfh
Omg it was in the control/swing/A Arm not the brakes even lol wtf , thought it was a #3 at first not a torx but still regardless what it is how do u leave an extended long ass driver where u dropped it and say fuck it
I keep seeing more and more incompetent people doing work that is subpar and dangerous. Construction guys and mechanics especially it‚Äôs pretty scary . Guy obviously doesn‚Äôt give two shits about FOD . Give the shop the business
this feels like the equivalent of a surgeon accidentally leaving a sponge inside a patients body
I went to a reputable place with a logo man made out of tires for an oil change around 2017. After driving home and then leaving again to go somewhere I noticed a strong smell of oil. I pulled over and popped the hood and the engine oil cap was sitting unscrewed on top of whatever where they set it to fill the oil. Oil was sprayed all over under the hood. I didn‚Äôt think too deep about the issue which was a big mistake looking back on it as I screwed it back on and called them to complain. They never warned me about anything or told me to bring it back in. Not too long after that my engine went and I never put two and two together until years later. I don‚Äôt think I topped it off or anything, just screwed the cap back on, but knowing better now a days I realize how much oil was lost out driving it like that
Just go back and explain what you found. If you want to make them repair the rim. Definitely get your clip and just have them look everything back over. 30 year retired mechanic. We are human. They will take care of it.
something similar happened to me a few years ago.  brakes were done by the mechanic shop we always go to.  on my morning commute, something locked up my wheel(s) and I had to pull off to the side of the highway.  

I didn't see what caused the problem, but after getting the car towed, our mechanic said a nut from somewhere in the brake system worked loose and got jammed in the wheel somewhere. the owner of the shop apologized, confirmed responsibility, replaced the wheel, and fixed the issue.  we kept going to the shop until I switched jobs and starting working in a different area.  

treat them respectfully.  I would expect a reputable shop to make this right.  

if they refuse to fix this, then...find a way to escalate.
You done fucked yp
Yes you should get them do just as you said all in their pockets
The tool left in the wheel is only one problem. This is a pretty hack brake job. 

This was a pad slap. Hopefully they measured the rotors and they aren‚Äôt below minimum spec.

The anti-rattle springs are supposed to be replaced at every brake service. They reused them and then only installed one.

Zero effort to clean and lube the pad contact points.
Small shop or dealership?  Not really too much you can do about it.  But a dealership will make you whole a small shop well good luck
Huh, that's where that went.
I'd have them replace the rim and retaining clip depending what vehicle that is those alloy and aluminum rims can run you 1200 plus dollars if you can't find a nice used one
That tech has been driving themselves NUTS looking for that tool
I say they replace all 4 rims and the caliper that was affected at a minimum.
Sue the shop
Absolutely get them to remedy the situation.
They should replace both for sure. The damage is from negligence.
Oh sweet bonus tool
I'm pretty sure they put the caliper on backwards. Those holes are where it bolts to the knuckle. The hardware / spring clip should definitely be replaced so the pads don't drag. But I assume it was torn off when the caliper rubbed against the rolling wheel since it's not actually bolted in place.

I've put a pad on backwards before and realized as soon as I went to back it out of the bay. I've never put a caliper on backwards, I don't know how you'd make that mistake without have zero experience working on cars. So I would have them fix the issue since they owe you, then find another shop with competent techs.

Also am I really the first person to recognize the caliper is on backwards? Damn...
In Germany we say ACH DU SCHEISSE !!
Looks like that grinding noise went on for a long time
A torx socket with the entendio bendio!?‚ÄîMY TOOL NOW (Daquan Loco voice)
I‚Äôm not a mechanic but even to me it look like the brakes are not there like at all
It‚Äôs missing the clamp to hold it in place
Free Torx bit?
Free tool
Call credit card company and deny charge
Personally, id document with pictures (which you already did) and then Bring it back saying you hear a grinding noise.

If they tell you the truth and offer to fix the problem/replace the wheel, then great. Someone made a mistake and they fixed it. And I‚Äôd probably keep going there

But if they lie to you and tell you they just cleaned some dirt from a rotor or some other bs you know they can‚Äôt be trusted.    Hit um with the ‚Äúso I guess it had nothing to do with the tool that was jammed into the wheel destroying the inside?‚Äù


But you do you. I like to give people the opportunity to lie to me.
Those brakes don't look recently done. Are you sure they replaced pads and turned or replaced rotors??
4th photo is strangely and artistically beautiful. Like a study on rims.
Tell them to fix what they broke. Simple. Another wheel and replace what‚Äôs missing. Simple fix‚Ä¶
We all make mistakes, so I would approach in a respectful manner to start. If they screw around, let them have it.
Looks like the shop owes you a a new wheel.
They should replace the brake pad and rotors for free and then check the wheels if it has a deep enough groove that could be a potential spot for crack if you hit a pot hole . I am not everyone but I would as a shop bite the bullet and buy new wheels and obviously new pad and rotors. and depending on the situation I would be hiring a new employee
Ngl thats pretty damn funny, and im sure the mechanic would gladly rectify the mistake for his torx bit back.
Did you drive away before they finish the job? Who told you that the job was donne?
Someone‚Äôs getting a new wheel
Bonus! üéà
People forget, just like surgeons sometimes leave stuff inside the bodies that they operate on.
Wow. Did you go to the junior high Mechanic shop?
Didn't hurt that torx one bit tho.
Let the service advisor know. Usually, they would offer to fix said issue even the wheel.
Yeah, that's not right
Absolutely
...how...
New wheel for sure
‚ÄúWhere tf my torx go??

Ah fuck it‚Äôll turn up‚Äù
Dam‚Ä¶ mistakes happen. Any good tech would feel so bad if this happened to them. Go talk to the shop be cordial and they should make it right. If not sadly it‚Äôs gonna have to get ugly over a mistake we have probably all done but didn‚Äôt result in damage.
Any decent shop would rectify that
Bruh they should give you new wheels for that
Insist on a new wheel, that one can easily blow apart.
There is literally thousands of pounds of force trying to separate the wheel at that score from the air pressure in the tire.
Make sure it‚Äôs not the back side of your rotor (the side you can‚Äôt see)
New rims, you say
Small claims
Hey! Free torx bit! Score now you can do your own brakes
Those aren‚Äôt new at all. Retainer Clip is missing. 
Go back immediately, get them to rectify the clip and if your money back. Mechanics like that ruin it for the good ones.
Oh I‚Äôd be pissed yes and try not to be to mean but still be mean enough to get the point across while still being respectful
Honestly, it's amazing how few people realise this. We had a nurse during covid who, through a shit turn of events, blew his engine, and it wasn't under warranty. Due to it being the peak of covid and him being a nurse, our AWESOME manager pulled a few strings (lied) and got it under warranty pending a signature. We thought it was only right to help him out cus of his job and lock down...

Then he came in, and before the manager could even explain that it was now a warranty job, 
pending signature dude went absolutely off at us. Bear in mind it was just recovered. We hadn't worked on it prior or caused the blow, so we'd done nothing wrong.The managerr finally got a word in and dude went off even more and started shouting how he wasn't signing shit etc...

Offer of warranty pending signature was then withdrawn, and he was given a near 6k bill for engine replacement.

If only he'd spoken to us like people...
100%
I have more trust in someone who fixes their mistakes than someone who says they don't make mistakes...
A level headed person. That‚Äôs refreshing.
best answer i've read so far !
This is my approach to all customer service issues. I'm nice and understanding at first and if they fix the issue then great. If not, then the gloves come off and things get ugly.
They told him to go fuck himself

This, this is beautiful
Good advice. I had a shop not tighten my drain plug after an oil change and I went in to talk to them and they accepted full responsibility and got me a new (used) engine.
[deleted]
So I‚Äôm perfect then. I would absolutely treat them exactly how I would be treated if I did the same. Pull that hack out in the parking lot and stomp a mud hole in his stupid ass.
The comment of a wise man
Yea new clip and a new rim.
Think Deeder, be sweeter.
I'd apply that to minor non life threatening mistakes. Now if it's something that could've killed you, a slap on the wrist will only prolong a tragedy.
You're not wrong. But this is completely unsafe and un professional. If you can't remember to put in a total of 4 bolts and one retaining clip you shouldn't be a mechanic. If you don't check your work. You shouldn't be a mechanic. You do this on a brake job. The mother or all gravy, keep of thy beer stash, and replenisher of my food. 

You don't fuck around with safety, and you sure a fuck don't mess with the graaaavy.
This is the way
I agree with you. Be kind towards costumer-manager or what its called. But at the same time this is a result of overstressed work enviroment and/or the new guy at the shop with little experience. That caliper glider pin is not torx but hex 7 or 9mm. Have never seen ATE glider pins be torx head.
Based.
True that
That's the best way any human being could have put it, are you a physicist ?
# ARE YOU A PHILOSOPHER BRO!?!?
Understandable
To this I would add, setting your expectation/preference for how you‚Äôd like it made right can help things go more smoothly. Eg: they might prefer to refund the entire labor bill for the repair and let you go find a new wheel, or choose to live with it, etc:  you might prefer they find the wheel, mount & balance the tire and give you back your car just like you dropped it off + the work you paid for. So just tell them what you want rather than ‚Äúthis happened, what‚Äôre you gonna do to make it right?‚Äù
Would this apply to aviation mechanics? I don‚Äôt think so, same principle. If you do decide to go back I would specifically let them know I don‚Äôt want that tech working on my car unless someone checks behind them.
This is fucked. It‚Äôs time to speak with confidence, conviction, and really put the hammer down. ‚ÄúListen, you guys made a mistake, you damaged my property, and now you don‚Äôt want to make me whole for the property damage that you caused? Sounds like a lot of liability for such a small inconvenience to you and your shop. I want a new wheel, the retaining clip installed correctly, and I don‚Äôt care that you ‚Äòthink there‚Äôs no damage done.‚Äô And your argument that I ‚Äòdrove it for several days before noticing it‚Äô is null and inconsequential. I took my car to a repair shop that‚Äôs supposed to be licensed, insured, and capable of professional repairs so I don‚Äôt have to do it myself. That is quite literally what I paid you to do. You didn‚Äôt hold up your end of the bargain. Fix this now before it becomes a bigger issue.‚Äù

Hope this helps OP. Any manager with more than a few brain cells should figure out it‚Äôs easier to just get the new wheel than deal with this.

Source: I‚Äôve (regretfully) had to do this 4 or 5 times in my life and since grown tired of incompetence. I do all my own work now.
Damn they‚Äôre not replacing the wheel?? Bruh
Defamation only occurs if telling a lie.
make them put all that in writing.

that the tool was theirs, that they removed it, that they inspected the wheel, and that they declared it safe.

&#x200B;

If they arent willing to do that, they need to replace the wheel
Do these fools have any idea what could happen to their online reputation if you were to expose their name here on reddit?
Damn op that sucks. Really hope you get taken care of. If it where me I wouldn't settle for anything less than a new wheel.

And honestly I probably wouldn't even want the work done there anymore if they're that shady. I'd take it elsewhere and have them pay the bill.
If they won‚Äôt cooperate report them to your state‚Äôs department of transportation and submit a complaint. They‚Äôll get investigated by the state and hit hard with fines
Call your local chamber of commerce and report this.
Good catch on that clip!
Then the job should pay for that, everyone thinks it's just a flews bolts u take off and replace a sensor/part
That was my first thought as well
*The issue is they*

*Forgot the retaining clip*

They also forgot they left a torx bit socket in between his wheel one of the reasons I like to work on my own car.
Thank you for your insight
Seems like this guy is lying
Nah. 
‚ÄúHey, so I didn‚Äôt get too far and I heard a noise, so I investigated and looks like one of your techs might be wondering where he left a certain socket: (show photos). ‚ÄúI understand mistakes happen, but unfortunately the wheel is pretty badly damaged, so I‚Äôd like it if you‚Äôd go ahead and replace the wheel for me.‚Äù If you maintain a pleasant tone of voice and demeanor and seem reasonable, and understanding, often times people will meet your same energy level. 

The angry attitude would likely result in a debate about how much a scratch on the inside of a wheel is even worth, etc.  Also don‚Äôt underestimate that if you‚Äôre a dick, they might be thrilled to lose your business.  Also consider, is this a corporate shop? Does the service manger give a shit to lose you as a client? 

Be nice. Be understanding. Clearly communicate the problem and what you expect to have done about it. Most times if your ask is reasonable you‚Äôll be accommodated.  If you KNOW you gave benefit of the doubt and were pleasant and calm and you get a bad response then you‚Äôre fully cleared to go at them with a lawyer full force.  Typically though - photos like this and a receipt in small claims is all it takes if it gets so far.
>If he‚Äôs not cooperative at that point, mention a lawyer.

Depending on the business, the moment you mention legal representation the staff are trained to shut down all communications and let their legal team know to expect a letter.  

9/10 the customer won't bother.
Seems aggressive. Would you like to be sued if you made a mistake. Or would you like to be givin a chance to help and fix your mistake? I think it would be more received if you say we have a problem. This is what I found. What are we going to do?
Specifically which lawyer should he mention? "Morgan and Morgan for the people" perhaps? No injury occurred and you cant sue for what "could have happened". This is a small claims court situation at best. Threats get you no where.
Hate people like you. Top comment is way better.
Slow down Karen. For starters you dont have a lawyer on retainer. Secondly f*ck you with a rusty torx bit. Thirdly any chain franchise or dealer within a group actually does have a legal team or department and now instead of talking face to face with a human you will be forwarded to a phone number/email. No one caves at ‚Äúim gonna call my lawyer!‚Äù ‚Ä¶this isnt network tv and 99.999999999% of companies tell you to not say another word on behalf of the company once the lawyer card is thrown out.
They might not be cooperative. At the same time that I got the brakes done, I also got 2 injectors replaced. Picked up the car the next day and I tried to get them to explain to me why they were charging me 4 hours to replace the injectors.

In short, their response was, " how can you, who isn't a mechanic, tell us how long the work is supposed to take"

I just thought that I'll never bring my car back to them, but now I have this issue

UPDATE: Official labor standard for the injectors is 1hr for one, or 1.2 hrs for all.
lol, no
Easiest way to get told to pound sand right here don‚Äôt go in like an uncivilized prick.
T40*
Get it inspected and fixed elsewhere and take them to small claims court for both damage and the cost of ensuring your vehicle was safe. 

You have enough photo proof and with the right documentation from a third party you'll recoup your losses without fail. 

Brakes and wheels are the most important thing on a car. Your life rides on them. Don't take a chance with it for your and others safety. 

If they can't hold themselves responsible then you have too through the legal system.
They refused recompense, refused to give me a statement in writing to detail the that they refused to replace the wheel and clip, they also refused to give me written documentation that the wheel is safe to drive on.
Repost of updates

UPDATE: I'm at the shop now and they said my tire didn't blow up so it should be fine. They're saying no to replacing it. They said " I drove it for several days before noticing it" and the wheel did not fall apart and my tire is not flat, so no damage was done.

That should not be the logic applied here.

UPDATE 2: The mechanic who looked at the vehicle got his tool returned to him. He said the tool looks fine so the wheel must be fine.

 The torx bit is made of a harder material than the wheel is, it would make sense that the tool took less damage than the wheel.

UPDATE 3: They put it on the lift. Said the wheel wasn't damaged. Refused to replace the clip and refused to give me physical documentation that they declined replacements of any damaged and missing parts. Also refused to write a written statement saying that the vehicle is safe to drive.
[deleted]
They denied any recompense and refused to provide documentation that the vehicle wheel was safe to drive on and refuse to provide a written record of their refusal to replace the wheel and the clip.
It‚Äôs Gearwrench, not Snap On. :(
It's...it's not backwards...or missing bolts...it IS however, missing the pad retaining clip.
I know a few mechanics who would break your jaw if you disrespected them let alone raised your voice and threatened them with violence. You‚Äôd be surprised how many ex military members end up turning wrenches when they get out ü§£
It was used to remove the Bolts on the caliper to gain access to the brake pads
The bit was pressed against the wheel pretty firmly, I'm no expert on wheels,but the groove is just a tad to deep to pass as purely cosmetic
silence pion
Except that massive stress riser that bit just machined into the rim. I bet that groove is 1/3 of the way through the barrel of that wheel. It‚Äôs a ticking time bomb.
The shop was about 150 miles from my destination (NYC), I immediately hit the interstate as soon as I got my car back. I didn't hear anything until I got to lower speeds. My dumb ass thought they must have bent the metal guard behind the rotor into the rotor bc if they just did pads, what else could it really be? I called around to get it looked at but every shop required an appointment and they were all booked days out. So I couldn't get it on a lift until after I left the city and driving approx 300 miles total.

I didn't think it was a concern bc I thought it was just the shield behind the rotor, which isn't a big deal if it scrapes the rotor, I was on a time crunch so I figured I would just bend it back once I got home.
That‚Äôs GearWrench..it is literally engraved.
I cut my teeth in aviation at 19. Most other industries don't push tool control the same way. Lose a 10mm, well you got 19 more in your box, so who cares. 

I'm in manufacturing maintenance now. And the amount of lost tools I see needing to be replaced would give a maintenance controller a heart attack.
Small shop.
Devil's advocate (because I really do support treating all employees nicely)...

Maybe being the peak of covid was the reason he was at his limit. I would have taken that as a sign that he probably needs the help even more so I would have done it anyways I think. The only bad outcome would be his embarrassment when he realized he overstepped.

But again, up to each person's discretion, and you guys were probably stressed from covid too to be fair.
My dad is like this all the time. Like this one rental place we always go to despite being given a car with a governor that activates at 80mph (mind you they knew we were going to Utah where some roads have a 80mph LIMIT), having to get 3 different cars until FINALLY we got AWD on one- they have excellent customer service and better prices than most in the area, one mistake they made my mom went in to fix and she was kind, patient and understanding despite being upset and they took a day off the price. 

Anyways my dad recently gets a Cherokee bc he needs a big car that‚Äôs AWD, he complains about how it feels like it‚Äôs gonna fall apart and makes my brother and I follow him on the freeway to see if we can see anything wrong and is snippy the entire time- despite me mentioning death wobbles and every Cherokee I‚Äôve ever seen having them. Finally we can ask why we had to do that, and my dad starts going on and on about how he wants $300 back and it‚Äôs not his fault and yada yada, how he wants to DEMAND they give him back his money for renting him such a terrible car and how they better. This man can‚Äôt make his own doc appointments but willingly yells at workers who he understands are underpaid and not really in control and yet bullies them to get his way even for the smallest thing that he blows out of proportion so the rest of the family is stuck having to calm him down or deal with it ourselves bc he doesn‚Äôt take criticism well. 

God forbid he sees this comment lol
I like how you agree with a rational reasonable take about not jumping to conclusions and that some people make mistakes but also have ACAB in your username¬†
If I pay you to solve problems then shut the fuck up and solve problems and stop killing random black people to move up in rank from your police gang
I have more trust in people that DON‚ÄôT leave tools in brakes.
I mean it's that not where you keep your 10mm?
I don't understand how a business stays in business acting like this. OP came correct and they shat all over him.
You‚Äôre so right. If people Only knew
What the heck is "Deeder"?
Got me 4 new aftermarket wheels of my choice any brand and kept the factory set that I paid very little to have fixed. Don't go in pissed off. That manager didnt do the damage but want to make customers happy. Good luck!
The best part is walking in with one of their tools in your hand. 
How did it go?
>let you go find a new wheel, or choose to live with it

The gouge in the rim is deep enough that I'd be concerned for safety.
If the question you‚Äôre asking is if people ever make mistakes in aviation mechanics then the answer is yes
Time for Karen mode! Damn I really wasn‚Äôt expecting that.
Will do. They have terrible service. They asked me to wait in my car, they had another customer and they all left. There's literally no one here but myself now.
OP commented on it in the original post as well, so he knows. Now we‚Äôre just repeating it like it‚Äôs new info, invalidating the fact he already caught it hehehe.
Good bot
You‚Äôre welcome. I didn‚Äôt mention it, but they should replace the clip as well. That will probably mean a new set of brake pads, this is a teachable moment for the technician in question, there is a reason that we double check our work, and test drive vehicles after working on them. If this vehicle had been double checked and test driven, they would‚Äôve heard the noise, and upon investigation would‚Äôve found what they did wrong. Then they could have disassembled it, and removed the tool, and you probably never would have even noticed the rim. They would‚Äôve had the option of leaving the rim as is, or repairing the rim for a substantially less cost than replacing it.
If he‚Äôs not cooperative with such compelling evidence under his nose the shop needs to be sued for the benefit of the community.
Your brakes is what your life depends on, would you like a car with brakes that don't work 100% and fail in case of emergency?
I was trying to make the point that the tool is pretty compelling evidence and he should immediately be very cooperative.
If you say I contacted my attorney they fold cause you have one. If you threaten with a lawyer they know you don‚Äôt have one. I did this to Amazon and I won they folded and paid me 2 months of full pay.
Well, maybe you were out of line. That shit gets old. Most shops are full of honest guys trying to earn an honest living and yet everyone looks at them as crooks. 

Some cars make simple sounding tasks pretty damn difficult. It just depends. 

Just tell him that there was a tool left in your car and you want to return it. The thing is that it damaged your car. 

Seriously, in the grand scheme of things replacing a rim shouldn‚Äôt cause that much trouble. They‚Äôre insured for stuff like this, but that probably wouldn‚Äôt be filed as a claim.
Likely they charged you four hours because they book for your car said it was a four hour job.
https://www.wikihow.com/Replace-Fuel-Injectors#:~:text=Purchase%20new%20injectors%20designed%20for,a%20professional%20do%20this%20one.

Economical viability, they have overhead expenses to account for and your paying someone for their time to do a dirty smelly job, even if it took the 30 minutes for a job you didn‚Äôt want to do.

Yes you can do it yourself, but there is a high chance you fuck it up if it‚Äôs not your usual routine, your paying for an experienced tech, but fuckups happen, if your polite about the damage caused they would be accepting of the incident.

I had tyres replaced and one tech forgot to torque the nuts, I just walked back to the office and asked to borrow a torque wrench as his tech forgot to tighten the nuts, dudes boss came out and rectified the situation.
I wouldn‚Äôt complain about 4 hours changing injectors? Sounds reasonable. You‚Äôre factoring in setting up, getting tools and procedures. Possibly doing a scan before and after plus test drive and additional cleaning etc. If they also tested if your injectors actually needed changing that also takes time.
Shops charge you for all the extra time all those things take. 
I‚Äôd be more comfortable knowing someone took their time and did it correctly than a bozo mechanic slapping them in.
Do you know how long it takes to replace injectors in your car?

It could quite easily take that long depending on the vehicle and how much interference has to be removed and replaced.
How are you, as a non mechanic, going to say that‚Äôs one of OUR tools.  You may have picked that up in the road.
Injectors can be a bitch to get out, especially diesels. Times are quoted according to book time, the time it normally takes to do the job. Doesn't take into account for corrosion and seized bolts etc.
This can add hours to the job, there's a good chance it took longer than 4hrs and they ate the extra hrs.
that seems like a reasonable amount to time for injectors
Read my longer post I just made, but the caliper is on backwards. That's the main issue.
T25*
Is this a private owed shop or a franchise or a bigger company that has several shops in your state or other states ?
This is awful. Literally the worst possible way they should have handled that. Sounds like someone's poor ego couldn't take that they fucked up. Sorry you were treated like shit. A link to the business should be added so we can all leave them kind reviews. They just damaged your vehicle didn't do the job correctly and told you to go fuck yourself. It's just the point. You don't treat people like that. Especially paying customers who just want their breaks done correctly and to drive safely.
We all know what to do. They have 4.7 stars on Google but only 6 reviews. I can fix it.
Why would it be surprising that blue collar military guys do blue collar work when they get out  ?  Also,  hope this isn‚Äôt your everyday way of looking at the world,   It‚Äôs pretty simple minded and you‚Äôre heading down a dead-end road.
Go get em. Good luck!
It just doesn‚Äôt look like that much to me, but you‚Äôre right. Better safe than sorry.
To be fair, t I also would have assumed the metal shield being bent as opposed to, ‚Äúoh they left a Torx bit in my wheel and now it‚Äôs like perforated paper üòä.‚Äù
It‚Äôs upsetting because it comes off as lazy and careless , but honestly who has 20 10 mm in their box? I heard that they grow legs or something
Well you could take them to small claims but probably waste of time.  I pay a little extra for dealership for this exact reason.  Besides this looks like a low skill shop  I will not go back.
I was always taught to not take a shitty day out on someone else. You could be having the worst day of your life, it's not the cashier at the supermarket's fault
Nah. I work in healthcare and during covid. That‚Äôs no excuse to act like that. He just a dick.
I like how these  things are unrelated, ACAB isn‚Äôt about  blaming alll cops for some bad apples  it‚Äôs about realizing having an armed force of regular  people who make mistakes isn‚Äôt a good idea. 

Innocent  people die when police make  mistakes, repeatedly, every single day. People go to prison for the  mistakes of police.  People lose their children, their siblings, their parents, their cousins and uncles and aunts when police make mistakes. They should be  held to a  higher standard of the law if they are  to enforce it with the responsibility of judge, juror, and executioner.
Yes, a conundrum indeed.
Well if the shop kept fucking up over and over again while not being apologetic or trying to improve you might stop giving the shop the benefit of the doubt.
ACAB is only jumping to conclusions if you ignore the mountain of evidence of widespread systemic issues with America's police forces.
ACAB IS his username ü§£
ACAB is a rational and reasonable take.
Damn, it‚Äôs almost as if he believes we should have a higher standard for someone that carries a gun around all day and can shoot you then a wrench turner.
that‚Äôs because acab is not about individuals making mistakes, you just don‚Äôt understand it in the slightest
Kony 2012
I like how u r a boot licker lolololol
thanks for telling us you kiss so much cop butt that it actually affects how you respond to "rational reasonable takes"
ACAB is rational and reasonable
You'd think a Minnesotan would know ACAB by now
I like how you think you know what you‚Äôre talking about but you have no idea
I can‚Äôt even decipher what point you‚Äôre trying to make‚Ä¶ try school? Try reading? Socrates might be a good place to start. After all, the unexamined life is not worth living.
There is an update lost in the comments somewhere,  I wish I could just edit the original post but I cant

https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/s/X8KqZfP5wY
Did you measure it with your eyeballs?
Put them on blast OP. Mention their name and City. Maybe all of us can write them bad reviews!
I would involve a lawyer. Brakes are safety relevant. Imagine you didnt notice because you hear music in your car. One day your wheel breaks in a corner and you are done.
Shops fuck up all the time. As long as humans are fixing machines there will be mistakes.
OP's brakes are completely functional and the two issues have nothing to do with safety.
Tell me you don‚Äôt know a lot about cars without telling me you don‚Äôt know a lot of cars
Still a bad way to go about it. Wouldn't work out well for you in a lot of situations.

Amazon is a multi billion dollar company with real lawyers, which would cost them more than ~10k usd to fight.
Sorry, I should have provided more context. I've been working as a mechanic for several years now and I usually do my own work on my cars. Right now I don't have a garage and the place I work doesn't allow employees to get their own cars worked on there. I replaced all 6 injectors in the summer (it took about an hour) and 2 of them ended up being faulty which was under warranty. Now it's winter, and I just didn't want to try to work on my car in the cold, but I needed the injectors replaced.

All things considered, if I can replace 6 in an hour, there's no reason the shop couldn't do the same.
I just turn wrenches, I don't deal with with anything past that which is why I don't know the process of getting this stuff replaced through the shop
I'll look it up on all Mitchell when I get to work tommorow. I'm sure you're right. If they were paying their techs flat rate, then it was probably based off the book labor time
A Bozo that would leave a tool inside of the suspension?   Plus, it was Two injectors.  Alldata doesn‚Äôt factor in getting your tools ready for a job.
The job felt like it was a bozo job, but I do hear where you're coming from. If the follow on procedures included a scan and test drive, then it could take longer.
Because op has no reason to damage his own, perfectly good rim. Best case scenario, he gets the same rim back. Worst case, he doesn't. It doesn't make sense for him to damage his own rim

I just emailed an attorney I know to see if it's worth pursuing
It doesn‚Äôt surprise me, most of my friends are either enlisted or have served their time in the military. Not myself no, I am a very anti confrontational person. Unless the safety of myself or my family is at stake.
Wheels and tires are one of the few items on a vehicle you don't ever play around with it's all that's keeping you connected to the road.

I would personally demand them to replace that wheel as compensation, obviously not going in screaming at them or anything.
At first, I did think maybe it wasn't much, but if it were left alone it would have 100% sheared the wheel in half. I don't know how much is left before it goes through, it might be enough, it might not. For all I know, it could act like perforated paper and break on a pothole.
Exactly. I would understand maybe an irritated tone and the like, but to go off like that is not ok.
You can be having the worst day of your life. And you still manage to take your worst day of your life out on someone having a more worse day than you. Always something I‚Äôve remembered from when I was a kid. Life sucks man. But damn, most people have it worse than you. Doesn‚Äôt make that nurse invalid by any means, but still. Rationalise, and be nice
Oh yeah, I was taught the same! But seeing someone else doing that and knowing the kind of pressure they're under... it probably wouldn't make me reverse my decision to be kind to them. In fact, that kindness would probably go a long way to getting them out of that mood!
Teachers prepare kids for the future and require a degree. 

Attorneys defend people and make laws, they require a degree. 

Doctors save lives and perform miracles of healing, and they require a degree

Police can ruin some ones entire life in a second and they get 6 months of training on how to generate revenue and suspect everyone at all times for being a criminal and out to hurt them.  Some only have a GED. They don't need any kind of degree.
Don‚Äôt forget dogs. Lots of dead dogs.
It _is_ about blaming all cops for _covering_ for the bad apples. When the *brotherhood" creates a system that allows bad actors to perpetuate, then the system is a problem.

When you cover up a crime, you become a part of the crime. Acab.
Makes me wonder if a doctor made a mistake intentionally or not and killed a guy I bet all seven hells would break loose and I don‚Äôt think a doctor could ever get a qualified immunity so why does a cop, when both have to deal with lives ?
Feel it's also very important to point out that it's almost never just one bad cop. 

It was four cops that murdered George Floyd, and it was dozens that failed to arrest the killers. It was dozens of cops that went and protected Derek Chauvin after he murdered Floyd. Now you can say they're just doing their job, but truth is they wouldn't have done that for anyone else. 

https://abcnews.go.com/US/officers-color-barred-guarding-derek-chauvin-15-million/story?id=88239864

They couldn't even not be racist against their own people. 

There's a video of a cop shooting reporters on live TV with a pepper ball gun. It wasn't just one bad cop, there were dozens of cops in the background that did absolutely nothing about the bully. Every single one of them is just as guilty as the one pulling the trigger.
>it‚Äôs about realizing having an armed force of regular  people who make mistakes isn‚Äôt a good idea. 

And your alternative is? Anarchy? Kill bots? Legitimately curious.
Acab is about the system. The saying is bad apples spoil the bunch. There was a case where an officer in my city was caught and convinced of stealing evidence, twice. He got his job back. The other officers and the union fought on their behalf. I'm not anti union, but their are times unions need to drop certain members in the interest of the others.
"isn't about blaming all cops..". ACAB literally means All Cops Are Bastards. Even if you ignore the ALL part , calling them bastards isn't constructive or related to the problem in anyway.
It‚Äôs literally in the name üòÇ I get your point and agree but ACAB stands for all cops are bad
> ACAB isn‚Äôt about blaming alll (sic) cops

It's literally the first two letters of the initialism!
> ACAB isn‚Äôt about  blaming alll cops for some bad apples 

What does it stand for, again? Whoosh
You will not makes it far in college spelling You're* like that.
Boot lickers will only learn when that boot is across their neck.
Lmao,  let me get this resolved first. Information moves fast on the internet and if the bad reviews roll in too fast, it will impede the final result.

Exactly, there‚Äôs no reason they wouldn‚Äôt make it right other than being an asshole.
Are brakes considered fully functional when they're missing an essential retaining clip, though?

Not only did the shop literally half ass the brake job but they also damaged his car.

This has a lot to do with safety, as the job performed was not done safely.
best comment
I still think you‚Äôre misunderstanding. 

I‚Äôm not saying go in hot talking about a lawyer. 

Show the evidence and explain the situation.

Gauge the reaction. 

If they‚Äôre immediately obstinate or deny any wrongdoing, there is no point in wasting time at that point. Lawyer up. OP has already had a bad experience with this shop and they might take it as an angry customer being difficult. 

Take the evidence to a lawyer, instead of handing it back to the shop. The tech has a matched set of those, and now suddenly on specific size is missing. That‚Äôs evidence if the shop tries to deny it. 

You think they should go in and beg for help or something? They fucked up. They‚Äôre responsible for making it right.

And you didn‚Äôt get a labor estimate ahead of time?
ask if they used alldata/ mitchell time
Clearly not a mechanic üòÇ. Just stop lying. A real mechanic would know how to deal with this and not ask Reddit. If you actually work in a shop youre the annoying shop kid that sweeps up and is always late. But you tell your friends youre a Mechanic.
I'm assuming you're somewhere with extreme weather conditions? I ask because I don't have a garage and I do the work on my car... Tbf though I also work on heavy duty stuff all day so I'm getting use to intense weather like 20F temps üòÖ
There are zero mechanics that are as nonchalant as you seem to be about book times. That's how you get paid. Even if you work hourly, then you will need to meet certain efficiency metrics. Don't come into a sub full of mechanics and try and pass that bullshit off as truth.

There is no way that any mechanic would go to a shop to get their brakes done. Even without a lift,you would just do it on the ground somewhere. There is also a zero chance that a mechanic would pay a shop to replace injectors when you wouldn't even need a lift to do it. There is zero chance that a mechanic would come to Reddit to see what they were supposed to do in this situation.

Don't try and bullshit all of us bullshitters.
>all Mitchell

All Data or Mitchell
Or All Hail Mitchell
Definitely a bozo, I was more talking about the 4 hours. I don‚Äôt find it that unreasonable. Maybe US is that much different to AUS but here they charge you the time it took the mechanic to do the job (within reason) including getting tools, clean up and if it‚Äôs during their 15 min morning break well you‚Äôre paying for that too.
How.wpuld they have teat drove it and not noticed the tool wedged in?
You‚Äôre right he probably was a bozo. I hope for your sake it took that time to make sure everything went like it should.
That‚Äôs not even what I said you goober.
Sorry again, OP. This shop is run by raging dickheads.
I'd be attempting an insurance claim against the shop ASAP.

They damaged your vehicle and you are entitled to a new wheel in the very least

Reviews have started pouring in, here‚Äôs a reply just minutes ago.
I guess it depends on the sort of day you're having üòÖ
Fuck, HAIRDRESSERS spend more time learning to do their jobs than police officers.
To apply for a law enforcement position they should need at least a BA in Criminal Justice.
Depends on the city and state. In Tulsa a bachelors degree is required for law enforcement.
[deleted]
Fun Fact most states require you to earn a degree before or within 5 years of becoming a peace officer.
People already do not want the job, let‚Äôs just make the pool even smaller
I like how you blame cops for revenue generating as if it‚Äôs not the politicians you vote into power, nickel and diming you instead of actually putting in laws to stop crime.  Look at CA as an example
Actually, at least in MI, to be a police officer requires a minimum of a Bachelor's degree and then you can apply to the academy.
Isn't the saying also "one bad apple ruins the bunch?" I mean, I leave a routing or molding piece of food with food if it's kind of spreads unless it's removed. That's another reason the "bad apple" theory is bullshit, it's only utilized to justify shitty behavior and not take action to correct it.
Based
If they didn‚Äôt do it themselves, they knew it was happening and did nothing to stop it. Back the Blue till it happens to you.
Not to mention if a doctor made a mistake and all the other doctors came out saying they made no mistake-they had no choice but to leave a scalpel inside the patient, and then the AMA came out agreeing that sometimes a scalpel must be left inside a patient. When a doctor came out disagreeing about the scalpel, they would get fired and ostracized, unable top practice medicine anywhere.
Do u know how hard it is to hold a medical professional accountable? Might as well be immune.
Doctors do make mistakes intentionally and sometimes people are killed. This is why I always suggest people be nice to their doctors. Even then a doctor may not like you because of stereotypes and will intentionally let you die after feigning attempts.

I play video games with a doctor who speaks loudly about his biases, talks about shitty patients he sees, and then wishes bad things to them because there are more deserving people of organ donations. It‚Äôs fucked but it‚Äôs also how the world works. Hence why cops can sleep at night after they empty a clip into a perp who was reaching for his phone. It‚Äôs already justified in their mind and they have had plenty of time to think about how to cover it up. Not talking about serial killers just the occasional death that they do not feel bad¬†about
Leading cause of death in US is mal practice
Dude this is a great point I‚Äôve never thought of it like that.
>Makes me wonder if a doctor made a mistake intentionally or not and killed a guy I bet all seven hells would break loose

Doctors and nurses kill people ALL the time, nothing happens. If something like a med error results in death they usually get a note on their file.......
The fact that it seems to be a choice of total anarchy or militant police forces is really an American problem. I‚Äôm not talking about this as the person who knows THE solution. I‚Äôm saying this as  someone who sees that America has a unique set of violent problems involving those who are supposed to protect us. 

Better  mental health awareness and help, specialized training for situations that call for it because sending the guy with a GED and a gun seems to backfiring spectacularly. Idk man. Why is so hard to hold police accountable for their actions instead of foaming at the mouth because  there‚Äôs just NO other alternatives Americans  like.
For real, where is this going.
Actually the most commonly accepted solution is removing the police force as we know it, then using those funds to add multiple different specialized groups. Unarmed traffic enforcement, armed and trained professionals for hostile situations (armed robbery, etc), trained psychologists for domestic disputes, etc. It stops the whole "one untrained man doing 50 difficult jobs" scenario. When you realize what people are actually fighting for, you realize we truly want what's best for cops. Lighten their workload and make sure that people are getting the appropriate help required in all cases. You don't need a gun or a bullet proof vest for 99 percent of the jobs a cop does, but you do usually need specific training in a wide variety of fields.

Edit: typo
Society tends to police itself if left unhindered. All this craziness happening is government attempts to alter societal norms. When you do that, society fights it, as it isn‚Äôt organic to it. If not created by society, society will spew it out as it doesn‚Äôt belong. We need police. We just need them different. Defund the police and abolish it. Bring in a new police with a different perspective of how to police.
You‚Äôre more worried about the nomenclature than the actual problems, thanks for clarifying
Them beating the hell out of people, mistreating people, lying to people, limiting people‚Äôs freedom, investigating people for a crime instead of investigating a crime to find the people involved are all things bastards do. The police are the worst element of our society. They are by far the most tyrannical.
It‚Äôs similar to Satanists not believing in Satan. It‚Äôs in the name, but that‚Äôs not what it STANDS for.  It takes  2 seconds  of critical thinking to understand the difference in what the words mean and what the actual movement means.
Are you this adamant that Satanism is in fact about Satan because it‚Äôs  in the name? Genuinely curious if you understand how a movement and it‚Äôs  label work, vs literal explanations of words involved. 

Do you also tend to vocalize that ALL lives  matter when you see BLM anywhere on Reddit because it‚Äôs  not just Black lives  that matter? Or do you understand the reason for that movement?
Idk tlabt that tho

The retaining clip is mostly for noise/feel and keeps the pad from slipping around in the tracks when not engaged. When the caliper piston is engaged it's not asking. You might end up with uneven wear on the pad, but it'll still work.

They fall off from time to time on the road when they get old and worn. I've seen a few laying around in parking lots. It's not going to cause a wreck.
What you're not understanding is that your original comment did not convey the sentiments you've expressed in this message. Which is why people are questioning you.
Why would they deny any wrongdoing when they recently replaced OPs brakes? Don't be so naive.
No. I knew the hourly rate of the shop, but I didn't get a labor estimate. They just said they would call me when it was done
I wouldn't consider 20¬∞F "intense" weather, but definitely not something I would voluntarily work in. I've worked in the negatives and over 115¬∞ weather, but when you're working, you can tolerate it, it's an entirely different mentality than when you're on your own time. Not even comparable.

My reasoning for not doing my own brake work right now was 
1. The temperature
2. My jack doesn't fit under my car
3. My car didn't come with a jack that bc it was meant to have run-flats
4. I live on a busy street and other cars parked in my spot have been hit. Accidents occur in front of my house probably once every 1-2 months. I do not want to be a casualty.
20F man you're lucky lol, when I did work on a friend's BMW over the winter it was -40C most every day, -25 at best, -55 at worst which honestly is average winter temps here. Think 20F is what only -5C or something? But yea once it's below -10 or is windy 100% don't want to be working on a car in that weather
That‚Äôs why same folks are called ‚Äúshade tree mechanics‚Äù

It's cold af outside. I'm not doing none of that with a negative wind chill.
Well said sir!
Tbf while I'm not a mechanic, there are things I'm fully capable of doing, and do on my boyfriends cat that I absolutely won't touch on mine. Swap his injectors? Yeah I can do that in an hour. But on my car it's going to just piss it off so I pay for it to be someone else's problem. Stupid British POS can have one thing fixed, then something completely unrelated just blows up. I'd assume that's half of why this guy wouldn't want to do his own stuff, and if it's that cold I get it, it sucks.

Example: I will not touch my injectors, cus magically the o2 sensors start getting pissed. Ok so I replace the #1s, then the #3s go out, replace those then the supercharger isolator shits itself. It's comical how things just decide "nah I'm done" and blow. 

Weird stuff like that happens when I do it, when JLR does it, or when an independent mechanic does it, and I don't feel like paying for TOPIx so anything ignition or emissions related I just refuse to touch on my car anymore (and as a British car, let's just say I'm breaking even with the parts warranty from going to a shop... Stupid $3000 part broke within 50 miles, glad it was their insurance's problem and not mine)
Have both, but say all Mitchell bc use both

Which should have at least one semester of constitutional law.
In Norway it‚Äôs a required 3 year university degree.  https://polis.osce.org/country-profiles/norway#:~:text=The%20Norwegian%20Police%20University%20College,broad%20practical%20and%20theoretical%20foundation.
Yeah but a lot of people are unable to get such qualifications. It would be a good deterrent for potential corrupt police but would also limit the people who want to make a positive difference but lack the ability to get the quals
A bachelor's degree in what?

&#x200B;

Literally anything.
That's an exception to the normal. It's nice it's there but it's mostly irrelevant.
I would respectfully disagree about requiring military service.  A lot of us "old-heads" (50+ y/o) see the increasing militarization of our local law enforcement as a direct cause of what's going on with police today.  We still have some small-town, friendly cops but they're few and far between these days.  Being in-theater, having the mindset that "everyone not wearing my flag wants to kill me" is necessary.  Being a cop I would submit that it's the total wrong attitude to bring to the job.
> that gives time for military experience (18-22) which would be required

What a *remarkably* terrible idea.
Law enforcement is given "FULL DISGRESSION" on how to fulfill their duties. They have qualified immunity to cover them. 

That said no one but you said anything about politicians. No where did I say they aren't responsible. Both cops and politicians are responsible. It's not one group or the other.

Laws don't stop crime they are merely a deterrent. Sentencing prevents crime. I don't have any illusions that I must protect myself first and not rely on others to do it.  

Politicians will continue to do as they please so long as they force politically charged issues into voters faces instead of issues they can actually have an affect on. 

You seem to have a very narrow view of the world with those blinders on.
Yes, that is exactly the saying. And it's being applied correctly. The entire bunch is spoiled unless they remove the bad cop.
To elaborate on your very excellent point, under current US law:

The kid installing your tires has a legal duty to inspect the products he installs for visible manufacturing defects.

The surgeon placing a medical device inside you has *NO* legal duty to inspect it for visible manufacturing defects.

That's fucking insane.
No it isnt
And your source for your statement?
Actually it's heart disease, cancer, and then covid
Not even close
(I apologize in advance if my comment comes off overly combative, it's just my writing style. I appreciate the well written and good faith response)


)1 I've heard this solution before, but that still involves a force made of fallible people, which is what op was objecting to. 

2) while I get what your going for, it unfortunately wouldn't work for a number of reasons in the US. 

>Unarmed traffic enforcement

Makes sense at first, why does someone writing tickets need a bullet proof vest and a gun? The reason is that traffic stops involving individuals with outstanding warrants will result in the need to arrest them. If your going to arrest somebody wanted for murder, assault, ECT, it's a good idea to have a vest and gun. They don't always go willingly. 

>trained professionals for hostile situations (armed robbery, etc),

That currently exists as swat/HRT


>trained psychologists for domestic disputes,

No no no no, fuck no. Out of any type of call, domestic disputes are the most likely to result in officer fatalities. They're often extremely tense where multiple parties have quick and easy access to their personal firearms. There's a reason that cops NEVER show up to a domestic dispute alone. Psychologists and social workers are sometimes brought along but sending them in alone is setting them up to die. 


>It stops the whole "one untrained man doing 50 difficult jobs" scenario.

1) there's usually some training lol

2) the problem is when individual needs to be able to respond to multiple situations because those situations can evolve in front of you. It can go from a domestic dispute with a parent and kid, to a murder and barricaded suspect real fast. 

>When you realize what people are actually fighting for, you realize we truly want what's best for cops.

I think most people want the best system we can get, it's just we disagree how to get there. Thus is democracy. 

>You don't need a gun or a bullet proof vest for 99 percent of the jobs a cop does, but you do usually need specific training in a wide variety of fields.

Id agree with that statement, the problem is it's really hard to know which call is going to need a gun and a vest. Does the homeless dude just need a snack and a ride to the shelter? Or is he about to attack you because of a mental health episode? You need the ability to respond to both, or the unarmed social worker that got sent out might get shanked.
>We need police. We just need them different. Defund the police and abolish it. Bring in a new police with a different perspective of how to police.

Can.....we just offer more and different training....cut out the middle man?......
He's right.
> Are you this adamant that Satanism is in fact about Satan because it‚Äôs in the name?

Yes I am, because that's the very definition of the word. Just because you think it means something else, doesn't make it true. Perhaps you meant to reference The Satanic Temple or Church of Satan?

Do you know the history of the term? Its skinhead and biker gang origin and use?

If All Cops Are Bastards doesn't actually mean "all cops", then the term is stupid. It paints a collection of people with the same brush, and does more harm than good. The problem cops couldn't give two shits that you think they're a bastard, but good cops - yes they do exist - start to wonder why they bother and end up leaving the force. The use of blanket statements as slogans has never been a good thing.

Justify it however you want, but this brake job was not completed correctly.  It's easy to judge the quality of a shop's work based on how they perform the easiest, most common jobs:  oil changes and brake pad replacements.

If they overtorque drain bolts, don't replace o-rings on filter housings, or fail to replace pad retaining clips on the absolutely easiest jobs to do with 100% perfection every single time, what are they neglecting/massively screwing up on more critical jobs?

If I let a customer pull out with a brake job like this, I would fire myself.

That‚Äôs on you. You should absolutely know better than that man.
Those are all fair. My little fusions the same. It's a pain in the ass üòÆ‚Äçüí® but yeah no I get it. I was genuinely curious only because you mentioned how you usually do your own work. I tend to do my own mostly because my local shop is run by a greedy up selling POS (long story behind that) I wouldn't trust to change a tire on a 6 year olds bike simply because he might diagnose the problem being that the chain is too old and needs to be replaced for $80 because it's "premium"
.... I'm just going to say that's a tall glass of nope from me. I respect the dedication but I could not for the life of me do that ever üòÖ but yeah I'm a desert bug currently living in a place that sees the sun 10% of the year and the rest is either rain or snow. Like tonight it hit 15F ... Not fun
Tell that to the guy who was laying on the ground under his truck on the side of the highway fixing something last week when we were hitting -45 to -50¬∞C wind chill‚Ä¶ üòÇ
Exactly why. Maybe I need to study Criminal Justice.
3 years of education? WOW. That's what we need here.
It's a serious job. Should require serious education. How about a semester stretched over a year and the town/county/city should have a degree program in place? If you don't get it done within the first year, you're out. Could weed out a lot of the bad apples.

Come back to me when you can spell Discretion.
I think it was amazon prime. Maybe HBO. They did a show called Dr. Death.  Based on a true story. Terrifying shit.
If you take it literally sure. It‚Äôs a movement, not a declaration that every single cop is a bastard. Somehow this is lost on people and it‚Äôs funny to see because like I said, it‚Äôs showing people are  more  worried about the nomenclature than the issues at  hand. 

It‚Äôs not hard to look into a little more than googling an acronym or word related  to it, and come awayy with something more than a  literal definition of the acronym.
The Satanic Temple refers to their views as Satanism while having no ties to a theistic deity of any sort, including Satan.  

If a blanket term such as ACAB disincentivizes someone enough to leave the force,  perhaps they could help to actually do something about the bad cops. If it comes down to hurt feelings, perhaps cops as a whole should do better about their actions that have encouraged the grouping you mention. 

I‚Äôm not the one who coined the term, and I‚Äôm also not going to discard the motive and meaning behind the modern use of it in a  movement  meant to bring awareness to the actual bad cops.  ACAB brings scrutiny to good cops as well as bad cops, and helps people see that MANNY ‚Äúgood cops‚Äù aren‚Äôt good just because they didn‚Äôt actively kill, rape, or steal from those they swear to protect.
Fair.
Yea, I told them I'd get the job done soon as possible and didn't yet have a prefab garage (live in rural area so proper heated garages aren't too common) and cursed myself for it the entire time üòÇ was so cold that when I removed the dipstick tube it wouldn't go back in until I held a heat gun to the block for quite awhile and left the tube outside overnight
I completely agree, or on the job degree training, like being offered in some medical jobs in the UK. That would possibly weed out the ones unable to commit to the job and the studies, in theory leaving a police force of those that actually deserve and want to be there.
But that also goes back to the training they get. If they were trained to "protect and serve" I would agree with you, but they're taking kids straight out of the military and reinforcing the attitude of "everyone who's not a cop is an enemy" and "going home to your family is the most important thing". This is why cops stood around in Uvalde TX in tactical gear, listening to children screaming while one shooter killed more kids. I would recommend you actually search for the training they're getting. Watch some YouTube vids of actual training. It's a scary proposition, and even more scary when your wife and stepson are black, speaking personally.
My son was a wanna be bad a$$, then he did 2 tours in Iraq.  He saw more than enough killing, and would certainly avoid it at all costs.  He also isn't too concerned about an untrained local.  He knows what a real threat looks like.
rofl, that's all the rebutal u hve wow, you loose
> The Satanic Temple refers to their views as Satanism while having no ties to a theistic deity of any sort, including Satan.

Well from now on I'll ignore what various dictionaries define it as, and use their meaning (which I have never seen them use) instead.

We're arguing semantics here anyway. Either ACAB or they aren't. If you'd be happy to tell [this officer's](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/new-york-police-officer-dies-injuries-mattress-fire) 7 year old son that his father was a bastard then you win, if not, then you have to concede that the term is idiotic, if not at the very least flippant.
Wow man all these toolbags downvoted you to oblivion. Almost every comment haha.

We can tell who the price gouging mechanics in here are lol seriously if you can do it in an hour then yeah they just charged you extra labor because that's what all these motherfuckers do when you take your car in to get fixed.

Took my Trans Am to get a rear intake duct and the shop couldn't find one so I got online and bought one from classic industries for $200.  The shop ordered one a few days later and tried to charge me $375 for the exact same part! I took my car somewhere else.  Fuck that.  Fuck these guys.

There's three types of human scumbags on this planet- the first are politicians the second are fucking lawyers and the third.... You guessed it....
EMTs have to get training. And it's more than what LEOs go through.
Lol it's all good. I personally never had gone to a mechanic ship for anything other than this so I didn't know the proper way to approach it. People down vote anything and everything. Even the haiku bot got down voted. I'm not stressing as long as I can find a solution.
You can tell the price gougers are because op she really know better than to just wait til the end for the bill? 

People will always rip the shit out of you if you do that
lol don't get this subreddit started on part markups. I had a lengthy argument months ago about how I feel that it is dishonest, and no one here agreed with me ("that's how we make our money!"). Charging 2x the price for a part that anyone can buy is dishonest at best, downright scammy at worst. I'd rather see a $175 service charge than a massive hidden markup on parts because at least then I'd know what I'm paying for.
Vermont ü§òüèº
Recently went to vermont and I just wanna take a moment to appreciate this sign, 10/10 was the best part of my Vermont experience. 


Vermont needs more of this.

Additionally, I'd like to see "Leave No Trace, Motherfuckers!" posted at every trailhead.
This is awesome, thanks for sharing. ü§òü§òü§ò
I'm a lurker from the Adirondacks and we have similar problems here. I'm curious tho, do you guys have the same problem with tourists interfering with wildlife that we do here? The locals generally know to leave the deer and bear alone but the tourists will try to feed them and pet them and sh*t and usually ends badly for the animal. Is it the same there?
Someone who often drives my road enjoys twisted teas, bud light platinum, and a particularly cheap brand of cigarettes
Well put
Thank you Im tired of picking trash up on my fucking road.
Oh, it aint just the crack heads, either. I see plenty of "honest, good, church goin' folks" chucking shit at a trash can, missing and walking away. Or leaving an empty water bottle crushed on a trail. Or leaving bottles and cans on disc golf courses. Lots of assholes here lol
It would be awesome if the state started making this an official slogan.
I live close to a Creek and every spring a snapping turtle would go through my garden, planted or not, and leave her eggs. She was out by the road one day and a New Yorker stopped and was going to pet the thing. It was fairly large. Unfortunately, my husband was outside and suggested she might want to leave it alone
Yeah, we've got a good collection of crackheads up that way. (I recognize the sign, don't know the road name, but I know the corner you turn up onto when you see it)
That should be our new state flag
The number of commenters on this post who've seemingly never heard of a ladder is astonishing.
Beautiful
I love the sign but the cynical side of me can't help but notice something. Everyone seems tosupport this kind of sign for the litter bugs, even the crackhead ones. Put that sign up in Burlington tho, because you're fed up with needles, and you'd likely get a much different response. People would be telling you to just dispose of them and would shame you for calling them crackhead motherfuckers. 

Just funny the different views at times, that change based on situation and subjectivity. Humans are strange in that way. There's a part in "The Courage to be Disliked" where the philosopher uses an analogy of well water. Well water largely stays the same temperature year round but if it's summer time you think it's colder and if it's winter you think it's warmer. 

I apologize for my overly active brain activity üôÉ
That's just fabulous.
Do crackhead motherfuckers read or heed signs?
This makes me happy
üòÜ best
I think I might make one of these too
We have shit heads here in Maine too. There‚Äôs not a lot you can do to get me furious at you, but littering will
Well, it‚Äôs not lying. Give a hoot, don‚Äôt pollute.

Pack in / pack out,  and leave no trace .
If trees could speak
Too many crackhead motherfuckers in this state, sadly.
‚úåÔ∏è
Hell yeah
It‚Äôs usually locals who dump garbage on the side of the road.
I feel so shitty and sad when I see 987 upvotes for this post.  Really?!? This is one of the best things about Vermont?!?   F\*ck that!!!!!  This may be the first time I'm ashamed of my state.  Hey- if you've got time and energy to comment and complain and upvote this POS sign I'm asking you to consider expending that time and energy on more helpful endeavors.  You might start by educating yourselves about the generational trauma and socio-economic conditions that keep people trapped in addiction and perpetuate narcissistic and sociopathic tendencies.  Maybe instead of targeting your "crackhead" neighbors you could stand up to the real villains in our society who are getting away with waaaaaaaay worse harms on a deadly scale.  Just sayin'
You know, there are parts of Vermont we New Hampshirites would welcome with open arms, but then you all needed to fuck it up with Burlington.
How did they get up there
‚ÄúYes it includes fruit peels and nut shells you ingrates‚Äù
I've seen out-of-staters exit their cars when seeing a moose, and try to walk nearer to get pics or just delighted to see them; locals would yell at them to knock it off and get back in their vehicles. Though they seem to have a healthy respect for bears, that ive seen.
Happens all over. National parks have all sorts of problems with  these sorts of things. Occasionally you'll see someone get trashed by a bison in Yellowstone. The ultimate FAFO.
This is everywhere, man.
I think many of us were pissed at the bear fiasco. All caused by out of towners and not people from Old Forge. All they know how to do at least the younger crowd is to cause issues.
It's always twisted tea and bud light. They seem to land the cardboard box in the same spot every few days. It'd be way more convenient for both of us if they'd just think to put the damn cans in the box before they chuck it.
Mmmm do they have a lifted truck üõª ü§î
Oh, we must live on the same road...?
If there was a higher redemption price, and on more containers, this might curb the littering.
Thank you for making this sign, I hope the crackhead mother fuckers stop littering 

nobody likes a crackhead motherfucker nevermind a littering crackhead motherfucker
How did you get that plywood up there and attached? ¬†
Or picking up after their dog while hiking, then leaving the shit-filled bag at the trailhead.
I read ‚Äúcracker head‚Äù lol
Lol I wish!
I saw your use of the word "unfortunately" in that story and I'd like to express my appreciation for it. Some people just have to learn the hard way and we should let them.
How high up is that sign?
Actually they are probably junkie motherfuckers.
Crackhead motherfuckers are capable of doing many things
I see a business opportunity...
Found the Burlington resident
I want to know what part of the country/world tourists are coming from that so many of them think going near any big wild animals is a good idea, because I‚Äôm originally from an upper great plains state and the amount of people who think it‚Äôs a good idea to go anywhere near bison is astounding and you know those are the exact same people going up to moose
We call moose unicorns here because they're always talked about, but never seen so, I can understand taking a picture of a moose from your car. Getting out and approaching one seems like suicide by stupidity.
I laugh every time I see one of the idiots get thrown 30 feet by a living bus. I just don't understand how it's not common sense not to fuck with animals.
I didn't realize the news about that had spread so far. I'd like to think it would make a difference in how people act but I don't have that much faith in humanity.
I don‚Äôt even get the box just the cans
Haven‚Äôt seen who it is but there is a red pickup with a rusted out exhaust that rips up my road about 20 over. Might be related
it wouldn't... in fact it might make them do it more (for spite)
I counted 17 poop bags at Sucker Brook yesterday. 6 of them were in a little pile at the trailhead!
Even better lol
Not higher than the crackhead mother fuckers
10-15 ft, it's on a bank, clearly visible just driving normal. Any bit of awareness at all and you can't miss it. It's up in the Kingdom, Orleans/Brownington area
Urban environments where every animal encounter they've had has been with a tame animal so they just assume that all animals exist to amuse us. I was at Yellowstone once and this kid comes running up to his dad shouting "DAD, DAD, I TOUCHED A BISON,"
to which his father replied, "Well it don't count if I don't got a picture of it! Go on back!"

Meanwhile a park ranger is running down the boardwalk from hundreds of yards away full sprint screaming "GET AWAY FROM THE BISON, NOWWWW!"

Dudes got a stressful job dealing with literal throngs of ppl like you described.
Fr! I‚Äôve lived in Vermont for 10 years and not ONCE have I seen a moose in state I left the state to go out west on a vacation and I saw 2 damn moose‚Äôs
Yeah, they are so kewl to spot but they are *huge* ! And so many have that brain parasite that makes the poor things even more unpredictable.
Just the other day another person was handing feeding a deer looked like by the Old Forge Fire Department where they like to hang out. No. People definitely don't learn and I don't have faith that they will
I was just wondering if the determined sign-poster shimmied up there!
This is it. Used to live right by Yellowstone and I'd put it around 25% of the adult human population has no idea what a wild animal in the wild actually }is. These people can spend their entire lives in a city and spend 2 weeks every decade in a position where they might encounter nature. And strictly being observational here, most of the Chinese tourists (and there were tons of them, apparently the park is a huge thing for them to go visit) would function about one half-step above completely brain dead. Countless times they were trying to touch elk or bison, walking out on the thermal features where people fall through and die every year, etc etc and when they're faced with a group of people screaming at them and waving them off or waving at them to come back and everyone's clearly agitated about it the standard response was to vigorously wave back with the biggest smile a person can have plastered on their face like they're having the time of their life and are just completely ignorant.

As a sports ball/studio cam op I am always in awe of your work. Wish I had the opportunity to push my limits and work towards a similar skill set. Keep killing it out there!
Fuck me this is epic, I was think someone has a really good friend to get footage of them like this, then I saw the OP so makes sense.
Wow that was amazing. How the heck did the camera guy record you and watch where he was himself going? Drone?

Soooooooooooooooooo want to see this at 60 or even better 120fps. The feeling of speed and smoothness would be accentuated 10x.
Got some of best runs of my life In 2023 , rode some things up here in Tahoe that I doubt will fill back in again! Still stoking
Love such aggressive powder riding. Such good fun!
This video is wild! Is the video cropped to keep him perfectly in frame? Or how do you track him so well without crashing?
Breathtaking bro
Nice to see someone posting fire, not another "why did I fall off this 1 foot side hit" posts.
Envy fills me. I hope I can get some pow turns in this year!
Damn I was like both rider and cameraman are INSANE, especially the guy on camera, then I realized it was you Gimbal lmao. Been following you on insta since years ago when I think you used to post clips of Stale here, or maybe on Youtube :D Cheers brother, your work is amazing
This is not only amazing riding but some of the best camera work I've ever seen
Did you use a polarizer for this shot?

Or is the darker sky due to the color grade?

Excellent operating! Is there somewhere to watch this in its original aspect ratio?
Ayyy gimbalgod! Huge fan üòä

Everyone that doesn‚Äôt already should give this man a follow on instagram as he regularly manages to get some truly incredible footage

Also sick run! Looked like a ton of fun!

I mainly hit Sugar Bowl last year and had a great time with the historic snowfall. Hoping this season brings more snow soon ü§û
This type of follow cam will never ever be beat by drones. Those simply lack the feeling of really being there right alongside the subject. I do hope people understand how insanely difficult this is.

Much love for your work Spen.
Fav spot for me from last year was finally getting up to baker with a proper foot+ of pow after growing up boarding in WA. Something every boarder deserves to experience. 

Cool to see you on reddit spenny! Been watching your videos since the start of stalelife and you guys have been a huge inspiration to say the least. 

I like your pick for top run of 2023, the weirdly dark blue day sky gives it a wild contrast. Also sage is a beast. Wishing you the best with all of your future endeavors!!
are you the same gimbalgod on ig? are you the one riding or filming?
Gawwwwllldd dog, you have the filming skills of an undeniable legend. Just fucking epic stuff.
Love your YouTube channel bro
You put out the best videos out there. Huge fan!!
This camera work is wild. Sick run!
I'm fully erect
Is this some line at a ski resort or some private mountain you heli‚Äôd onto?  I‚Äôm just curious what it takes to board down a virgin run like that.  (Both effort and cost). This is like something of my dreams to ride a hill like that
r/PraiseTheCameraMan
Respect to the camera guy!
Amazing, didn‚Äôt make it to the pistes in ‚Äò23 and missing it so much now
Nice ride dude. Credit to the camera man / woman. Beautiful setting too. Where is this?

Edit- i see where it is now. Didnt read the info.
Holy Sh!t I've been following you for a while now on FB on insta. Stoked to see you post here.
Damn?! Gimbalgod up in this?!
Now we need a follow cam for so we all know how you move this fast while looking back at someone else. I‚Äôm sure your line is also crazy
Gimbalgod! Me and my homies have followed you on insta since the beginning!!!

Your footage has always been dope, so good to see your growth!! üí™üèΩ
Gotta be one of my days in Silverton or off RMP. First week we had right side up conditions with 2 feet of blower on north faces. 

Tagged red 3 with a group from the summit and then skied 3 more lines that afternoon

First run down tiger claw after a 30‚Äù dump (but it was surfy dense snow)

Party skiing rope dee dope with the locals crew, we got 3 really good laps that day

On our last day we rode the ski area all day and then tagged the rabbit ears at sunset untracked as well. 

Or maybe the double lap day I had back home in March where I rode blower pow at 6PM back into town

Tough choices!
This sub needs way more pro content like this. Incredible clip
I recently saw this post on other socials and was about to blast this "reposter" for calling this "his run" lmao. Your work is off the charts GimbalGod! The shot about 25 seconds in is bonkers, it feels like I'm watching a video game replay that's been upscaled.

Thank you for sharing with us.
The whole time I was thinking "this is sick riding of course but huge props to the cameraman" then I realized who posted it lmao. Of course! Awesome clip.
Lol watching this I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúdamn this cat films as good as gimbalgod‚Äù haha
That‚Äôs the fucking floaty feeling right there man. That‚Äôs the type of run that takes up residence in your mind forever. You and Sage rock. 

I‚Äôve been riding for about 20 years and just haven‚Äôt been stoked at all for this season‚Ä¶ but this lit the fire a little bit.
I  just posted a montage from my trip to Whiteface Mountain and after seeing this..... yea  I'm going to just delete my whole ig.

Seriously though that's the steeziest angles and views I've ever seen on this site
Before I saw this I was like wow this quality I‚Äôve only seen from GimbalGod

And here we are haha, awesome stuff as always ‚úåÔ∏è
This is sick reminds me of the clip I had of me. But uhh my dog ate my memory card‚Ä¶
Damn son
PHWWWOOOAARRR FUCK
Yeeew, nice to see you more on Reddit, Spenny. Awesome riding by sage, great filming (though I like filming from behinde much, much more, personally)
This is cool, so fun. I really like it üëçüèÇ
Gimbalgod is GOAT. By far the best filmer in the game. You really do kill it bro!!! Stellar work as always!
Always insane having actual celebrities post here! Holy shit.
#praisethecamraman
/r/praisethecameraman
Oh shit! It‚Äôs you!!!!!!!!!!
That‚Äôs juicy af
When you‚Äôre this good you could have a whole boulder on your back and it wouldn‚Äôt even matter üò©üòÇüò©
For a second I thought someone was stealing and posting your video üò≠
Watch this to Gojira- Silvera
Is this sped up? Looks fantastic
Such GOAT of a ride.
Yo @gimbalgod hangs out on this sub!? So dope you popped in to kick it w us morals
Legendüëä managed to get my day of a lifetime at snowbird on a random Tuesday, 28 inches and unlimited refills
Save some skills for the rest of us üòÇ
Instantly knew this was a gimbalgod creation.  The flow was unreal
That‚Äôs dope asf bro
"No helmet looks better on film" ü§ì
Hang on, is that a backpack I see?!

![gif](giphy|YO7P8VC7nlQlO)
So you have all that gear, a backpack, a big jacket, but no helmet because the flappy hat looks more unique or like you're a regular cool guy or some shit?
Why is it sped up
Very nice
Shred
Insert Mariojump.mp3
Get it, son!
Sorry but camera man is way better
Amazing!!!  Nice
Dreams! We only get like 1 epic line like that every year.
Love your footy dude
Sick, man!  Follow GG on YouTube if you haven't yet.
Phenomenal run!! I was in awe at the speed and control of the run. Figures it was Sage. Even more props to you for capturing it all so perfectly
Sick as usual
Yeah you are one great videographer my friend.
This is so sick!
I hope you make your own poster of this
You didn‚Äôt do any 1800s wtf
What did you do to the video in post? Add clarity? Change the colors?
thinking ‚Äúdamn, this dude rides like sage. fucking rips‚Äù

reads the comments and OP‚Äôs username, oh checks out
Mad props to the guy filming here. Met sage a few times last year, super cool dude.
Awesome run!
Thanks for all the great footage throughout the year to keep up the stoke during the off-season.
Side-on shot gives a great sense of how steep that run is!
We all start somewhere üëçüèº
Holy shit the cinematography is so great I thought it was CGI at first!
The filming is fucking insane.  Loved every second of this clip.
That camera work is next level... Any time you wanna shoot a mediocre 53-year-old who's been trying to get at it since the age of 16,  give me a call..
that lil hit at 10sec is so satisfying   
Great footage/riding!
Oh shit its THE gimbalgod. Are you using a 360 cam, or do you just point the camera behind you when you get in front of him? Like how tf do you film behind you when you're going that fast lol
I wouldn't even know how to ride on snow like this.
That‚Äôs an awesome clip. Camera man is MVP there!
Absolutely sending it in the pow!  Must feel so fast and floaty in person!
I'm always impressed at how well you match speed and tight distance with your subjects while they go off and do spontaneous things.
How I imagine I ride through good pow.
Sage is a beast‚Ä¶
Great to see you on Reddit gimbal god. You have inspired me to take the go pro filming to the next level and improve my riding to be able to do follow cams like this. Much love brother!
God bless the filmer
I had a blast in Kagura ski resort (Yuzawa, Niigata Japan.) hiked up after the last lift on the back side to get the golden run. 

Great powder on a blue bird day felt like hitting the lottery.
So sick
Beautiful!  So jealous.
Absolutely gorgeous looking run. Love your videos man.
Goddamn! Props to the cameraman.
Pure fire, as always. Cheers guys, keep sending it.
Cameraman deserves a raise
Is it bad form that you‚Äôre not putting weight on the front foot? Or is that how you ride in powder?
I was about to ask if the cameraman was for hire then I peeped the username and realized I can‚Äôt afford it üíÖ
Top run was at Brighton when it was over 800‚Äò in 2023. My Nitro Banker felt like it was a toy that day! Had to switch out to Rossi Sushi Wide and it was a blast being able to ride out even the flats. Everything was so good. All the deep rocks were buried, every cliff landings were soft. Amazing. Every run a white room. Every cliff drop soft and magical. Best week of my life. Ever.
Gimbal god is the best snowboarding camera man out there. Has been for years and most likely will be for many more years.
sheeesh fuck i wanna do this too , gotta get better tho
Camera man is the real shredder. That was amazingly well recorded!
My god, imagine how good the camera man must‚Äôve been to shoot a vid like this
What a monster run
Whoever shot this, fuckin rips! You're pretty ok too!
How much practice does it take to get this good
Legendary run.  Amazing!  Thanks for sharing
The color grading is something out of this world.
Looking a little goofy
Love it. This year my favorite run was Lupus Canis over in the Canyons. It was a good year in Utah with So much good stuff to hit in 2023.
u/savevideo
So sick
When this post popped up, before I saw OP username, I thought to myself, "some jackass is trying to steal a gimbalgod or Sage clip."

Then I realized it was you! Love watching your stuff!
Really great camera work
to bad u look like a jerry
Top run of your life?
Where is this?
Incredible clip. About how much is a trip to that lodge? The website is a bit obscure about pricing, I'm not good enough to go tbh, just curious.
This is what you imagine snowboarding to be
The fact that no one put the freebird solo on this video is criminal
what stance do you ride
i‚Äôm in maine i haven‚Äôt even gotten a chance to go up yet. no mf snow i‚Äôm pissed
Is he even carving though? /s
Nothing better than  when skill  matches conditions.  I wish that run was a few miles longer.
Much love homie ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I mean, for 90% of this sub, this is the only place they get their boarding media from. Gapers and Jerrys all over this bitch.
I didn't check usernames. I was thinking screw the guy on film. The cameraman is some sort of god! Turns out I was right!
Two. Legends.
Recognized it was gimbalgod just from the production quality and style. I never see his stuff on IG anymore
I have his board!! Bought it on a whim, it too much board for me as a newbie, that thing likes to goooo
Thank you sir!
/r/praisethecameraman
The filmer posted it lol
It‚Äôs OP
Oh no doubt. I can‚Äôt tell if you are fucking around or not but if not, you have to really start following Gimbal God in YouTube, the most insane camera man on the planet.
This right here. The filmer is the real hero.
Yes came here to say the same thing.
Hear hear..!!
Haha that‚Äôs my buddy sage
Thank ya! It‚Äôs been a fun journey learning how to keep someone in focus going fast
Haha yessir my friends are very good at riding
The poster is the filmer, dudes legit. Check out gimbalgod on Instagram for more of this
Like the other guy said, follow Gimbalgod on youtube. He filmed this and he has tons of stuff like this. His resort riding is also super cool.
I am gonna double check but I do want to say I shot it side by side at 60 and at 120 I will double check and let you know later
So stoked you got it there. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to make it over that way
Just practice. Like anything in life if ya do it enough times it is easy
Thank you my friend
How's my overhang, though?
Try my best!
How does my carving look????
Me too! Can‚Äôt wait for more of this
Thank ya my man! Been off Reddit for awhile because I never really understood it but so hyped to be back on here. Want to build a rad community of people ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank ya that means a lot it is much appreciated my friend:)
Yup you can watch here in full aspect and I did have an ND on, but my assistant out an interesting grade on this. 

Here‚Äôs the YouTube to the footy: https://youtu.be/FrHdCzWPEeI?si=jmaYgr9ybhCNZVCi
Aiii thank you my friend!!! Was one of the best I‚Äôve ever rode. Never been to sugar bowl. Probably was so fun with the season last year! Hopefully starts snowing soon :)
Good to meet ya g! Really want to get up to Baker one day I‚Äôve never been. Definitely a wild color job haha, my assistant did the editing. Hyped Tk be on here seems like a rad community:)
You say you grew up in WA? Have you never been to lookout? The pow is fucking insane at times, although it does suck rn.
I am the one filming and yes same one as instagram and on YouTube :)
Thank you my friend much appreciated:)
Beast of a photogrisser, never meddim.
It‚Äôs only the beginning wait for what we do in 24:)
Thank ya homie!!
Thank ya sir!
The boomers will get ya chubby
Look up Baldface lodge it is a private lodge in British Columbia. Without the lodge it takes a lot of experience and knowledge either Splitboarding or helicopters or snowmobiles to get there
You can ride backcountry and skin up to as many virgin runs as you want
Sumbout calling it a virgin run ain‚Äôt sittin right w me
Thank you sir:)
You will in 24‚Äô
I am the camera man :)
Hyped to get back on here. Refreshing
I‚Äôm here
Haha much appreciated my friend. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Haha interesting. Filming behind is easy. I always try to get the angles most people can‚Äôt step to.
Learned about Reddit today haha it‚Äôs all
Time
Much love I appreciate you:)
Not a celebrity just a guy whose spent way to much time thinking on how to make a GoPro look like a cinema camera hahaha
Praise ROB4251!!!
We‚Äôre all little humans:) hyped to be here. YouTube and Reddit are the real shit with the OG homies
To be fair he has a gold medal under his belt‚Ä¶
Avy pack brotha
Might even make backpacks cool at this rate.

EDIT: Guys, I think he was just joking - no need to trigger and downvote parent to -4!
Just depends on the type of riding for whether we wear a helmet or not. If it‚Äôs anything like rocks, sketchy or big terrain 100% of the time but a run like this is the equivalent of walking down the street for Sage and it looks much better on film with the beanie than a helmet. Not what your mom wants to hear but the truth. 99.9% of you reading this should wear a helmet. That clip is 25th years experience of one of the best snowboarders in the world.
Do you not know who sage kotsenburg is???üòÇüòÇ
Why are you such a knob? Worry about yourself.
My breath was too busy being taken away to check what was on top of his head.
It is not sir this is full speed. I would never do such a thing that is as whack as it gets. Skier shit.
Not sped up.  One of the best snowboarders in the world going mach schnell, filmed by the best cameraman in the biz who is going just as fast and miraculously keeping Sage in frame.  Amazing work, /u/gimbalgod.
Haha that‚Äôd be a good one
Yeah for powder you want the nose up or you can get stuck
In Pow it‚Äôs almost all back leg but like a center weighted back seat ride. Always have to make sure your nose is well above especially on landings and depends on the steepness of the run.
Dude thank you. That means so much. I‚Äôm just getting warmed up brother.

Hahaha I back that. Thanks g!
Sage has been one of my favorites boarders for forever! So sick you got to film him, and no surprise people think this was sped up. Dude is an Olympic gold medalist for crying out loud üòÇ
Captures the essence of "full send"
Yo wear a helmet homie, I‚Äôve lost a friend because of that and he shedded. It just ain‚Äôt worth it brother
This is really an indicator of what this sub is
Where you consume boarding media makes a gorby? No. Boarders who only cosume media and shred three times a season make their gap large.
Insane stuff! How do you keep it focused? And do you have behind the scenes footage of you filming?
You the real MVP
Came here to say this
He should‚Äôve. It‚Äôs good work.
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic but op is gimbal god lol
Honestly you and Sage are a great pair to watch ride. Much respect to you both and have a great year.
Yes. Your Olympic Gold Medalist buddy.
‚ÄòReally good at riding‚Äô is a funny way to say has a gold medal from the Olympics ;)
Folks about to learn today.
Much love homie appreciate you

Wow, please provide a download link if you have one!
Easy, lol. I think just about if everyone in here even got good enough to ride pow at that speed, and got the rider in frame, would still end up cracking our skulls in a tree.
Can I download a snowboard?
Spenny, love the vids. Please keep posting, it‚Äôs getting me fired up to go boarding. Awesome run!
Let's make a deal, I'll cover a day for you up at baker if I can tag along next time at baldface. Seems fair to me LOL üòâ
Lookout is somewhere I can't say I've been, but Idaho snow is prime I'd love to get out sometime. Schweitzer is one of my favs.
We better get back to the kitchen before the dishes start piling up b
What you got planned?
My buddy has had a reservation for us for Baldface since at least last year lol can't wait for it to come through!
So you are gimbalgod. So you are..... üôå
Your shares are very much appreciated
When are you and the gang heading back to Australia and Perisher, met you guys (including Stale and Marcus) briefly maybe 5-6 years ago and you were doing laps of the park literally all day!!
Yeah I know. And I know it's much harder, too. Only a photography AND snowboard professional can do what you do. Then again, watching from behind is more immersive, personally, as I can picture myself riding
Welcome in that case!

It's a laff riot in here. Sometimes we're cruel, sometimes we're kind, and then sometimes we're just blown away.
Word, maybe icon would be a better word haha either way, your work is freaking amazing, man!
Oh so people and especially impressionable kids look up to him? Nice...
Be honest, it‚Äôs full of sandwiches.
Hahaha good shit
Next time, maybe even skip the beanie too? ;)
Olympic rider sweet, lots of kids look up to him I bet.
We live in a society.  People influence each other (and kids) and even if you have insurance, hospitals have limited trauma bays for your ass to occupy.
I also thought it was sped up, but it looks awesome! Why does it seem like that, just because of the insane riding speed, or does the filming play a part in this? The way the snow sprays looks kind of hectic, but maybe that's just because the camera is so close.
Thank you for the reply brotha
Haha I was laughing so hard. I would never speed up a clip
Ok great - that helps I don't feel so bad now about how far I'm from that riding skill Lol üòÜ
Meh for them, this is light work
I‚Äôve just stumbled on this from /r/all, and this is hilarious. It‚Äôs like a different language lol.
Here‚Äôs a good pov: https://youtu.be/FrHdCzWPEeI?si=qGek_LA6H7ir-pxX
A GoPro has a fixed small aperture, so everything is in focus and it cannot be adjusted. This is also why GoPros / all action cameras have terrible low light performance
The real question here is how did you keep up?   Absolutely love this vid.  Apparently you‚Äôre a hell of a rider as well.  Very very cool.
Ha! Yeah I saw that. Incredibly stoked he is here. Just wasn‚Äôt sure if the guy above was fucking around as he said ‚Äúfor the guy filming this‚Äù not ‚Äúfor you for filming this‚Äù
Too bad sage rides park city where there‚Äôs no real chutes. It‚Äôs an insane theory that people can ride more than their home resort, but what do I know.
Your videos are the best. Going on a trip next week and your videos are hyping me up! Keep doing what you do brother.
Mr. God, do you still use a gimbal or is the hypersmooth/realsteady enough these days?
Call me George of the Jungle cause id be imprinted on every trunk.
Tell them you want ‚ÄúCheeky Monkey‚Äù and the ‚ÄúBoomers‚Äù
Probably next summer. Was there for a couple days this last year. Such a fun park lap one of my favorites
For sure. We‚Äôve been doing some fun 360 cam angles from behind and above that look like a video game.
Sandwich, apple, spliff kit, shovel, probe, snow saw , water
Grown-ups make their own decisions. No one asked you for your input on the matte, Captain Wear a. Helmet.
That‚Äôs just how it was and the speed of a professional snowboarder
The man, the legend, the myth..The Gimbalgod! Awesome clip as always man!
Wouldnt really call the latest generation terrible especially when you compare it to previous generations
You following me around bub
*I knew it.*
Mock me all you want, I'm right.  There's volumes of literature on why.  Adults can't freely do a lot of things, and don't be shocked in a decade when the helmet is mandatory most places, because again, even if you have insurance, you don't have the right to disregard reasonable safety stuff when you live in a society where EMS, hospitals, insurance companies, ski patrol, and your fucking family have a vested interest in you doing something very simple that 99% of people on the slopes are doing in 2023.  Especially as a pro that looks cool to easily influenced young riders.
Sure, not "terrible" compared to previous generations of action cameras, but certainly worse than \~any other modern camera with an adjustable aperture
Literally no one gives a shit about you being right. Your moral highness and absolute need to inject your feels into a dope piece some guy made (who didn‚Äôt ask you) is what‚Äôs wrong with the world. It‚Äôs not always about you.
Get off your fucking high horse. This isn't an instructional video - it's art. If your kids aren't wearing a helmet while they skid down blues then you're a shit parent and a terrible snowboard teacher.
That‚Äôs cute lol.
Sure i can agree with that. I still think the current gen of action cams/phone cams are insanely good and they certainly arent "terrible" in bad light conditions
Sure.  And it‚Äôs what kids watch and it contributes to their idea of cool.  You‚Äôre lying to yourself if you think otherwise.  There‚Äôs still a few holdouts and some weird counterculture associated with helmets now that everyone wears them, but it‚Äôs nothing more than contrarian ideation.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter where you‚Äôre riding.  You can get a head injury cruising blues easily with an uncontrolled fall, especially when the snow is hard like it is right now.  Especially for younger riders that don‚Äôt have the best fundies.  Bad parents and naive kids exist, and I can‚Äôt clean that up. But I sure as hell can chastise an influential rider for not wearing a helmet.  Society still pays for needlessly reckless behavior regardless of whose fault it is.
You're the one lying to yourself. Get your kids in check and stop letting them be raised by movies starring professional snowboarders. Do your kids just copy everything they see on tv? If so, they sound like they've had some pretty terrible parenting. 

I suggest you start having honest conversations with your children.
I added a little to the post to contextualize, anticipating that response.  Tldr no one‚Äôs a libertarian when EMS gets involved, and kids/families aren‚Äôt individuals.
Wartime production welding on a French tank hull
Saw this in a museum and thought it really highlighted how far things have come 
Sacre bleu! hold ze cigarette in ze left hand and ze stinger in ze right!
Whaaaat the fuck! There was good welders back then, no doubt about it, just like there was shitty ones lol. Interesting to see, wartime production so it's go go go, who gives a fuck about what it looks like.¬†
Mon ami, it is hard to weld properly when it's already 11am and you haven't had your 12th cigarette break of the day yet
Factories producing vehicles were so focused on speed that I‚Äôm not surprised the welds look like this
This looks like it may have been rewelded at some point or the original bad weld cracked and someone splattered an even worse weld over the top of that.
Idk why everybody is hating so hard on this. That shit is still on there isn‚Äôt it?
I would also suggest this is a cosmetic restoration job, looks far too much like a cheap mig setup to glue something in place than a proper production line making equipment.
I mean it was war torn France in the 1940s. Cut them some slack üòÇ
I think those early WW2 tank hulls were cast iron. Probably not easy to weld a steel part onto a giant chunk of cast iron.
They needed every dime they could get for the war couldn't spare any on welds
Better than the welds on a T34

But let's play that game of "Name that defect"
The r35 hull is casted, it's a pain to to weld to begin with. 

And I think the frensh had the same thought as the soviet. 

It's good enough. 

It won't fall of now or on 100h usage, so why make it pretty for 3x the time and skill if this gets the tank out earlier and does the job perfectly fine :)
Well, it is French. They've never exactly been known for manufacturing elegance. As a reference, I cite the 2CV.
why putting finishes on something that s going to be blown away
That's paint on chewing gum
Bondo: I can fix it :)
What welds?
‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt weld nice, weld thrice‚Äù
i've seen naked electrodes welds from the 1914 better than that
No wonder we were invaded.

- some French welder, possibly.
Ain‚Äôt this the Rosie the riveter era?
Learned from a Facebook post
Me, laying down the best beads I can even though they're going to be ground out: will I ever be as good as the old masters? 

The old masters:
no amount of grinder and paint could hide this.
Who knew Fridays existed so long ago?
In fairness it only had to hold up for three weeks.
I heard tales of welds like "hammered dog shit" but never saw a real example of what it was supposed to look like.. dayum!!
My morning dump looks better than this.
If it holds its good
It‚Äôs holding tho isn‚Äôt it???
But I am le tired‚Ä¶
Probably a field repair
A part of me wonders if those survived to become a museum piece because it was so shit. Like some QC person saw that and thought "I'm not sending that one to the front unless it's absolutely necessary."
Looks like every Detroit built car frame from the 70's. Blind monkeys comes to mind.
All I can say is, it‚Äôs in a museum and it hasn‚Äôt broken yet.
I once talked to the tail gunner on a Lancaster bomber and he said you could see the welds coming apart during flight,and usually after 7 flights the aircraft would be overhauled.
Assuming this is WW2 and France was in the same situation as the United States and other allies there was a desperate push to train women, elderly, and the the able bodies that couldn't be otherwise drafted into service.  Training was quick and dirty and far from perfect so this is what you would expect from very green rookies.
It looks terrible, but it held when it needed to, and it's been 80 years, and it's still holding.
I've seen chewed bubble gum look better than those welds, if you even want to call them welds
They may have been short on time qualified welders.
Considering it was probably a 12 year old or.woman with next to no experience.
They had shit bag welders way back when too.
That's terrible.
Wow! That is rough
It looks like someone spray painted a bunch of cheese wiz.
This is actually hammered shit, you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise.
My name is Chaz, and I'll be your gunner today. Lol
How do we know this weld is original? The tank looks restored
Fuckin chip that bitch you‚Äôll have some war time slag
A grinder and paint makes a welder what he ain't
His profession before the war was a cake decorator. üë®‚Äçüç≥ü´°
üòü
The weld is still there ain't it.
I think whoever welded that on had a feeling it was relatively useless. 

I see it's at the back of the turret between the rear hatch and commanders cupola but I can't for the life of me find any pictures of anything being stuck into that hole, no MG mount, radio antenna, nothing. 

Hell, half the R35s I see don't even have that part there (maybe because they all fell off somewhere down a dirt road in france)
You should look at Soviet WW2 welds on tanks. And then on the other side of the spectrum. German WW2 welds
What is that part even for?
‚ÄúCaulk and paint makes me the carpenter I ain‚Äôt.‚Äù

I‚Äôm guessing someone got drafted into the wrong MOS.
The French had tanks?
I mean‚Ä¶.its French
LMAO
Interesting weld style üòπ
Nah that‚Äôs just painted blue tac
I like that it's lasted since WWII without falling off, since my welds look a little too similar.
There no way you can convince me that's not chewing gum
No wonder they got ran over so fast. Wasn‚Äôt really a blitz, equipment just fell apart.
Like many war-time manufacturers, the welder that made this part was probably a candle maker or a musician the week before. All kinds  stepped up to fill the shoes of the men that became soldiers.
Dad shipped to Europe on a Liberty ship. He had the top bunk and said he spent a lot of time looking at the bad welds above him and wondering if the ship would make it across the Atlantic.

For the curious, the Liberty ships had a major revision during production because they did indeed tend to break in half (welded ships had nothing to stop a crack from propagating, unlike riveted ships) 

They had a five year expected design life, so were essentially disposable.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ship
Doesn‚Äôt really fit the definition of welding does it. We need a word or phrase to accurately describe such as this.
French battle tank: 5 reverse gears and 1 forward gear... in case they get attacked from behind.
Nothing worse than riding into battle in a tank that my apprentice welded up lol.  Then again it might be your saving grace, you just might not get to the fight before you break down.  üòÇ
This welder works for the enemy.
ü§£ü§£ü§£
It Lasted didn‚Äôt it?
If it‚Äôs a French tank, isn‚Äôt it likely to be prewar production?
You‚Äôll see similar welds on any US tank from WWII
It literally looks like hammered dogshit to me
Damn and they‚Äôve never lost a war? Amazing
If you can‚Äôt tie knots tie lots
He was getting ready to run from the Ardennes
For want of a nail‚Ä¶
Fun fact, Pablo Picasso was the first guy to fuck around and make art via welding. 

I assume most of his welds were close to this.
Rosie the riveter built that. All the skilled welders had to go fight. Remember, women didnt work much before that especially a job like welding. They had to learn on the run.
What do you expect‚Ä¶..they are french..
Is that when all the men were at war and the ladies were working the factories?
I mean, to be fair (and depending when the tank was made) there‚Äôs a good chance who ever did that weld learned to weld by doing that weld
This just goes to show that crappy welds can still get the job done.
No wonder they just gave up.
QC‚òëÔ∏è Stick = makes it stuck.
Wee wee looks gud from mon chateaux
Ok guys, used my HF coupon on the 90 amp welder you told me to get.  Is the wire that came with it good enough for this 3‚Äù armor?
Aren‚Äôt T34s disgustingly welded as well?
Probably because they had the women in the factories and the men fighting the war
Looks like an oxy/ accet weld. It was obviously hard to get the parent metal hot enough to accept the filler.
Bit hard to weld while running I suppose ...
Rosie the  rivitor was full of shit
Good gravy. This looks like piled bubble gum. Calling this welding is offensive to the entire industry.
[removed]
But then how will i drink ze wine
But I‚Äôm le tired
I like how you all started off french and changed to German ü§£ 

Im curious if that weld was done with Oxy/Acet. torch. It sure looks like essentially lava flow lol
Right, foot? Good god, the paints doing more work structurally than that weld is. Geezus.
I guess a badly built tank was better than no tank
Yeah probably under pressure or whatever unit didn‚Äôt have the highly skilled guys around at that time but needed it done anyway. My best guess.
Eh, corners were being cut everywhere and a lot actually wasn‚Äôt understood well about metallurgy in some manners. 

IE: the B-29‚Äôs revolutionary use of magnesium was great‚Ä¶ until they started catching fire mid flight‚Ä¶ cause they used Mg for the engine *and exhaust* mount fixtures‚Ä¶ oh‚Ä¶ and had CO2 extinguishers‚Ä¶ **which accelerate Mg fires‚Ä¶**

Or how a ton of Liberty ships switched to welded hulls (cause faster + cheaper) instead or riveted‚Ä¶ and sulfated steel (cause cheaper)‚Ä¶ they cracked open like fortune cookies if they took too large a wave in cold water. 

Honestly wish I was making this stuff up, but no - *hundreds* (honestly probably thousands) of people died due to these seemingly simple design or construction errors - some even decades *after* the war.
My guess is they were recruiting and training anyone they could.

They probably put the best welders on important structural parts like the track roller supports and weapon mounts. But went ‚Äúeh, this new guy still needs training, let him weld the antenna brackets.‚Äù Or whatever that is. It‚Äôs so small compared to the size of the weld it‚Äôs probably not likely to break.
wasnt even wartime, interwar france was just vibing
Not during ww2 for the French.  They didn‚Äôt last long. They had a legit army but absolute bafoons leading them, and they got massacred.
Yes but in this case, it doesn't even get the job done so it was actually a waste of time and effort. Should have just stuck it on with a piece of gum, for all the good this weld does.
This was when they put women in the factory.. just kidding but probably true. Give her a break it's her first day welding.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Aren't they allowed to drink brandy or something during their lunch break according to top gear
Where I live "French Quality" is a literal derogatory term.
They probably had to take all the labor they could get and would have the best welders doing the more important parts. This looks like a small mounting point for something on top so it probably got the new trainee who worked at the baguette shop until a war broke out.
For that he put quite a lot of chicken shit on that joint
It's funny how in a sub full of "welders" that people don't recognize a field repair made from a piece of coat hanger wire and a jumper cable to the tank's battery. This tank didn't leave the factory like this. It's obviously been repainted for the museum, too.
This tank survived. Maybe it was one of the better ones
Just about üòÇ
They should Cut the slag instead budum tssssss
Especially if this is a field repair and your experience welding is zero.
Especially when the armor is such a massive heat sink. We have had cracking problems welding pipe to large valves where the valve is 30k lbs of steel sucking heat out of the weld and it is hard, risky, time-consuming, and/or expensive to pre-heat the valve properly.
cast homogenous armour is not the same as cast iron, 

armour plating has a brinell of 550 or more, and doesn‚Äôt shatter under the stress of bullets and cannon shells, much less a drop onto a floor
I hadn‚Äôt considered the material so you make a very good point
I think it was cast steel which is much different
Time spent stacking dimes was better spent unstacking every dime we had.
Hey, at least the T-34s saw action. If I recall correctly, their most recent deployment was to Ukraine circa 2023-2024
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Cast tank hull....hm. Yes, I'm sure of it. That's the absolute worst example of engineering I've ever seen.
So should I cancel my future trip to finally see the Statue of Liberty? 

I bet whatever holds that together is atrocious
Well, its still holding, aint it?
Yes, because everyone knows the surefire way to compensate for inferior skill is to do it badly multiple times.
this is more like rabbit turd welding.
More rods than skill ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Personally I stack dimes in the bowl every morning
It isn't holding though. It is a big steel booger hiding a mediocre tack weld. If this tank had actually ever seen combat, it would have blown itself up.
Just about üòÇ
Or repaired years later by whoever owned it before the museum or museum repair lol wait is this the hot glue trick I saw on my coworkers TikTok the other day?
Ok, then take it to the front in Ukraine if it is so awesome, lol.
Peak British engineering. Same folks that gave you the worlds first jet airliner...and the world's first jet airliner crashes.
That‚Äôs crazy
It never had to do anything so...
I dropped a deuce last night that was better coined.
My grandmother built ships during the war and that's an incredibly offensive comment. She would have had her pay docked for a weld like this. You learn fast when feeding your three kids depends on laying down a solid weld.
Because if this were part of the restoration, it would look 10,000% better.
This would get you fired from a job as a pastry chef.
Not doing much but it is there.
I would assume a radio antenna or something but I don‚Äôt know
I shall add this interesting fact to my general knowledge repertoire
Apprentice has it all figured out
I‚Äôm not sure
Scuptor Vladimir Tatlin 1913.
Should've riveted it not welded it
My grandma was a steamfitter during the war and you're full of sh\*t.

For a second my pharmacy brain was thinking oxycodone/acetaminophen, then I remembered where I was. Honestly I feel it's applicable either way though.
So did France. Then back again.
as long as the gun functions and it can move it's very much so honestly

judging how people immediately scramble when they see anything vaguely tank-shaped in video games - where anti tank weapons are fully reliable and readily available

I'd imagine it's much worse in real life where it's more confusing and your life is on the line
At a certain point, you're very right. I'd guess that this  was probably one of the last few built as Germans were inside France, and they had to save time where they could.
The Germans may have put more effort into producing higher quality tanks, but in the end, they didn't build enough of them, so it didn't matter.
I could weld some steel plate on a Ford Model T and it would be more of a tank than this suicide machine.
A lot of russian tanks had 1-4 inch gaps in the armor during the worst part of the war
Unless you‚Äôre French then it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway lol, just drop in some weapons for the resistance
I'm trying to figure out why this was made in the first place since the French capitulated and then sat back with a glass of wine while the rest of the world took care of their problem. A Vichy tank, maybe. Even then, Vichy French were more of a liability to the Nazis than an asset and it was mostly from stupidity and incompetence. I mean, you'd have to be pretty dumb to side with the Nazis.
Literally zero adherence here. Basically no different than just tack welding it on. In fact a competent welder could join it more sturdily with tack welds than this debacle.
Yes, the French equipment was as good or even superior to the Germans‚Äô, it just didn‚Äôt get deployed appropriately.
Typical French ploy - blame the officers for your general manufacturing incompetence.
My buddy was a maintenance tech and installer in the U. S. for a large German company. It was for machines that cut large gears. Every year or so they would fly him to the German factory for training. They would eat lunch in the factory cafeteria. The first time he went he was absolutely stunned to see beer vending machines in the cafeteria.
Back when I worked for an engineering company with a HQ in France, you could have a small bottle of wine with your lunch in the on-site canteen over there. We're talking in the 90's and I think it was fairly commonplace across the country at the time to have a few with your lunch. Knowing the French, I doubt that culture has changed much.

Unfortunately, we rarely actually had to go to HQ but we did hold a weekly phone conference just after their lunch time on Fridays, and although my French was never great, I swear the big wigs were always half cut and slurring their words.
Or it was never used.
It's french. It only drove once.
If you call rolling into a field and being exploded by a drone 5 seconds later, "action", lol.
The tank was ok for the doctrine intended use. 
That the reality was different we don't need to mention.

A lot of hills are cast :) 
The hull of the Sherman and all it's variants are cast steel if my.memory serves me right.

Most of the frensh designs, the Matilda's (unsure tho)
Corrosion?
You do realize a 5.56 NATO AP round would go through that tank like a hot knife through butter, right?
Exactly! üòÇ
I didn‚Äôt say it was awesome, I‚Äôm just saying it has already exceeded its service life without failure.
If you think British planes were held together poorly, wait until you see American planes of the time
Not necessarily. I haven‚Äôt met a lot of great welders who feel like welding for free at home.
What did she do before and after the war? I bet she didnt work. Not saying she wasnt the best steamfitter out there, but she didnt do it for a whole career like the guys she took their place.
Thank you mod team üëç t
There are now, but remember back then women didnt work, and if they did it wasnt welding. They had to learn fast.

Oh, and also if you have one, you'll suddenly become friends with every broke mf around trying to trade you stolen consoles or monitors.
I agree for all we know this could have been a field repair
I recall reading about how the Russians decided that it was easier to weld an angled steel plate that almost touched the treads so that the pins in the treads would be pushed in by rubbing against the plate every go around as they work their ways out, rather than designing pins that wouldn't fall out. IIRC the expected life of a Russian tank was something like 2 months, and half of that was spent driving it from the factory to the front lines, so they didn't give a shit if things wore out because it was far far more likely that the thing would be shot and destroyed first, and so quantity was far more important than quality.
"The Germans are gonna blow this thing up anyway, fuck it"
Quarter inch üòÇüòÇüòÇ with those gaps they‚Äôre not even trying at that point
Well thats hindsight. Many believed that world war 2 would never happen at the time. And nobody expected Germany to roll over a major world power like france. Germany even had a pretty good change to invade the British mainland if Hitler didnt mingle with war stratagies.

So siding with the nazi's was more or less a bet at that time. As if the nazi's won it could payout bigtime in money and political power.
I agree it‚Äôs crap. But there is probably something equivalent to a few tacks in there somewhere, maybe. I mean it held on this long. I‚Äôm not confident that a whack with a hammer couldn‚Äôt knock it off though.

Oh, man, thanks, I haven't laughed like that in a decade.
I guess when you've been going to bars/drinking since you were 16, by the time you land a job at a factory like that, you've learned to pace yourself.
Like a good French rifle, never fired, only dropped once.
Most likely answer because, with this quality of welding, I'm sure this tank wouldn't have to wait for a German shell to explode.
Yep, onto the train. Problem is, they never drove off it.
The earlier shermans with the rounded corners are cast. The later ones with the sharp corners are welded hulls
I understand but the original comment came across more as misogyny unfortunately
Nein, you hold zat vith ze toes.
For all they know it‚Äôs cranberry juice
Also some welds are critical, others are fancy hot glue...
How do you make a tank less effective? Put a tank crew in it.
[Indeed](https://youtu.be/OCSh8aS1_D0?t=324).
It's still good if they are facing light infantry.
Not 1/4"


1 to 4
They literally didn't give a fuck if the crew lived or died....the average tank was lasting 18 hours in combat.

They would regularly be missing radios or some of their machineguns.

Love the SCOTUS ruling but‚Ä¶
Can‚Äôt express how much I love the reasoning in SCOTUS‚Äô opinion, but I still think they‚Äôre kind of goofy. I‚Äôll still probably get one though. 
Anything that slaps the ATF is fine with me.
Judging by how they wrote it, I am very hopeful for a FRT issues to be resolved positively for us as well
My proposal, do the Hughes Amendment next!
It's time we get legal full auto, there's no reason we need to spend middle class salaries on some piece of a metal with a number that was registered prior to 1986.

I don't care if my transferable AR is useless in value I'll have every other AR in my house converted.
Can we get the frts and super safety completely cleared now
So, who's gonna develop a bump brace? lol
I would‚Äôve gladly let them keep those stupid bump stocks. If we finally got rid of suppressors off NFA and or SBR.
While bump stocks are the trailer trash excuse for ‚Äúfull auto‚Äù I‚Äôm beyond relieved by this. I know he put the justices in place that slapped it down but fuck you Trump for even starting that road and more important fuck the NRA for going full support on negotiating rights as they always do
I‚Äôm a 07/02 ffl . I‚Äôm working with people right now to try and get these produced asap. Yeah they are dumb but I want to flood the market with these and make them so common that no legislation will ever be able to be passed and hopefully the rest of the nfa will be repealed
Hopefully this leads to knocking down the force reset trigger ban
I‚Äôm glad people again have the right to choose. On the other hand, (in my opinion) bump stocks have a cringey, trailer park, ‚Äú20 year old noob dipshit‚Äù quality all their own. I never owned one, and will continue to do so. FRT or binary is plenty for me.
Baby steps, I hope suppressors, sbs, and sbr's are next
I‚Äôd never use one or want one but still happy.
FRT go brrrr.
I‚Äôm fired up that we were able to draw that line in the sand and hold our ground rather than just watching as more of our rights eroded in from of our eyes. I‚Äôm even more excited about what this means for FRTs. If bumpstocks aren‚Äôt machine guns because they still fire one round for each action of the trigger, than by that logic FRTs are safe too. Between that and the pistol brace win all we need now is the Safe Hearing Act and we will have effectively dismantled the NFA.
Don't forget what president ASKED for the ATF to start this road.
Sorry it‚Äôs been super busy at work but what exactly happened?
The SCOTUS ruling directly affects only bump stocks, but stepping back and viewing the big-picture litigation strategy for FPC, GOA and the like, it's clear that the end game is to use this ruling to challenge all bans and limits on so-called assault weapons. Justice Sotomayor‚Äôs dissent in today's case concedes that AR-15s and the like are ‚Äúcommonly available, semiautomatic rifles.‚Äù

With the Court unanimous on the matter of ARs being in common use, and therefore protected under 2A via the Heller line of precedent, we can expect more lawsuits challenging state AWBs and a federal AWB would be a dead letter.

Now what I really want to see is the fact that over three million Form 4 suppressors are now in American hands and someone needs to challenge the NFA's inclusion of suppressors citing common use.
I wonder what is gonna come of FRT's
How about they give everyone compensation for destroying their slide fire stock as well pistol braces.  This would make it right!  Will they make it right?  Doubtful
So, what's the status on forced reset triggers? Don't they have a case waiting on cert?
I am just dreaming, by Bruen standard, will Hughes Amendment be unconstitutional as well?
I am going to be in so much debt over FRTs after the logical conclusion is that those are legal now too.
Trump is the one that put the bump stock ban in place
If they make one that looks like a B5 SOPMOD I'd definitely pick one up for the HK416 clone I've been planning.
This is how the law works. It‚Äôs one small victory that takes forever, and then there is precedent and the rest can fall as they come up.
Bump stock = Derpy winged noodle. üòÖ
One step at a time.
I'm more curious what's going to happen with the pistol brace rule, as my 3 eForm 1's I submitted during the amnesty period (Feb 2023) are still stuck in limbo.

Who cares what you think. Regardless if they are dumb or not it‚Äôs a step in the right direction. The atf needs to be abolished and if we get enough of these cases where the atf overreaches where we can show a pattern then we can actually legally do so.
Where to get it
Where can I get them?
[deleted]
Thank you President Trump for starting the ball rolling and getting bump stocks untouchable for the foreseeable future.
330 million Americans, way less than 1 million transferable MGs.  Bumpstocks work fine with very little practice.
I'd have settled for binary triggers.
I agree, I think most here want the ATF to get its peepee slap hard all around.
This. Remember, we have M855 but not 7N6 because a bunch of people said "I don't really care about imported AK ammo".
That was my thinking as well... Since they're using the definition of the law.
Thats what ive been saying since i read it. I mean, the only differences by the reasoning they gave is:

What is applying the continual force, your trigger finger or your support hand?

What causes the reset, the bolt or the recoil?

Fingers crossed twin bros and/or rare breed file new suits or amend their suits with this. 

As far as I could interpret, they do not consider the continual force a factor in the function of the trigger, nor do they consider the recoil part of the function of the trigger...
True. The middle dragon should be a binary/FRT
As someone who owns a transferable, I‚Äôm all for this because I‚Äôll just cost avg down by buying a ton of
As an owner of 2 MGs that would be out a lot of money if this happens‚Ä¶I fully support
Preach.
Amen.
In theory, the road is paved. Rare breed or twin bros now need to amend or file their lawsuits including this language... altho I'd rather see them challenge it excluding this language to lead to a constitutional argument instead of giving courts and easy out, which scotus somewhat took here (altho they still gave an excellent ruling)
I'd imagine someone on r/fosscad is making one or already has one and hasn't released it...

It occurs to me that SBR‚Äôs being NFA may help some folks in more restrictive states.

SBR is a cheat code in MD, as an example.
Bump stocks are really only important here because the way ATF applied the rule is how they applied the pistol brace rule (which isn't a thing anymore), and is how they are trying to regulate FRT's. As SCOTUS said, ATF's logic for bumpstocks leads to "all semi automatic firearms are machine guns", which obviously makes no sense. 

Bump stocks are also kinda useless for most shooters with any understanding of how they work. Put stock in, balance weapon out of your shoulder-pit with finger fixed and floating over trigger, pull forward... but yes, good people can choose a cheap option vs a 5 digit minimum machine gun to get their rapid fire itch.
The theory of bump stocks is all we needed. FRTs are so much more a complete system, but without bump stocks I'm not sure FRTs would have ever been a thing.
There have been some guys getting pretty sophisticated with bump stocks on ARPK builds. IIRC there was some dude on arfcom able to hit 1000rpm with enough tuning, specialized parts, and technique.
The "take the guns first due process second" president. Our (s)election is working as designed since the early 1900's.
My biggest issue with that one. Supposed to be pro2A and is the only president in my lifetime who has fucked with my gun rights
Bumpstock ban overturned by SCOTUS this morning
Remember that today's ruling had nothing to do with 2A and everything to do with Agencies ignoring statutory language.  Sotamayor's language was either a mistake that she'll ignore in the future, or a strategic admission that they're common use.  I'm surprised by it.

I doubt they would do that.  If there is a clear path to victory through procedural rulings it makes more sense to take the safe easy win than to risk it all on a 2A argument.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see it.  I just can't get my hopes up.

Ain‚Äôt that the truth. Hopefully, since they render the verdict in the way they did. They‚Äôll concede that a suppressor is just a muffler equivalent for a car. It doesn‚Äôt make it any more lethal it just makes it hearing safe. You‚Äôll still notice if somebody‚Äôs firing it.
Damn right. Gotta push things the other direction while we have the Supreme Court make up to do it. I've said it for a while now, but I hope everything 2A related possible makes it to these Supremes, and they're showing the willingness to hear the cases. They weren't before, and honestly, it was probably a good thing.
Believe it or not the frt was here before the bumpy bois.    The original creator of them is the guy that released the last one called the alamo from his design from years ago.
To be fair Bush said he'd renew the 94 AWB if congress passed it, thankfully it never did get renewed but all presidents are against our rights regardless of party in these current days.
I mean he literally only cares about himself, idk what to tell you.
In what way, other than lip service and posturing as "right wing", was that person pro gun?
What a glorious day
Yes, to the ‚ÄúT‚Äù
They get off on trampling our rights. Maybe we'll give them another avenue.
Has there been anything from anyone besides the tweet from them? I could find absolutely nothing from field offices, local police, local courts, federal courts, etc...

I'm entirely convinced they got overwhelmed, then cut and ran off with the money.
I was like a fresh baby then so I cant remember him at all
Not exactly but that kit was a true full auto kit. Im sure they are in trouble i mean i ordered a super safety but idk its whatever
I was too, I only found out about it when I started getting into guns and learned about Reagan signing the FOPA.

1997 ftw
We‚Äôre the same age and you already have an MG? Are you in CS or a trust fund kid or what the fuck is happening?
I‚Äôm in the Army and 2 years ago the Army offered me 50K to sign for 6 years.

Had to sell my soul to get a full auto AR.
Well shit‚Ä¶
Just bought this 2 years ago. Mechanic won't touch it. How screwed am I?
Not sure what to do.   Heard a scraping noise from d/s front tire.   Turned out to be the backing plate, but he said everything is so rusted he won't even start it.   Says it needs new control arms, brake lines, gas lines, p/s, a/c lines, rear springs, etc.      Basically told me the car is shot and unsafe to drive in it's condition.  

My wife is sick and I am the only one working.    When she got sick I had to default on my 800 a month minimum payment for my student loans, so my credit is destroyed, and I cant afford another car and I don't know what to do üò≠

I put almost all of my savings into buying it and was anticipating at least another 3-5 years use out not it considering I usually work from home.

That mechanics a üê±
Lol find an actual mechanic. That's like a 4 year old car where I am and if a tech here said they were afraid of touching that because of the rust they wouldn't last a day in this business.
Average rustbelt car. Average non-rustbelt mechanic.
I also should have mentioned this is a 12 Pathfinder
It‚Äôs rusty but yes just bring it to another shop.
Your mechanic is either over reacting, or in experienced. No holes? Let her roll

This could really use some work, and you should expect inflated labor times for having to deal with the rust. But I see cars like this often and while this sucks, it's far from the worst
Buy a Haynes Manual and get to work lol
That‚Äôs a sub 5 year old snow bird special. As the Toyota frame guy in a past life, that‚Äôs light work and not all that scary. I would have the frame cleaned and coated though and probly replace the tank straps before they get much worse.
Also on the student loans if they are government call your servicer and get a hardship forbearance follow the link and look about half way down the page. [https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/lower-payments/get-temporary-relief/forbearance](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/lower-payments/get-temporary-relief/forbearance)
Take it to another mechanic and Authorize the control arms and the brake lines. The rest you can put on the back burner.
Since you have no $, I‚Äôd get to work on trying to stop rust from getting worse asap.   Use a wire brush and reduce the amount as much as you can, then spray the heck out of the entire undercarriage with fluid film, including inside the frame.   And find  a different mechanic.  Good luck.

There will be a mechanic that will not be scared off by this, you just need to find them
It's been parked close to the sea ....
Just cut the backing plate off, problem solved. I just throw them away when they get like that. Your suspension is already rusty, it's not serving any purpose at this point. You could still get years out of this car, just find a mechanic who actually knows how to work on cars. If he's scared of the rust on your car, he shouldn't be working as a mechanic. Period. I work on cars that look like that EVERY day.
there is some car on your rust
He must not have a torch.
It doesn't look that bad. If you're able to get underneath it then you could spend a happy day painting a rust proofing product on to the crusty bits - it'd look like a completely different vehicle and would likely last a lot longer.

It certainly isn't ready for the scrap heap yet!
Really doesnt look too bad, definitely bad rust for a 2012 but not "i wouldn't touch it" unless he doesnt feel like breaking bolts. Worth looking into oil undercoatings if you get some replaced elsewhere? Or go to car washes with underbody sprays after rain or road salt depending where you live.
 I dont see any holes but definitely bad pitting
Honestly it's not that concerning. His fear probably comes from looking at it quickly and assuming that it's going to be a headache to remove anything. 

This is likely a mechanic who does not have the experience to deal with stuff like that. What you are looking for in a mechanic is someone from the Midwest if possible. Someone who is no stranger to cars that are in the rust belt.  That stuff can only be taught from experience.
As a rust belt mechanic, I personally would change those brake hoses, and probably all the hard lines, then the fuel tank straps and it'd be good to go.
What is this north Texas auto repair??

That's surface rust....
The South is weak, must be a rebel mechanic
It's just rusty it won't bite.
If you can't stick a screw driver THROUGH the rusted parts, it's fine.

Find a different mechanic or beg and borrow the tools to fix it yourself. Pb blaster, air tools, and heat are your friends. A broken bolt extraction tool in case stuff gets real ugly.

And a bicycle to ride to the Autozone when the part connected another part is too rusted so you have to Sawzall one off cuz every nut went except the one you needed.

Or... I don't know what the used market is like where you are, but old rusted out trucks were selling for lots of money around me.

Unless you need a truck for work, sell it as is or trade it at a dealership. Some car companies are offering seller financing at like 3% interest which is better than the 7% I was paying.
Just bought it 2 years ago forgets to mention the vehicle was 12 years old 2 years ago. lol Sounds like your mechanic is one of those guys that wears a light blue shirt, name tag and all with beige Khaki pants and black dress shoes to work. lol
Your mechanic is dramatic
The frame side is where the problems really are

If the knuckle and everything can be removed then i don't see an issue but this will require a lot of pb blaster

Unfortunately i live in the rust belt so this kind of damage is normal if you don't use fluid film or something to help the undercarriage
The frame on this car just screams ‚ÄúNEW YORK STATE!‚Äù
Just get a dye grinder and go ham. If or when something falls to the floor just replace it. If it doesn‚Äôt fall off you‚Äôre good.  It might be a pile of lard but at least the grinder will make it sexy
They turned you away for surface rust?? Im sure some things will be seized but ive seen worse. Looks like a pathfinder or xterra, those control arm bolts are seized in the sleeves guaranteed, but not hard to cut out.
Your mechanic is a diva
Are you ok with buying a few tools and sweat equity?  A lot of that hardware still has their Hex shape. This is a lot of surface rust. Get going with a steel brush and a face shield and mask. Clean it off and fluid film it.
It‚Äôs not bad. It‚Äôs just a lot of fussing about making sure every bolt is properly being removed. Rust tends to make everything a pain in the ass to remove. It‚Äôs nothing a penetrating fluid, heat, and elbow grease won‚Äôt fix. It just takes longer to work on.
Looking at this again. Your mechanic is soft. There's nothing unsafe thays jumping out. It's got lots of rust, mostly surface rust. When there is no paint left then you gotta worry. Brakes don't fail at the caliper from rust like that. They pop somewhere further down stream where the line in thin and straight rusts thru. Just DIY it man. I've fucked around with a lot of 2000 subarus way worse than this. Rest easy and take care of your wife.
Mechanic isnt wrong. All of the parts are rusted and corroded together. It would be triple the work taking it apart and you would end up having to replace all of the essential parts up until the frame is too rotten to support anything. Grease what u can, drive conservatively and u might get another year or so out of it.
I‚Äôm in the same boat, repairs are difficult when everything is rusted out.
It goes from ‚Äòflat rate‚Äô, to ‚Äòclock hours‚Äô, immediately- before the first wrench gets lifted! It looks like a NewYork state car, moved to coastal Florida and beach driven. Stuff breaks when you look at it intensely, you don‚Äôt even have to touch it.
Former Minnesotan now residing in Alabama. This rust is nothing more than surface rust, and your mechanic is an idiot. Replace brake and gas lines? Are they leaking? If not, fudge off. The only "concerning" parts would be the sway bar linkage, tie rod (both of which can be soaked in PB blaster prior to removal), and maybe a small area of frame around the hole. Take a sander and knock off what you can on the frame, and follow it up with primer and paint. Rust neutralizer also works decently well for surface rust before painting.
this is not a safety thing, the mechanic is lazy and doesn't want to deal with getting that hardware loose.
Undercarriage looks like it identifies as a submarine.
Nice springs
See a different mechanic.
In their defense if they‚Äôre not familiar with working on rusty stuff you really don‚Äôt want them touching it. It‚Äôs its own skill set learned by breaking shit and costing yourself every time you mess up. The car isn‚Äôt  too bad, wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to start getting her wool waxed to get some more years out of her.
I looked at this saying... it doesn't look *that* bad.
As an amateur DIY mechanic from Illinois.....Couple coats of rust reformer and undercoat will do her nice.
THAT mechanic won't touch it... take it somewhere else
Get another mechanic unless there is rot we arent seeing. Definitely can use some attention but I have worked on way worst.
Do you park it in a pond?
Looks like a saltwater flood victim to me
how much can you get for iron oxide by the pound?
"Watermellon craaaaaawl!" Such a fun song!
It has a lot of surface rust, but I didn‚Äôt necessarily see anything that compromises the structural integrity from what I can tell by watching a video. You should check the frame and see if there is also internal rust and if some of that metal is thinner than it should be because of it. I would take action though because if you let this go before you know it something will be crumbling. As for all the brake lines and other fittings most of these repairs could end up being a lot more work for the mechanic to take apart or it may not even be able to be taken apart at all and will need more parts replaced and or a lot of grinding and cutting etc etc so be prepared for higher labor costs.
Takes time but super easy stuff your dealing with
Lot f stripping down wire brushing re painting.
Corrosion due to sea water it seems??
You park in a lake at night?
This to me is like 12 years of rust and I live in Wisconsin. It doesn‚Äôt look bad and it‚Äôs still drive able and repairable
The only way I‚Äôm touching this is if I have to push it into a cliff
Not the worst... get on it before it's total dust.
I‚Äôd work on it, but I also charge straight time for dealing with seized bolts $$$
How does one avoid this on their vehicle?
‚ÄúJust bought this‚Äù

‚Äú2 years ago‚Äù

GTFO OF MY SHOP
Become the mechanic.
I‚Äôve seen worse
find a better mechanic.
Worked on 98 Subaru wagon from Boston. Started as a break change, turned into a complete front end, and full suspension redo. Took forever and had to cut/torch every bolt. It took a month, $1500 but car is still rolling today.
Find a new mechanic
Southern mechanic here. Working on that wouldn't be my first choice either, but realistically it doesn't look like it has any structural issues (yet?) from what I can see. 

If it were mine I'd cut/bend/break those dust shields out of the way, consider replacing those struts to err on the side of caution, and have somebody who knows what they're looking at check it over for anything actually concerning. Even I have seen worse. It's not fun to work on. But I'm not seeing anything that would make me drag it to the scrapyard just yet... Maybe don't plan on passing it down through the family or whatever. 

My gf's old car looked similar and aside from a few odd noises it was pretty solid. It did take stupid amounts of time to do some relatively simple work in the worst spots though, so be prepared for that.
Yes, the lower control arms at a minimum.

I‚Äôm near Buffalo, so well into the rust belt.

It looks ok, there‚Äôs still spots of the original paint. I‚Äôd replace the brake lines if they are showing corrosion (not just if the brackets are corroding), and I‚Äôd replace anything obviously failing. 

Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt touch anything, and I‚Äôd plan on replacing in a year or so if you are in an area not used to dealing with rust.
Always look up under a vehicle for rust before purchasing. If you're buying online sight unseen then imo, you're a moron.
Your mechanic is weak
Your mechanic is a p*ssy
From a Minnesotan, this looks fine n
So you're saying the undercoating isn't a scam.
it is very rusty, but i dont see any real structural issues. im sure there are some there, the swaybar brackets are fuckin gone, but it seems like your mechanic just doesnt want to deal with it, either he is lazy or has easier jobs to do instead. 

idk where you are but finding someone willing to work on this in the northeast should be real easy lol this is just what all vehicles look like after a few years there. honestly i would imagine this is from the northeast, that looks like brine and salt rust because of how aggressive its set in but thats not a bad thing. 

the absolute #1 thing i would do if you do find someone willing to work on this thing and if its somewhat reliable as it is, find someone who does lanolin treatments. have the whole underside and inside of your frame rails cleaned and treated with LANOLIN. it will protect it from this shit, its very effective.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSSYLFZzH40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSSYLFZzH40)
Just surface rust Hawk Tua ona rag and just wipe it off
Your mechanic is a ninny. Go find someone that wants to work
Get a new mechanic most of it is replaceable.
Find a new mechanic
Thats not terrible. Mechanic is a wuss. Its going to be frustrating but its definitely possible to get it fixed. Youll need stripped bolt sockets and youll need to replace all of the nuts. Lots of heat and PB blaster.
Honestly I‚Äôve seen worse. ¬†Do the brake lines and fuel lines. ¬†Then spray the underside from top to bottom with fluid film. ¬†And keep driving it until you can‚Äôt. ¬†
Get a jug of Klean-Strip

1 Gal. Concrete Etch, Metal Prep and Rust Inhibitor Outdoor Cleaner

, a wire brush, and a paint brush. Soapy water and wire brush it....rinse. Brush the metal prep. Let it sit for 20-30 mins, or until it turns gray or black. Rinse. It stops the rusting. Biggest thing is getting the loose chunks off, then stopping the oxidation. That's the starting point. Then use Kroil or other penetrant if you have to remove nuts/bolts for any parts too far gone.
Get a new mechanic.

And a cutoff grinder‚Ä¶
From Michigan seen way worse go for a lot longer keep her chugging
Same this wouldn‚Äôt bother me abit the 20year old civic was worse than this when I bought it as it had been sat for year ‚Ä¶ a lot of blood sweat and tears but she‚Äôs as good as new now
My advice is to learn as much about rust as you can. Then, devise a system of attack that suits your schedule. 

You can clean most of it up with a wire brush. Maybe a spray bottle for dust if you hate masks.

Then spray a light duty protection on parts that aren't pitting and rotted to the point of replacement. 

If it looks like it's crumbling or flaking, replace what you can and don't brush too hard your goal is to see how much good metal is left not to remove the stuff that looks the worst.
Looks like my 19 year old Subaru from VT. In my experience, these cost more to maintain than a new car.
That all looks like relatively new rust dude. Fairly little proper rot.

How often do you clean your car when you live in a rust-prone area?
Did you drive it into the ocean? Wtf
All cars and trucks look like this in upstate NY after   10 years we should get a Tax refund for ruining  the 2nd  biggest investment  people have to make.
I used to be a mechanic in the lower Wisconsin area. This rust is nothing compared to some of the stuff that‚Äôs come through. Extremely laughable that he said it‚Äôs too rusted to start on.

If you are in the Chicagoland area, I‚Äôd be willing to do this work for you to help you out. I would charge a 20 piece chicken nugget from Wendy‚Äôs, and I‚Äôll do the work. Just buy the needed parts and I‚Äôd take care of it.
Your mechanic won't touch it because he's a baby who doesn't like rust falling through his safety squints/down his back
I mean, I don't see anything wrong with it. I do all my own car work and repair, live in Michigan, and drive 20+ year old cars for the most part. I like funky 4x4 vehicles as well. This looks like a car. They rust underneath. 

I see no mechanical issues, nothing rusted through or otherwise dangerous here. Sure, this will require some soaking in penetrating oils etc. to have any hope of removing fasteners, but stubborn ones are an air chisel away from being replaced with new ones anyway. 

Get a good mechanic. That one is just lazy. Mechanics should be there to keep vehicles on the road, not causally rip people off for replacing brake pads etc. on a factory new vehicle only.
‚ÄúJust bought it 2 years ago‚Äù lol you didnt just buy it
jesus christ titanic.

you guys defending it, isnt there something you guys in those areas can spray on it to help prevent this
New control arm, new steering knuckle would be a smart choice
What car is this?
I‚Äôll bet OP is in a state that has warmer/drier weather and rust isn‚Äôt a common issue. 

This looks to be medium/moderate rust but nothing immediately jumps out as a safety issue. Even as a native Californian, this seems like a car that is fine. Maybe it gets some additional labor time on the quote due to the rust, and new hardware is quoted/installed too, but definitely serviceable.
Yup id just drive it
Crusty
As a Yankee I'll agree with the general sentiment here and add on be nice to the alignment guy if you need to visit him soon.
What state is this mechanic from? A New Englander / Midwesterner would have no issues with this!
That doesn‚Äôt scare me on a 12 year old Nissan. It‚Äôs ugly for sure, but it‚Äôs got several more years left in it. I don‚Äôt see anything that will strand you on the side of the road or keep you from getting to work. Keep it dry when you can, try to wash the undercarriage in the winter months and save your money for normal wear stuff like brake pads & tires when you need them. With a Nissan I‚Äôd be more concerned about the transmission failing long before the rust structurally weakens anything.
Is that a Nissan Armada? 

But anyway just scrap the loose rust off the backing plate best you can, the rust will shake out eventually so no worries. Mechanic gave you the "I don't want to work on that thing" special
Looks like someone has been cruising the beach
Before you bought this was it near any oceans perhaps stored in the ocean.  In all reality you‚Äôre ok ish it has a lot of rust but it should stay together a while longer the backing plate can be bent away from the rotor.
You rustheads need to stop flexing your masochism. This shit belongs in a junkyard.
I used to be a shop manager - cars like this are tough because when you request an estimate for repair, there are quite a few issues that could arise and result in larger labor costs. Bolts break, then we have to extract them, press in components are seized and require lots of heat and hammering. 

Things can domino and customers get upset when you tell them a bill is higher now because of X or Y. I would advise a customer in a repair with extra labor to pad the repair and explain that if things go smoothly, it would be cheaper at X cost. 

I‚Äôd imagine this is why they won‚Äôt touch it.
Knuckles, shocks, LCA's, sway links and bushings... it needs just a little bit of work.
Lmao do you live near a beach
Get a Krown treatment. It'll make things look a ton better.
Hahaha. Looks like every single truck older than 5 years here. Your mechanic sucks.¬†
Oh boy. Well, it definitely gets worse
Linkages are easy to replace and not expensive. Despite the appearance of all this: this is very salvageable in all likelihood. Blast that rust off there so you can really see what's still there. Looks mostly like surface rust though.
Nothing unsafe here.

Find another mechanic who is not a simple parts changer.

This is surface rust, if you are worried about it, it can be scraped, brushed, wire-wheeled, sand blasted, whatever; then shot with some tremclad or rustoleum.

I think that mechanic is afraid of snapping a bolt off and having to do some real mechanic work.

You don't want to deal with a guy who's afraid of that.

As for the noise, other people have suggested it, just pry the backing plate back if it is of concern.

Your car is fine based on those pictures.  It won't be fine in a few years though.  When you can, I suggest cleaning it up as best you can and either spray paint it or soak it down with some oil.
I live in snow country in Oregon, and the road department just plows and scatters gravel, they don't use road salt at all and most everyone still gets around fine. There are cars on the road 40 or 50 years old that hardly have any rust. I just don't understand how anyone deals with all that rust, or how people don't vote for discontinuing road salt use. 

During Covid we bought some rigs from Canada at auction, and they were nightmares to work on, even just three or four years old. I'd still work on them if I that was the job I got handed, but if it was an every day kind of thing I might reconsider my life choices.
Mechanic can‚Äôt make book on it.  Also, this is nothing in Michigan.
Yeah, that there is an excavation. Tech will be sifting through layers of rust and broken bolts. I wouldn‚Äôt want that much misery in my responsibility. That‚Äôs a shit show for sure!
I wouldn't say it's shot but lots of that is going to fall apart while being worked on. Not going to be cheap. I wouldn't want to work on that.
Well the front won't fall off for one.
Hobby mechanic here. It would be a good idea to scrape off this rust and apply some rust protection, but I don't see anything structural or broken about these parts. 

I have heard good things about this [undercarriage wax](https://www.amazon.com/Woolwax-1-Gallon-Package-formula-Undercoating/dp/B0CSDRJR44).

If looks like you might be somewhere in the world where they salt the roads in winter. If so, something like this (if you have access to a hose) [sprayer attachment](https://www.amazon.com/RIDGE-WASHER-Undercarriage-Attachment-Extension/dp/B0CX8NG2W9/) lets you easily rinse off salt underneath your car DIY.
I‚Äôd recommend a Time Machine and some wool wax
Sandblast it and find out
It's not that bad, get some fluid film and put it on the important things if you want it to last. I mean yeah fix the crucial components like brakes and control arm, but are the other lines leaking? If not, coat them. 

-Brake lines
-Transmission lines
-Power steering lines
-Nuts/bolts 
-Weld seams on frame
It looks like shit sure, but i dont see any perforations in the frame. I would probably curse you while working on it but i wouldnt turn that away.
Looks very average in PA
It looks pretty crusty but can probably survive a few more years if you clean it up and  put some rust treatment on it. I would probably get one of those suspension kits on it just to make it more road worthy but wouldn‚Äôt put too much money into it.
Flood damage? Would get rid of asap. It‚Äôs scrap.
Not a mechanic but from the Midwest and this looks like most of the cars I‚Äôve owned or seen. Salt and snow make it almost impossible out here to prevent it looking at least similar on anything before 2010 over 100k. Not having garage access at my place doesn‚Äôt help either.¬†
Induction bolt/nut heater‚Ä¶
Most of it looks like it'd pass the screw driver test honestly. Mechanic is spoiled.
Find a mechanic that wears safety glasses
Your mechanic is scared of surface rust?     This just looks like a job for PB blaster, a wire brush, and some heat.
I am am at wow. Soak in pb blaster for a year.
What kinda car is that?
Base on this video this is all surface rust. Obviously can‚Äôt tell you about the rest of the vehicle.
Even the rubber is rusty üíÄ
You‚Äôre looking for an auto body shop, not a mechanic. 

Also, video isn‚Äôt going to really offer much more than showing a lot of rust. I don‚Äôt see holes, so that‚Äôs good, but the concern is the integrity of the metal that is under the rust. You need a professional that‚Äôs willing to walk you through what you have there.
Ohio says ***send it!***
Must be a southern mechanic.
Where do you live? It's pretty rusty but it just looks like surface rust. Pretty normal for up north. All our cars look like this
What‚Äôs wrong with it? It‚Äôs well seasoned
He‚Äôs a coward
Call a mobile mechanic just had my frame patched as much as possible. 

It's likely a liability on insurance that they won't touch it
Every car i've been under looks like this, tho my old van was about 20 times worse.
As long as the frame is good you can replace pretty much everything that's rusted beyond repair
This is what all cars look like where I‚Äôm from. 2022 and beyond.
This is really common in Oregon too. Most dealerships in the state buy used vehicles from Canada... And they all look like this
Your mechanic is a pansy, that's nothing
Lol
The only reason I wouldn‚Äôt touch that is if you told me your budget was 300$. Understand that will probably need some extra parts and labor and it won‚Äôt be cheap because all these dudes acting like rust is nothing are trippin. It takes a lot more work to deal with major rust, doable but it‚Äôs gonna cost ya and some stuff might need to be cut if the torch doesn‚Äôt do it
All it needs is rustolium and degreaser at a mechanic
I think the cause is salt water
What's the issue here?
I will work on it. Book time does not apply, and we go as far as necessary to make it right or not at all.
I would have it oil sprayed to prolong the life another 5-8 years.
Pre purchase inspections by mechanics are a thing
Yea idc what the rest of y‚Äôall are talking about, so glad i don‚Äôt live in a rust belt state lol. I will take our minimally rusty cars (Virginia) all day long and live in blissful ignorance of what the rest of you northern techs have to deal with. Good luck though OP
The gas tank straps are ready to break, and some brake fittings look like they are close to coming apart.
What state are you trying to get 3-5 years out of this in? You won't get 5 years in the rust belt. In the south fix it as it breaks or you get the money.
Wire wheel all the rust off and see what it looks like underneath then get some rust prevention sealer
Coming from Texas, I ain't touchin' that with 10 foot pole.
Get a different mechanic
You need a better mechanic.
i‚Äôd say you got a 30k clusterfuck on your hands but it can be easily fixed with about a years worth of headaches
Get a new car bro
https://youtube.com/@youngshizzie?si=a1F5kAG7U1S9yBph
That‚Äôs called surface rust here in the northeast.
Take it somewhere else. I live in Wisconsin and that really isnt that bad. I mean its not *good* but its not anywhere near bad

Things need to be replaced, absolutely. However it is safe to work on and drive around to find a shop that isn't full of wussies
There are some bits on there that are in fact fossilized but it's far from toast.

Your mechanic hasn't seen the north.
Well that thing is rusty as f and it looks like you need all new suspension and brake lines, but once all that stuff is on there it‚Äôs going to look hella newer, minus that super rusty frame. Only thing is it would cost a lot to do a full rebuild on suspension and probably every one of those bolts would break in PITA fashion.. said mechanic is probably thinking why spend all that money and do all that work when your frame is looking like it could be next to go. They probably just don‚Äôt want the headache. Another mechanic might not care what the outcome is for you or if your car kicks the bucket; and just see dollar signs. So those are your options. Invest money into a potential money pit and hope for the best or get something in better condition. 
    Next time you buy a car definitely look underneath, and when you look at it, ask yourself, ‚Äúhas this seller/owner taken care of this thing‚Äù. Are the fluids the appropriate colours, or are they all dirty pitch black, is the engine bay filthy or clean, does there appear to be any new parts on it, or do they look like they live on the bottom of the sea? If parts are new, you won‚Äôt have to replace them. New parts = üëçüèª
See rust holes anywhere? Stay away. If the seller won‚Äôt work with you or let you take for inspection, stay away. If the seller is using pressure tactics, they‚Äôre probably trying to hide something and are shady as well, avoid crappy sellers.
Quick!! Somebody call the framer!!!! That needs to be replaced with FRT LUMBER!!!
Clean it with W40
Maybe look for a parts car/truck. Some of those components are dangerously weak.
How long was it submerged before you bought it
What‚Äôs your mechanic on about - those CV boots, coil springs, and oil pan are pristine. üôÉ
That looks like a flood car, the way the rust is so even I‚Äôll give you dollars to donuts it‚Äôs a flood car.
You‚Äôre probably fine.  Ask another place. 
I have a ‚Äò07 Fit that the mechanic said ‚Äúdo not put another dollar into it. Scrap it‚Äù
It‚Äôs on year 2.  I did my own brakes and yeah, there a nice and thorough coating of rust everywhere, and. Sure, the side jacking points may have crumbled away to the shadow zone, but it‚Äôs still kickin.
Find a different mechanic that came from rust to get it to a solid baseline.

Then find a guy to clean all the rust off, treat the surfaces and repaint. Follow that by getting an undercoating service like fluid film or something, done every couple years.

If there's no holes in your frame you should be good a while, rust is terminal but you can slow it's process down enough to get you by until you're in a better place.
Just replace your entire everything and it should be good to go. üçª
I'm in Chicago, and any 10-year vehicle looks kind of like that. It looks like yours was left submerged in standing water for days/weeks

Start by replacing the brakes: lines, calipers, rotors, and pads; that will take you some time and money but is the one thing you need to have working 100%

After that start replacing control arms, tie rods, and sway bars. Leave shocks till the last

By this time, the truck will be good to go for a couple more years.

Good luck, you got this
Coils springs look mint. So you got that going for ya...which is nice.
I‚Äôm so happy I don‚Äôt have to deal with rust anymore, but on a serious note this isn‚Äôt bad.
POV: you just bought a car from the scrapyard in CMS 2021
Talk to a different mechanic / shop. They were simply lazy and didn't want to do the work.
Looks better than most of my shit (canada, salt, dirt roads).
Canadian here- Is something wrong?
Your mechanic is right. That car, as it sits is unsafe. At minimum, you need to replace the broken springs, control arms, possibly the brakes, shocks look questionable, sway bar links look questionable, might need ball joints, very likely does need brake and fuel lines, etc etc etc...¬†


I live in the northern rust belt, and even I would say that thing is really rusty. I really hope you didn't pay very much for this thing, its really on its last legs. With substantial repairs, you could probably fix it good enough to get maybe a couple years out of it, but it really is in bad shape. You are looking at thousands of dollars of repairs to get this roadworthy, and you are still going to have a very rusty vehicle. In my opinion, the money you need to spend to fix it right would be better used to get a less rusty vehicle. You could sell this thing as is, for parts, disclosing the rust, and recoup at least some money.¬†¬†


This is a good example of why you need to get a PRE purchase inspection done on used cars if you aren't particularly good at knowing what to check yourself. I feel bad for your luck here, but try to learn for the future I guess.¬†
Scrap it
Id rather not touch it too but for the most part its surface rust and the most damage at the moment will be your wallet when misc things like needing a brake flush and suddenly needing all 4 calipers if i where you id take it somewhere that can knock most of the rust off and under coat it, dont get the hard undercoat thats a scam and will rot under get something thick and oily because that the only stuff that will protect the car
 Not even just saying this but as a northern guy this is surface rust in a car with anything 50k+ miles
I wouldn't fuck that with a stolen dick.
Honestly, doesn't look too bad. Just find a better mechanic lol. Nothing looks like it's falling apart yet.
Step 1
Find a new mechanic. 

Ok so maybe check out your local trades schools or mechanic/tech Colleges. It's a good training opportunity and they get to see a real world vehicle in gor inspection. 
Go in talk to the person in charge maybe work something out. Worth a shot. It costs nothing to ask.
Springs look good
Get those gas tank straps replaced before you‚Äôre dragging your tank.
Sandblast it and find out.
Just a Lil rust no biggie  pissy tech lol
Sway bar looks good
Bro just keep the tires and brakes good and you're solid. Along with other maint. A bit of rust never hurt nobody.
Clean it up and put rust encapsulation paint or something to seal it üíÄ
It won't be cheap, but it looks like you could keep removing parts until you get to the body, replace them all, and be just fine.  You will want to treat the rust on the body so it doesn't get any worse.  Structurally this still looks alright, it's just going to be a bitch because everything is going to break when someone tries to remove it.
What kind of vehicle is this
What do you want done?
Was the car at sea?
Definitely needs a ton of work. However, maybe he‚Äôs running away because he‚Äôs worried about your reaction when you get your bill which is very possible. There are definitely jobs I personally won‚Äôt get involved with for a number of different reasons. If it were my own vehicle, I‚Äôd get after it myself but there‚Äôs definitely no way in hell I‚Äôd pay someone to work on that
Find another mechanic and be prepared to hear that lots of bolts snapped off which means extra labour and different bolts in different places
>How screwed am I? 

Pretty fuckin‚Äô I‚Äôd say
Probably comes down to reliability. I‚Äôm sure if u paid up and did the whole thing. Ya. But ruining the integrity of other components would fall on him
Just throw the whole car away.
*Laughs in Ohioan*

I've worked on, owned, and driven worse than that.
Take a screwdriver and a hammer. Firmly hit the different spots of rust to reveal where you're screwed üëç
new car time
I drive a 16 year old car with no rust protection in southern Canada in a heavily salted city . That underside looks almost brand new! haha 

My rust test is to bang it with a hammer. If it‚Äôs not making a solid clank, it‚Äôs more than just surface rust and you should be worried.
Doesn't look dead yet, just not as easy to work on as a car without rust...
Most cars in UK look like this after 4/5 years.
Tried pouring coke on it?
Bro that‚Äôs some epic rust where do you drive to work? SpongeBobs diner?
It‚Äôs a time bomb
Is this a frontier? I feel like i recognize that suspension
go to a real mechanic
Hahaha xD no wonder. Everything needs to be replaced. EVERYTHING!  Get a donor car to scrap for parts is my advice. Too much? Then scrap and get something els :)
I live in the West coast and wondering if the underside was washed once a week and maybe treated with WWD wouldn‚Äôt  that slow the rust if not stop it completely ? I saw a frame nearly cracked in half. It‚Äôs nuts
Just looks like a normal day in northern Minnesota!
You can always work on it. Doesn‚Äôt it look fun?
Brush it off, treat it, do it again every couple of years.
Looks like you need a real mechanic who can handle a broken bolt or two
Western mechanic here.... I guess I'm in the "OMG RUN AWAY!!!" Crowd.... 

 But my reasoning is that while I would do this work for a friend who paid me, I would not do it at my work... namely because we offer guarantees on our labor, I have liabilities to consider.... 

If I were to replace a strut, sway bar link might break in the process of trying to remove it, and then, shop eats that cost, if a bolt breaks, it's extra time I'm not getting paid for to remove the damn thing from whatever it broke inside of. 

I see a liability... one that will get me yelled at for attempting to help someone out, and youre sure AF not going to be willing to watch the price tag for the work and the parts continue to climb at each "next step" .... which means... if I lose company good money, it either comes from my paycheck, or I don't get jobs like it for a while....

So... yes... would do it for a friend, if I was paid to, if they knew going in to am agreement with me, that breakage may be unavoidable, and that it doesn't come out of our agreed total.
Not that bad, you just need a mechanic that is used to working on cars like this
Mate you should see my 20 year old car
Don't see any holes run it
Like the rest of yas in the Northeast, I'd tackle it. I've owned vehicles much worse. I'm not saying those fasteners will come out easy but I'm confident I could do it in my driveway on my back. üëç
Why aren‚Äôt cars offered with more comprehensive corrosion prevention for areas such as the north of America and Canada?
What happened? Did you buy this car from King Triton?
Where‚Äôd you buy this from Atlantis from a guy that talks to fish
‚ÄúJust‚Äù bought it *two years ago*?
It's not beyond recovery, but it all needs stripping down; a lot of new components will be required, and its likely there will need to be some structural welding at mount points.

So the mechanic wont touch it because he/she knows it's a really big job, will come with a massive bill and will tie up his/her time and workshop for probably a couple of weeks.

Mechanics want to service lots of customers as swiftly as possible to make the business pay. With this there's a high risk of getting bogged down in this one job, having to lose other customers who can't wait, and then your job might keep getting bigger as more is revealed, and you may be so horrified at the cost at the end of it that it becomes a dispute.

If he/she knows the bill will likely be $8k and it's a $3k car, they're doing you a favour by turning it down.

In a way, at this point, you kind of need a restoration person not a daily mechanic. This doesn't really fit inside the jobbing mechanics business model.
Take it somewhere and trade it on something that isn't rusty
You didn't use Kroil as bait?
Hope there was a rust discount offered when you made your car purchase dealers know the condition there selling their cars top and bottom of the car those damn scamming dealers look underneath before buying your next car
Wow

Have underside cleaned professionally 

Then lather only the metal with those cheap Chinese anti rust sprays 
Rinse and inspect again

And probably prepare to weep üò≠
What is he scared off ? Yeah new suspension pieces will expensive but everything but the frame and the knuckle will get replaced , and those will get a good scrubbing
Looks like it‚Äôs taken some sea water during it‚Äôs lifetime.
There's some car in your rust, sir/ma'am
Eric at South Main Auto would easily take care of this
Your mechanic is pathetic. That‚Äôs like a 5 year old car over here in the UK
New control arm new strut assembly
Looks like a Subaru? Fresh coil springs, probably from the recall they had on those a while back. That means it was in the dealership and they felt comfortable doing the work. I think you're good to go.
I live in NYC suburbs and that's not unusual around here for maybe ~20yr old car...  yours looks bad but not the worst.

I did own a R1 Pathfinder (2005), and I am surprised that your AC is still working as my rear AC line galvanically rusted within the warranty period and had to be replaced (in 2007).

In regards to your car, I would do what someone said in the comments.  Take off the offending wheel, put car on jackstands (do NOT work on your car while it is on the scissor jacks), and pry the backing plate away from back of the rotor, or ask to see if a shop will be willing to do that.

I just got my son his first car, a 2017 pathfinder with mild rust (surface rust, but nuts were rusted well).  I had to use one of them yellow can torches and heat the nuts and then use a harbor freight air tool (and a dewalt 20v impact wrench) to get the nuts off, but I have managed to replace (dollars is part cost : second is hours it took):
New front control arms and sway bar linkages($120:10 hrs)
New Inner and outer tierods ($108:10hrs)
New Front struts, rear shocks and all mounting HW($200:6hrs)
New front bearings/hubs and dust shields ($120:9hrs)
New front rotors and pads, rebuild front calipers ($118:6hrs)
New rear rotors, pads, and new rear calipers ($170:4hrs)
New transmission filters, gasket, and drain procedure ($140:5hrs)
New spark plugs and PCV ($50:3 hrs)

I was out in my driveway everyday for two whole weeks.
The lady who sold me the car was not from around here and her ex-husband gave her the car, and she did not have the $ to pay a mechanic to fix them.

The pathfinders are surprisingly easy to work on, and the number of hours I listed is to show you how long it took because of hand tools but mostly because of rust-siezed bolts.  But it CAN be done.

My sons car rusted weird.  Only light surface rust on the subframe,  little to no rust on body (mines a unibody), and a ton of rust on bolts, nuts, and suspensions.

I had to learn how to work on my car because back in 2004 I dropped out of my PhD program (biology) and my wife also got very ill and got hospitalized.  I knew NOTHING about cars and YouTube channels didn't exist like they do now, so I had to learn by going on nissan forums and using Chilton/Haynes manual books.  Things are a bit better with a ton of youtube videos.

As others have said, it CAN be done.  I am guessing that with your financial situation, you went to the cheapest local garage.  The local garages around here are useless and for thevjob I did, they would probably be wanting ~$4000-$6000 on labor alone.

I got most of parts from nissan online, becsuse Nissan had a summer sales with free shipping over this summer, and when they were still too expensive, I got my struts and shocks from ebay.

I was walking into my nissan dealer parts dept (you order from online with discount and they deliver to your local dealer) almost every other day and the parts guys finally said, "you trying to build yourself a Pathfinder?  You do know, we also sell fully built cars".  I told him what I wrote.  On a Saturday end of the day, he insisted that his mechanic throw my Pathfinder on a lift and do a safety check of my work.

The mechanic said all work looks good, and said I saved thousands.

So...  I would go around and look for a mechanic that would be willing to tackle the job, AND shop around as you will get different labor quotes.

Things like brakes, they are so easy to learn how to do.  I would go get jackstands from Harbor Freight (some may day their jackstands are shit, but there was a recall and now they should be safe), and a set of Pittsburgh brand socket wrenches in metric and box wrenches in metric, and a bunch of screwdrivers and pliers (they didn't have HF around here in '07, my biggest cost was cost of tools).

You can also look for a shop that will remove rusted nuts and bolts and replace them with new ones (google nissanpartsonline), so you can drive it back home, and then use hand tools to do you brake jobs.  You still pay them for hourly labor of temoving the rusted bolts and buts, but at leadt you will save labor on rwdt of the work and parts cost.

Autozone does free rental of specialty tools.  You do have to put down 100% deposit which you get back when you return them.

I rented bearing puller slide hammer which made the rusted bearing come out with four taps.


Also, around here, buying parts and bringing it to a local mechanic isn't too much cheaper as they often uncharged on labor to make up for not being able to sell you their parts for profit.
Is the reason the mechanic won't touch it in the room with us? Shit looks better than some of the 2018 cars I've seen in MI
It‚Äôs all cosmetic, the problem would be if you were to hit it and a hole formed. They‚Äôre lazy.
What‚Äôs wrong? Springs in perfect condition!
So screwed
That's how cars look in the UK after 6 months.
mechanic is a weenie.  That‚Äôs standard practice for vehicles in nj.   I mean cmon you still have both gas tank straps!
I‚Äôd touch that
Find a second mechanic.
With no disrespect to my day 1 mechanic, and tbf to him hes nice and honest with me and will even recommend another to try, but if he says he aint doing a job, my money goes elsewhere. 
I had a gasket that needed doing but he wasnt willing to chance damage doing so amd costing me alot more money, so he sent me elsewhere.
I think those that use garages/mechanics, should have 2-3 trustworthy ones. I have 2. My day 1, knows my cars as well as i do, will encourage me to do my own job (if possible) or at least knows a good reputable mechanic.
My second is a recommendation from the first and i cant fault him at all. It started with a gasket and he found other problems too whilst doing it. Not only that but he gave me a little leeway in the bill ‚Ä¶ personal opinion
gay mechanic
It doesn‚Äôt look to be terminal rust cancer yet but it is a lot of surface corrosion, i think it could be cleaned-up and treated with rust converter and then rust-proofed, seems to be worth it! But then again i‚Äôm canadian so i‚Äôm used to that!
That rust is just surface rust, and the mechanic doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. Unless the brake and gas lines are leaking, there‚Äôs no need to replace them. The only parts to worry about are the sway bar linkage, tie rod, and maybe a small area of the frame around the hole. Just sand off what you can, then use primer and paint.
Time for the crushing!
It's more of a liability issue, just had this the other day, if it looks like it's going to fall apart when removing or if something snaps later on down the road the repair shop is going to be on the hook.
If I saw this much rust under my car I‚Äôd loose my mind
OP, you can buy OEM "used" parts on ebay very affordably. Just purchase a part each week. A knuckle, control arm etc. and then replace all at once yourself.
Your mechanic is a baby.
Canadian confused ü§î
Im a Civic guy and not a truck guy and in midwest. So maybe what I think might be gradually purchasable is in fact mechanicallt totalled. My 93 Civic was killed by rust- but it was 16 years and significantly worse. 

But is it that much more expensive on a Nissan Truck to figure out whats truly compromised and swapping it out? 

Especially if you want 3-5 years of work from home service- which is  20-40k miles tops and presumably rarely that far from home base. 

Even Jeeps in these parts (pickups arent as common but there are some outside of work vehicles) get compromised by potholes and speedbumps eventually and need suspension work in rust belt cities. 

Truth be told, its what puts a lot of cars under because I dont think people understand what owning a high mileage car can entail. 

At some point just brakes, tires, and shocks are gonna cost as much as the car is worth and its dice rolling time.
Did you park it in a pile.of salt? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Looks like my 05 MGM. Most of that is replaceable with the exception of the frame. As long as the frame is solid under the rust, you can scrape off the scale and paint over it with POR-15.  For the replaceable components, it depends on your toolbox and skillset.

The rust makes everything 10x harder than it should be. Penetrant (Kroil, Mouse Milk, or PB Blaster), heat with a torch or induction heater. Be prepared to have to use a set of bolt extractor sockets, vice grips + hammer (5lb sledge at a minimum), a Sawall, a nut splitter, or any combination thereof to remove the nuts askills etc. For the love of God, don't reuse any of that rusted out hardware unless you clean *all* of the rust off of it, inspect it, and treat it with a corrosion preventative.

For example, it took me about 4 to 6 hours to *remove* my rack & pinion, power steering pump, outer tie rod ends, and all the associated pressure lines because of dealing with the rust. It involved soaking with penetrant every day after work for a week before I started, and a combination of regular sockets + ratchet, electric ratchet, impact gun and impact sockets, vice grips + hammer, ratcheting wrenches, and harsh language.
There's nothing alarmingly bad, but there are definitely parts that will not last 5 more years. I worry about those front brake lines and the fuel tank strap that is specifically focused on in the video. But really this is normal for a vehicle that sees salt and doesn't get an undercoating. 

I don't know your location, but if you are in a place that has to salt the roads, you need to be getting an undercoating yearly if you want to prevent this. Not on this car, of course, but on your next one. There's also different kinds of coating that don't need to be reapplied yearly
get a new mechanic..
‚ÄúJust‚Äù bought it 2 YEARS AGO? I wouldn‚Äôt say you just bought it. But if you‚Äôve been driving it regularly since then it would have come like that. Live and learn‚Ä¶ Always inspect under a used vehicle before buying. And for what it would cost to repair/replace everything that‚Äôs rusted, you might as well just drive it until you can‚Äôt anymore then sell it for parts.
This would pass as certified pre-owned in Onatrio lol
ü´°
Well, the entire suspension and subframe are gone.   The actual frame is getting there.   My advice is to look underneath a vehicle before buying another one in the future.  Idk why your mechanic won't work on it, but it needs a lot of work, so if you don't have a decent chunk of change right now, might not be an option for you.  Was this a flood vehicle?  Are you in a restrictive inspection state?  Depending on where you are it might be zero issue or it could end up failing inspection.  I know in New York and Vermont this would fail.  Florida there is no inspection.
I would be most concerned about brake and fuel lines with this much rust. Brake line suddenly leaks out and you're in trouble (been there happened to me, fortunately it burst open right in my driveway). Replaced all the lines to the master.
Forget that rust bucket, watermelon crawl EVERYWHERE!!
This is what cars look like in areas that use road salt consistently 3-4 months of the year.  Very normal underside where I live.  The vehicle is fine, find a mechanic without soft hands.
Every rusted nut, etc is a candidate to snap off.  #1, spray some PB Blaster on everything.  Don't try to loosen anything.  Spray more PB Blaster on day 2. Let it sit for a couple of days.    
Next - re-evaluate.  I don't see what plate you are talking about, but every bolt you touch is a candidate to snap off.  Each one will probably double your cost.  

If its more likely to break than come off, leave it alone.  Look for a church or charitable org.  Ask if they know of anyone donating a running vehicle.  Explain your circumstance. See if they'll give it to you. Afterwards - pay it forward.
Laughs in Ontario
I have bought and modded cars like this, start by spraying a penetrating liquid over all the bolts, do this periodically before you do any work on that suspension. Also acetylene will be your friend, if you don't have access to acetylene get a couple cans of map gas.


If it's more than a daily and your modding it then you can clean and por 15 the area when your working on it, if por15 is expensive for you buy rubberized undercoating. I don't like the latter because I feel like dirt gets stuck in it.
I can fix it all day no problem
mechanic is a wuss. a good mechanic doesn't flinch at a little rust. good mechanics help you.
Honestly I‚Äôd keep driving it with the knowledge that no repairs can be done because once you touch it, it could be a domino effect of more things breaking which will only bring the repair bill to a higher amount
looks like any vehicle 10 years or older here in Canada.
Go to another mechanic.
Having lost my brakes doing 60mph on a highway, while getting off a downhill exit ramp, i would be carefull listening to people on here telling you it's nothing. While surface rust is no biggie, rusted brake and fuel lines are something you should take very seriously. Good luck.
It's bad, but not run away bad. 

If you're going to keep it for a while, it's worth replacing the worst stuff and treating the remainder.
That looks nice to work on this man would cry if he had to crawl under a ford plow truck out here in new england
"Just bought this", as if 2 years ago was just yesterday.
Me, living in Michigan my whole life: "Looks fine to me." 


But yeah, what other people are saying, find a mechanic who isn't afraid to get their hands dirty
I just ran a car with 1/4 of the frame left in a derby!
You gotta understand that when they start cranking on bolts, stuff is gonna need replaced. All your rubber looks good.  But when they tell you a connecting rod broke or your A arm is bad, you are gonna come back here with a picture of your invoice asking if you are getting screwed and not want to pay to fix it.  Mechanics can see into the future
‚ÄúLaughs in winter salt usage state‚Äù
Rust belt special
Well you don‚Äôt have to drive. You could just do the watermelon crawl
On a limited budget, you're pretty screwed. That's a couple thousand dollars worth of parts and labor.
Doesn‚Äôt look bad at all.. Get some rust converter
A lot of it is FUBAR (IMO based on the video) how ever I would check with other mechanics (just incase one scams you you have other mechanics to fall back on) but as someone who has worked and lived in New England all my life, these things are pretty common
It‚Äôs fine
doesnt look too bad - make sure the frame passes the screwdriver test (bang on the rustiest parts with a screwdriver and make sure it doesnt go through) but it sounds like your mechanic just doesnt see northern vehicles lol
Canada?
Wdym mechanic won‚Äôt touch it
Another day im thankful i  live in a desert üôè
OP. Where are you located? I started my career as a tech in Connecticut, where this would be no big deal. I wrenched for 9 years in Florida and then 18 in South Carolina where this would send most mechanics running for the hills. I personally wouldn't touch it.
My shop is in massachusetts. I restore truck frames. That doesn't look bad up here. https://www.facebook.com/p/Cape-Cod-Undercoating-Frame-Restoration-100068883192104/
It looks like just about every car I've worked on in south Dakota.  Mechanic just doesn't want to have to break anything loose
Noting a little WD40 can‚Äôt fix
That‚Äôs normal for northeast get a new mechanic
Dude I see worse on the beach trucks around here. I just charge a bit more, and have a torch for the really tough stuff. I think a lot of shops just want the gravy and want to charge like it‚Äôs so damn hard to do.
I see why almost everything is rust no one would want to deal with that mess probably can‚Äôt get nothing apart easy and everything might end up needing replaced at the end of the job compared to the one thing that‚Äôs wrong
Has it been under water
Did you park it in the ocean or something? rofl
Just paint black paint over it
It's only surface rust. You got a lot of work ahead of you
Mechanic needs to hit the gym
Seen worse up in Illinois.   Likely sat outside its entire life but unless I missed it, the frame isn‚Äôt rotted entirely.  

Repairs to keep it long term would cost a pretty penny , I‚Äôd replace the shocks , the control arms , the brake lines , the calibers ‚Ä¶ basically it runs okay but it‚Äôs getting eaten so won‚Äôt last wildly long. 

To make it great for the long term, it would cost more than it is worth ‚Ä¶ but If you love it - the investment is worth it.    If you don‚Äôt?  Fix a problem as it comes up and then junk it for something less rotted eventually.   I‚Äôd be surprised if multiple mechanics won‚Äôt touch that but also only can see what I see in this video.

When buying used up here in the rust belt, always check under the car!

I am from Texas, and even I'll say I've seen worse. Nothing but a little surface rust.
Lesson learned look underneath next time
Lazy parts changer
Nothing a can of Rustoleum can‚Äôt fix. /s
Take it to like‚Ä¶Iowa. They‚Äôll fix it lmao.
Every car I have owned has looked like that. Weld in patches or replacement frame rails when needed and keep going.
This mechanic is garbage, I've run into the same types movingbfrom the northeast to the southwest. Vehicle is not too bad with rust, but some just won't touch it. Never had this problem up north.
Just spray it all vanta black and call it a home
The Movie Rust lol
Find a new mechanic. This is surface rust, the bolts might be annoying and there's some clamps, bushings, and joints that should be looked at more closely but there's nothing dangerous here. Just make sure you're getting it fluid filmed every fall and your car should be fine.
Looks like my wife's 2005 focus zxw. One of the rear coil springs broke apart in 4 spots! Suspension bits are basically fused together with rust... Spring clamp my last hope to install the replacement... I told her "consider this car temporary"
There's a reason WD-40 is sold in 5 gal and drums.
Not very. Don't drive fast. Recognize that rust can still be strong.

Thiis is possible a case of "we are not a restoration shop and do not deal with advanced rust. Our plate is full of desirable work already. This is not desirable to us."

Or "We have enough infractions on our shops insurances and license already.... so please, another person."


In general, the idea with the car industry went from having something you can repair to just letting it be another's problem and buying new when the insurance liability becomes too large. 

Most service industries operate like a McDonald's. Bigger longer projects aren't their favorite. Small prepackaged and quick projects are preferred. So don't take it personally, just try different shops.
Just find a different mechanic, nothing out of the ordinary shitbox rust belt vehicle.
About a pothole from everything falling apart...lol
Not even that bad. Tis surface rust. Grind and spray with a can of rust protectant paint
A lot of WD 40
After reading your story I'd sell it or sell it back and if he won't take it back get yourself a lawyer because that's a "lemon" and there's laws for that. Then use the money to buy a cheap but dependable used car after you checked it yourself and test drove it. Look the car, year and model up online and see what people are saying about it online. Stay away from nissan cars specifically the 2014 nissan sentras as their transmissions have a short lifespan. We are on our 2nd tranny and have to sell it. Good luck and hope it all works out
Where are you located?
How Far is your commute to work?
Not screwed. Your mechanic sucks.
Do it yourself Man !!!!!!
Eh it‚Äôs not all that bad, scaly but I don‚Äôt see rot
Buy a case of PB Blaster & spray everything you may need to take apart‚Ä¶ But anywhere that uses salt, or that other shit they spray on the roads (like in the northeast) destroys steel at an alarming rate‚Ä¶
That stuff‚Äôll buff right out. You‚Äôll be fine.¬†
A lot of it is just surface and some looks a little deeper. Only a true strength test would tell you but if you start chipping at it, you‚Äôll probably find out rust is what‚Äôs holding some of that together. 

I‚Äôd plan on needing something within the next year or so. Definitely start doing rust inhibitors on the bottom of the cars you get in the future, you‚Äôll save yourself from this headache a little longer. Especially if you live in an area that uses road salt and brine.
I'm from Canada and this looks okay, not too rusty at all lol
Did you park it at an ocean beach for the last two years?
For everyone here saying this is normal in colder climates... There's rust, and then there's corrosion.

If you look closely, you can see many areas where the metal is badly corroded, to the point where there could easily be failures in many places. Yes, this is mostly the suspension we're seeing here, a lot of which could be replaced (still not cheap though). But we're also not seeing everything. That much corrosion in other places might make this vehicle pretty unsafe.
Standard rust.
lmao must not live near any coastlines huh?
California mechanic here, wouldn‚Äôt touch it with a 10 foot pole taped to a 20 foot pole unless you‚Äôre paying like 3x book time.
It's not done yet.
Some areas need attention like around the brakes, the hoses especially.
A few hours with a wire brush or a dustless media blaster followed up by a lot of lanolin or fish oil and you'll be ok.

After removing the crap you might find some things that need fixing like sway bar link pin etc.
Please...that the mechanic won't touch it, but there is someone out there who has half a brain and can make it work for you.there is obviously damage from rust, but I d be hammer testing the main points. Your suspension components. The main. Stuff first and go from there. I know it really doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman, but I am a female. I never worked on a car other than detailing a day in my life. I taught myself how to do brake all around rotors inner and outer tie rods, out a new front end on my Elantra GT after being nailed with a deer. I did my own alternator, timing belts, and read shocks, struts, oil, and tranny fluid changes regularly in the last 3 years because it pained me to pay so much money for parts theb some fool to put them on for ne when I did everything myself and am fine. Saved me and my partner 1000s of dollars. And probably from being ripped off, too. Idk how much you know about cars, but I knew enough to YouTube research and give it an honest shot. Ran into shit like learning how to drill put rotor screws that won't come out or are stripped. I was defeated the 1st time. But I looked up DIY how to every road block I hit. Now I'm doing it in no time. This weekend, I dropped my whole steering shaft to open up my power steering to replace the bushing rubber thingy that's in there. $5 part. It is like 3 or 400 on labor if Someone doesn' try too rip me off.  You can do some of it for sure. Ypu have a bunch of rust and some component that def need replacing so you'll need some help but you can def do some of that shit yourself. If I can anybody can.
Looks ok to me. Wash your car more during the winter. Salt is a killer
I wouldn't touch it either .. looks like if you sneezed under there half the frame would fall apart..
He won't work on rust?  I don't know, seems to be a lot of surface rust on the underbody.  If you have any intentions on driving this thing for a couple of years, get it undercoated, perhaps spray a bunch of rust converter on it first to get that process to stop.  Some formulas do both.  A different mechanic might work on it, but ultimately, if you want to save the underneath from rotting out in a couple of years, undercoating is really a no-brainer, but you are nearing the point of being too late.  You can do it yourself even, I tend to use woolwax with an airless paint sprayer but it makes the entire underneath a sticky mess for a while.  It will at the very least help stop the existing rust.  I do see some flaking metal in the back but the frame looks solid.

Who TF cares about A/C lines.  If they break, you don't have A/c.  nothing safety wise is associated with this.

Power steering could be an issue but again, I've driven vehicles without it.  Some older vehicles don't even have power steering, so yeah.  

On the cheap side of things, bar and chain oil could neutralize some of that rust.  I've made homemade formulations of grease, bar and chain, and used motor oil, and it seems to work okay.
Your mechanic is a coward. Or a southerner. Either way that's fuckin mint for another 100k if you keep the oil changed.
did you not crawl under it and inspect it before buying? I wouldn't touch it either as a mechanic.
You buy this from SpongeBob or what? Jesus Christ
There‚Äôs a million reasons why a mechanic said too rusty to touch. 

He‚Äôs actually afraid of screwing up your car and getting fired. 

He just doesn‚Äôt like you personally because of your looks or you remind him of someone.  

Who knows. But that  guy is not to be trusted because he‚Äôs conjecture doesn‚Äôt match up with reality. 

It‚Äôs a working car. It will get you places.
Everything here is a cut off and throw away. That includes the frame. The entire vehicle is gone my friend. That‚Äôs why they won‚Äôt touch it. Your mechanic is an ethical business I‚Äôd say.
Put it on a truck and take it to the scrap metal merchants
The oxy torch will take most of that off nicely
You‚Äôre not screwed. You just need a new vehicle.
rust bucket.
I think any mechanic who refuse to work on this should go to jail because mechanics means they work with any type of situation why would to just fix easy problems but not the big ones the  they shouldn't call themself mechanics but fixer
This exactly wouldn‚Äôt faze me at all. Every car in mn after 5 years looks like this.
Desert west coast " what dafuk is this"
As a southern mechanic, I see dollar signs when this stuff rolled in.
Was literally just about to say this. I was a mechanic for only a few years in the north and I‚Äôve seen WAY worse than this.
This guy is insanely accurate. Went from Indiana to Texas and my god do i miss my mechanic.
Yeah, most of that is surface rust hah. Looks good
It's true
As a southern mechanic, can confirm
As a southern mechanic I couldn't agree more y'all rust buckets are held together by rust and dreams! Down here we just don't have any experience with frame kits welding cars back together
Well, this surely looks bad indeed.  I can understand the shop's reluctance to get involved here.  Bolts, parts may just start breaking/crumbling during the repair, just leading to a bigger expense.  Exactly what backing plate is rubbing?  The shop is worried about the liability of getting involved with this job, once they touch it, they can be held responsible for future failures, I understand their position.  

On the other hand, most vehicles up north look like this underneath after a few years.  Sometimes things look much worse than they are.  I would get another opinion.  Where do you live?  If you live down south, the shop's response is what I would expect.  This is kind of like bringing an outboard motor that has been used in salt water to an inland repair shop that has only ever worked on clean fresh water units.
Yep, in Southern California run from it. Up here in Maine not that bad. There are a few things but if you do not have NE skills that's scary looking.
That's what I was going to comment. Bring it to a shop in New England; everyone's suspension looks like that.
So true üòÇ
Born and raised in the south. Just started a mechanic shop and have learned cars differ in the north. Could you explain how?
took my 5yo wisconsin truck to a dealer in austin for a recall.  "uh it took us a really long time cuz there's a lot of rust."

"haha yea."
Eric at South Main: "Oooh I get to play with the gas wrench today!"
Yup, from New England. PB blaster, heat, time, and tons of patience lol
Right! I was just looking at it and thinking ‚Äúmeh seen much worse.‚Äù
This really isn‚Äôt that bad. Smh.
We really have tho ü§£ü§£ there is a Nissan Titan sitting in front of my shop missing 18" of frame...
I'm literally watching this and thinking, "is that it? I've seen and worked on waaaay worse."
Yeah, I don‚Äôt see any structural rot (this is a quick vid though so may have missed it not shown something).   It‚Äôs all covered in rust, but nothing looks fucked.  The only thing I‚Äôd mildly hate is having to break loose rusted fasteners and bolts.  It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt do it, just will take a little longer.  (Note, I‚Äôm not a pro, I just work on all my own stuff and a few friends classic cars)
Was gonna say, my daily driver has been worse for 4 years and I work on it more often than I‚Äôd like to lmao. Does it make everything way harder than it needs to be? Sure, but that‚Äôs just living in the rust belt. Anything is possible with enough tools. OP I‚Äôd suggest you watch a shit ton of YouTube videos and buy the tools necessary to do the jobs yourself if a mechanic won‚Äôt touch it. You‚Äôre not doing engine work here, so you can‚Äôt screw it up too bad ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è did he at least rip off the backing plate for you? If it‚Äôs the dust shield it‚Äôs not necessary so just take it off, should only be a couple bolts.
Southern mechanics are wimps, if they have to take more than 5 minutes removing a bolt they give up.
Lol it's got bigger problems than a backing plate. Lower control arm is crumpled up like a soda can
Right rear spring is snapped in half.
Or he has so much work he's able to turn away anything he doesn't want to work on ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
They can move to Tucson, AZ. Only see rust when the snowbirds are around.
Oh I would work on it.  With the understanding that a 2hr job could turn into a day+ job, and I am going to get paid for the work I put into it.
[deleted]
Thats just a normal looking undercarriage when I'm from.  Maybe the bad side of normal, but nothing I would be too afraid of short term.  Long term I would be intending to kill it with miles before it dies from rust but your a ways away from that.  I'm guessing its never had its undercarriage oiled.  Not a bad idea to start doing that every fall from now on.
Go to an actual mechanic
My money was on a Chrysler product.
Are you in SOCAL? This just needs to be addressed with a trustworthy mechanic that has seen cars from northern states.

My only fear for you is that this is also a salvage title and you‚Äôre about to enter a world of (electronic harness, sensor, etc) pain.
Not sure the year of my buddy's, but he's over 300k miles, dependable if maintained
I just use chain on all my rusted tank strap situations. Get everything flat and where the straps were. Bolt it down and it will outlast the vehicle. Source: me. I've done it to both steel and plastic tanks.
How much does it usually cost to get the frame cleaned + coated?
\^ this  
but I'll also add, use the wire-brush just to get the loose/flaking crap off, then use Ospho to neutralize the rust, THEN coat it in fluid film. Fluid film by itself slows down the rust, but doesn't stop it. The rust needs to be rendered inert with a phosphoric-acid based product.
i was gonna say, im from the salt belt and our rust looks different.
It can't be stuck if it's liquid!
Have you ever been north of Georgia?  This is just what cars look like in half the country.  This isn't even bad.
Move to the desert
I was thinking the same thing. Those rear springs are fucked too
This shit is normal for vehicles anywhere north of Georgia.

100%
Man, I apologize for the stupid smartass comment. I didn‚Äôt realize your situation and meant no harm. I joke to much. I wish I actually had some decent advice or a solution for ya but¬†
I‚Äôm at a loss for that. Don‚Äôt spend too much time or money on it. Even like it is you may still get some good use out of it for awhile.¬†
Ya it's hard to give a estimate..I'd go to a private backyard mechanic that can put the time in.. what kind of car is it. How old. Why doesn't op just buy used car with cash no need for credit.
Dry Ice blasting and lanolin would do it.
Yup, minnesotan here with a 2000 tacoma that looks just like that. 

What you gotta do is go around and give it the ‚Äúhammer test‚Äù Just take a pointy hammer and start really seeing how bad it is everywhere. 
If the hammer goes straight through then you‚Äôre gonna wanna bust it all off, sand it down and paint it. and then hopefully it isn‚Äôt a big enough hole or crack where the overall structurally integrity is in jeopardy.

Your frame is the biggest concern. If anywhere on frame snaps then obviously you‚Äôre completely screwed, your trucks just a giant paper weight at that point. Unless you can weld or know someone else who can. Most places wont do it for liability reasons. 

I had a strut mount completely brake off on my frame, and I got lucky that it didn‚Äôt effect the overall integrity of it, but I did have to go through the process of welding a new mount on which was not easy. 

Also, my suspension looked just like yours and I just got done swapping it all out. Cost about 900 bucks and 3 long days of pretty brutal work. I ended up just saw zaling and angle grinding everything off. 

Are you screwed, no, but you‚Äôre gonna have to watch it and most likely problems will start coming your way so better to be preemptive
Exactly. Get some PB blaster, an impact and a torch. Good to go.
I do not have sound on, so if there's something glaringly pointed out there, I'm not hearing it. I live in the TN mountains and I've wrenched on junk for decades, first of necessity, then just habit. 

My MiL had a Pontaic (generic sedan) 10 years ago, where the car was parked and the control arm broke. It was a pretty heinous looking event, and thank God she wasn't driving it. That said, a local shade-tree guy bought it for $200, welded it up and his wife was driving it the last time it was seen. 

While that's a lot of rust, that doesn't (automatically) mean it's structurally unsound, ...yet. As far as that degree of surface rust, I have a field of Volvos, likely in the same condition and I wouldn't be afraid to drive them. I'm voting with the northern guys here. 

Also, the only backing plate I can think of is protecting the brake rotor from the inside, if it is rubbing and making noise, it may have taken a rock or something and need to be bent back out away from the rotor. It's kind of a heavy-duty splash guard, but can be bent with your hand (or a screwdriver).
As much as a hate dealing with rust I run away from stuff you see daily. You guys can make some rust like nobodies business
this rust is quite bad, though. this is beyond surface rust. it‚Äôs fair to be worried about replacing one specific part when all of it could be replaced.

if they‚Äôre only replacing one part complications can arise
What are you doing to your cars? I live in MN and have had cars with over 250k miles that don't look nearly this bad
Oh yeah, that's surface rust here
This is why the death rate in American roads is 5x that of Europe adjusted for population and miles driven
Have you personally worked on stuff like this?
Not a pro, but native west coast, and exactly! My 1973 motorhome doesn't have rust like that!
Sure, if the customer is willing to actually fix it
Fluid film and be gone
For starters down here it's hot and wet, up there it's cold and dry (except when it's not). The cold means corrosive road salt. The freezing contraction -> wet -> thermal expansion -> dry + corrosive pattern does material and surface damage over time.
[deleted]
? looks fine to me.  I would want to get pokey with a screwdriver before I gave it the green light but I don't expect I would find anything I'm concerned with in that.
this is probably the case, but also, labor on this thing is going to be more expensive simply because of the extra time and car to get stuff apart without stripping / breaking stuff... and repairing what strips and breaks. 

So quotes for work are going to be inflated especially compared to averages.
Just got to worry about your car flipping over or catching on fire randomly.  Swear everytime I went to Tucson there was either a burnt car or one flipped over somewhere ü§£

I love sharing this photo. Rusty ohio bumper beam. Replaced with one from Tucson junkyard. Same age part.
Lol good for you.... living near the ocean is nothing compared to where they salt the roads.

That's a little bit of surface rust in OPs pic, if this scares you from working on it then, again...... You wouldn't survive a day where I am.
I live by the ocean.  Knowing what ocean rust looks like.  It's not near as bad as a rust belt car coming down for the winter.  You notice it right away, just a different type of harsh rust from salted roads.
Exactly. I'm in Colorado, where we DON'T have major problems with a ton of undercarriage rust and salt corrosion, but I still see plenty of vehicles like this. I agree with these others that you CAN expect labor times to be inflated because everything is going to be more of a PITA, but there is no reason anything on there can't be replaced and no reason that it can't be driven so long as you replace anything that ACTUALLY needs replaced, as it fails. 

One thing I like to do on these kinds of vehicles is intensely pressure wash the undercarriage to remove all loose rust, dirt, salt and other contaminants, and then spray the entire undercarriage with a good rust treatment like POR-15 rust remover, Rust cure formula 3000 or a similar rust remover/converter product.

That will get you by, but if you can get it cleaned up halfway decent, it might also not be a bad idea once you do to apply some actual POR-15 rust preventative coating that you brush on to all areas where it is reasonably safe to do so. You don't want to spray things that shouldn't have coatings on them like axle shaft boots, rubber lines, etc. 

But there is no reason an actual, experienced and knowledgeable mechanic would refuse to work on this. Heck that guy, find somebody else.
your half correct, Nissan is the Chrysler of Japan.
I'm in the rust belt too and it does look different.  Rust belt vehicles only rust what the snow touches. This is rusted everywhere, everywhere the air touches.
Doesn‚Äôt have the speckles üòî
It reall does look different. I thought maybe it was the camera lighting
Same up here. That‚Äôs why u get an oil undercoat spray every year
I‚Äôm in Tennessee and this is maybe 1 out of 10,000 vehicles. (You said anywhere north of Georgia)
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I would upvote you five times five if I could. Very well said.
This dude rust belts.
100%, gotta check how bad it is, most joints will have several different metals, accelerating the corrosion process since theyre in contact. I‚Äôd be sure to check all joints.
In 2017, I worked with a guy whose truck frame was rusted into at least two pieces, and had a hole in the gas tank. 

He drove it around town picking up junk and delivering pizzas. As far as I know, he‚Äôs still driving it.
As a guy who grew up in Michigan, I completely agree with this.  I bought a '99 s-10 a few years ago when I moved to Oregon.  I couldn't believe how immaculate the underside was after 20+ years.
Needle gun/descaler is critical in the salty parts of the country for sure. Maine experience here
Oh yep I saw the other side. Good eye! Damn I'm so glad I'm not in the rust belt
Right ü§£ü§£ every time I post here no one notices the failure it‚Äôs just look oh my rust. Like guys NE techs live this life
In NJ you can live near the ocean, where they salt the roads in winter, AND where it hits crazy humidity levels all summer.
Oh I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd survive lol
Haha so true!
I live about 1,000 feet from the Pacific Ocean and my 08 Ranger has almost no rust.
Looks like a plow truck, honestly. I've never seen a sea water rusty vehicle. 

If that's what this is it would make sense they look the same.
Mmkay. 

Anywhere north of Tennessee

You are all fkn nuts by European annual testing standards
Cameras do tend to enhance rust and make it look worse. Still, I can see someone not in the rust belt (could also be a flood car) noping out.
Seems like the people think otherwise

It is the annual Redbull Homerun in √Öre, Sweden. First skier and snowboarder down wins. 'Avalanche'-start and its chaotic. They also have a price for best costume while making it down. Think a Legolas snowboarder took it home last year. And ofc... the boarders fault.
The one going behind can always do something. You have to be careful and consider that you may need to stop to avoid killing someone. It's like cars, if you hit from behind, you pay 90% of the time.
everyones fault for going so fast on a tiny run
Everyone here is at fault.

K I get that it's busy but like how do 80% of these people not know how to stop without falling over?  You can tell who actually knows what their doing in the video and who should not even be at the hill in the first place.  Smh
It‚Äôs flat. How do you fall there?
Last one to the lifts is a rotten egg
Everyone‚Äôs fault.
Me and the boys on our way to get to the dropped rope
I am laughing so hard at these comments
Fault: vail mountain resorts
Everyone uphill of the skiiers are at fault. They have right of way, and everyone uphill is going too fast for such a crowded area/terrain. It‚Äôs unsafe.
Looks like the two skiers that crashed in the beginning it‚Äôs their fault
Pictured: the bunny slope on all of the northeastern US trails
Straight to jail, everybody on the slope, right away
ALL the skiers, obviously.
Definitely the skier.
I was just thinking this looked like long John on mt. Snow
Death Race 2000 is what we call Creek on a Saturday
Amen
This is too funny. Going there tomorrow, ha!
Learned how to ride on that mountain. Now even a busy trail out west feels wide open lol
Lmfao

Absolutely 100% true

It gets SO SO BUSY at Creek, its bananas
Mountain Creek!!
Can confirm
this is gonna be south this entire weekend
MOUNTAIN CREEK MENTIONED LETS FUCKING GOOOOO üëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπüëπ

Omg a reference I understand
Damn section 8!
Sounds like fun
Belt parkway at Hunter
Average Friday night experience there
I fucking despise this place
It‚Äôs always the skiers fault, according to my boarder friend.
D.  All of the above
It was a skier who probably came up with that crazy idea.
Why? I was thinking it was the boarder? They looked a little panicked and uncomfortable with the speed while the skiers looked a bit more relaxed til they were taken out!
Your mom was waiting at the end. Free handies Thursday
Its a Red Bull event
Also snowboarders racing skiers head to head lol
Yeah I feel like this is the ski resorts fault for not putting up huge ass signs that say slow down right there
East coast style
ask any marathon or the tour de france or basically anything. wtf are you talking about?
Chinese downhill
I miss the game road rash
Lmfao that‚Äôs amazing
I like doing that
When you‚Äôre cruising: ski/ride at risk level lower than your skill level

When you‚Äôre racing: ski/ride at risk level at your skill level

Layman‚Äôs term: stuff like this will happen when you race with many other people at once. Not great organizing but the skiers/riders signed up for this and should expect ‚Äúsh*t happens‚Äù
It‚Äôs a Red Bull event, this is part of the fun
Blame? 100% as intended
Same who the f thought this would work out lol. It just takes one.
It‚Äôs a Red Bull event
I was thinking yakety sax
What do skiers dream of when they take a little skier snooze.
Classic 80‚Äôs ski movie vibes. Hot Dog the movie comes to mind
I think it's Red Bull Homerun in √Öre, Sweden.
*I believe this is*

Whata tha fucka is da Chinese Downheel?
I‚Äôd rather have some buffalo wings.
Yes, and he was a genius! I'm assuming it was a he cause I'm right. Only a forever man-child would think this up. And we thank him for that.
As some one who worked at a hill for a year in Japan, can sadly confirm this is all too true.  They come to take a picture at the top then straight leg it down the hill.  Most of them refuse a helmet at the shop as well cause it won't look good in the photo either.
This is √Öre, Sweden.

How does it feel to have a friend who is 100% correct
It usually is because skiers tend to be faster on the slope. And it is faster guy job to ensure other are safe.
Ok edit, I see a little why you might blame the middle skier, but they were doing a standard slowdown as the boarder was creeping up behind them and panicked and took em out! Still blame boarder, the F‚Äôd around and found out that they weren‚Äôt ready‚Ä¶in my Kevin Hart voiceüòÅ

You have to bomb it. No matter how fast I try to go I can never get through without unstrapping.
And you don‚Äôt want to be one of those dipshits unstrapping when it inevitably flattens out.

okay well races where people use things that cant stop instantly have pile ups. just so you know. i understand you must be 5 years old or so i assume
For park, I think it is good to warm up below your ability level, practice at your current ability level and then just try to add one or two new things per session. It is safe progress without being stagnant.
Neither of these sports require unpredictable movement Nascar is a circle and street cycling doesn't require you to swerve back and forth. It's not the same. Also the terrain here is so narrow. Looks like everyone got bottlenecked in.

Pretty sure Vail killed it
Yes I √§m, √§lth√∂ugh we d√∂n‚Äôt use ‚Äù√º‚Äù
I can confirm.
Yup, it is the route from the VM8 heading towards the VM6 :) the event in the video is the red bull homerun, it‚Äôs held annually and is just a mass race (everyone starts at the same time) where you race from the top of the mountain down to vm6 loading terminal. 
  
People usually have a bunch of liquid strength in them. Sometimes teams dress up in costumes for fun. It‚Äôs just mayhem

You good bro??
Very good advice. I would also add that you should definitely ride below your level when you start feeling tired
uhhh you can slow down a car by swerving back and forth or braking. you can slow down a bike by swerving back and forth or braking.

this isnt different.
I would 100% expect Vail to kill it. WAY too much liability, not the clean "family appropriate" image they want, added cost etc. Yeah Vail would nope it so fast.

Wow, that sounds great, I might need to visit for this. Thanks!
Airtight skiing
you should organize races where each individual gets their own time on a track. you are a genius.
no im not. i agree with that guy. how could race have a bunch of people jumbled together? im just asking.
I think what you meant to say was "it was an organised race"
You're super weirdly aggressive in your reaction to a simple question
Well you can start by not having a massive fucking bottleneck and having several timed heats. Get your head out of your ass jethro your farts don't smell good
Bought son a used car. Then this happened 
2002 Ford explorer sport Trac
120k miles
4.0 sohc v6

Everything seemed fine but took to a mechanic just to double check everything was okay and then this happened. Took the valve cover off and TONS of sludge.

Do I have any decent options to try before throwing in the towel?  Should I try mystery oil and oil/filter changes and see if I can get this any better or take the loss now?

Sad to see this. The 4.0 V6 had a very finicky and difficult-to-change timing chain and regular oil changes are critical to keeping this particular engine on the road. Clearly the previous owner didn't know or likely didn't care.
Next time, buy a cheap USB borescope off Amazon, connect it to your phone or tablet, open the oil fill cap on the engine, shove the scope in, and have a look around first.
Put the valve cover back on and trade it for something else.
Ah, the post-purchase inspection strikes again
Honestly, I got a Dodge Durango for free once, the oil cap looked like this so I put motor medic in during an oil change and basically chuckled ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in danger‚Äù 

Drove it across country, sold it for $1000. 

Fuck it, dawg.
Do yourself a huge favor and sell it while it is still operable.

These engines are notorious for timing chain/tensioner/guide failures. Even when maintained properly, they frequently fail right around 100-120k miles, generally resulting in catastrophic engine failure.

I am extremely surprised that this engine has survived this long with such poor maintenance, and I can guarantee that the timing system is on its last legs. It **will** fail, and probably in the not so distant future. 

Proactive replacement wouldn't be economical, as the required parts are quite expensive and the engine has to be pulled due to the complex timing system (three chains and the passenger side camshaft is driven from a rear mounted chain). Plus, you'd still be left with a sludged up pile of garbage.

If you insist on keeping it, start looking for a replacement engine ASAP, preferably from a 2004 or newer vehicle, as it will have the updated timing components.

Does it run good? If so, if it‚Äôs fucked it‚Äôs fucked and you‚Äôre going to find out regardless, but I‚Äôd try and save it at the risk of killing it out right, so only do this if you‚Äôre willing to risk it for the biscuit;

Change the oil, but swap one qt of oil for some full synthetic transmission fluid. Trans fluid is just 20wt oil with a lot of detergents and additives in it to keep things clean and low friction, allow it to idle for a bit and then change the oil again, swap another quart again. Change the filter every time you change the oil, use a GOOD filter. The second time, drive it for a bit, get it up to temp and go around town if you feel like it, if you see the oil light come on and/or the pressure gauge drop , stop, the filter is likely plugged. You‚Äôll need to change the filter and oil right then and there, or have it towed. Repeat until oil comes out normal looking, afterwards, remove the valve covers and see what you‚Äôve got. If most of the crazy buildup is gone, and it runs good, you have a fighting chance that the motor isn‚Äôt permanently damaged in a way that will cause any more harm.

However, it could just blow up nearly immediately, though it‚Äôs not that common if it‚Äôs running fine. 

Hope you make it out okay, sorry to see this happened to you.
My advice for future car buying would be to switch the two around. 

Take it to a mechanic FIRST then buy the car if it looks good.
I like how you‚Äôre like ‚Äúthen this happened‚Äù as if pulling the valve cover creates the sludge.
Wow, sorry to see this. It's in rough shape. If you can return it do so. If not, follow what jazzie said.
The motor isn‚Äôt circulating air properly- check the pcv valve and the crank case vent. 

My husband is a mechanic and saw your picture. Best of luck!
If the rest of it is solid, you can make a project out of it.  Clean as much as you can by hand, see if you can raise the engine and drop the oil pan.  Keep running solvent thru it. You'd go thru a number of oil filters and maybe even a case or more of solvents.

If the compression is good, then it's just a matter of time and a few hundred dollars cleaning it up.

You can also pull the engine, break it down and overhaul or rebuild it.
This is why you pay for a prepurchase inspection!
Buying a used car is like conducting a job interview with the seller.
Always look under the oil fill cap, check the oil level, check the coolant reservoir and pop the radiator cap off if the vehicle is cold. 

You can pretty much tell if the vehicle was maintained by doing those few quick checks, only takes about 60 seconds. Take it to a mechanic before you buy, not after. Hopefully you aren‚Äôt out too much money on this deal.
If it were mine here‚Äôs what I would do,

Start scraping the crap out whilst using a shop vac to try to keep as much from falling into the oil gullies. When you have done as much as you can pour a generous amount of diesel onto the camshaft and valves and scrub with a stiff bristle brush. 

Now flush with more diesel and leave it overnight to thin the crap in the sump. Drain the sump replace the filter and fill it with the cheapest oil you can find plus a bottle of Seafoam. Run it for 100 miles and rinse and repeat. 

It‚Äôs going to cost less than $50 and might get you back on the road. 

Good luck.
These are the people that swear you can go 5-10k miles on synthetic oil.. I change mine every 2.5-3k cause it‚Äôs literally the cheapest form of insurance for your motor. And just cause you technically can go longer, doesn‚Äôt mean you should..
That didn‚Äôt just happen‚Ä¶.the seller knew damn well it was full of sludge and that‚Äôs why he got rid of it. Always get inspections on older used cars before dropping money on it
the only way is to physically remove all that by hand any additive you use will just destroy the engine
BG Dynamic Platinum Engine Restoration Service kit application might work.
Try Seafoam. Dump the whole can. Let it idle for a while.  
Replace oil, add Seafoam again. Let it idle a for a while.  
Replace oil, dump Seafoam and this time drive it slowly. Drive it for few days, 1-200 miles.  
Replace oil, add 1/2 Seafoam and drive it for 500 miles.  
Replace oil and drive it.  
One time I saved an engine like this.  
As long as these is no abnormal sounds it should work
My guess is your mechanic didn't even bother to open the cap on the crankcase and look inside.  I would be shocked if opening the crankcase cap wouldn't have shown that this engine was fucked.... 

That said, put the valve cover back on... go buy few gallons of kerosene and a half dozen oil filters.. drain the oil... fill it with kerosene, start the engine and about a minute or two.. but if the oil light comes on shut it off immediately... then drain it and repeat the process just like you were changing the oil over and over... you could also get lots of bottles of seafoam... but kerosene will work for this and is a lot cheaper.   But you need to do this multiple times because its going to be hard to get all these years of neglect dissolved.

In fact with that amount of shit... before you put the crank case on get some wooden popsicle sticks and start scraping as much sludge out as you can.... good luck... but I suspect when you get the sludge out, you are likely going to see some wear on some of the spots you don't want to see it...  This looks like one of those cars where they never changed the oil and just kept topping it off when it was low.
I hate seeing that. For what it‚Äôs worth, I had an explorer last 380k miles before I sold it with this same engine. I stayed on top of the oil changes though. This is such a shame.
Where's the vehicle located? I could come and manually clean up the engine heads, check PCV and a couple other emission related problem areas. If you buy a few choice items for the cleaning and fluid changes. Might be able to save it from a catastrophic failure. Buy you some time to find another buyer.¬† Unless you want me to find s 2004 or newer engine¬† compatible with your unit?¬† Prefer the first choice. 250$ for the cleaning and mobile service to your vehicle.

THIS didn't just happen. Its been happening for a long time.
I have a 90's volvo that looked like that, still driving it

but newer cars have such small oil passages and cheaper bearings, not sure you can do like me. I scrapped the thick parts and shop vac'd out what I could get out, then ran a flush through it and literally filtered hot oil and used it to flush the chunks down to the pan
Honestly homie, just buy a new 4.0 off eBay. If there‚Äôs anything salvageable save it. But you can find a block assembly for pretty cheap and if you already know how to pop the engine and lift it you‚Äôre on the right track :)))
Fill engine top to bottom with kerosene or diesel and let it sit for a day or two. Drain and fill with oil and seafoam. Idle till operating temp. Drain and fill with oil and drive for a week or so then repeat till the oil isn't jet black... it's a process but possibly saveable. Problem is the bearings are probably already washed out.
Flush with kerosene a couple times, will clean out the sludge. Timing chain is another matter, if you‚Äôre lucky
I‚Äôd take the loss if you‚Äôre not interested in rebuilding it. The wear likely caused by that level of neglect won‚Äôt be worth trying to save at 120k miles. That‚Äôs not going to be a 200k engine hell even 150k
It's trashed. I wouldn't rebuild, id call Jasper, they're a good, reputable engine rebuilder and they're nationwide
There is an oil cleaning kit that can possibly clean this up. I can‚Äôt remember the name of it however it does work.
Put ATF in the oil, and change it quite a few times doing this.

Pull the pan and make sure it‚Äôs not sludged and destroys the pickup tube after.

Other than that, new head
Do NOT try to clean this by flushing the engine. You'll clog your oil paths in your block. That's how my 3800 blew a rod. The guy I got I from, did like, 40k oil changes and it had 150k miles on it. When I took it apart the oil filter housing was clogged and the rods and everything was starved of oil because he tried cleaning it out, after he realized he messed up. Only thing you can do is tear it all down, thoroughly clean everything and put it back together.
First of all before anything, WHY A FUCKING FORD BRO??! TELL ME, please i wanna know what possessed you to wake up and say "hey ima go buy my son a ford explorer" one of the worst models ever. INSANE!
Seafood the oil, run it for 3-450 miles, vlchange the oil. Rinse and repeat until the sludge factory is cleaned out ü´°
This sucks because these 4.0 sohcs don't tolerate missed oil changes because of the odd and brittle timing chain design. I would do what Jazzie says aswell. Perhaps use some diesel oil (also high on detergents) of a similar weight or engine cleaner. Pour, Drive, Drain, filter swap and repeat until it comes out clear. If possible try to get some of the big chunks out by hand so they won't clog up more passages. Best of luck to you.
Used is the right word alright.
I'm amazed that with that much sludge you haven't had a timing chain issue on that 4.0 SOHC.    
The 4.0SOHC wasn't a bad engine, but the complex timing chain, and not being able to do a timing chain job with the engine in the vehicle made it crappy.
What did the mechanic say?
Don't need any bore scope. Just unscrew the filler cap turn it over and look inside it. Whatever is in the motor will be there. One of the first things I do when buying used.
Try doing some oil flushes maybe 3-4 times?
Maybe you could try cycling a cleaner a few times? See what happens.
Seafoam in there and drive it a little to get it circulating
Option1 drive it till it don't drive anymore.
Option2 crate engine swap it.
Option3 sell it and move on.
Option4 at the possible risk/revival of the engine, buy the 300$ BG engine oil flush on ebay (only available to dealers) and try that out. I've seen it perform wonders. Scrape, chizzle, and vacuum away the valve cover build up first, then drop oil pan for a deep clean also. YouTube the BG oil flush. It's amazing. But is a brutal procedure however the best results
I would try to save it since i just bought it and it's running even looking like that. I would run a flush through it for about 15mins then fill it up and add either MMO or Rislone. Make sure to check the oil filter every so often in case the flush loosens up some good sized sludge. I might repeat the process in a year if after popping it open again it looks like things are getting cleared up after the first flush. Be sure to use a grp3+ synthetic oil. They tend to have better solvency than grp2's/blends. Once the engines cleaned up a grp2/+ is perfectly fine.
We had a 4.0 when i was growing up. If you have the tools and time swapping the engine would be best. 

Did you get a prepurchase inspection with fluid checks,have them remove the valve covers and check it our before you bought it?
Good job greasing the valve train
I had a  neighbor back in the 70's that would drain the oil then fill it up with diesel,  run it a few minutes then put fresh oil and filter in. Only guy I've ever seen do that.
The new Valvoline Restore Synthetic does an amazing job at cleaning engines but I wouldn't try that on this motor till it's cleaned up with other methods
Always open the oil cap and look around with a flashlight.
Take it back
oh, that happened well before you bought it.
i mean at this point i‚Äòd just drive it until it dies. you could technically remove the heads and have them cleaned but i don‚Äòt think you payed much for it so it‚Äòs not worth probably.
clean the valve head portion with heavy degreaser brush and towel, repack it. drain check the old oil condition if it has sludge and gunk mix fill in some diesel instead of engine oil and let the engine idle for like 2-3 minutes and drain. refill fresh oil and drain it after around 1000 miles. sludge isn't a big issue if eliminated early.
...an 02 Explorer...lasted that long? I'm truly amazed. But it's where it should be now.
I‚Äôd say the best thing to do is run good oil thru it and change it more frequently. If it‚Äôs running decent and otherwise fine ID say keep her goin. If you get too aggressive triying to move all the sludge around you May start to clog shit up.
If it‚Äôs a lose/lose you can try the old tractor trick. 

Fresh oil + one qt of kerosene (or jet A, or diesel, wtv u can get) let idle for 10-20min, then drain and replace with fresh oil. 

This comes from the days of detergent oils and loose bearing tolerances, so I have no clue if it would work on something like this/this bad‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôd be a fun way to find out.
Do an oil change every week for about a month. Also don't use sludge remover. It will break off chunks and plug up oil passages.
Shop vac the chunky stuff out change oil and filter and check crank case vent and pcv valve
I said put the fries in the oven at 425! Not the motor!
Do you have lemon laws at your disposal? Not sure how it works but it might be recourse.
That must be those 100k oil services üòÇ
Yeah 2002 was still the era of 100k miles cars being ticking time bombs.  Especially American cars.
Well, that didn't just happen. That's years of neglect from the previous owner. You can try all the different flushes but who knows what the outcome. I'd just drive it until it dies
WatchJRGo did a video on cleaning sludge using BG Dynamics additives, might be worth a shot.
https://youtu.be/jtiS4AucmJ8?si=V_O0-b2JGned-M8j
Close it back up n cycle it with mystery marvel oil it‚Äôll clean it up
I have never heard a mechanic say anything good about the 4.0s but I think that's lack of oil changes and maintenance.
Yo they never changed the oil I'm convinced üò±
What propted the removal of the valve cover?
You MIGHT be able to get some luck with the right cleaner and people but at that point it‚Äôs easier to buy a new head and take the whole thing apart and clean it or new engine but that‚Äôs just too much in my opinion but it‚Äôs personal preference lmk what happens to this tho I‚Äôm curious
Oil changes didn't happen.  Holy.
I hate that motor. Worst over head cam design ever. The way one head is driven from the back is asinine.
Good thing you had this inspection done before purchasing the vehicle. Saved yourself a lot of trouble!
BG Dynamic Platinum Engine Restoration Service kit
It all of a sudden didn‚Äôt change the oil for 10 years.
Question for OP, was this engine still running before you took it to the mechanic? Everyone's talking about timing belts/chains and what a pain this engine is (and I'm sure they're correct about that) but I'm not sure they're answering the right question.

btw I don't blame you for the purchase, if it had only 120k you probably thought you had found a gem. Instead the previous owner appear to have been trying to make gems...
Royal purple oil is well known to clean engines internally at a safe rate.
Now what did we learn today
Send it. Clean the gunk out you can get to put valve cover back on and drive it. Clearly someone didn‚Äôt change oil
Once again manufacturers regiment of design engineers sucked by Design. Explorer was a decent truck not particular with any problems on the ones I've owned. But it's all about maintenance especially oil changes and it's a low budget truck please many owners straight away from regular maintenance. Ford probably created this future dilemma to fuel their service departments work
You should have some sort of warranty a dealership offers, if not, I would fix it up cheaply somehow in running shape and trade it in.
Some advice if they don‚Äôt have service records of any kind they probably didn‚Äôt treat her well this is lack of maintenance purely
How about contacting the seller first?
The 1st thing is to manually remove as much of that sludge as you can. The 2nd is a 5 min motor flush, and 3rd, you now have a clean enough engine to analyze if it's even worth saving. I don't know your financial situation, but if you need to recover your costs and try to repair it, then it's designed to drop out the bottom, which requires a lift. Otherwise, you'll have to do it the hard way, and I do mean hard.
Well now you both have a parent son project and can teach him how to fix his car and that is a life long lesson and skill that can make him able to be independent and self sufficient
Can try a kerosene flush ,also possibly has worked for me in the past on a mercury villager.
Did you check the dipstick was it like this also
Sludge city
Ah yes, the post purchase inspection.
Did this valve cover come off for a reason other than just to see what‚Äôs under there? You ever hear the saying if it aint broke don‚Äôt fix it?  

In your case if it was running fine then yeah sure try some solution that will help ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù the engine. If it was running poor and this is the cause then buy a replacement motor to drop in. Can get one for cheaper than it will cost a shop to do the repairs to this current motor. 

If you can‚Äôt do a replacement motor because of cost I‚Äôd assume this repair will be too much as well. In that case scrap her.
Does it run
real honestly
Buy a used car nowadays is a hit and miss people don‚Äôt take car of their cars like they use to
Engine flush  with all that put together and then drain the oil out
This ‚Äúhappened‚Äù a long fucking time ago lmao
Clean out as much as you can easily get to, then button it up and go for a slow (safe) engine flush. Lots of options out there, so will need to do some research. AutoRx used to be well respected. 

Worse that happens is you have to rebuild, so why not try at this point.
Someone didn‚Äôt believe in oil changes
Drain what you can. Sea foam in the oil with a top up of oil and new filter. Do this two or three times.
Can fill the crankcase full of diesel to eat away at the oil build up. If not, I would say, 2 cans of seafoam or Berryman‚Äôs b12 chemtool should eat that all up.
I would check if any of the moving metals are fused. This happened to a friend of mine. His cam and head fused together.
That doesn‚Äôt ‚Äújust happen‚Äù, that‚Äôs years of neglecting to change the oil.
DAYUM
Previous owner obviously never did an oil change. Jeeeezuz
I swear I changed oil on that thing every 17,000 miles! I even used the fancy orange filters and super tech oil!
Run away from it and that motor it‚Äôs bad news 3 timing chains
Unfortunately engine is toast or it needs complete rebuild
Marvel Mystery Oil and Valvoline Restore and Protect.   Nothing to lose to give it a shot.
What would happen if you cleaned it with dawn dish soap and vinegar? Carefully. Each piece. I realize that it would be a lot of work but wouldn't it be worth it? I have a Saturn Vue and it sat for a really long time and it wouldn't start. New battery later. New fuses. New connector on battery cables, my daughter's idea, and voila, runs like a top. 

Now I have to get the interior redone. I had a leak in my sunroof. I fixed the leak myself.üòÇ. Don't ask how.
If the engine still runs excellently id say try a bg works oil flush kit
i have the 4 liter without overhead cams but instead overhead valves (like a LS engine so to speak) 

i guess this is what happened when they tried to update it to ohc, lol

its the 4 liter in my 1st gen explorer (and first gen rangers and maybe bronco II idk if those had the 4.0 as an option)
Im no, throw the towel.  Don't overthink this.
It is really sad to see pics like this.
Never hurts to try an engine flush. Liquid Molly makes a great one. Best case scenario you buy a few years worth of time, worst case you waste 10$ and an oil change.
I just picked up an 04 Explorer. It‚Äôs the 4.6 with the V8. Eddie Bauer edition. It runs like shit but the kid insisted it needs plugs and coil packs. I‚Äôm not getting good pull up hill. And it does seem to have a hell of a miss. Any idea what this is? Or anything else I should be aware of? I‚Äôve got barely 1k in it. The tires are brand new. It has over 220k miles on it.
Oops! All Sludge!
FORD - Fix Ordinarily Regularly & Daily
Could be stop leak that ran through the motor and mixed with oil when drying.
Clean it up with some parts cleaner and a blow nozzle then run some sea foam in the engine oil to break down the sludge in the oil passageways, run sea foam through the vacuum system, take the throttle body off and clean it, MAF sensor, IAC valve, and replace the spark plugs after you‚Äôve done all that and change the oil and filter and hope for the best.
Try BG EPR, do it three times. New oil and new filter before the next can of EPR. Do not breathe that stuff in!
Do people typically take valve covers off to inspect?
So i've been a mobile mechanic 5 plus years , I Say if the vehicle was running enough for you to get it.Where it is, then it's worth cleaning that it's shut up and putting in a new oil.And you know when your oil unless it's already been seized and cut off
That's not a very popular or forgiving engine, especially when it comes to lack of oil changes.  

I'd get some 10w30 store brand diesel oil, in two gallon jugs, and a stack of cheap filters.  Start changing the oil out every 1000 miles or so, maybe even weekly for a few weeks.  Get the engine up to operating temperature before draining it to maximize the sludge removal, and keep a listen on for any odd noises.
That already happened before you purchased it, unfortunately. All vehicles, for the most part, have an oil cap on one or both(uncommon) of the valve covers. Pop that bad boy off and look down inside the engine. Sometimes, they have a guide inside that helps evenly distribute oil over the valves and other nearby components, so it obstructs the view, but you should still be able to tell if it is sludged up or not. You can also smell the cap for a burnt smell. It should smell like gas and oil, no burning smell. And for the love of God, try to refrain from buying a car with an old experimental v6 engine for a daily. They won't last long. Goodluck
You can use oil flush, change the oil with quality oil every 3k for a while. If it still runs good
See it as something positive. Yes this sucks, but you and your son have something to do together and both will learn a sh*t ton with repairing this. 

Good luck and let the wrenching start
Well... That is certainly gunked. Flushes,cleaners,etc.; will only clog up the oil passages.

Clean up what you can physically and button it up. Change oil and filter and drive for a few hudred miles-change all again.  Drive normal until it won't.:(  

Don't know about rest of vehicle - rust,wear,etc. No book value to speak of.  $ 400 to LKQ w/title.

Best of luck.

\* All: Try looking at an Audi V8 engine and timing chains. ;)
Seafoam !
The real question is how was it running?? I've messed with several 3.0 and 4.0s and the family is kind of a ford fiend family. I myself prefere toyota/hondas. But if it ran good minus the cake icing level of sludge, I'd start doing oil changes with a high mileage blend oil thats the same weight it calls for or a tad thinner like 5w-20 maybe if you can find blend in a 20 so that when the sludge gets blended in there is less of a change of starving the motor from a clogged sump. Then after several quick ~2k miles or less oil changes bring it up to 30 or 40w full synthetic and keep running short interval changes till the sludge is cleaned out as good as its gonna get. With the valve covers already being of, it's in your best interest to throw some nitrile gloves on and get to scooping
New motor
Easy way to check for this next time you buy a car, take off the oil cap and look down into the valve cover or run your finger around it you‚Äôll know right away if it‚Äôs sludged up
Anyone ever flushed an engine with diesel? I can't quite bring myself to do it on my engine but obviously it's a very light oil and I can't see a good reason not to.
Try this supposedly it works really well.

Not sure what you funds, skills, or willingness are like. But you could maybe find a reman engine for a fair price and swap yourself.
Wow. I owned one of these when I was younger and really liked the truck had no issues with it. But then I totaled it in a bad bad way and maybe this is the reason why. Good looking out car gods.
Your first mistake was looking at a ford exploder
Do a 4:1 mixture of
Engine oil to ATF. Drive it for a day and change back to all oil with new filter. ATF acts as a detergent. This MAY help your case some.
Buying a Ford is not a responsible choice.
That does just happen lol.
Yeah that didn't just happen.
Depends... does the SUV still run decent?  I would do a 50/50 mix of engine oil and trans fluid, run it for an hour. Then change oil and filter. Run the mix again. If the engine isn't knocking or loud ticking, drain it, change filter.  Fill it with engine oil , Check or change after 100 miles if there's no issues your good.
Ah the good ole Ford Exploder
Plot twist. That crud didn't just happen.
Working at a Ford Lincoln dealer who wouldn‚Äôt believe how many people bring these in multiple times a month and they end up going to the junkyard . 

Trust me, the engine is only the beginning of your problems with these , that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt see that many of them on the road and yes, I have owned one. I left it on the side of the road and sold it for 500 bucks.
Well it is 2002...
Engine oil has left the chat.....
Never had an oil change.....
Shoulda had car shield.....  LOL
Clean as much by hand, then soak pour diesel fuel on it. Clean it one more time at best. Then throw the valve cover back on. Pour quart of diesel fuel in the oil. Run it for 30minutes. Change oil.
Absolutely not, engine is done, everything you see there is going to be inside components and passages as well, don't waste one dollar on that engine.
If you are going to scrap I'll give you scrap value for it. If you're near maryland
I did not think it was possible for an engine with only 120k to look like that‚Ä¶it probably never got an oil change since new. *SMH*

You could try a flush product, but it might lead to starvation issues if the chunks break off and impede flow in the smaller passages. Haven‚Äôt trusted those products enough to try them.

IMO, the best method is disassemble and inspect, and either use a heated parts washer or soak in solvent and scrub manually.

Either that or replace the engine entirely‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs likely got a lot more wear on your cam oiling passages and the oil passages for the crank and connecting rod bearings than the low as mileage would indicate.

(For comparison, here‚Äôs the inside of the abandoned 01 Xterra I bought from a towyard for $550: this picture was taken at 187K, before the rebuild‚Ä¶ I fully expected it to look more in a state like your engine, frankly.)

Sweet, original factory issue oil...
shopware is actually a pretty awesome program, I'd work for them if I could.
Look into Valvoline 'Restore and Protect' motor oil. It's designed to deal with these kinds of situations. It'll clean things out over the interval of an oil change and will continue to do so if you keep using it.
Buy him an old civic and it‚Äôll last
brb I only did my oil change 2000 miles ago but I think she might need another just in case
Using new oil and chemicals will help the engine. However,  think of the underlying issues that you can‚Äôt see.  The results from sludge can greater.
Anyone here would‚Äôve told you not to but this car
Drop a v8 in it and go!
Pennzoil has entered the chat
Wow, that's nasty! My advice would be to run Mobil Delvac 1 in it and hope for the best. The detergents and dispersants in a high quality synthetic diesel oil will work on breaking down the sludge as you drive it. If you really care and want to try to bring this back, change the oil filter every 500 miles with the cheapest one you can find. Lubricate the seal and put it on hand tight. Every 4th time you replace the filter, so every 2k miles, change the oil as well. A regimen like this should help.
Is it broken
I'd throw some Amsoil Engine + Transmission flush and run it for the recommended 15 minutes or so. You could probably get away with 30 minutes or throwing some mileage on it. Change the oil with something cheap + a filter and see what the valve cover looks like. Just rinse and repeat with cheap oil and engine flush until the valves look good.

You'll probably want to replace some seals afterwards since that sludge is probably pulling double duty
Oh I think I see your problem you put your brown sugar in the oil fill cap instead of the sugar reservoir, common mistake.
With this heavy sludge cleaning it without tear down would likely throw off tolerances. If I were you instead of using additives to clean it. Do your oil change and the last quart of oil put ATF in. ATF is a detergent. Run in for a few hours revving it up intermittently. Then do another oil change and see how it looks after. I've done this with pretty good success. I've also seen people just use ATF only instead of ATF mixed with oil but I've never personally done it. If it's not noisy and cleans it up ship it but keep an eye on it. Otherwise prepare to tear this engine apart.
I'm sorry, seems like a have a hard time understanding. What is "this happened"? 
You bought unmaintained car? 
Sludge in the engine appears overnight? 
Valve covers flying out of its own place in the engine?
Take the lost brother cleaning it isn‚Äôt going to fix the damage already done due to lack of maintenance from the previous owner rebuild the engine or get one already rebuilt with a warranty just in case that way you‚Äôre safe
Sell it and buy him an old Corolla/camry.
They called this thing the Ford exploder for a reason. My mom's died as a kid too. Then she got another one and that one died too.
If it still runs put som sea foam in it then change the oil on it drive it till it gives out I guess
Ford Exploder
Put the valve cover back on and just drive it.¬†
Honestly that explorer. Unless you have money and time it wasn't worth it's price when it came out let alone now. Not to be harsh but truthful.
Those cracked heads, a lot, that‚Äôs all I would worry about, I went looking for a set of 4.0 heads and like 4 cars were cracked heads, waste of time. Only good set was all caked like this, just pour some atf in the oil and run it a few minutes after ya get the chunks out, then flush
It's about to become a Ford Exploder
Ford exploder is a common nickname for them ‚ò†Ô∏è
>2002 Ford explorer sport Trac 120k miles 4.0 sohc v6

I wouldn't have touched one of those with a 10ft pole unless it was given to me... It is hilarious when I see people trying to fetch almost $10k for these shitboxes....
Don‚Äôt ever buy a used American car. They‚Äôre SHIT.
Ford things
Look at car sale laws in your state. I know if that was sold here you could sue and force them to give money back
Number one don‚Äôt buy ford they have engines where the oil pump is driven by a belt in the oil pan. Complete fucking garbage designed to leave you stranded. Do yourself a favour and buy a Honda or better get a Toyota if you can find it in a manual even better if not try to stay away from CVT and you will have a bomb proof car, especially if you keep up on maintenance. 

Looks like you‚Äôre looking for another ride now.
When was the last oil change?

We‚Äôre supposed to change the oil. I thought it changes every time I got gasoline.
Yup, I‚Äôm dealing this timing chain nightmare as we speak. Engine removal just to even start the work. Ridiculous design. They‚Äôre quoting me for 4x what the car is worth. Unfortunately this is the reason I‚Äôm scrapping it
Yup. I have an 02 sport that im THIS close to sending to the junkyard because the engine is just such a pain to work on. Gotta pull the motor to get to the jack shaft.
Exactly this. The engine has 3-4 timing chains:  

Front of crank to prop shaft in lieu of cam  
Front of prop shaft to left bank  
Back of prop shaft to right bank  
Front of crank to balance shaft in oil pan (on 4x4 models)

If the engine is sludged this badly, surely the hydraulic chain tensioners have been clogged and the chains have slapped their guides (nearly) to failure. When they go, it's likely to keep running and sounding like shit, but if it slips, it's interference and game over. 

It's easiest as an engine-out procedure and involves some special cam locking tools. Plus the single-user TTY LH and RH threaded bolts holding on the friction-locked cam sprockets... 

It's a big job and I don't think there's much chance of saving this engine because the damage is likely already done to the guides.
agree i am so sad that simple maintenance would keep most trucks-cars purring , if it was me i would get another motor after i had them pull the covers off to check-that it is descent and swap em out, then watch it like a hawk, as you do not know what other surprises are waiting for you to find..
This just needs a good few engine flushes with some heavy stuff like deisel fuel  at the 60/40 oil/ deisel  mix for a good few cycles that will break it down mixed with some good activity stretch the rpms some after 3 oilchange cycles of this and like a day or 2 of activity I'd check again then worry if sludge is still heavy

So I just asked chatGPT which Ford makes, models, and years carry this 4.0 V6 and it's horrifying how many there are.  I'm slowly starting to see why my FIL, a retired farm mechanic, hates Ford.
Dang,  this also is a good idea!  I'm a get me one for the future.  thanks
On this car, it would have been visible from the oil fill! No borescope needed, good lord! But in general  this is a good idea.
This isn‚Äôt a bad idea, and I‚Äôll admit the last truck I bought from a dealer, I did actually borescope the cab corners looking for rust before I bought it. 

However in a private sale situation, I‚Äôd be very reluctant to let someone I don‚Äôt know, with some cheap camera that could potentially fall aspart do this to my engine. Usually, unless there‚Äôs a baffle built into the valve cover where the fill is, you can look in it with a flashlight. If it‚Äôs super bad like the above posted situation, you‚Äôll be able to see it just fine through the fill hole.
Brb looking for my borescope never thought I could do this, it won‚Äôt get stuck inside or like melt?
Bro‚Ä¶ how long have you been sitting on this information!
That's a good shout. Altho i tend to just ram my finger in there and wiggle it about before checking if it's silky smooth oil or lumps of dead dinosaur.
The real LPT
There's no way this engine ran without noise.
They should have simply had it inspected before the sale not after.  They were already spending the money.  If the seller refuses a PPI then you know to walk away.
I just look at the engine from the oil fill cap since you can see inside with most engines. Anyway, why would the inside of an engine be perfectly clean on the inside, like brand new clean at 98,000 miles? I put on the last 7,000 miles. 14' focus st
Honestly just opening the oil filler cap and peaking at the camshaft would catch something like this.
This is such a good idea and I'm mad I never thought about it lmfao
They actually work pretty good for being cheap
This might be a dumb question but what am I expecting to see besides oil?
No way I'm letting a stranger poke anything into my oil cap without it being paid for lol.  Good idea in a perfect world but not happening in mine.
Lol it's a 2002 ford WTF did you think it was gonna look like?... seriously tho
Don‚Äôt trade it, find a member of the original seller‚Äôs family and sell it to them.
I hate to say it but this isn't a bad idea unless they have a lil disposable income to throw at this thing to try and salvage it.
This made me laugh for real.
its just difficult to start taking things apart when the other person still owns the car lol
Happy eyes strikes again
Full send
>a 2004 or newer vehicle, as it will have the updated timing components.

Did they not update this design with better hardware for the 2003 model year? I had heard the cassettes were significantly improved. I've got an '03 with ~200k miles, and it still sounds perfect. It had a little startup rattle if it sat for a few days, but I replaced the 2 externally accessible tensioner and haven't heard it since.
Don't be a dick like the people who originally sold it, at least have the decency to tell people what's wrong with it and sell it as a running parts/project car. People who do this is the reason why buying used private party is a huge risk.
These engines are well known for blowing up, even when maintained properly, and tend to fail right around this mileage. I'm incredibly surprised that this one has made it this far with such poor maintenance.
I love *lengthy post about attempting to salvage motor* right before "...or it could blow up immediately"

Really tickled my sense of humor. Thanks for that.
I'm gonna get a few more opinions but this was what I planning on trying. The car seems to run pretty damn good but has a little ticking not bad which is why the valve cover came off, wasn't expecting this obviously. But might as well give it a go. My dad had this happen years ago and his mechanic ran diesel through it and it seemed to run perfect after so it's worth giving it a shot.
Trans fluid has zero detergents and no additives that are designed for this. I really don't know how this myth that ATF is the oxiclean of fluids, but it needs to end. 
  
ATF will reduce the detergent level of motor oil, not increase it.

This is the way, they know what there talking about
I thought something blew when I first saw the post...
Did he say this is the reason for the engine sludge?
And pull the trans fluid dipstick
Doesn‚Äôt help that the automotive manufacturers all use oil life monitors now. Non-car people were already shitty at changing oil. Now they‚Äôve got a perfect psychological reinforcement for the neglect. When I change mine at 4-5k, my monitor still shows 30-40% life remaining. Bullshit.
No way additives can do damage? I added a bottle to mine and it made it better tbh
Came to say just this, that shit is magic
Word life brother I got a ‚Äò92 Volvo still running smooth
My buddy bought an early 2000 explorer and I tried so hard to convince him otherwise. Guy he bought it from said "new engine and transmission" but couldn't provide paperwork. Not to mention the suspension rust was horrendous. Got a good 7 years out of it (and an insane amount of money dumped into it). Right after he paid over $2k for a full brake job it started making a noise so he took it to a shop and they wouldn't let him drive it away ü§£ proceeds to tell me he's looking at a Ford Edge and I just ended the conversation there. Ended up with a 2011 Explorer that looked like it was lived in and never cleaned.
Would shrimp work, or should it be calamari?
That it's the worst engine sludge he's ever seen and drive it till it pukes then scrap it. He didn't wanna run diesel through it.
Guessing not or we wouldn't be here...
Exactly correct. Under the hood looked spotless! Interior spotless. No rust on paint and minor rust underneath but I'm in Michigan so whatever. Seemed like a gem. Yes the engine seemed fine, my dad and a few friends drove it and thought it seemed like a great deal on a first car for what it was. I even checked the oil and it looked pretty clean on the stick. I think the previous owner knew tho and specifically cleaned under the hood really well to throw me off. Live and learn I guess. I changed the oil on it and might throw in a quart of marvel mystery oil and change the oil every 500-1000 miles. I don't think I can consciously pass this on to another buyer. Maybe sell it as is and inform the next person. Not sure what I'm gonna do.
No dipstick looks pretty clean actually. Mechanic even said that too.
Yes
Lol I understand that...
What?
What?
It was running fine before the mechanic. Now its running like shit. I had them do an oil change while there with a synthetic blend and now it feels like it's "breathing" while idling.
Sport trac is a pickup
What?
This, scrape out as much sludge as you can find first. Restore and protect specifically breaks down sludge and stuff into smaller particles to prevent clogs. Add some seafoam for extra cleaning power, run it about a thousand miles and change it again minus the seafoam. I have this exact truck with 50k more miles on it right now. Some of them have lasted over half a million miles and every day there are people wishing they had one or hadn't sold the one they did have. Worst case if you don't want it anymore go to the sport trac forums on here or Facebook and someone else will save the engine and keep driving her. The only real issues these trucks have with proper maintenance is the thermostat housing needs to be changed from plastic to aluminum, the timing chain tensioners might fail eventually, and the body mounts will need to be replaced after 20 years if they still exist at all. I wish you the best of luck! (Also for a pickup truck, the 02 sport trac probably has the best mpg out of all the other years, and for current trucks it's not bad either)
Bought my 97 4.0 explorer for $800 at 120k miles, it's at 230k and still trucking. Put more into oil changes than I paid for the car haha.
You're laying on your back, looking at the roof of the church ...

Preacher tellin' the truth, and it hurts ...
What state is this where you buy a 20 year old used car with 120k miles like this, no warranty and you can get your money back?  Every state I'm aware of, used cars are sold as is.  There are some states with some very limited exceptions, eg if it doesn't pass state emissions inspection.
These don‚Äôt have a belt driven oil pump. This is an engine built in K√∂ln Germany, aka ‚ÄúCologne V6‚Äù
Putting the timing chain behind the engine is truly one of the ideas of all time
I picked up a 97 a few months ago, for free. Motor was completely shot, just like this one. Ended up finding a junkyard motor for about $300 and replaced all of the timing chains and some other miscellaneous parts. It was such a PAIN IN THE ASS!! 

Just last week I pulled the motor and put the ‚Äúnew‚Äù one in. Just have the radiator left to put back in. But I‚Äôm too nervous/scared to start it, in fear that something isn‚Äôt right because it was such a big job.
Don't know about the explorer but the ranger with the soch, you can drop the trans and get to the chain.
Did this job many years ago. If I remember right its 4 timing chains or five if its a 4X4 model. Brilliant idea to put a chain behind the block. Chef kiss lol
Same here with a 2008 BMW E61 520D, chains at the back of the engine, have to remove half the car to even get near it, and then either lift the engine or drop the transmission
Get a chevy truck. Then your kid can do his own work. Bought mine for 800, drove it for 5 years and counting, serviced about $300 of parts plus tires. Total.
It's a Ford. "Remove engine from car" is always the first step.
What is a jack shaft?
I thought everyone was talking a gm 3
6L. If I didn't see the pic first I would swear it was a hm 3.6L. That is crazy how they have the exact same problems. My enclave had stretched timing chains.  I replaced them and it ended up having bent valves.  I just got them back from the machine shop and in the process of putting it back together.
Very good read
Ask for cash in hand, title in theirs before they poke the borescope in. If they drop it, they bought it.
Depends on the car as to whether or not I‚Äôd allow it. A 22 year old explorer? Knock yourself out. Use my borescope though. Back when I sold my 7 year old Wrangler if you wanted to inspect it you were welcome to have any ASE certified mechanic of your choice do that.
Obviously the heated up engine could damage the camera. Put it in when the engine is cold and you will see the slump. It won't be stuck as it's just a big long flexible tube and it's designed to fit in small places.
While you‚Äôre at it you can also take out the spark plugs and look inside some of the cylinders
Essence of the chicken's ancestors must flow freely in and around our engines to keep them turning.
This is the beginning of a legendary SNL skit
if you asked my dad or my grandfather they would say pull the thing fill a metal water trough with diesel soak that bad boy replace all the gaskets and hope for the best, if you have the tools and time to spare and can afford to just buy a new engine.

but for most people this is definitely gonna cost more than it‚Äôs worth.
I‚Äôm laughing to hide the pain. reminds of when I bought a rusty black truck at nightü´†
The updated components were released halfway through the model year, so sourcing a 2004+ is the best way to avoid the possibility of getting a failure prone engine.
Someone got the cream of the crop and treated it like dogshit.
I have a ranger well over 200k miles with a soch. I did replace the tensioners with the updated part so it's spring and oil pressure fed. I think the part became standard around 2001. 

They are pretty good if you take care of them. I've seen them go 300k before.

Regular Oil changes are a must since the bulk of the tension comes from oil pressure. The spring just stops the chain from smacking the guides on start up
There‚Äôs a reason they call it the exploder
those 4.0 engines had funky timing chain guides that liked to self destruct around that era. bad news is you gotta pull the engine to change the front and rear chains and guides (yes you read that front AND REAR chains lol) symptom is ticking cuz of chain slap. look up info about this before spending another dime.
I'd try running BG Dynamic treatment thru it as I've seen amazing results. I personally would go this route vs diesel. It is a $300 gamble but there is a lot of successful results from it. Either way isn't 100% obviously.

Lol ain‚Äôt gonna do shit. Find a junk yard engine swap it out and sell it. If it still runs trade it in you‚Äôll at least get some of your money back.
This‚Ä¶I was going to mention putting either diesel in the oil and get it circulating through the engine then change oil. Might have to do it a few times. Could also substitute 1 qt of oil for 1 qt of transmission fluid.   T fluid has a lot of detergents that will help clean out that sludge.  Hey man good luck.
You can also try bg dynamic 2 part system. It's 325$ but it will clean all that out in like a hour. It's the best flushing agent made. I would recommend trying this before spending money on a engine. The bg dynamic should be done by a mechanic and they must hook up a oil pressure garage while it'd running through the system to make sure the engine maintains correct pressure during the process.  Also I would recommend dropping the pan maybe before and after to make sure you get as much of this stuff out. 

When it's all done put some good synthetic oil in it and change it every 3k for the first 3 oil changes and then go back to normal oil changes.
I‚Äôd just start using synthetic oil and change it every 3k and know that I‚Äôm gradually chipping away at it. If it‚Äôs running good and sounds decent to be too aggressive at sludge removal could be the nail in the coffin.
You are correct. 

I *think* this stems from working on diesel and their fuel systems. Super common to add ATF to injection pumps and fuel systems. So I guess people think ‚Äúfuck it, might as well put it in everything!‚Äù ü§∑
You mean the people trying to sell you an expensive product in its place are telling you that the detergents in ATF aren't detergents.  We got a live one here boys.
ATF contains a different type of deterrent, a very small amount of non-metallic organic detergents. These are used to keep buildup from the oxidation and friction modifiers from gumming up the valve body or glazing the clutch packs, and they are *very* effective at doing this. They keep what would normally turn to sludge liquid so that this doesn‚Äôt happen, and they work very well for removing sludge from an engine, albeit slowly, but they do work.
True, use marvel mystery oil instead. It will actually clean things.
Truth. I only ever bought one automatic car so I never even think about the transmission dipstick
Exactly, look at your oil even after 3.5k miles and it‚Äôll be pretty damn brown and thin compared to new.. even 4-5k is a stretch to me. I‚Äôd rather change mine at what the ‚Äúoil life‚Äù would consider 50-60% life.
A solvent/flushing additive might dislodge the debris and crud in the photo and it will then circulate it around the engine and cause the damage. That's why mrhappyface is saying it needs to be removed by hand.
Also came to recommend this. It really works well on sludge build up. Check out this unbiased review.

And here‚Äôs the follow up video showing inside the valve covers. https://youtu.be/5fG-LCADsVQ?si=QzA0BKZPaAzV6doq
Negative big tuna, it is crab and lobster night.
I would throw some Risolene through it and change oil and filter x2 or 3 and give it a fighting chance
I had a misfortune of dealing with this type of mess on my sisters used car about a decade ago. I scrapped and vacuumed all the sludge I could and used the BG treatment on it. I warned my sister that if any of the oil passages are blocked and that there is a high chance that a lot of them are that there is a chance of engine destroying itself. I think I ran the treatment twice, second time about a month later. I also made sure to remove the oil pan about 5-6 times to clean the oil pickup. She put about 120k km on it before she the car was totaled in a hit and run.
As bad as it sounds i feel like if we drill into peoples head that they need one after a mistake they may get one next time...but im no saint
Who knows, maybe you‚Äôll get lucky. 

We have an ‚Äò01 Yukon, still going strong at 225k . The inside fabric is showing age but the body is totally solid, never been in an accident. Well unless you count the time my wife tried to back into the garage with the rear door up; but that was replaced.
Sorry...um no nothing you should do further than throw in the towel.  That is a loss.  Sorry man on to the next one.
So the idle is surging? Enough that you can see the tach fluttering or just feeling it through the seat while at idle? Theres a good change when the oil changes start happening its going to start throwing sludge and carbon into the vacuum lines and the PCV valve and i wouldnt be surprised to see any smoking from shit getting blown through. Maybe even jamming a valve, but that'd tell you the engine is done for you lol. If its not outright missing you could either go the way I stated and do it slow and steady or you could outright throw a quart of ATF in it and be agressive. I fucked up once and topped my 97 camry off with about a half a quart of atf and sent it. Sitting at 315k miles now on it as a daily currently so the atf itself isnt gonna be the killer, it'll be how fast and where that sludge goes that'll do it
Shopware is the program that the shop working on your car is using.

I could have offered perspective on your car, but 400 other people already did.
It's true I've put a lot of time into maintaining it, but I've learned a lot and I'm happy so I don't regret it.
Most states, if buy a car at any mileage and the a dealership is negligent and sells you a dangerous POS you will win a lawsuit 10/10 times
Hah! Repeated by Volkswagen with the VR6 engine design!!! What engineering group thought that layout was a good idea???

Audi has quietly left the room.¬†
I thought the starter on the Honda civic was bad üòÇ this is crazy
Lol check out the "new" 2024 Mazda CX90 SUV.  Inline 6 with...... You got it, timing chain on the back.
Leroy how did she run? You can‚Äôt leave us on a cliff hnager
As long as you didn‚Äôt crack the engine apart and do bearings, rings, gaskets, etc, you shouldn‚Äôt have anything to worry about.
The design of this ford engine has two overhead cams like a normal engine. However unlike most cars where the cams are driven from a single side of the engine, this engine has runs one cam from the front and one side from the back. The back is the jack shaft.
Kinda in the same family as a dicfer
He prob meant cam shaft
Yeah, I spent the last couple decades of my career working in a Chrysler dealership, where I was the used car tech. Chrysler has made plenty of crap-mobiles, but in the time I was there I pulled more GM 3.6's than any other engine, knew that one like the back of my hand. Piece of crap, basically. 

That's also the engine I think of when people say mechanics recommend changing the oil too often because they're greedy for that sweet oil change income.
As a buyer I'll just leave. As is cash sales have no warranty. You get what you see. If I'm not allowed to inspect critical components, then you've just wasted time for both of us.
One might theoretically negotiate with the seller to inspect the engine by offering a free spark plug change in return. Do a compression test and bore scope inspection during the changeover.
"And thus began the tradition, every Christmas we wrap up the Explorer and pass it to its new recipient."
but for most people this is definitely gonna cost more than it‚Äôs worth.



This the truth right here
Is there a specific date of manufacture to look for on the 2003's then? I'd like to think that because mine has been problem free and sounds great that I'm in the clear given my current mileage, but I also change my oil religiously and try to keep up on preventative maintenance.
Seriously though, this thing had to have been the absolute best early 4.0 SOHC that Ford ever built. 

I've done several engine jobs on well maintained sub-100k mile Rangers/Explorers that jumped time and grenaded, but somehow this neglected pos soldiers on.
sodding chains
TWO timing chains?!? I want what Ford engineers are smoking üòÇ

I'm in the corner that says there probably isn't much hope for this one. Synthetic oil isn't going to magically clean off years of sludge and caked on neglect. The oil pickup tube screen is probably holding onto so much crap, so it's on borrowed time. I'd say, "you need to pull the oil pan" to assess further. Thing is, if that's 4wd [and think I remember seeing all trac?], you're in for a not so pleasent surprise for what needs to come off in order to get the pan off.

Soundest advice I've seen, is, throw it back together and trade it. That or see what it's worth to Carmaxx or Carvana who buy sight unseen. Not sure how strict they are on knowing if it's maintained or not, but you do have very little options here. You private sale that, even with as is sale, you're in for a pissed off person standing in your driveway when they find out.
I could believe that.
So when Mobil, who make both motor oil and ATF, tells you ATF has fewer detergents and isn't designed to deal with combustion contaminants you don't believe them?
Sure, but would ATF work better than regular detergent motor oil? No, not really. 
  
The detergents in motor oil are specifically designed to combat sludge from combustion. ATF doesn't do that at all as there's no combustion byproducts in the trans. If the ones in ATF worked better, they'd just use those in motor oil. They don't do that for a reason.
It certainly can be worth it, obviously. And we're blaming the seller, but they probably(?) had no clue to this either since someone would have to actually touch the engine to find out...

But it may also be awkward to say, can I have your car for a day or two while my mechanic checks it out. My BIL is a mechanic and would check cars that we were interested in, but he didn't go so far as to take things apart.
I'm debating dumping oil and change filter and filling with either diesel or kerosene and flushing it. Filling it again and idling I for a bit. Do it again. Then filling with 5 w 20 and some marvel mystery oil.
This isn't a "dangerous pos", it's a vehicle that's 22 years old, 120k miles with sludge in the engine.  Cry me a river.  And OP never said the sale was from a dealership, not that it matters with such a vehicle. Look up as is vehicle sales.  That's what this is, unless there is a warranty included.
Don‚Äôt even get me started on Audi b6 s4 chains üòÇ
At least this thing is transverse though so you can get to it. I remember changing out the camshafts in my R32 and it was a fucking nightmare, I couldn‚Äôt imagine the chain being behind a longitudinal engine configuration
I still miss my '97 passat.
Yeah but VW mounts the VR transversaly so it doesn't matter. Op- If you're scrapping it I'll put an motor in it I'm living on ssi and am starting over at 39
 I can tow it and store it till I get a 4.0 to put in it.
Supposedly it's a pedestrian crash test thing in Germany.  I read a comment by an Audi tech that the timing is on the back so they can get a lower hood line for pedestrian crash test ratings.  They still make big SUVs right? ü§∑
Yep I'm experiencing this right now. "it'll last the lifetime of the vehicle so you wont need to change it" \*snaps\* apparently the lifetime is 145k
Next car im definitely getting a B58
Just about to say this but you can get to them by taking the gearbox out which is fairly easy to do on bmws
Don‚Äôt forget Audi, they did it first
Don't forget about the new lm2 Chevy Duramax 3.0l diesel. Also has timing on rear as well as high pressure pump. Trans or engine has to come out for any of that work to be done.
Undates yet to come. I‚Äôm still on the cliff myself. I had to take a few days off because I‚Äôm traveling out of state for a wedding (would‚Äôve totally stayed home to finish the sploder but it turns out I‚Äôm a groomsman) and will be back a little later next week. 

But trust me skeeter, you‚Äôll be the first to know how she runs when I‚Äôm back!!
Okay thank you so then what is the front one called?
The Jack shaft is what runs parallel to the engine to connect the front and back timing chain sprocket sets.
Why is it the more I learn about cars the more I learn that nearly every engine ever made is a piece of crap and unreliable
Good god that engine is just the biggest pain to do anything on. Yeah, I suppose the oil change is the easiest of the work. But when that involves putting your hand three inches from the exhaust to grab the oil filter (which is also filled with hot oil), then somehow cleaning up the oil mess because GM decided to put an engine mount directly below it? Well, maybe there's a little bit of joy that sparks when people don't take the advice to change the oil more often to keep it running.
If you drop that boroscope i know youll also get in your car and leave. Thats more than a time waster
there's a chance you will drop that and you expect the owner to pay for the damage YOU caused? the owner will be lucky to have you walk away
On a lot of motors today changing all the spark plugs is a major job. 

On my Frontier the intake manifold has to be removed. It takes several hours of miserable labour to remove the rear plugs.
Hell no I'm not letting some random person change the spark plugs and do a compression test. That's just asking for problems.¬†
Regifting the lemon back to the original family with a invoice for the original purchase amount sounds like a fun tradition
I've had a few friends brick their explorers in the last few years. Freeway on-ramps tend to be the nail in the coffin. On another note, I had a coworker 7 or so years ago with an 02 neon with 600k miles on it. Said he changed the oil every 70-100k miles, and that's it.
Blessed by Gerald Ford himself
It‚Äôs actually 2 chainz. Sorry I‚Äôm half asleep and couldn‚Äôt pass up the opportunity.
Try 4. 1 on the back, 3 on the front.
Alright, I understand where you come from, but the ones in ATF work better because they‚Äôre not the same. The ones in ATF are designed to remove the deposits, more than prevent them. The ones in standard engine oil are designed to prevent it, and are not as good at dissolving it. There‚Äôs a good reason for that as well; the engine oil has to remain at a specific viscosity in order for it to maintain fluid bearing surfaces, if you load it up with contaminants, you will find very quickly it will not be able to do that job very well. If you add a quart of transmission fluid, sure, it doesn‚Äôt have the same amount of detergents, but it‚Äôs got different detergents that do a very good job of liquifying sludge.

It‚Äôs like using a tide pod vs a cap full of dollar tree detergent, one may be smaller in quantity, but is much stronger for the purpose than the other. 

We actually studied this in school when I went for automotive engineering, the reason manufacturers put out warnings against doing this kind of thing is because you can cause damage really fast if the motor is really bad like this one is, due to the debris rapidly contaminating the oil. Nobody wants liability for that so they put out tons of information like this to combat the use.
It can be hard also to get a car in somewhere.  My mechanic was a week out just from being able to look at my car

This is why i am so adamant on people having to learn more about automotive maintenance,  obviously yoyr average person cant change every spark plug or know everything but i have stuck with 3800 series 2 cars for half of my life so atleast i know how much things cost and what i should expect to break
Well they're close enough to each other and where im at kerosene is $6 and some change a gallon vs diesel being closer to $4 so for the sake of being cheap diesel sounds like the bwtter option. My only worry with getting the crap out quick is how easily it'll be to dislodge something large hidden below all the sludge. I'm assuming the miles weren't crazy high even though the maintenance schedule obviously sucked ass. You in a hurry to see if it's gonna be a daily? I've used marvel mystery oil, if you have hydraulic lifters it helps shut the tapping up. Never really noticed a difference in sludge removal though. You might better off letting it idle up to temp and slowly mixing a can of seafoam or similiar cleaner straight into the crank case at the rate it says on the can and letting it idle and do drain and fills that way. Could probably do the same thing with diesel so long as you dont blend enough in that you thin the oil so much it can lube properly and starts eating bearings and scuffing the cylinders.

Edit: If you go the marvel route just go for the dirt cheap full synthetic walmart brand motor oil. It's still above SAE spec and perfect for something like this where you're gonna be grabbing oil in bulk. Just grab the dirt cheap supertech filters too. This shit is so sluged there isnt any point in better filters, it'll be grabbing plenty for awhile lol.
The V6 3 Liter holds a special place in hell
B7 A4 2.0T is entering the chat
Unfortunately, 3.6L VR6 in VAG SUVs are longitudinal not transverse. Engine out to change timing chains and guides on those buggies. Lower timing chain guide can be changed w/o engine out - but is a HUGE PIA!!
3.6 toureg enters the chat... My mates one is almost at 100,000kms, not looking forward to that timing chain job.
New Mazda I6 engines put it in the back as well. Whole front clip and engine removal to get to it. 
Sure, put the noisy timing chain closer to the firewall. That's the performance engine sound people want to hear!
Leroy I can‚Äôt take the suspense!
I‚Äôm curious to know as well but enjoy the wedding. Looking forward to the update
I never thought about it. Im sure it has a name but i dont know it.
His brother Paul
I've never had serious engine issues with any car I've ever owned. Except my first, which was a used VW beetle.

Fortunately you can drop that engine in about the same time as it takes to do an oil change. Four bolts, fuel line, throttle cable IIRC.
There are some good ones, and even most of the crap ones will last well enough if maintained and treated well, but there's a very long list of vehicles I would never own, knowing better.
They are at least several feet long. If you let go of it's not go to disappear into the engine. It's not something that is just going to fall apart.
Suit yourself. Waste your time and make excuses why buyer can't inspect the car they're buying. 

Why don't you trade in your car at a dealership if you don't want to deal with the as is nature of private automobile sales?
I'm confused how one is gonna lose a borescope when it's literally attached to a big cable.

Slap it in some vise grips if you're that clumsy.

Although honestly, if the engine runs smooth, the oil looks new, and the compression test comes back OK, that's probably enough.
When my Hemi needed the plugs changed I paid for the service because Cyl8 is a right pain in the ass (7 ain't no cakewalk either).
I really only buy sedans, hatchbacks and coupes, so that problem evades me.
Like transverse mounted motors on vans. Not that the cowling and wiper arms are too bad.
'97 Explorer with 230k miles on it... I'm gonna be the guy merging going 55mph now, sorry.
>Freeway on-ramps tend to be the nail in the coffin. 

One of the worst places for your engine to fail
That‚Äôs asinine. I‚Äôll stick with my old timing belt Toyotas. Even if they have to be changed often there‚Äôs only one and they‚Äôre easy to change
I have two ME degrees(BS/MS). I disagree with what you said, so do the people who make the stuff. 
  
It's not a conspiracy, it's just that ATF doesn't have such detergents. It's really that simple. 
  
If you find something published from a lubrication engineer that says otherwise I'd be glad to read it.
"one of the best American V6s ever made"
I like this advice. I did have one mechanic/car builder tell me that he thought this buildup was do to shitty oil and paraffin build up in the motor. For what that's worth. I don't disagree with you on the Walmart oil just curious if you think it that it could be harmful if even if I'm just using it briefly. And no, at this point I am in no hurry for this truck. Basically if I can't figure this out and get it running (it was running fine before taking to mechanic) then it's just one big piece of scrap metal. I'd love it get it running if possible.
Looking forward to experience a taste of what hell has in store when i get around to doing it on my B8 S4, but so far no rattle on startup or anything else.
Ugh that sucks, I didn‚Äôt realize until today that they mounted longitudinal. It‚Äôs a shame because the VR6 is one of my favorite little power plants out there
Is there ever a case where you have to replace just the lower guide? Seems like a pointless job.
Yup! ‚ÄúPut car into service mode.‚Äù Meaning take entire front of car off (set aside) to access all the bullshit ‚Äúchains‚Äù strung all over the heads and lower block.
Do you need to change out the chains on that bad boy or is it just the guides?
Skeeter I‚Äôm sorry it took so long. But the suspense shall kill you no more. [SPLODER UPDATE](https://imgur.com/a/om3BF4i) She‚Äôs running but I have a pretty big oil leak coming out of the front somewhere I have to find. other then that she sounds mint and is running way better then the previous motor. 

I still have some work ahead of me but I‚Äôm not too worried. 

Also some of the videos in there were snapchats sent to the boys. So I apologize for the less than exceptional quality
commenting to remember
Some of them have small metal caps that screw onto the tip of the camera so that you can put different attachments like mirrors onto it.  If that falls in your not getting it out without at least pulling the valve cover
Because people like you hardly exist in real life. Most people are reasonable enough to understand ‚Äúno you‚Äôre not sticking something in the engine until you buy it, but you can look around first‚Äù
just because there's a low chance someone will lose a borescope, doesn't mean it can't happen. But when it DOES happen, and if it does happen, the seller is screwed if the buyer does drop it. If the buyer is serious enough to do all this, he should have the cash in hand in case something does go wrong. And if there is nothing wrong, then both party's are happy.
cylinder 7 is when i called my 4ish foot tall friend so i could borrow her hand lol. crazy how tight it is back there i still miss my hemi tho
Just depends on the manufacturer

I‚Äôve had two 6 cylinder cars that both had the engines sideways, to where the air intake manifold covered the rear 3 plugs 

It isn‚Äôt really that hard imo but it is harder than popping open the hood and immediately being able to access all the spark plugs
There were 2 versions of the 4L V6 offered in late 90s Explorers. You want the older, lower powered one, not the SOHC.
Props for having the right info.

Any time I see 'ATF' and 'detergents' I cringe. Folks think it is just high detergent oil and miss the whole point. 

Oil goes in the oil hole and ATF goes in the transmission hole. You don't mix coolant or brake fluid in the oil because that is bad, so why would you do it with ATF?

Oil/ATF myths are still rampant.
That's what it looks like. But it's gonna have to ran for a long time, long enough they've skipped interval after interval and not even topped up due to no leaks with some form of mostly conventional. Walmart's Supertech is fine, the additive content is going to be less than say Mobil 1, which is considered primo or atleast the best brand for gasoline engines in general at a general retailer. But, so long as it has that SAE stamp on it then it's good to go. My daily is a 98 Camry with 315k on it that I bought 6 years ago with exactly 200k on it. It's used Supertech all the way to Mobil 1 through multiple stretches while I tinkered with oil weights and brands differently blend ratios to combat the amount of blow-by you get on an engine this broke in lol. During my low icome phase a few years ago, it ran nothing but Supertech for 2 years and still is here today. And since you aren't in a hurry to get it running, then the slowest path will be in your best interest as far as trying to save it. I am a little confused on why it started running so much differently after the mechanics though. One oil change alone shouldn't have caused enough movement with the sludge off the rip. Is it misfiring?
The lower timing chain is a single row chain. It‚Äôs under more torque and stress than upper two-row cam timing chain. The plastic guide usually breaks first on the lower chain. Thus, when the timing chains start to ‚Äòrattle‚Äô at cold, low oil pressure, start up conditions it‚Äôs usually the lower chain guide that‚Äôs broken causing the timing chains to rattle. In that situation it‚Äôs easy enough to replace the one broken plastic lower chain guide.
Yep, gotta change the chains as well as the *plastic* guides.
Most common failure point is shops cheaping out and only replacing the chains, causing failure with the already worn guides lmao...
Hell yeah dude! Glad to hear it!
Same
Luckily you can make sure it's not one that has attachments on the tip

Inspecting the engine IS part of checking a car out PRIOR to buying it. You gonna give a refund if they buy it then check the engine and find this horrid mess? No of course not.
Mine has the SOHC unfortunately, it's an Eddie Bauer.
I'm not sure honestly. I was scared to shit driving it a few blocks away. I came to a stop light and the car seemed like it was going to give up. The light turned green and I made it home and parked it. Haven't touched it since. Not sure if spark plugs or if something got dislodged during the oil change? Something maybe got loosened up and clogged something? They told me they put a new gasket on the valve cover. I really don't know enough to troubleshoot so I'm just reading and trying to learn what I can before making a move.
When I did the cams in my R I also did the guides at the same time, what a dumb ass design. Speaking of, that same car had a water pump explode because lo and behold, plastic impellers on the water pump.
How is he going to sell you his piece of shit without you knowing it's a piece of shit?
Frequent oil changes it is, then! Clearly you're doing something right to get it that far. Many SOHC cars are on their 3rd set of chains beyond 200k.
Would that be the metallic green and beige Eddie Bauer?
But when I was idling at the light it seemed like it was gonna die.... Or maybe stall? Kinda like the car was moving but slow. Like it wasn't getting air or fuel or something.
I'll buy a piece of shit as long as I can figure out how much it will cost to fix it up.

Shoot... Half the time it's cheaper to fix a "junker" than to just buy the same car in good condition. At least with the junker you know it's gonna be junk. I've been fleeced more than once by people who wouldn't let me inspect properly. Now I just walk away.
Every 2k miles! It seems like overkill but it's worked for me. 
It also has the dreaded downshift thunk for 50k or so with the OD OFF flashing and it's not caused me any issues lol, I just cruise around town in 2nd. Happy cake day!!
Red & Beige! I've seen the green ones on the road and they look slick. They're either rusted to shit or a garage kept grandpa car, there's no in-between lol.
It's possible that something got dislodged or the plugs were already on their final days before the trip to the mechanics. Headgasket maybe, but it'd be god awful to drive to the point that you feel like you're driving a 2 cylinder with all the misfires in-between lol. I'd check the plugs, and take the breather tube to the throttle body and see how bad it is around the throttle plate and how worn the plugs are. Then, if those are good, start checking vacuum lines for clogs or tears. If the exhaust is excessively steamy and so hot that it's going to scald you then it may be a headgasket, but that's not a surefire way to know. A n exhaust leak tester that attaches to the radiator will let you know, or a leak down test at a shop will as well. I dont have this Haynes manual on hand, or I could send you photos page by page. But autozone or advanced auto generally have the books on this model, if not, ebay is your friend. They want too much for these things brand new outside of a parts store.
Forgot about this for a hot minute, was curious if you've had any luck with it or chalked it up as a loss?
