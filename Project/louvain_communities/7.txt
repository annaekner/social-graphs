Peer pressure from dead people

Fuck them ancestors. You bastards consumed everything and left us the crumbs
Some of my ancestors were conquistadors so fuck what they think
Dam I kinda don‚Äôt care
If they'd been rich enough to pass on their wealth, I might have grown up spoiled, stupid and wealthy enough to want children.

But they were too lazy. That's on them.
that mfs should be grateful to us for breaking the cycle of curse.
Who cares? It's always confused me as to why people result to ancestor worship.
My female ancestors have all lived lives of suffering and oppression. Getting married to abusive cheaters and being trapped having 7-8 kids, never becoming educated. Is this the life they dreamt of for me? My mother alone married a deadbeat cheater and had 3 kids by him. She is poisonously bitter and talks shit about him daily. Her life has just been non-stop suffering and she clings to her religion/cult. Her oldest daughter, my older sister, had 4 kids by 3 men and is acrimonious with all of them. Her kids are all messed up. Why would I perpetuate this bullshit?
Fuck u ancestors. Your only legacy is generation trauma. Thank you for fucking up with my brain and my mental health. Now I have to deal with it all alone just because you wanted more labours to help you with your farm. olo 

(or maybe you were just horny, idk, still fuck you.)
good riddance to my ancestors
LoL. This obsession with the bloodline has caused enough mayhem in the human history now. In my humble opinion, there is not really such a thing. While it could be argued that by genetics, "there is a bit of each ancestor in there", my argument is that effectively, it is also a lot of non-ancestry in there, producing an entirely new mix every time. And even IF, it effectively is utterly irrelevant for any actual person, so no. Not gonna bow to such a concept.
Many of my female ancestors only lived long enough to spawn once or twice, leaving their husbands to produce football teams with multiple women. What a shitty legacy.
They would have preached personal responsibility. I don't know what to tell them.
My family tree is full of pathetic drunks and narcissist bastards, I'm putting an end to that shit right now.
We don‚Äôt give a fuck but also, if you have siblings, which most people do, and those siblings have children you haven‚Äôt ended shit.

My ancestors can rot in hell for all I care. They were probably horrible people.
My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?
Good news for my ancestor is I am not the only one from their blood. There are probably 50 of cousins to continue the bloodline. Not like my Ancestors were some hot shit anyway :v
My ancestors are like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy that you live in a time where you get to choose for yourself whether to get impregnated and enslaved to a marriage or not‚Äù
nah i'm not sorry, they can suck on my left nut man
Get fucked boomers lmaoooo
In a twist the ancestor was your own damn self. High five buddy. You done enough.
I always hope they smile upon my living standard: - a home to raise many kids in- special food like meat whenever i want - a university degree as a woman

and get all excited. Then they look closer and see: - i refuse to have children - i‚Äòm a vegetarian by choice - no one wants to employ me bc i don‚Äôt have years of experience so i work manual labour for a crap salary 

and they shudder bc i suck lol.
Lol good though I got so many cousins that my ancestors probably don't care
Most ancestors were probably rapists anyway.  Fuck em.
witness me, ancestors!

 this is where your line ends! all your efforts and worries are over now and forever. 


our line will never feel pain, fear or hunger again!


WE'RE FREE!
"This curse ends with me."
I do think my nazi ancestors are very disappointed that I am both tolerant and child free. Good thing I'm not trying to impress them or feel pressured by them.
They‚Äôre dead. The approval or disapproval of the dead is imaginary.
I like to think some of our ancestors are proud of us for breaking the cycle. People in the past used whatever contraception they could, maybe they‚Äôd be overjoyed that birth is a choice for us.
That‚Äôs his ego not mine.
I‚Äôm sure many of my female ancestors wished they could have had a choice to not have children.
Dead people don't care, and even if they did, I wouldn't.
I honestly think they don't care that much, natalists are not focusing on the 4+th generation after them but I still find that funny
I would think they would be pleased I had the choice and was smart enough to choose the life that would allow me to best survive through the hardships my era is imposing on me. I imagine my great great grandmother in particular would be glad I didn‚Äôt have to marry  so I could afford to eat, have children I couldn‚Äôt afford and bury three successive abusive husbands due to illness like she did.
Dp we really have to worry about dead people
Listen, fam, it‚Äôs ok. My ancestor who ‚Äúhad a tough life,‚Äù left Ireland because he was caught sleeping with his brother‚Äôs wife‚Ä¶ by his brother! So, instead of trying to patch things up with his brother, my ancestor murdered him and fled to the States, changed his name to something German and became rich (all the money has long since been lost). I am not bothered by ending this bloodline. üòÇ
I got a vasectomy so they can quit watching now.
I don‚Äôt even know how this sub came up on my feed. But I have learned recently about Ancestor Worship in a lot of First Nations tribes around the world.

They dress up like animals and dance.

üåàthe more you know‚Ä¶
He was childfree too and looked after a child that wasn't hisü•∞
Tradition is the dumbest reason to do anything.
my ancestors caused the salem witch trials. let this bloodline fucking end already
Correcting ancestor‚Äôs dumbass mistakes üçµüê∏
I presume they‚Äôd be jealous of me and wish they knew about AN earlier.
If my ancestors are mad about anything, it's how easily I (we) can obtain food and water and then waste it.
Welp, my ancestors can watch me make another gin and tonic and get back into bed. :)
Oif I didn't have 5011 cousins then the bloodline would end but it's definitely not
Just because you're related to someone doesn't mean you'll like them. I'm white and from the deep south. Take a wild guess as to why I'm not too excited to learn about my ancestors.
My ancestors also passed down some bad genes, had skeletons in their closets, were cheaters and gambled away the family fortune all before I was even a twinkle in my parents eyes so fuck em
I'm an ancestor.

I care about my descendents that exist. Not ones that could have existed.
Fuck em, they're dead.
What they gon do about it? They dead
Out of every bloodline that's ever existed, why should I give a shit if mine doesn't survive?
The dead man feels nothing
What ancestors did was increasing public debt around the world for future generations to pay for and that is what even we are doing but at an exponential rate. It's a great tragedy for our offsprings that they will have to deal with failing infrastructure, sluggish economy, high interest rate debt which they will have to pay by the taxes with no benefit in return because benefit has already would have been consumed by their ancestors.
They‚Äôre just jealous
I don't have gene pool, i have gene cesspool lmao.
MY BLOODLINE ENDS WITH ME
As a white person, imagining my colonizing bloodline-obsessed ancestors crying over my antinatalist gay ass makes me happy üòÇ
Fuck you, MF, you are the reason why I'm here. If I find you in the afterlife, I'm gonna fuck you up.
It's not like most of them even planned a family. They just got married and fucked and boom, tons of children. They might be happy/jealous that we have a choice.
[deleted]
They‚Äôre dead. Why should they care?
F*ck them! They bred like rabbits and now there's 8 Billion humans
I‚Äôm German so uh I don‚Äôt think many people would blame me for not having kids. Not making a mustache kid is my contribution.
They made having kids expensive. Their fault.
Maybe they should have left me something to inherit. I still wouldn't have kids, but I might not be poor
I know for a fact some of my ancestors didn't want to have kids. If they weren't, by their own admission, cowards, they could have lived their best lives and left me in peace.
Sorry, fam, the suffering ends with me.
I‚Äôm beginning to think that the old adage that women have instinctively dreamed of having babies throughout history is a myth. Sure in biblical times if a woman didn‚Äôt have children, she was shunned and had no means of support if her husband died. But that‚Äôs different from WANTING babies, deep down. I suspect that, given the luxury of choice, most women would choose not to be mothers.
If he was so smart how come he's dead?
My ancestors expect me to pass on my terrible looks and genetics, all just for continuing the bloodline, haha. They couldn't care less that our descendents will suffer from the judgemental eyes of society.
Yes
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt touch this‚Äù grandma üòâ
Good. 
Serves them right for having kids.
As if any of them really had a choice on whether or not to have kids themselves.
There is no afterlife; thus our ancestors can't watch us end "the bloodline."
I think they‚Äôd understand.
My ancestors were war lords
That's the thing though the bloodline doesn't end. Go back 2 or 3 generations and some sibling went off and branched the tree that have their own kids. Man this whole debate is so annoying.
I actually thought like that. My sister and all my cousins don't want to have kids because of carrer reasons and not wanting to invest the money and time into it. I actually thought my bloodline survived for millions of years just to end because some people are too lazy  to have kids. So I took up the mantel and I am a father now. I love my child like nothing else, but remembering that I actually felt obligated to keep my family alive the next generation is still kinda strange.
What a bunch of LOSERS!!!!!

No respect for your ancestors????

I love my ancestors and I have nothing but respect for them doing what they had to do, making their family their focus at least enough to make sure that I'm here today.

God bless those who came before me and created a path for me to follow. We may not always live in easy times, but our ancestors created so much abundance, that there can be an absurdist philosophy called anti-natalism where unappreciative losers can trash talk everything that is sacred and piss on the fundamental values that create and continue life in our species.


I say a short prayer:

Lord God please bless the OP of this post.
That they may have a moment of enlightenment and see for once the beauty that they are surrounded by in your creation.

That they may at once realize the error of their judgement and renounce the demonic influence that has possessed them and strive for and have faith in the everlasting abundance of Devine Providence.

In your name I pray, God, Father and architect of the Almighty universe.

In the name of the father, the son and the holy Spirit.

Amen.

This sub is full of a bunch of emo teenagers in a phase
reddit recommending to me the most shitty subreddits ever filled with horrible people
This is singularly the most selfish and arrogant generation that ever lived.  Being childfree is to be selfish.  Ending the bloodline is punishing and condemning your ancestors for your selfish behavior.
They don't care.
It's okay, my sister had kids.
My ancestors don't need me to continue the bloodline. My half-siblings on my dad's side all have kids. My maternal grandfather straight up left and started a new family. And my half-cousins on my mom's side are also having kids.
"Sorry, I'm really busy with all those spices I can buy without having to travel across the ocean to get"
Most of my ancestors, up to and including one set of grandparents, married young in arranged marriages and did not meet their spouses until the wedding day. They were expected to produce sons who would carry on the family name and take care of them in old age, with the daughters being extras who would marry into other families. I don't think they would care whether a female like me carried on the bloodline.

*Edit:* Come to think of it, maybe some of my ancestors would be pleased that I don't have kids. They might not have enjoyed having and raising 4 to 10+ kids.
That guy is totally smiling and serene. Probably thinking "they finally got it right!"
I have siblings significantly older than me.  I already have a great niece and great nephew, with plenty of other nieces/nephews entering adulthood.  I can live out my 20s, 30s, 40s, and so on with little worry about the bloodline ending. I don't need to have kids.
I feel pretty confident my ancestors would be thrilled with my decisions. (And they‚Äôre not here to argue with me, so I win). At least three generations of women in my family had abortions, so the tradition of controlling our reproductive destinies lives on. Also, you don‚Äôt have to reproduce to be someone‚Äôs ancestor if it‚Äôs important to you.
I think some of my female ancestors who were kidnapped & raped by warlords wouldn't mind seeing those genes die off.
They didn't leave my lineage with any wealth so fuck them.
Guilt-tripping/shaming me makes me want to do it more
Ancestors came over on the mayflower, im not sorry
That sounds like a them problem
üñïüèª my brother (who retains the surname) has a son. So suck my make believe dick.
Continuing my parents' cursed bloodline? No, thank you.
Oh well. They‚Äôll be aight.
Womp Womp
Womp womp
ü§∑üèæ
If not having kids is what my kids want then we will celebrate every child free moment, negative pregnancy test, sterilization surgery, etc... one already is pretty sure (like 80% according to him at 12 through to now at almost 14) he doesn't want kids. The 17 year old does but not sure about in this world and where it's going. Both know it's not their job to have kids they don't want, can't handle or don't feel right bringing into the world. And my parents and ancestors can suck it if they think it's wrong.
LoL üòÇ yeah, more like "why did it take you so forkin long to end it!?"
They're already dead. They had their time
They‚Äôre dead. Too fucking bad.
One of my grandma became a huge antinatalist after one child. üòÖ So this bs doesn't work in my situation.
I would feel like if they had a bad life they would be happy????
Do they give a f...k about our struggles?
I don‚Äôt care if my ancestors are mad I‚Äôm not having a child with a high likelihood of schizophrenia. I‚Äôm also gay.
I didn‚Äôt have kids but I have 8 nieces and nephews so bloodline is okay lol
Sorry to all my mothers. But yall should have done this earlier.
My ancestors who were raped and didn't want the children they had, or the ones who had 12+ children so they would have someone to tend the farm for free? How about my grandparents who had 7 children just so they could abuse them? Certainly not my parents who had me on accident.
The cycle is at an end, no more suffering
I have zero respect for my ancestors and they can keep away from me if they wanna judge me like thatüòÇ most of them struggled to eat and keep a home. Generations. Yeah totally wanna keep THAT going.
They're probably jealous
Wiping out generations makes me feel successful already. 

It would have been a huge failure on my part if I had children
The people who married children?
Came here to say this.ü§úü§õ
i took this to mean they were happy that i didnt continue putting others through a tough life
ie what most 'tradition' is
They say that this is the definition of The Tradition.
Same üòÑ
What they don‚Äôt know won‚Äôt hurt them.
They're dead, they don't feel shit
>Ancestors who did nothing of importance

Adding great man theory to the list of all things antinatalist.
God bless you ‚úùÔ∏è I hope you see the light and the error in your judgement.

Even though your words will probably continue to spew demonic ugliness, I know in your heart you feel that I am right and you have been misled by others who are blind.

Just know that they cannot let you where you will surely go, as all who have come before us have gone. And in that time, you will seek wisdom and guidance to understand. When that happens, here is the Lord's prayer that will help you through.

The magick of this prayer will protect you and guide you. You don't even need to believe. It works with or without your cooperation. It even works when I say it for you, without your consent or even the knowledge that I have said it for you.

Our Father, Who art in heaven, 
Hallowed be Thy Name. 
Thy Kingdom come. 
Thy Will be done, 
on earth as it is in Heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive those who trespass against us. 
And lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

‚úùÔ∏è
‚ÄúDid nothing of importance‚Äù wow you suck. Imagine your ancestors who fought in the Great War, WW2, Vietnam, etc. Fuck you if you think that.
Isn‚Äôt that kind of a dis to yourself though? If nothing they did was great‚Ä¶ having you was something they accomplished, no?
Maybe not ancestors, but I don't think there's anything wrong with succesfully raising a child into a strong, independent, and functional adult, and feeling proud that they reached their goals in life
Fact, they breed and then strave us. Great job, ancestors.
True'
Tbf most of human history was significantly more sustainable living compared to today. It‚Äôs mostly post industrialization that living standards and consumption/contribution to rampant waste started racking up.
Technically it‚Äôs because there are too many people today, not because the past people used everything. (Sorry, Just being a ü§ì)
That's very rude and disrespectful. Your ancestors cannot be blamed for the illegitimacy of your present and past societal tyrants who have stolen from you and oppressed you.

If you want to make a better world, build a family that is based on righteous principles and rejects central authority figures such as the state and the clergy.

That's why God is important. If God is your master, then there is no ruler powerful enough to rule over you. When you fight for God, you fight for individual liberty.

Your hatred for ancestors is truly not based in anything that will be constructive for you, or anyone else.
I got legit Confederate slave owners in my ancestry, so fuck those guys.
Doesn't most of white LatAm come from conquistadores?
Bro, I'm from Germany...
Meanwhile i was raised in higher than usual income family,i am spoiled, lazy and wealthy enough to raise kids.(and can afford 4d0ption fee)

At 13 years old was interested in David Benatar and Thomas Ligothi works and they changed my views.

Wealth gives people opportunity to use their time for studying and knowledge. Some poor kid has to work starting at 13 years old and never in a million years they would have time to think "Should i bring kids there?" they are barely surviving in poverty so they don't have the luxury of having time chilling on a couch reading a philosophical book or even thinking by themselves on what they should be doing.

&#x200B;

They are following lifescript since it's so easy to do.
So it‚Äôs not lazy to expect to inherit everything and not have to work for it? Give me a break. Go make something of yourself.
Man the antinatalists just won't stop telling on themselves for being classist huh?
Lmao needing someone to get you money while you do jack shit is lazy you hypocrite
True
different people have different values due to the environment they are rasied in. this is why people care about ancestor worship. they were raised to believe it. i hope that answers your question
"Cult needs more slaves and followers. Get to work outperform your sister!(in terms of how many times you had unprotected vaginal sex)"

Is your sister religious? Because if she is or were during creating kids,sadly there was no way for her to even think about not creating kids. All religions in the world make reproduction a main quest in people life no one should skip! The more kids the better!

>Why would I perpetuate this bullshit?

There is no reason for you to do that,but 90% of people think with their heart,feelings and emotions,not logic and math. So when they are horny or are in love with someone,naturally people create kids without giving it a single thought.

The funny thing is antinatalism was created with feelings and emotions,it's just that people don't have enough empathy to their kids to spare them from existence.

And people don't want to take in kids from 0rphanages because "they are not mine". So the only thing they do is reproduce mindlessly.
Your family should have ended the cycle Insted of just passing it down to you. 

That was shitty of them, but fortunately, not everyone has this experience.
[deleted]
Tbf it‚Äôs hard to fault people getting horny considering contraceptives were at one point (and for a long time) wrapping a sheep intestine condom. We got it made these days with a variety of methods to ‚Äúscratch that itch‚Äù as it were without producing offspring.
Imagine them having made immense sacrifices just so you could be here right now and waste all that time, money, and sacrifice writing that comment.
"do you really think that all women suffered miserable, joyless lives? that no man ever loved his wife? that no gay person ever lived in peace? that no child ever grew up to live a life they loved? that no parent ever saw their disabled child and cared for them anyway? that nobody ever had sex, and enjoyed it? that no priest was ever truly virtous, that nunneries were always places where women were sent away to be locked up? do you really think that it was just suffering day in, day out, unless you were the richest of the rich? do you really think that simply living in a different time made people stupid, senseless, violent? do you really think that people living in the past were so different from us, that they never had thoughts and feelings and dreams to rival our own?

do you really think that people in the past were not people?"

You mean the women would abandon the men with the kids?
That's great üòÉ I want to end my shitty bloodline
Thank you, came to the comments to say this. Ancestors don‚Äôt give a fuck because they are dead.

It should
1,000%
Your ancestor was a god damn supervillain who got away with everything.
My parents said, "You should earn your own wealth instead of depending on us."
Same except I‚Äôm not sorry.
Lmao so now one of the primary goals of evolution is bad? I‚Äôm glad you will remove those ideas from the gene pool.
There is
My Ancestors Are Smiling At Me Imperial, can you say the same? -Skyrim
I don't give a sh.t about people i don't know. ü§∑ Worshipping stupid ancestors is the silliest thing i have ever seen. They were just a bunch of people with miserable lives.
Fundamentally value my vas deferens in your teeth
Amen brother üôè
They may be unhappy with their lives but I don't think they all are teenagers and I don't think treating them as such is a smart move.

Have a nice day anyway
I'd hope that teenagers wouldn't be wanting to have kids tf
So you don‚Äôt agree their voice deserves to be heard? So you don‚Äôt think people should be upset they were forced into a shit world?
Cry harder
This isn‚Äôt a generational thing. It‚Äôs socio-economic and there are plenty of older ppl who have been child free.
Having children to spread your meaningless bloodline is the most selfish thing ever.
Same. He even looks happy.
LoL you sound like Umbrige from Harry Potter
Oh fuck off.
Magick is heresy.

Lol
[deleted]
Get out of here with your verbal abuse.
his ancestor did fight in ww2 ...but for the Germans
[deleted]
Holy shit what are they supposed to do? Starve themselves?
Wars, crop famines and less modern farming practices, no real ways to treat disease, high infant mortality and mothers dying during pregnancy, lack of clean water and education for lower class citizens. Not as sustainable as you might think, at least not within the last couple hundred years.
To be fair, though, we are probs doing more actively today to save the planet than we have ever done before in human history.
Fighting for God has never been for individual liberty. Fighting for God is just an already established propagated status quo forced and interpreted by human beings with their own selfish convictions.

You're either the type to follow a false profit, to worship an antichrist, or one who blindly believes what they choose and uses "God" to justify that. 
Typically a bastardized version as well that only smudges the borders of any so called religion based on convenience.

Pushing personal belief disguised as "Fighting for God" serves and proves nothing.

You were good with the first two paragraphs at least.
Do you really think dead people are concerning themselves with what we're doing down here?
Literally go fuck yourself you freak
Haha, this is like words coming out of a bible basher or something. What a joke.
You know, if I had read the username first, the sudden appearance of Using the Lord's Name in Vain may not have been so jarring.
Oh, na I'm definitely not white. But yeah that makes sense. And generally they try to marry white, or lighter skinned latin people. That's what 2 of my aunts did. One married a very pale american guy, and the other married a fairly light Mexican guy. My dad I'm sure would have liked a white woman but "thankfully" he is with my mom who's kinda dark.

If this sounds weird, it's fine. I think it's weird. Brown people hate brown people
Maybe uh,

Well

Perhaps uhhhh
Not entirely wrong, but I think the "lazy" quip was more tongue and cheek.
Yeah they broke failures who blaming their ancestors, society, literally anyone else.
Some people were brainwashed by religion, you mean.
It really is for "fuck" sake.
If people are horny all they need is sexual release.Reproduction is not their goal. People can give each other pleasure without vaginal sex. We have so many erogenous zones we can abuse to make our partners squirm in pleasure.

People were lame and stupid back then so they didn't experiment with fetishes or foreplay and were doing it raw the moment they got the chance.
i wish i was never born bro. ü§£ü§£ü§£
Sacrifices for who? For non existent future kids? Ancestors were stupid back in the day,i can forgive people who are not educated about life and talk giberish.

But since everyone can research with a phone it's fascinating to me how there are so little AN. Cognitive bias i guess. Lucky that i transitioned when i was 13
o No!!111
Oh please, they didn't even know me or think about me. üòÖ Are you truly bored, little angry natalist?
its not about that. i understand they strived to be happy in those times, but thats the thing. it was a STRUGGLE. probably a quite unconscious, stressful, fever-dreamy struggle for most of them. Heavily influenced by religion and misogynistic culture and non understood puzzling illnesses everywhere.

everything thats ever happened in the past still happens today. its nothing to do with past vs now
No, they died.
I wouldn‚Äôt say that. I believe people are horrible today as well.
Oh true facts. The more I learn about him, the more I think exactly that. The dude was truly evil. I make up for it by not having kids and working in HIV relief lol!
Considering how destructive we are to the planet? To each other? To other species? How unsustainable we have made it for our descendants? And how at least 2 3rds of the human population will likely die horribly due to the effects of that?

Yeah, I'd say it's bad in our case.
Prove it then! üòÄ
Thank you. I've been kind of aggravating these people on here by challenging their ideas, I like that a lot of people on here are clearly intelligent, but in my opinion, could use a real redo of their sense of life, the world, etc.

I'm not super religious but fortunately for me, I AM able to differentiate between good wholesome ideas, and the nasty people often in charge of Jesus Fan Clubs.

I like a higher power(God) and having faith and recognizing the beauty of life.
I also believe in the power of prayer, and when you're talking to someone who's so misguided, it can be above our paygrade to really address the issue, so it's good to pray. It's also a way to show that beneath my criticism and disapproval, there is love, even for someone I don't know, don't agree with, and probably won't ever meet in person.

There is love because that person I'm sure is loved by many people in their life, who know them directly, just like I love the people in my life, and I would always want the people I love, to be treated with love, even by strangers.

People that believe in God and pray, can feel like they're all part of the same struggle. We can bond in the difficulties of life. I think a lot of people on this sub are just pissed at life for other reasons, and it's sad that for a lot of young people, good old fashion faith and determination aren't tools that they were really given. Not by society, their parents or anyone else for that matter.

If I can help even one person, even from a distance, to get a sense of empowerment and climb over whatever is making them think life isn't worth it, then that's fine. It's worth it.
You know this is a meme right ? 

The guy in the photo isn't thinking about people not having kids...
Where do you want me fuck off too. This place is really nice and inviting. It's free and there's nice people. Do want to fuck off with me and maybe we go somewhere cool and fuckity fuck...? Not sure what the fuck off applies to?

What are you fucking off about? Did you run out of words and now your fuckadity poo poo brain box is just fuck sputtering along trying to keep fucking up?
Fuck yeah it is. Heresy where the shit gets interesting and the religious authorities say no go there.

Ever heard of the book called High Magick by Damien Echols?

Interestingly, the Lord's prayer is one of the rituals as it has a tremendous protective effect.

You can choose to believe in that or not too, but lesser magick doesn't have to defy physics. It has tremendous power just in it's bridging between our psyche and fundamental truths of reality.

If there is a truth about anything, just remember that it's authority figures like clergy and government who distort the truth to their own benefit.

They can even take something like the Lord's prayer, and make it into a symbol of oppression.

Don't give them that power. Let good, wholesome things be good, and protect their use and symbolism from tyrants. Part of that is simply refusing to go with the lie. Don't let bad people run our symbols, rituals or anything else.

Keep it free, distributed, decentralized and open to new influences that can have a new take on old, stale ideas.

If you think about it, that's what history is. Recycled ideas.
They most definitely did, if you go back far enough in the past.
lol no
Even then, if they didn‚Äôt commit any atrocities they are fine.
What's wrong with your blood?
You gotta remember that not everyone is failing or had fucked bloodlines. Sure, your bloodline needs to end, but that's not true for everyone.
Failed human beings? Speak for your own experience, but don‚Äôt project that shit on others. If you really believe that your life is worthless I feel bad for you. I think deep down young people see the exponential growth in technology but completely deny it having anything to do with the world population increase. More brains has its benefits too, it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom like the early Eugenicists of old would have you believe.
not bring us into the world
Right but the waste created from a life mostly could be turned back to nature with minimal effort and time. No PFAS back in the day, microplastics, massive CO2 or other ghg emissions (there was some but not even remotely close to today‚Äôs levels). Less modern farming practices were actually more sustainable in some ways. More labor intensive but no chemical pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers were just animal waste and pot ash (a few other pretty sustainable practices). I get that we have better practices today, but prior to the industrial revolution agriculture didn‚Äôt have as much of a long term impact on natural systems.
We wouldn‚Äôt need to save the planet if we weren't dicks to it
For sure there is much more of an active effort to help the environment than ever before, but what I‚Äôm saying is that the environment was less affected by our use of it prior to the Industrial Revolution.
I've thought about it a lot. God is actually an empty variable. undefined.

When a "people" allege that "God" is their ruler, if you follow, that means they don't have a ruler, therefore the incoming tyrant is illegitimate by virtue of being less than "God" which equals "undefined."

It's an interesting trick, really, because the reality is, when group-think kicks into gear, all of the dumb sheeple who follow "God" are actually following men, who claim to have communication with "God."

That being said, a lot of sheep seem to like tyrants, as long as the tyrant is persecuting people they don't like.

Now look back at the original character of this whole Christian show we've been watching for 2000+ years

Original guy Jesus and perhaps earliest followers had something interesting and revolutionary going on, but as the group-think rolls along, it all turns into virtuous excuses for rape, tyrants and conquests.

Likewise you have communists which are a new social experiment. What's their magic? Atheism and the abolition of the empty symbol "God."

So who takes the place of that empty symbol, which rests vacant in the minds of every human? Like an empty seat, or throne, only empty because there truly seems to be something hard-coded in our brains that desires that CATCH-ALL empty symbol of "whatever I don't get it God must have done it."

That empty God Throne gets filled by Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao, Kim Jong whatever!

So, why I respect the concept of God, is because from the evidence I see, God is a symbol that casts off tyrants, and then gets used by tyrants. It's a powerful symbol. But power doesn't make it necessarily bad, especially if it can be used to cast off a Hitler or a Stalin.

Like all symbols it's a tool. Use it to liberate yourself. You can say things like "don't tell me what to do! My only master is God." Lol

Try that in China, and you'll be working in an Apple üçé factory in NO TIME.

When they colonized America in the early days, people used their religion to create a culture that eventually welcomed everybody. It's not perfect but it's more true in America than anywhere else. Take a second to think about it. I know a lot of shit talk about America goes on, but I really don't think there is a more free place in the world, as far as people and ideas, from a general standpoint.

God was a symbol that in that case was used to cast off monarchy. I think that was a win, a step in the right direction.

So I wouldn't throw God away completely. It's useful.
Can you elaborate please? I'm not really sure how you think I should fuck myself. My dick isn't small, but I'm not sure if it's long enough/flexible enough to pull it off. I've seen it done in porn but those guys/gals are way more talented than me. I'm also not sure if it would really be that gratifying. Have you had any luck?

And also, thanks for the compliment, it's good being freaky üòò
Wow, quality discourse there. 

Fucking yikes.
>Brown people hate brown people

Conscientemente no, pero el sesgo se nota mucho.
Poe's law
I guarantee you don't make near enough to support any children you may want. And if you're arrogant enough to think you do, you're not ready to have any.
Well yeah. If you're broke, don't bring kids into that situation. That's selfish. That shouldn't be controversial.
you say that as if athiests or antithiests cant also be raised with shit morals. the problem is the urge to make your children exactly like you. like clones. that mirror speech and body language word for word. that happens to non theists too. religion is obviously problematic im an antithiest myself but its not the core issue

edit: religion isnt just problematic, its cancerous as it very actively rewards making populations homogenous in thought
Yeah, fucking should only be for fuck's sake, not for procreation's sake.
Absolutely also anything but procreative sex was considered a sin‚Ä¶ so that was a thing lol.
Skill issue
People are just normal.
Proof?
Oh I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that, RIP to them üôèüèª I got confused for a second
Womp womp
Prove there isn‚Äôt.
I agree
You mean he isn‚Äôt my dead ancestor either ?
Oh I‚Äôm a happy heretic. Love Damien Echols.
I figured based on your tone you were a high and mighty Christian here to bludgeon us with the ‚Äúword of god.‚Äù I have very little patience for evangelists.

Fluoride makes us stupid and compliant, and microplastics and chemicals make us sick and suppress our gene expression. It sucks. But the rest of the comforts are pretty awesome. Shame the dollar is worth so little. Almost as if by design üò±
"Hitler was born to a practicing Catholic mother, Klara Hitler, and was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church"

This took all but 10 seconds to find on Wikipedia dot com, the free online encyclopedia that you can read anytime you like.
Crazy how angered people are at the simplest mention of religion lol.

Funny comeback
[removed]
What an assumption, my God! I make $90k and already have a son‚Ä¶.
But to hate life and everyone who does enjoy it and to be so bitter and full of resentment about other people‚Äôs choices?
what does this mean
Then i prefer being weird/non normal then.
What proof? They were dead for a long time when i was born. üòÖ
No worries!
I've not gone up to anyone else and told them what to do, only explained the reason why I feel the way I do about ME not having kids. Which is what you commented on in the first place, so womp womp all you want if it makes you feel better that not only were you unable to get anyone to care about your opinion on their own choices, you also encounted logical arguments as to why they went for those choices. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You were the one who stated there is an afterlife, then you are the one who should bring some proof first. ü§∑ Or prove there it isn't the flying spaghetti monster.
Yeah that's why I have my own version of the Jesus story. I like to think of him as a time period-accurate anarchist that caused such a ruffling of feathers that they had to hang him up on a cross to get him to shut the fuck up.

Not unlike Socrates or many other antagonizer types. I do realize the ideas and methods were very different but those antagonizer types play an important role in making sheeple turn into GOATS

Christianity is very right hand path for most followers, which again, can be good or bad depending on the energy and will of the person holding the ideas.

Okay, so the reason for my antagonizing here, and my use of Christianity, is to weed out and reject the arguments of the anti-natalists that are just religious, group-think idiots of a different breed than "evangelists."

The most scary religious people to me, are the ones that replace God, with the state. They often call themselves atheists, but in practice, they believe in a god-like concept. Such religious statists are very anti family because the decentralized institution of family is the biggest threat to the state and its holy monopoly over death and violence.

When the state says do something stupid, real family people be like, "fuck you"

And that stops guys like MAO from killing 20 million people for no reason.

We all gotta know who the new "Catholic" church is. It's this slippery slimy government overreach and erosion of individual rights to rule ourselves.

Also, just want to point out that the true destruction of the Christian religion is when it became the Roman religion of the state under Constantine, I think. I mean I don't know all the details like a scholar but I would point to that being a big part of how it got roped into so many scams and murder conquests.

I mean seriously. Co-opted, appropriated, whatever you want to call it.
I did put etc. If you really believe it is worthless, don‚Äôt have kids but don‚Äôt shit on other people who have them.
They might be worthless to you. But they are just happy being alive.

Not every human being has to make millions to have worth.
I‚Äôm not going to let you shift the argument, as if advances in tech was a vote that got cast based on popularity. You‚Äôre dissing yourself, full stop. Even if it‚Äôs disguised in pseudo-sophisticated Nihilism. But let me ask you this, were all the pets that those people owned worthless if their human masters seemingly were too? Maybe we should exterminate all their offspring in advance because they didn‚Äôt do anything that you deem is important.
He himself was not a practicing catholic though.. 

He was the product of incest however, his mom married her uncle.

Many people in this sub seem to think raising kids requires $300K annually or something.
Disagreeing with someone's choice to have kids on moral grounds is not the same as hating them or hating their enjoyment of life. 
You have no legitimate arguments against anti-natalism itself so the best you can do is to to try and paint an image of anti-natalistas all being "hateful" and "resentful", even if those descriptors where to apply to some anti-natalists it wouldn't even actually discredit the philosophy in anyway. if your gonna disagree with anti-natalism at least actually point out reasons why it's wrong instead of just making assumptions about the people who agree with it
I'm not talking about not being able to afford a second pool in the backyard. Or a poor person in a nice country in Europe where there's social benefits. 

I'm talking about US citizens who can't afford essentials & are one paycheck away from the streets. Where if a child get's sick there's no money for hospital bills. It's selfish to bring a child into that. That's not classist. You don't seriously believe that children in that situation are going to escape it as adults. Is it possible? Yes. But for the majority not so. Not everyone in the US is at that level of broke but there's a reason GenZ & Millennials aren't having kids. There's no money for that for most americans anymore.
You have an issue with skill (or lack of it)
Ok.
They are in heaven watching you right now most likely
Do what you want, but many here shit on anyone who has kids.
The other guy said there was not first.
I hear you, but it is very hard to convince people who are disillusioned with the structure of Christianity. and while Jesus may have individually been a pretty good person. The organizations of Christianity have not been. Also begining with insults will not help foster a sense of empathy for your cause. 
I hope this can help you learn something (I understand that sentence is often used sarcastically, I am not though and do really hope you can learn. As learning is the best thing people can do!)

I agree. But the way this sub spits hate and venom at people who can afford to and choose to have kids from some moral high ground is baffling. 

I bet every single person in this sub acting superior has some character flaw or way of life I don‚Äôt agree with, but it doesn‚Äôt affect my life so I‚Äôm not going to cry about it.
what is your evidence of this?
Hell to the no. üòÖ They weren't such a good people.
Oh I know, it's annoying when people shit on you for having or not having kids without any other justification isn't it? :)
Because the whole thing is just a theory without any proof.
Many of the people in this sub shit on anything they see where someone has children, sorry for misunderstanding.
And who gives worth exactly?
you‚Äôre literally here ‚Äî crying about our way of life.
Source: I made it tf up
Ok
Yup. So I shit back.
Is there proof of there not being one?
[deleted]
[deleted]
why are you randomly telling me i have no skills? what‚Äôs your problem?
Oh? So that's what this was?
Cause from my understanding, shitting back only applies when you don't instigate it üòÇ
Is there any proof that the flying spaghetti monster isn't real? You need the bring some proof at first...
Good
So what defense do you have if 51% of the population thinks that the other 49% is worthless and wants to get rid of them? I know you‚Äôre not saying this directly yet if you follow your logic out in any direction you end up in Eugenics as I mentioned earlier.
That's the ting though, you might decide someone is worthless, but that doesn't really make them worthless. 

They can still just ignore you and live a happy life
Just a stupid natalist, as always. Don't feed the troll.
Idk I just enjoy shitting
You also need proof, and for both of us it is unobtainable. But I sure as fuck believe in an afterlife. You may not, but you do you.
This is absurd. This picture is from University of Arizona. Happened yesterday I think.
Men are truly so scary.
Almost guaranteed these people are religious.
ASU student here. Saw those fuckers yesterday too. The abortion caused cancer nutjob also appeared today.
"women are property"??? Really? Please tell me that's satire or something because even the most far right women wouldn't agree on that
Someone should spray em with fake blood.
Women are property? Whose property?!
i wonder if itd be illegal to spray them with sticky sugar water from water guns
If I am property, it means I am not bound by any laws, so I can hit them in the head with an axe and there should be no consequences, correct? 
I am not condoning violence, but these people are asking for it. /s
It is absurd but exactly the kind of signs / beliefs people would hold together
And people still think we‚Äôre overreacting‚Ä¶
Oh hey! They are finally saying the quiet part out loud!
I'm likey starting the Depo shot in November for heavy periods and I hope to the skies that these fuckwits don't have enough supporters in power to take that away .
I am pretty sure they are looking for someone to attack them so they can suit the school or at least there was a band of annoying street preachers who made serious money that way.

If they are being unironic then they must suck at life and be very pathetic to have slavery fantasies. It's usually the biggest losers who want to hurt and control people.
they're getting more bold outright saying women are property. a lot of them always felt that way. but there's a growing movement amongst weird creepy fascists to repeal the 19th amendment and no fault divorce and basically do everything to make women property who have no power.

don't underestimate how much these things will be absorbed by the "mainstream" right either, especially since they're just the ones who don't yet say the quiet part out loud. i guarantee they've already heard it. They're all drinking downstream from the nazis and 4chan incel groyper freaks.

the JD Vance "thought experiment" giving more votes to "parents" is part of that agenda. spoiler: the hypothetical extra votes go to the father.
I would have stood right next to them, holding a sign saying "Men are property" and "Men cause cancer".
This is at my alma mater. These people are baiting for someone to physically attack them so that they can sue for assault. They are right wing grifters.
I think this was at ASU. They had another sign that said "Most Muslims are terrorists" with the "most" in much smaller letters. They are hoping they piss off somebody who assaulted them and they can sue the university for not protecting them.
Again, these men are the ones simultaneously claiming that men are the oppressed victims in society... because they aren't allowed to quite literally enslave women.

Imagine being one of these guys then crying about how misandristic women are online.
American Taliban
This is fucking crazy how was this allowed? So many men are insane.
These dudes are into pegging
the ‚Äúwomen are property‚Äù sign is so absurd and blunt that it made me laughüíÄ
Actually, women are human beings and my birth control is helping prevent cancer and abortion should be a CHOICE for each individual that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called pro CHOICE you fuckwads
Those aren‚Äôt men, they are something else
Ah, those Christian weirdoes who think their own sex is trash and helps the man destroy it. Who wouldn't want one of those as your mother?
Wow saying the quiet part out loud
Gross
The times I wish I had a paint ball gun with me in a certain location.
I find it funny how a man is saying women are property and I bet he can‚Äôt even afford one ü•¥
Probably the most mask-off thing I've ever seen, so far.
Christians and incels

The great people of MAGA
I'd choose cancer over being impregnated by one of these losers every day. People who don't mind their business are so fucking gross.
So ‚Äòwomen are property‚Äô does not contravene anti slavery laws? 

A question  from beyond US shores.
Californian here who graduated from college years ago. These clowns actually go on tours around all campuses across different states.

I actually talked with one of them after they gathered up their stuff at the end of the day. They are obviously extremely religious, but even they don‚Äôt believe in some of the things they say. It‚Äôs intending to provoke.

I figured out the unspoken part pretty easily: they want to provoke an attack to sue for money.
"Women are property" wow.. f*cking hell... and I get called "obsessed" with feminism.
How does this person still get to hold this board. How isn't he verbally shamed to the point of leaving. Honestly, I'm not sure if I wouldn't try to call the police. Protesting is legal, but I'd call this:
possible Incitement to Violence Harassment/Threats, Civil Rights Violation, Public Disturbance/Disorderly Conduct..
I literally just dropped my 17 year old son at the Dorms here. sheeeeeeesh.
The 'drunks burn in hell' shirt is kind of iconic (if you take away all the bigotry and hatred).
"Women are property"? They aren't even trying to hide their misogyny.
I would have smacked that dude holding the property sign
Ugh, I remember wanting to go to ASU when I was a teenager. But it's a hot spot for right wing nut-jobs hounding after college students to support their vile causes.

Arizona is SUPER politically divided. Phoenix in particular is insanely polarized. (ASU is in the Phoenix area)The most radical right wing and left wing people I've met in my life were from that area. MAGA and the right wing leadership has been trying to eradicate abortion and women's rights in general there for years.

 I can't imagine bringing a child into AZ, especially a girl.
Not to even mention Southern AZ is the human trafficking/kidnapping capitol of the USA. (Mainly preying on women of course) It's a city I don't feel safe in unless I'm walking in a large group of women, or with at least two other guys. As a local you're not encouraged to bring this up because then tourism would go down a LOT.
Looks like the heat there finally cooked their brains.
PROPERTY?!?!?!??!??????????
This makes me sick. Did you guys see where the Taliban now don't even want women to have the right to talk? üò• WTF Why do some men hate women so much? Is it because their mom was mean to them when they were little?
Tge dude with women are property flag would get roundhoused
As a man, these bastards are spitting on the almost centuries long fight for equality that both men and women were fighting for, deplorable, despicable and extremely shortsighted, they should say that to their mother's face first and then lets see what happens.
And they wonder why we choose the bear lol Do they really think people will be more likely to marry them if they get rid of no-fault divorce? After we lost reproductive rights a bunch of millennial women I know who had one baby or zero babies went and got their tubes removed because they weren‚Äôt willing to risk their life with a pregnancy.¬†

The fence sitters shut it down, and the ones who had babies decided it was one and done. So yeah, keep pushing dudes. We‚Äôve already stopped dating you. Do you want to be completely shunned from society because we can
How TF have we as a country regressed so much? It‚Äôs baffling.
Remember to vote because these nutjobs sure will.
Without sarcasm, I truly thought this was satire.
My womb is the closest I‚Äôll get to homeownership : /
I hate having to live on this planet with sexist and general  tards
This is either satire or those people are mentally handicapped.
Religion is a disease
I know where I‚Äôd like to shove both those signs.

Can‚Äôt wait for the fucking idiot boomer generation to go the fuck away.
False flag to rile up the voting youth
The fact there are citizens of the United States that actually believe that women are property is enough to know that we will never be a whole nation. We must irradiate this type of thinking from our people.
Well are you going to throw rocks at him or just take pictures. Because one actually solves the problem and the other just spreads his message.
what sucks the most is the women who were also there. like unfucking believable. why can‚Äôt i be a man.
saw a lot of videos of this "protest"..its insane people like this exist
Surprised no one committed an act of terrorism (or attempted to) at this rally
Me reading the sign on the left: "sooo my bisalp can cause cancer? Thought it was the opposite ..."
If you pull out you're getting cancer young men!
Men is too much of a blanketing term, try Christiofascist
the same thing happened at penn state the other day, it‚Äôs crazy how many people think propaganda like this is good for society
These guys come to asu too. They are actually doing it to provoke assault so they can sue assailants. Its really weird
Are men property too? No? Just vaginas? Okay then
I wonder who they will be voting for.
Had people like that come to my university last year. All they want is the attention and for people to look them up (this is basically all they do)
Good, they'll inspire more Harris votes
How evil!!! üëø
It's the natural result of cults being legal
They need another sign that says "Guess why I'm unemployed and single"
"women are property"
sounds about christian
I feel like these protesters are far more likely to give you cancer than any birth control.
How weird...
Did someone at the sign store actually agree to print "women are property" on a big banner?
Hold on I know how to make things iI dont like go away...Going to work and paying bills causes cancer.¬†


Did it work?¬†
American Taliban
Women will be property of we don't vote these Republicans out of office. They're full blown Nazis now.
My coworker who is a trumper said to me the other day, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for a conservative to be on a college campus.
That‚Äôs a fun amount of stupid in one picture
Its an argument so bad that I don't believe they believe it themselves. They are just trying to be "persecuted" for religious freedom or for free speech or something
Those men are scared.... so scared their dick has shrunk up into their intestine.  KAMALA HARRIS 2024!!
Grab him by the ball sack. Funny how men understand consent when it‚Äôs reversed
I meeannnn the oral contraceptive can cause cancer but these people are kinda fucking nuts. Wish they‚Äôd put money into women‚Äôs health care rather than using all their brain cells to stand around with pickets
Looks like Westboro Baptist Church members.
Ugh. Disgusting but not surprising. I've grown up in a rural area of the U.S. Bible Belt. There are tons of people saying things like this, with Trump flags on their pick-up truck. As a nonbinary, afab socialist, supposedly trying to brainwash their kids with my "woke" agenda, I never feel safe. I hear my neighbors doing target practice often. I'll never understand how people can think things like this. Do they have no empathy? Do they not realize Google is free? It's really not that hard to do some research about something on google before going to a PROTEST about it. Don't they care about the truth at all? It's baffling! And their stupidity is putting so many people in danger, and through pain they don't deserve. How can you even begin to interact with someone who doesn't support basic human rights? And why are there so many of them?!
The second sign makes me want to do crime
Abortion prevents cancer If you think about it
Women are property? Maybe 200 years ago‚Ä¶.
‚ÄúWomen are property?‚Äù 

This is the kind of message religious nuts preach, and then they have the audacity to ask why I‚Äôm anti-theist / New Atheist.

Society has gone downhill since Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett died and Richard Dawkins and Ayaan Hirsi Ali were deplatformed. We need a new outspoken atheist / anti-religious movement.
Notice how no women are standing by them?
This happens at universities all the time! They are trying to get assaulted so they can sue the university for a low settlement. Happened at my Uni too just don't interact.
That means that, as with guns, if women start killing men, then its not the responsibility of the woman, but the man who owns her.
I swear these people are paid actors. Who in their right fucking mind would carry a "women are property" sign....
Okay, what the actual FUCK?! This is unbelievable. Like, I‚Äôm fucking speechless, this is horrible.
If they're openly saying this we should take them serious.
Resume the bombardment, commander. Wipe this pathetic planet from the face of the galaxy.
This is red hot misogyny.
Aren't these the type of people that do this publicly to get people to attack them, so they can take them to court? Those just seem like trigger words, and seem to be doing a pretty good job.
These guys have been showing up at several high schools and I think (?) a middle school around town, too. Little early in the year for them to show up to the campus. Guessing it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs an election year.
Women are property? Tell that to my face sir. I want to beat you up with your own bible
Yes, those same men have carried their signs all over Tucson. They staged a demonstration outside of Catalina Foothills High School in the morning before showing up at UofA (the students there peacefully responded with a drum line to drown them out!) and at Flowing Wells High School the following day. ü§Æ
‚ÄúWoman are property‚Äù 

The rage that reading this caused me, I want to commit a felony
When I was at nmsu back around 2017 or so these same people came to campus and were spouting the same shit. Basically they try to goad students into hitting them so that they can sue. They also film the whole thing. Luckily all the students just banded together to trash them verbally. I'm sure there's a video somewhere they made of me and the other students telling them to fuck themselves.
Not noticing a wedding ring on the ‚Äúwomen are property‚Äù sign holder. That tracks.
Their mothers are rolling in their graves, and they are unwed. Their aunts wouldn't look them in the eye if you paid them, and they no longer have any daughters. They have sons from the wife who left them, but they will not carry on the name. They will die alone in ICU, abandoned by even the God they so value.
Man.. I can only wonder why religious men are having such a hard time finding partners nowadays..

Is this the new westgateverthefuck Baptist nutso? Those whole antigay people evolving to this nonsense
Is this the Westboro Baptist crazy church losers again?
ain't no way
Hate from ASU, these people are just bait, waiting to be hit in order to cheat compensation.
I'm hoping that those banners are satirical.
These asshats have been preaching their hate at local HS campuses in the morning then making their way down to UA every day this week. I'm thinking it might be time to infringe on their first amendment rights because this shit ain't welcome here.
Also in [ASU](https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/1f4gww8/sickening_misogynistic_christian_conservative/)
Are we not going to talk about the guy in the bright neon yellow shirt and fishing hat trying to show everyone how small their brains are?

O Dad-eeee
That's not a man...men don't need to devalue others for the sake of their fragile egos.  These are the types of idiots that need birth control, the world doesn't need anymore of these fools.
Dont look like he knows too much about women.
All I have to say is EW!!!
Almost like it's staged
I think the idea that any human is property has traditionally led to bad outcomes in history‚Ä¶ juuuuust saying
Gross
I‚Äôm pretty sure these people have signs with inflammatory things in hopes that you assault them and they can sue.
Disarm them with kindness. Pretend to be interested in their beliefs and get more info about them. Find out who their friends or family are. Find out where they work. Then plaster that mother fuckers face where every woman it comes into contact with knows exactly what it stands for. I say it because these sacks of meat certainly aren't men.
You‚Äôre all deep down gay. Or can‚Äôt get an erection.
America has been way better off with a democratic president than a Republican president every single time. But don‚Äôt just take my word for it, just look at the objective and provable facts that will be easy to research for yourself. (I‚Äôm also an independent voter, not a democrat) hoping our country wises up, knowledge is power!

Well someone said the quiet part out loud.
Men are property
That‚Äôs just wild
Saw a video last night of a guy saying ectopic pregnancies are murder while protesting abortion
The only cancer it causes is the protesters outside clinics
That‚Äôs really inappropriate. I think a slogan like ‚ÄòFat Dog for Birth Control‚Äô would be much better.
Photoshopped image posted on social media.
Keep them outside and out of the shade, God will take care of them, I have no doubt.
Gross
That shade of red probably wasn‚Äôt the best choice for a sign color. Maybe something teal or a deep yellow with apricot tones might be softer on the eyes.
You know who they're voting for, the fuck
These are called provocateurs, and they are paid to be there.

Stop letting wingnuts rile you up, some of you get on your phone just hoping to be offended.
I thought the left banner was already absurd until I see the right one.
These bigots are so hot on the 1st and 2nd Amendments but completely ignore the 14thand 19th
Trump supporters, I'll bet.
They should've had women holding signs with them. That would be were the fun starts
What in the 1824 is this
Woah!? Drunks burn in hell??? That's a bit much, am I right?
These would make great shooting range targets!!
I wish I could turn chimpanzee and throw my shit on them
How do we,know they aren't posers?
Westboro Baptist?
Protesting in August Tuscon also leads to cancer.
I guarantee somebody lost a bet‚Ä¶
wow, never thought i‚Äôd see that on a poster
Satire is dead and these people killed it.
This just got me so fucked up. I don‚Äôt ever want to see something like this again in my life

Def ASU
I would go to jail if I was at this. This property is about to give out free knuckle sandwiches
Is that Brother Dean or whatever his name is? He's been a blight on campus for over a decade
it's the ''women are property sign'' for me. it's so horrible that im not even mad, it's so horrible that it's hilarious. i can only laugh üòÇüòÇ
is this for real? C'mon.
Man, I miss the days when it was the crazy guy just yelling, "Yoshua!" on the corner of the mall.
That fat ugly guy doesn‚Äôt own any ‚Äúproperty‚Äù or get laid.
Hippity hoppity women are property
Whose property????
Women
1. Hormonal contraception CAN increase chances of certain cancers (breast and cervical). That one is correct. 
2. ‚ÄûWomen are property‚Äù used to outline negative treatment of women or is he/she delusional? 

I bet my ponytail these are devout Christian‚Äôs, preaching the good word but being horrible people at the same time.
I don't want to sound bad but I laughed - it so ridiculous üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ
Bring back the tar and feather!
[removed]
PLEASE someone tell me (**not** joking or in jest or ironically, etc) this is satire!

No takers?

Then I'll claim that mainstream definitions of "normal" and "abnormal" behavior, the belief that "unmanly" men (even cis-het ones who happen to not be 'manly') are just a Satanic plot (or at least a Ruso-Chinese one) to destroy America by destroying its social stability.
Yeah i am choosing the bear too
Incel Fascist pigs
Women are property?!?!
Tucson???
Just saying the quiet part out loud at this point. Very cool.

Campuses have always had weirdos. Penn State had (maybe has still?) the Willard Preacher. He‚Äôd spout nonsense about sin and homosexuality, and even in the 90s, no one paid much attention.
the abortion and property things are actually insane, buuut oral contraceptives can increase the chances of some cancers (but also decrease the chance of others.)

but these people are bonkers and need better shit to do. üíÄ
These people usually don‚Äôt believe the signs they hold. They are just advertising to create an angry mob, then some guy goes around the back with business cards saying ‚Äúthose guys are crazy right? Our church doesn‚Äôt believe in that stuff. You should join us‚Äù.
Very strong chance that these people are just hoping someone hits them on school property so they can collect a fat settlement.
I read the left one first an was concerned, then I saw the right one‚Ä¶ wtf is wrong with these people?
The transformed wife is going to love this one
Is the guy with the sign on the right being serious? I could see someone doing that to make forced birthers look bad. I have said I want to join an anti abortion protest with a sign that says stop abortion our pastors and priests are running out of children to rape. Haven't had the opportunity yet
This "property" would make their lives a living hell.
Watch yourself OP. 

I've seen these types before, their lack of a clear messaging/crass signs makes me think they're instigators. 

Watch for a camera, this happened once or twice at my campus a few years back. Basically some people will show up to presumed liberal leaning spaces to "protest" shouting just whatever they think will get people mad, and hope somebody attacks them so they can sue. 

They're not actually protesting anything, but since they technically have the right to be there, the best you can hope to do is just ignore them.
Someone needs to run over the "women are property" sign holder
This reminds me of a video I saw once of a wild hamster attacking some dude‚Äôs foot.
I‚Äôm half convinced they‚Äôre trolls.  ‚ÄúWomen are property‚Äù. Being right on a sign and not just implied smells like satire.  But it‚Äôs so hard to tell these days
Women are property ? Seriously lol WTF üòÇüòÇ cavemen mentality have they just crawled out of a prehistoric time warp
*Humans / Conservatives* are truly scary

Fixed

Remember that there are many women in those movements to, and men defending the right to choose
"Women are property" - They said the quiet part out loud.
This happened very frequently at the college I went to along with another group that had anti-Catholic stuff. Generally they don‚Äôt even believe what‚Äôs on their signs. They‚Äôre just fishing for a lawsuit. Public college campuses can‚Äôt legally ask them to leave or have them removed, and if that happens, they sue the school. It‚Äôs their full time jobs. And the crazier rage bait they can come up with, the more likely they will get asked to leave which is all part of their scheme.
their argument for this is going to be abstinence,  I know it.
If they're not trolling, then these women-repellant persons won't ever have to worry about getting anyone pregnant.
what the actual fuck
Apparently Arizona now has more inbreeding than Arkansas.
We are at a point where I don't know if people are dumb or just trolling the dumb people.
If I am property, then my owner should expect to die. Yknow bc I‚Äôm a person that wants freedom over anything else lol‚Ä¶Idiots
They should be done away with. This is dangerous to society up there with terrorism.
You Americans sure as fuck better show up and vote this year.
I would have become a whole new problem. I‚Äôm not afraid of confrontation and I would have been beating ppl with signs. They have a right to protest, not threaten more than half the population.
Bunch of f*cking Talibans...
More like Fox News causes cancer.
How about men being property, of their company, their parents, their country? Hmm...
This is obviously a bit different but it reminds me of the classic quote. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you noticed people picketing for banning abortion are people you wouldn‚Äôt wanna fuck in the first place?‚Äù

Fat old dudes saying women are property. They are DESPERATE. Ew.
Everything can cause cancer or diabetes or...
These are professional Trolls trying to get a rise out of people to get assaulted and then sue for millions against people, the school, the government. I walk right through their crowds and ignore them and eventually they leave. They love when people engage with them and yell at them.
I mean they're obviously not serious. No one is stupid enough to actually believe that women are property.
I'm sorry- HOW do abortions and birth control cause cancer? Abortions are either just 2 pills (sometimes only 1) you take, or a small medical procedure at a clinic done by a professional. And birth control is just progestins, or copper if you get that IUD. I'm not seeing the connection, what's the source?
A vote for Trump is a vote for these guys
Whoever held that ‚Äúwomen are property‚Äù sign deserves the fucking worst.
This is the sort of sign i would make to mock these whackjobs but poe's law is a bastard these days and they're full on mask off with this shit now.
The women are property sign must be simply assuming that they are, not advicating for it.
For midterms
Oh please. Those weirdos are paid for Leftist hired shills to make Christians look bad. Astroturfers.
Are you sure someone's not in their midst mocking them?
They go to college campuses because they know the students will engage with them. This happened at my college and payed them no mind. Now the young adults on campus engaged with them. They are trying to bate you into getting into a fight verbal or physical. So that it goes viral or makes the news. They aren‚Äôt looking to have a conversation with you. They are looking for a fight with you so that they can say that other side is violent and extreme. Do not engage with them. I beg. They will stop showing up if everyone ignores them.
The same man saying women are property doesn't understand why he is unhappy in his relationship, lol.
I would be surprised if they have a permit to be there on a campus at a collage. most places need a permit to protest or to do this. 

Complain to campus police. this is beyond crazy.
[removed]
The Cancer can be convince bc fear mongering is a powerful tool especially with medical issues and since their speaking to pro lifers who are just looking for an argument will shout this shit to the point where the majority of people think it's a just common knowledge.

But the women are property does basically destroy any sort of BS they wanted to spit.
Can we get an article or anything?
Brother dean and co need to get their ass beat again
Westboro Baptist Church is basically mainstream now.
With how bad the messaging is, you'd think this is a psyop

Somebody‚Äôs mad cuz bringing back couverture law is their only recourse. They would become communists if meant a woman like other provisions and amenities would be allotted to every man.

Good ol' crazy Christians from the mayflower.
I'm assuming "women are property" is a counter-protest, labeling the other's (backwards) views.

I really hope no one feels that sincerely.
‚ÄúWomen are property‚Äù how is this supposed to convict anyone that they‚Äôre the correct side?
The fear-based Abrahmic mythologies are a horrific blight upon humanity.

Allow me to state this group is evil & anti human. Anti natalism. Evil.

This is why they sell full-length bare ax handles.
I'd just stand with a sign "make slavery great again" near them, pretending I'm one of them.
Turning this into absolute circus is a thing better than trying to convey the idea they are wrong.
these people r the original rage-baters in real life. people need to stop giving them attention
Expecting downvotes here, but this must be a paid group or something. Even the crazies of Beaumont wouldn‚Äôt show up with these types of signs
If they are xtians, I wonder if they know that inciting people to anger is a sin‚Ä¶ üò¨
Well, where's their proof of acquisition, then? Where's their receipts?

They're such great businessmen, right? You'd think they'd know how to keep better track of the inventory and paperwork! Oh, and don't forget about our maintenance and the extended warranty, at owner's expense!

Where's their deed that shows how wonderful they are for the world and explains how they are worthy of being entitled to our time, energy and help bringing up the children?

Sorry, the rape, murder and theft in the fine print don't count as professional ways of treating property. And once all the property is gone, it probably won't be coming back. No replacements, no refunds.
Big crowd of the insane
I know they believe women are property,  that's not shocking. But I am shocked they're just out right SAYING it again
I‚Äôm not as afraid of cancer as I am of the prospect of birthing and raising a baby. At least cancer kills me quicker.
Women are property??? Lol can‚Äôt even take that seriously enough to get upset üòÇ
I went to school here.. What an embarrassment.
As a straight man, I don't condone this behavior. This is hate speech, not free speech.

Also Women ‚â† property.

Saying women are property is like saying Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food.
I mean there's a lot here, but to say that physical removing something from your body CAUSES cancer shows a clear lack of understand of what cancer is. It would honestly seem more reasonable/accurate to say that abortion is actually a sort of removal of a form of cancer
"Women are property" XDDDD I'm crying. Who in the fuck made that sign and thought "this is great we sure will get a lot of support with this one" so fuckin sad that this is the reality I live in. Man God abandoned us a long time ago. "Do you think God stays in heaven because he too fears what he created?" -spy kids 2
That‚Äôs ASU not UoA
Women. Are. Property. I think that‚Äôs enough internet for me today.
Women are property? What?
We do a bit of trolling
Omg this happened on my campus last year. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same group, but their signs had the same verbiage. One of my professors said that because we go to a public institution the school had to let the people protest (1st amendment) and to not engage because these people wanted a reaction and to sue if something got physical.
these people need to face consequences
Based
This is what they want, this is their base. They want women as second class citizens again
If they aren‚Äôt Christians I will literally boil and eat my own shoe.
I can confirm it, saw them today. The pink banner dude's shirt has a Bible quote. i dont remember what it is but it goes something like "The curse has a cause".
No, they‚Äôre fake preachers that travel to campuses across the nation trying to get people so mad that somebody hits them. Then they sue. Works every time.
They're giving some real Westboro Baptist Church vibes.
The neon "Drunks burn in hell" shirt and Corinthians verse verify that.
More like use religion as a way to justify rape/unwanted pregnancies
There are folks who are fundie Christian and come to the conclusion that women are property and folks who see women as property and gravitate towards a belief system to justify it. Kind of a chicken and egg thing. 

I used to think Christianity and fascism went together like peanut butter and chocolate, now I think they go together like chocolate and more chocolate.
Can one of you go out there with a Bluetooth speaker and just blast loud music that they would hate near them?
Was there any more context to what they were saying or are they just your average regressively quintessential idiots? Because I have trouble believing that people actually think like this

Are there any news stories or other posts about this?
I beg you- if he shows up again, please just go up to him, stop, look at him, then ask, very sincerely, very calmly "...How much attention *would* be enough for you?"

Edit: Or just write "attention" on a few slips of paper, go to him, and hand it to him, saying "here. You clearly need this". ...Maybe spread the word on campus and get a few people to do it. No swear words or pictures or anything else on the paper. Just write "attention" and give it to him. 

Never get mad at ragebait or try to make them mad. The best tactic is to find a way to say "I don't think you believe any of this, and I think you're just seeking attention". Don't even be gleeful about it. Gray rock. As little emotion as possible. Civil inattention.
Just hit em with pepper spray, go as a group who saw nothing and caused chaos

Unfortunately, a lot of ultra right-wing and radically religious women see themselves as property. I‚Äôve noticed this mostly in Christian and Muslim circles, women believing they must be submissive, docile creatures who do nothing but pop out babies and otherwise serve their husbands.
You‚Äôd be surprised what religious extremism can do to people (think a mix of self-righteousness and Stockholm Syndrome)
Unfortunately, I think that they might..
Former evangelical christian here. Religion: not even once.

If you would like I can explain a bit of it.
seriously what the fuck. how is it possible that someone can hold a sign like that and not get their ass beaten and shot
I thought that one MUST be trolling the protesters?!?!¬†
At least he's being outright with his intentions and mentality instead of trying to lie and says he cares for the unborn children. No pro lifers are pro life, they just want to control women and pretend they care about lives
I had an aunt express that opinion to me at a thanksgiving dinner once and everyone else agreed so probably not satire
Nah. Tradwife life started to trend for a reason. Also alot of straight laced Christian women lowkey have a humiliation/dom fetish I swear
Property of whom? He should be at work all day, if it's his day off,he should be fixing things or with his kids. Funny how none of them mention what men should be doing to earn and maintain " Property ".
I wish I could do a counter-protest just for that kne guy, with a sign saying "Then why don't you own any?"
i literally saw red when I read that fucking sign. if I had seen that in public I would have woken up in jail
If y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt read the Bible, I encourage you to at least pick through it, googling phrases like ‚ÄúBible verse on (women being property)‚Äù women have historically been considered property to the father, then husband, and Christianity affirms that. There are absolutely women who reject positions of authority or dominance and lead a life following their husband/family‚Äôs needs and are effectively property in the way they submit themselves. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A11-15&version=ESV
It‚Äôs biblical.
Deep indoctrination at a young age + fear of ostracism from their social group + feeling of distinction and superiority to the rest of society = some pretty absurd beliefs.

Religion is the perfect tool for justifying domination of a population and the perfect tool for securing it. Telling folks an omniscient entity can literally read their thoughts makes them self-police any flicker of defiance or opposition.
Oh they do exist, then on Fox News for a second
My father literally considered me his property that he would own until he gave me away to a man at least 20 years older than me. I had to move across the country and am still hiding from him
Fake? Why?
It scares me like the real thing.
Nope. With real period blood
Men's property obviously. That's what it says in the Bible. Biblical marriage is a contract to exchange property between a father and to-be-husband. When these bigots talk about going back to marriage like it is in the Bible that's what they mean.
"In addition to covenanting to obey their husbands (as he obeys God), leaving men as intermediaries between women and God, in the official LDS temple marriage ceremony, women ‚Äúgave‚Äù themselves to their husband"

Oh wow, that is insane
They believe almost EXACTLY THE SAME THING!  They want *the same thing* politically: religious law above all. 

It blows my mind why right-wing Christians like this and radical Islamists don‚Äôt band together.
This is spot on
It's not that they're insane as much as they're pathetic. They have to believe they are somehow superior so they try to twist reality and make shit up like "wOmEn aRe pRoPerTy" so that they don't feel like they are the absolute bottom of the food chain, even though they are. They are not physically fit or attractive, they're not smart, they don't make tons of money, they don't have good personalities. This is all they've got, desperation.
They do look like the type. üßê
People who are into pegging want to be *women‚Äôs* property. Big difference
My first thought was that someone rolled up to a protest with a wild sign to make fun of them, like when that guy joined Trump supporters with a sign saying "Birds Aren't Real" to make them look even crazier.
They are reapers and collectors from the Mass Effect series. Seriously, they are not human.
Doubt they have it in them lol
This doesn't answer your question, but just throwing it out there that our constitutional amendment outlawing slavery has specific exceptions in the case of "as punishment for a crime"
I'd like to see a counter protest by Satanists (who are actually atheists) and know the Bible better than most Christians
Bigots target young men for indoctrination
Why would they? Trump gave them all the ok to be their naturally vile selves
Chose a UC for this exact reason. Far left student body. No tolerance for even middleists.
No person is property. Any person thinking that should have their thoughts analyzed. Some deep issues going on there
It's because women have the ultimate power: creating life. If we stop making babies, the entire world crumbles very fast. (Food for thought, ladies.)

Intent matters, however. This is being used as a scare tactic and exaggeration, as these people want women to be pregnant as often as possible. They aren't concerned for a woman being at risk for cancer. Like anything, risk vs. benefits must be considered.

Hey hey now plenty of religious people of many beliefs fucking hate women.
They're in a cult, so... toast and eat your socks and we'll call it even.
It's Arizona, so yeah. But there's another big Abrahamic religion that has a similar sentiment towards women.
Christian or Muslim
We need to start pointing and laughing at them. Just hysterical laughter. No matter how mad they make you (Us) laugh at them, make them feel stupid and small. Point and say, "You actually believe that shit/crap/whatever" hahhahah!!
I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs what some of them do, but I think some of them actually believe what they‚Äôre saying and also have a team of lawyers backing them up too. It seems pretty dumb to bait someone into hitting you just to litigate. All it takes is an unfortunately-placed impact point on your head that can render you disabled or dead. I can believe they think it‚Äôs worth the gamble but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still pretty dumb.

Pretty sure they are part of a paid crew that does this. They target college campuses, which are often public property (you'll never see them at an Ivy League) so they can claim free speech. Then they rile folks up in hopes of encouraging assault, which the church that sponsored them will sue for and win a big settlement. Westboro Baptist famously did this at gravesites during veterans funerals.
They aren't, these people travel around from campus to campus and do this shit.
The Transformed Wife on twitter is a good example. Warning to anyone who looks her up: her views on sex and sa are horrible, regressive, and actually harmful.
> Unfortunately, a lot of ultra right-wing and radically religious women see themselves as property

My mom lives next door to these people. All of the kids are homeschooled and have no friends outside of their siblings. The wife recently told my mom she was a bad wife because she doesn‚Äôt always obey her husband. 

One of the ways she was disobedient? Not moving to an off-the-grid site in Tennessee.
Can confirm because I live in a highly conservative area
I would love it. Is this whole "women are property" thing the reason the dad gives the girl's hand in marriage to the husband during traditional weddings?
Because that‚Äôs what they want. They do this to rile someone up, hope they take the bait, then file for assault and get paid.
More often than not, the Police are on the side of these people.
Too bad the uni can't do much either since the areas they protest is considered public.
Because no one wants to get sued and/or go to jail. It's protected free speech, and because it's a public university, the school can't make them leave. There's no way for students to handle this without disrupting or even ending their college career.
Women are extremely unlikely to get lethally angry at words
They're pro birth, not life. after the kid is born, it and it's parents can go fuck themselves for all they care
Hold a sign that says, "Why are you here? Get back to the mines!"
I would‚Äôve been there with you
It's a red sign. Possibly intentionally to incite that much more anger. They *want* someone to get violent so they can sue for oppression of their 1A rights, and laugh at the person who went to jail.

The laws don't support us when it comes to giving them the physical response they deserve, but as far as I know, there's no law against defacing their signs. A streak of paint covering either the word "women" or the word "property" would render that sign useless. 

They'd have to take that to small claims court, and it's not worth their time to pay legal fees for a sign that cost them $10 in materials. lol
Yeah, use real blood.
real blood would catch you a much more severe criminal charge.

And children are treated even worse. Children, who's brains are still developing and need the most nurturing and positive attention, get the most abuse. Then they become screwed up adults who repeat the generational trauma.
Religion is pretty much a bad deal for women; theocracies def are (Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and so on & God forbid post-Election2024America).

Seems reasonable.  Even the nutty Topeka ‚Äúgot hates gays‚Äù don‚Äôt say ‚Äúwomen are property‚Äù out loud.
I was raised as a southern baptist evangelical christian. I was taught that non-whites weren't people, that women and children must ALWAYS be silent and obedient and that gays should be killed in the streets. Those beliefs were reinforced by cruelty and hypocrisy and violence.

For example:

When I was three years old I overheard my mom and my grandmother arguing about something (I didn't find out what they were arguing about until I was an adult). A few days after the argument I asked my grandmother about it. She responded by burning my hand on a coffee maker. "Spare the rod spoils the child" and "don't question god" were her favorite things to say.

BTW, the thing that they were arguing about? My grandmother gave Pat Robertson my Grandfather's life insurance policy ($100,000 in 1982).

I know for a fact that I wasn't the only one who was raised like that. My whole community grew up that way. The evidence for it, is the fact that the primary voting block for trump was evangelical christians.

You ask why they're like that, I show you the truth of religion. It's nothing but an excuse for cruelty and hypocrisy and violence.
Which is funny because universities have no problem breaking up legal protests they they don't like.
some things make people lose their shit and forget the law. this would be one of those things for me

Edit: I just realized I've been commenting in r/antinatalism. To anyone reading my history, I promise you I'm not subbed here.
There's a reason I didn't use the word "organized" if you'll notice. There are many people who hold religious beliefs which are not misogynistic, BUT, as I said elsewhere, I believe all religious belief is innately harmful.
I agree, it's probably a shit post. But if 3 people are laughing? It's hard to get mad.

She also defends the Duggers, esp Josh, who molested his own sisters and was found with child abuse material on hospital computer that was vile enough to gross out veteran law enforcement.
Christianity is bad for women, children, and usually anyone who's not white.
That's a good explanation and I'm sorry you had to live through that, sounds awful. But hey, at least you left that group and can live more freely, right?
I grew up in a town full of people like this and I am so grateful my grands were total opposite. I'm sorry you had to live with this in your home. It was traumatic to witness in the wild. I cannot fathom living it. I hope your life is full of nice people and love now.
Jesus Christ! I'm so sorry you had to deal with that kind of abuse as a child. And yes, that is 100% child abuse. What sort of monster burns a kid's hand on a hot coffeemaker?
Which is the reason this Christian stays away from religion and churches. Your last sentence of the next to last paragraph paragraph says it all.
And people wonder why I stay away from Christians to the point I will never be friends with them or date them. Even if a good friend becomes Christian, they stop being my friend. Why should I be around a group of 100% hatred and discrimination? It doesn't seem to be any positive to such a thing, so better to stay away.
that will give those men a pause.

Fucking right? Originally my comment did say religion- but not all religions discriminate against people of color. Almost all of them however definitely discriminate against women- and are unsafe for children
po tay toe
Hmm, there is a lot of truth in that. It's almost like bigotry of some form is built into them on a fundamental level. 

I have often encountered religious folk that say they are "inclusive" up until I ask them for their views on gay marriage, then the "hums and haa's" start. There is always something that they have to hate.
My rapist wants to see her child
When I was 14, my mother's friend got me drunk and had sex with me, and she got pregnant. At the time, I was just so embarrassed, and I didn't feel violated, I just wanted everyone to stop making a big deal out of it, I didn't even appreciate my son, and I was always annoyed when my parents would tell me to play with him. But the older I got, the more disgusted I was, and when I became anti-natalist, I hated her even more, my son is so wonderful and always makes me happy, but we're not rich, I'm not smart, and I have no formal education, not only that I feel horrible when I have to show him how the world works, I know he won't have an easy life and he won't be able to blame me because he loves me

Last month my aunt died and he asked me about death, I just explained to him and he started crying and telling me he doesn't want me or him to die, I wanted to cry, but I stopped being able to cry a long time ago, now his mother wants to see him, and I don't know what to do, I hate her so much but I also know she loves him 

Some people have told me I should report her, but I can't it's too late. Nothing good will come from that 

She technically still has parental rights, my parents made a deal with her, we don't report her, and she gives him to us, but lately she keeps calling my parents and telling them she wants to see him, even after they threatened her she still doesn't back off, and tells them she's changed 
Don't let that rapist anywhere NEAR your child! Idc if she birthed it, she raped a minor child. Who knows what she really wants.

I would file a restraining order to keep her away from you and your son.
Idk she raped you at 14 I don‚Äôt think she gets any say about whether she sees her child. I would actually be scared for the child especially since she‚Äôs obviously a predator but really take some time before making any choice. And make sure whatever that choice is does respect your boundaries.
Never let her see him. My mom failed to protect me from my rapist father. She can't be trusted.  Not everything deserves a 2nd chance
How did you end up having full custody?
[deleted]
Go to the police and report her.
As a survivor of a mother who exposed me to a predator willingly and knowingly, please keep her away from your child. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to be used as her emotional pawn and he WILL blame you if anything untoward happens
absolutely do not let her near your child. report her. or get a restraining order, anything you can.

im sorry youve had such a rough life. having no education is a serious shame. Read as much as you can. get tons of audiobooks if you struggle reading. read lots of historical fiction and make sure your kid reads a lot too. i think it matters more than formal education honestly
She is a pedophile! Please don‚Äôt let your child near her.
Child molesters can never be allowed around children, and you should report her IMO, there‚Äôs genetically testable living proof of her disgusting violent crime against you. If she wants to shoot herself in the foot by filing for custody, one paternity test and simple math and she‚Äôd be in prison. Call her bluff.
[deleted]
This is beyond fake.
low tier rage bait
Someone who'd rape a 14 year old should not in any way be near a child.
I would advise caution when commenting on this post because it's likely rage bait after giving OPs profile a second look. It's a new account created today and they only have one post for this sub and four comments. Could just be some troll creating a dramatic elaborate story.
im so fucking sorry you went through something so traumatic. and please no do not that p3d0 r@pist around your child, please tell the police tell somebody you trust PLEASE. not to be crude or to traumatize you again, but who‚Äôs to say she wont lay hands on your or your child. please remember, if she actually loved you and your child she wouldve never taken advantage of you.
Ya this didn‚Äôt happen
This story is so strange wtf, also I‚Äôm pretty sure it is still possible to have her ass arrested
I‚Äôm just curious how did a 14 year old male gain custody of this child? Like did she give it to you? Was DCFS involved?
I'm calling bs
If a sex predator moves into your neighborhood and you're alerted about it, and they come over and want to babysit your kid with a sob story about how "they've changed", do you trust them?

There's no difference in the situation to me.
"My rapist wants"

Fuck them, you owe them NOTHING. You will never owe them anything. 

What they did to you is unforgivable. 

Do what you feel is right for you and your family, and if that means ignoring her, do it.
DO NOT LET A RAPIST NEAR YOUR CHILD.

Also your parents fucking suck for not reporting.
Not only is she a pedophile and a rapist but meeting her would make you relive those awful memories. 

I wouldn't do this, not only for the obvious reasons, but also for your own mental well being.
idk how old you are but comments like

>we're not rich, I'm not smart, and I have no formal education

make me feel like you should probably take advantage of this person to aid in child care so you can get some education, certification, or something to get your feet more firmly under you to support yourself and your kid.
What country?
Wow I really did not need to see this today.  Holy fuck
She's a pedophile! Don't let pedophiles near your child. Do whatever it takes! Tell the whole town she's a pedophile if you have to! Protect him. Trust me the cycle always continues. You are strong and brave. Don't let her manipulate you or scare you. Don't let her win. Even if you don't have a case drag her through the system if you have to. Make her take you to court and tell the judge what she did. It's not about prosecuting her for that but that's a good way to show her character to the justice system and have fuel to protect you and your family. I'm so sorry that this monster is doing this to you.Toxic people like this always try to come back. Fight as long and hard as you can! If you have to use dirty tactics do it! Do whatever it takes.
This can't be real, how would they deal with the birth certificate?
Nursery enrolment? Pediatrics? Without legal guardianship?
Fake
I can‚Äôt believe your parents didn‚Äôt report her to the police when it happened!
child predators should never been around children
That woman is a rapist child predator and does not need to meet your kid and does need to be walking the streets she needs to be in prison
your parents made a deal to protect you and your child from her. in return, she is not reported. she is breaking her end of the deal, so you should honour the contract and report her to the police
Who is on the birth certificate?
You dont owe that pedophile a damn thing except a restraining order
OP, I think everyone else covered why you shouldn‚Äôt let a child rapist be near your kid, but I just wanted to say I‚Äôm sorry that this happened to you.

That‚Äôs absolutely horrible, and I‚Äôm sorry for any and all negative experiences that this has caused. I hope you regain the ability to cry, as crying can be freeing. I hope things start to look up for you.
i‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôre kind of pissing me off. i understand you‚Äôre a victim, HER victim, but wtf. she has not changed. she raped a child and god knows what she put the other kids she‚Äôs had through. rapists don‚Äôt change. and it‚Äôs not to late to report the sexual assault of a child, ever.
You were raped by a pedo at 14... Why didn't this get reported to the police? Why didn't your parents want a pedo Who raped their child in jail?

Something here doesn't seem right.
Rapists are fucking disgusting, idc if it‚Äôs a man or woman who perpetrates it, they deserve nothing and should get nothing but a lifetime of guilt and shame. Do not let her anywhere near your sweet child.
She raped you, there's nothing stopping her from doing it to your son. If you decide to agree, ensure it's supervised.
Advice: look up the statute of limitations in your state. 
When time's up, move. Egg donor isn't going to play nice when her only reason to is gone.
She's a rapist, rapist have and can rape their own children, do not allow this. I'm sorry this happened you and you son deserve better but life is hard so protect him with all your might.
Sweetie I'm so sorry that happened to you. I'm sorry that you were taken advantage of. I can understand why you had mixed feelings about your own kid.
I would say to not let her see him. If you feel comfortable, I would say to report her of you can. Depending on where you are, the statute of limitations might be longer.

If not, it might be time to go for full parental custody.
I would report her still, she is a danger to children!
She didn't have sex with you. She raped you
I hope you are in therapy because that shit is heavy and if I were rich I would would send you and your son away on a year long trip to get away from that for a while. also formal education is overrated. I'm sorry your parents made a deal and didn't protect you both more.
She is a pedophile. She will sexually abuse your son. They do not change. Never, ever leave her alone with your child. She will abuse him. He's probably aged into her preferred age of child to rape and that's why she's now bothering you.
You need to protect yourself and your child.  You should get a lawyer.  There are low cost and free lawyers avaliable, assuming you're in the US.  

Maybe you should report her, maybe she should pay child support, maybe that's to hard on you and your child for not enough results.  I don't know, but a lawyer would be able to give you really good advice
This is bullshit, and it stinks to high hell.¬†
Report her ass, she broke the agreement.
The statutes of limitations may or may not have run out (depends on the laws of your state), but if you take her to court for custody  explain the situation of your son's conception, ( her committing statutory rape)  and that you fear that she would try to sexually harm him as well. I would consult with a lawyer about what options you have ( most have free consult hours), you might only be able to get shared custody, with her having supervised visitations. (Don't let her be able to choose who does the supervision, such as one of her family members or a friend) hopefully things will be decided in your favor. If they are based on her current harassment for visitations, ask the judge for a restraining order to be placed against her so she can not contact you or your child moving forward. For safety purposes, I would also make his school(if school aged) that only those you have named have permission to pick up your child from school and that under no circumstances is she allowed to remove your son from school.
The dumbest post in quite a while.
Fake and gay
I would see a lawyer and ask for your legal options. Maybe the idea of being exposed as a rapist may cause her to think twice about forcing contact¬†
FYI - you mentioned you were 14. that is a child, by law. many states have gotten rid of their statutes of limitations for child rape, so it may not be too late at all. 

sending you hope and healing. wishing your son the best, and would reiterate that being around a pedophilic rapist is never going to be healthy for him.
Do not by any circumstance allow your parents or even yourself to let her see him. She raped a child and faced virtually zero consequences, what do you think will happen if she's near a kid?
i speak from personal experience when i say that your son is not safe w her

you need to report everything and get 100% custody
Yo OP ‚Äî take a step back and really consider the danger of this situation. 

When you were 14, your mother invited a sexual predator over, who abused you, a child, and even though she did something heinous and abusive, it sounds like this woman has continued to be in your family‚Äôs life, even *after* this happened. 

And now, you‚Äôre being pressured to invite a sexual predator over to spend time with your *child* because she claims to be a good person now. 

Do you really think your parents would have invited her over when you were 14 if she didn‚Äôt seem like a good person then? 

OP, she ain‚Äôt just interested in seeing him ‚Äî she is interested in spending ‚Äúquality time‚Äù with him. Protect you kid, OP. 

And if she continues to threaten you about ‚Äúparental rights,‚Äù get the situation detailed *in writing* with her acknowledging what happened. I don‚Äôt know where you live, but 14 is statutory rape everywhere (in the US). [Here](https://www.rainn.org/state-state-guide-statutes-limitations) is a state-by-state guide about the statute of limitations regarding statutory rape. 

Your parents and the rapist don‚Äôt get to make the decision to report or not report the crime now that you‚Äôre an adult. Good luck, bud ‚Äî sending good vibes from Amsterdam
What in the plothole filled fuck is this post?? I'm not going to say you weren't raped, the rest of the story however after that point makes no sense at all. At *all*. And the fact that you don't want to do the one thing that would protect your son from her, the less believable a majority of the post gets. Your family deciding to make a super weird and not legally binding deal with the woman that raped you instead of (1) turning her in (2) making her give up parental rights is sus af. You were a child so your actions at that time arent exactly a problem. Rape is traumatizing. You do make your parents sound like they don't have two braincells to run together between the two of them tho.
Threaten to report her. That's a pedophile and you're right not to want her near your kid.
Rapist don‚Äôt deserve rights, I hope you remain safe as does your child. I‚Äôm sorry you went through this.
This is a pretty tough and bad situation, but I‚Äôd say never let her see the child as it‚Äôs very risky and she should be happy enough that you haven‚Äôt reported her. And if she knows you won‚Äôt report her then she probably won‚Äôt ever back off
Dont
Let
Her
Near
Him
Period
What in the hee-haw hillbilly fuck did I just read?
So she told you she'd 'give' you your son as long as you didn't tell anyone? But yet if you told people, CPS, police, anyone, then she would not be ALLOWED near your child. 

She's a child rapist. A pedophile. One who's evidence of offense is alive and breathing whom she calls 'son'. 

If you tell someone, anyone, that this woman r*ped you as a child, then she will not be allowed near your child. She should not be allowed near children. How dare she demand to see your child now, and how dare she try to blackmail you into silence. 

I'm so sorry that you've been made to stay silent, your parents should have went straight to police when it happened and then went to court for the custody of your baby. They should never have agreed to silence. There was never any need, bc the mother is a predator and if that is ever brought up anywhere, she won't be allowed near the child. 

Predators blow my mind with their audacity. How could she even think for one second that she has a single leg to stand on here? Making demands? When she is the one who can easily be proven to be a pedophile and a rapist. 

Sorry for my vent, your post made me feel angry and frustrated for you. I'm mad at the way society handles things, and leaves victims/survivors to suffer and end up in complex situations still having to deal with their abuser. It makes me sick. Please if you can, tell someone. If she denies it, it's quite easy to clarify with a blood test. Then match up some dates. It will be clear that you were a child when she got pregnant. She has no real power here, only the implied power she has over you as a victim.
Wtf did I just read
>...my parents made a deal with her, we don't report her, and she gives him to us, but lately she keeps calling my parents and telling them she wants to see him, even after they threatened her she still doesn't back off...


I don't know how old you are now but it sounds like you still live with your parents so presumably you are still fairly young. I strongly recommend that you report the original assault to the police. The original assault is the crime and the fact that you didn't report it when you were 14 is totally understandable.
Under ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU ALLOW THAT WOMAN ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR CHILD!¬† At all EVER!
This has to be fake. Too many inconsistencies in the story, plus the whole ‚Äúnothing good comes from reporting her bc she has kids/grandkids‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make any sense bc she could just as easily abuse them, if she isn‚Äôt already. I don‚Äôt understand why people make up horrible stories like this. It‚Äôs far too real for a lot of people and to lie about it is, frankly, aborrhent. I guess you got the attention you wanted though.
OP. She will rape him if you give her that chance.
I highly doubt a person who raped a 14 year old wants to see their child because they love the child...
Please report her If you can. It will protect the other boys that may become her victim. 

Who knows how many lives she ruined.
Tell her to go to the cops. Then ask how she'll explain why you and your son are only 14 years apart.
Its weird why didnt you guys report her ? What was the reasoning and justification of it ? Had i been told my male friend raped my 14 year old daughter, he'd be gone.
She raped a child, she's going to rape him, too. These fucking subhumans never change and the only way to cure her is with a 12 gauge to the back of the head.
This is so obviously bait, man what sort of fucking weirdos are on this sub
Start from the worst scenario: She wants to replace you  by him

Including what she did when you were 14
Oh fuck all that 

She should be reported. She should suffer, she should never see your child

Fellow survivor and the only good rapist is a dead one.

The fact that your parents made a deal with her is fucking nauseating, she should be rotting for the rest of her life in a Cell at the very least.
This doesn't belong in this sub.
obvious bait post
You should keep the child and still report her. Shes a pedophile that disgusting freak should be behind bars
Report her. It‚Äôs not too late. And about death‚Ä¶reincarnation is real and puts a nice spin on death.
Why arent you getting child support?

Its not to late to make a report, women do it all the time to men even decades later
Few times where this sub is completely correct don't let her see him
Humans are complex. It doesn't help when they make horrible decisions. Conservative religious types try to paint children that are the result of rape as the silver lining. No one here can tell you how to handle this. I will say given your conflicting feelings.....if you think you can emotionally get away with it.... See if you can have some lemonade out of this situation. You don't have to forget. You don't have to forgive. You don't have to let her have any more access than the courts allow.. but just because you don't have to, doesn't mean you can't. That's up to you.
How much older is she? I feel like we are all assuming her age but there‚Äôs nothing to stop your mom from casually befriending the 16 y/o neighbor next door. We need context.
What does your child want? That's what matters.

Cry with your child the next time he cries. Don't show him to bottle up his emotions like you learned to.

As long as there are no legal outlets for adults to exchange sex, children like you and I will continue to be preyed upon. This may help you forgive this person enough to work with them for the sake of your son.
Yo my dad violated me and I'm telling you right now if I hadn't miscarried I would have NEVER allowed him around my would be child. A predator is a predator, she doesn't love your son she sees him as a new supply. I would bet my entire salary that she's wanting to groom him for when he's a little older so she can hurt him too. Do you want to be responsible for giving her that chance? We all know what the universal consensus would be if your rapist had been a man, the verdict needs to be the same as if she were a man. She's a pedophile. I wouldn't even be surprised if she was violating her own kids. For the love of your son and the other spawn REPORT HER.

The only thing she needs to see is down the barrel of a rifle tbh.
An antinatalist with a child ... Now I've seen everything
I call B.S.  Someone with no formal education could not write this essay. Something is fishy.
Was she hot??
[deleted]
I'm going to offer you a different perspective, I'll get downvoted but people are ignorant. You were a child sure. But the fact is that no matter how you feel now, you and your family kept that child and his physical and emotional well-being is your responsibility; furthermore, there will come a day when that child will come to resent you for disallowing him the opportunity to know his mom based on how you feel. 

Also, what do you actually *know* about death? There are ways to explain it to child that aren't from a place of anger and bitterness, and won't terrify them. Holding on to anger and hate is like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to die. What's more, you are setting the example for your son. Do you really want him growing up and thinking that the correct response to being hurt is revenge? Look around at the world and tell me in all honesty that that approach doesn't cause it to burn. 

It is also apparent that your parents seem to hold you responsible, unless they are raising your son like he's theirs. I'm not saying that is right or wrong, unless they are putting the financial burden on you. That would be wrong, especially if they insisted on custody. 

If I seem harsh I apologize, but there is a reason for it. It is now 100% about your child's emotional well-being. Your feelings on the subject no longer relevant and should be kept out of his sight. My advice to you is to take the love that you have for your son and understand the lesson it can teach you. Use it to practice forgiveness and let those feelings go for your son's sake. 

You don't need to make a happy family with her, or even associate. But as Mahatma Ghandi once said "An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind."
Supervised visitation
She's changed
I'll probably get down voted into oblivion for asking this and I mean no disrespect whatsoever but I just gotta ask - how did this actually happen? Like, physically? Wouldn't you have needed to be turned on for her to do this?
Was she atleast hot?
Parent or not, it's probably not the best idea to let your child be around a child rapist. It doesn't matter how she feels or what she says, she showed you who she is. Trust your gut on this man.

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK????
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too late to report, the facts of the matter are rock solid, not much debate to be had, you impregnated her when you were 14 and there is human proof of that. Open and shut case for sure.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do‚Äù get legal advice if you‚Äôre able to and record any communication she has with you.
That woman should be in jail, nothing good can come of her having parental rights. Please get a restraining order , her other children could also be in danger.
I am so, sorry this has happen to you. Please try and get an education. 
Read to your child, love your child and protect them. Don‚Äôt let that predator near that child. It was not your fault get some counselling. I am routing for you and your child. A internet stranger is wishing you and your child well in life.  

What do you want out of life? Make a plan, I am not sure about your parents. Save money to get out of this situation, get some perspective you only know what they told you. Can you get hold of the child‚Äôs birth certificate? Please get some independent legal advice about your situation. I‚Äôm really wishing you well in the future.
1. I can see the family blackmailing the women to get the kid.

2. Why are we acting like the law treats F to M grape the same as M to F grape. Alot of dudes get laughed out the police station or would look to blame him
Mother's friend, so we're talking someone that's between the ages of 30-40 but less than 50 obviously unless she has early onset menopause. Yeah it seems like child protective services did you a disservice with this whole situation. They would of likely locked the mother and father up for even allowing this to happen and being so nonchalantly about it. But the state would of took ownership over you and that's not always a good thing but that's a pretty bad situation to be in. Most mom friend types tend to be in those age ranges.
You have evidence of the rape by having your son. His age and his matching DNA is everything you need to prove she raped you, and is therefore unfit to be a parent. 

You can gain control of this situation. I‚Äôm not sure what state you live in, but you should look into some state funded family lawyers. If you talk to them about what‚Äôs going on, they could take you on pro-bono or point you in the right direction to get that kind of thing. 

She committed a crime, if you don‚Äôt want her to be around your son, you can definitely try to make sure she can never see him unless it‚Äôs his choice as an adult.
> can't it's too late. Nothing good will come from that
She technically still has parental rights, my parents made a deal with her, we don't report her, and she gives him to us,

It is not too late to report her. She committed statutory rape. None of this is legal. She is a predator and may do this to someone else, or even your son one day, please report her. Your parents are trying to intimidate you away from justice because they also failed you. There are support and services out there to help you and your son, please report this woman.
Not a great idea to let a child rapist be near a child.
So sad
The statute of limitations on raping a minor are very long. You could easily still prosecute her. Force her to give up her parental rights or tell her to enjoy going to prison and being a sex offender the rest of her life.

Even if by done change the statute of limitations are passed, threaten to blast her as a pedo online unless she gives up her rights. You should not let her near you or your child. And considering how young you are, this decision should be left up to your parents since they're essentially raising the kid.
Absolutely not. Get your parents involved. Talk to a counselor, but don't just give her what she wants.
Such sadness.

Tell her you prefer the child not associate with rapists, even rapists who believe they've changed.
There is no winning on this one.
Wow what an evil selfish thing for that woman to do. She forced you to become a dad at such a young age. You had no choice in the matter. This is truly evil she shouldn‚Äôt be aloud in your life. I‚Äôm so sorry that someone‚Äôs selfish disgusting decision lead to you having very little control over your own life.
Indroducing your child to a peadofile just to make sure he doesn't resent you later is kind of prioritising your feeling over his safety.. Please think carefully about it, even in the best case scenario this will be a toxic person to have around
this is so sad man omg
Report it and you have actual evidence. The child is the evidence!!!!

As a matter of fact what the hell with your mom!!!

Not saying it didn‚Äôt happen. Did you get a DNA test???
Just out of curiosity how old is your son? And by curiosity I mean most pedophiles have a preferred age range and I‚Äôm wondering if this sudden interest in wanting to see your son has anything to do with it. I‚Äôm actually pretty sure there‚Äôs a different term for someone attracted to 14 year olds I believe pedophile refers to someone attracted to children before puberty but we all know what I mean. It‚Äôs not like she was 18 and had sex with a 17 year old that was days away from turning 18. She was a grown ass adult that was sexually attracted and raped a 14 year old boy.
I‚Äôm so sorry. Someone who could go through with something like that is not someone who down the road is ‚Äúchanged.‚Äù I want you to go with your gut on this and don‚Äôt back down. You do what you feel is best for you and the child. Don‚Äôt worry about what your son may want or not want in the future; think about what he needs right now, and what you need, as your wellness carries onto his. 

The fact that she made the deal is also evidence against her. 

What you must do may be scary, and you may have to do something that substantially affects the lives of her children. But they are not your responsibility. You and your son is all you are to be concerned about. Her kids are her responsibility and SHE let them down, never you. You must listen to yourself and do whatever you need to to protect your little family, him and YOU. You matter.
I'm so sorry. This is so fucked up. Don't put yourself down. You're in a situation no one should ever have to be in. I really wish your parents would have gone to the police. I don't understand that. She's disgusting and needs to be held accountable.
Little quip about how the world works - it doesn't.
This situation sounds horrible and idk how to tell you to deal with It but if it was my decision I would question if shes should be around children  since she was obviously an adult when you were a kid and took advantage of you but at the same time how does your son feel im sure he doesn't know the situation and may not be old enough to understand what you feel towards her or why  but one day he will priority is keeping him safe but i wouldn't keep him away out of hatred or it could teach your son to do the same this is a complicated decision
No. She is a violent felon who victimized you and cannot be trusted with minor children. 

There‚Äôs nothing to feel bad about. No excuses need to be made. She is a rapist. The answer is no.
I am sorry for what happened. But you are smart. Remember that.
According to the courts, she would still have parental rights unless she signed them away to you. If she goes to court she could get visitation. Lawyer up.
She is a rapist. 
She raped you. 
You have a son. 

Keep that crazy rapist away from your kid. She is in no way shape or form a mother if she did that to you.
Yeah here's the thing, it's not even close to too late to file against her. 1. If you have any form of writing on the agreement she incriminated herself and a DNA test of your child will link you to them, from there they just have to determine you were 14 at the time and it will not be hard
I think you and your son should speak with a therapist on this. Like you said, she eventually will meet him. And children crave knowing their bio parents. Is your mom like a mother to him? Does your son ask to meet her?
here is a tip, dont let the predator with a history of paedophilia, anywhere near your kid.....
I understand
If a woman goes to a party and gets drunk and someone takes advantage of her the case is mostly thrown out and usually the court rules against it. But your young age might have made a difference. But you said yourself that it will just be more damage. So I would suggest to let her see her son/ daughter supervised. But you probably shouldn‚Äôt let her see him/ her alone
If anyone does the math for about two seconds, it's pretty obvious.
Sounds like she has an unhealthy interest in the kid. Restraining order.

Also depending on the age, maybe its about time the kid knows his mother is a pedophile. Children do need to be warned.
You‚Äôre not defined by the worst things to happen to you, hopefully you‚Äôre able to find the joys and happiness life has to offer.
Hi...this showed up in suggested posts but I'm really not a natural for this community.


You guys absolutely need to seek legal advice on this if you have not already done so and know all the details of the significance of various upcoming dates. If she seeks access or custody what the process is likely to be will change as your son ages. There's likely a date at which getting her prosecuted for rape becomes difficult or impossible. There is in some countries a point at which your son¬† gets his own representative. There's a point at which the courts can no longer force him to go to an access visit. And then¬† course there is adulthood and the end of the courts having the ability to order access and custody.


You can't deal strategically with this¬† without that knowledge.
You should really apply for child support if he is in your care all the time and I can't believe the police didn't do an investigation since it sounds like she put you down as the father, usually hospitals have to report this type of thing to the police. I believe some states the age of consent is 15 but it sounds like no one said it was against your will. Have you gone to therapy to try to understand your emotions and what happened to you and how to explain this situation to your son? You could also start family therapy with your son to help him and teach him how to cope with death and his story.
By bringing this person into your child's life, you risk her abusing him like she did you. If you don't have full legal custody I would get it. I'm so sorry man, but at least your kid will have you in his life.
I don't understand what is wrong with people
Hi. I'm really sorry you went through that. Can't the DNA and age of your son be used to lock her up? There cant be a statute of limitations on that
This is awful, why did she choose to have the baby? Should have gone for abortion üòï, now a life exists on this earth which was never meant to be born.
I hope u do the best for ur son, ur a good father.
A lot of people in the comments keep suggesting reporting her actions. From what OP says, that won‚Äôt legally happen as it‚Äôs been too long. There are statute of limitations on rape cases. But, since she‚Äôs not officially signed any documents giving away her parental rights, she could go to court and demand she either gets visitation rights or some custody of her son. If the statute of limitations have run out, I‚Äôm not sure if the circumstances as to how the baby was conceived were brought up would be allowed to be submitted in evidence towards OP keeping his son. 

Too bad she wasn‚Äôt reported back when it happened and could be prosecuted. Chances are her parental rights would‚Äôve been terminated at birth. Whatever the outcome was with custody, she would now be on the sex offender registry for her sexual assault on a minor. Which would help limit her access to working with children.  If you and your parents want continued custody of your son, you should look into how to go about it legally. 

And there‚Äôs no real guarantee that she‚Äôs changed. Maybe she has and regrets not being a part of her so be life or maybe now that he‚Äôs getting older she‚Äôs hoping to gain access to groom him for future pleasures on her part before he gets ‚Äútoo old‚Äù for her.
Whatever you decide to do get your child counseling so he understands where he comes from. That could be a hard blow to find out from someone else. See what his reaction is from that before you make your decision.
Depending on the country you live in, it might not be too late to report her for what she did to you. Most countries and states have no statute of limitations on sexual assault and rape against a minor (meaning that you can report her at any time and the police will have to investigate) and you have evidence of her crime living in your house. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you and you are obligated to protect your child, but you are not obligated to protect the feelings of that monster.
Don't let her see him, and threaten to report her if she keeps asking.
Ho. Ly. Shit.

First off, you are right to hate her.

What about your son? Does he want to see her? I would let him decide this. 

Sounds like he is still rather young, you gotta plan to explain everything to him one day?

Best of luck to your family!
WTF. Call the police immediately.

Through your trauma, you‚Äôve normalised this whole situation. But it‚Äôs far from normal. You need to contact the police and tell them everything.¬†
Shouldn't have made that deal. Should've reported. But you can still report it
Is she at least paying freaking child support?
The kid is gonna be tied to you for another 18 years, and you can already see the strong attachments it has to you and his mom. It‚Äôs going to be a tricky thing to take away his mom. So I suppose the bigger question is the kid better off in their psychological/physical development if mom is in the picture or not. I know I wished my parents were together when I was growing up. Best of luck man.
Whether it was a long time ago or now, the important thing is that she did it. What's to stop her from doing it to someone else again? Or worse, to your child!

Your parents are not spared either. How dare they tell you not to make a big deal out of what happened? Any parent in their right mind would report what happened to protect their child and grandchild.

You are strong, but what happened is still something you will carry for the rest of your life; give your pain the importance it deserves. Report her, get to work and get out of that house to ensure you and your own child a decent future.
Damn this is fucked up
That‚Äôs so sad. Such sick and twisted people in this world.
Hey I‚Äôm really sorry üò≠
Imagine your kid is 14.  Then make a decision.
It's never too late.
She's a pedo, don't let your son near her
Im not a lawyer and I don‚Äôt know what state you live in but you should check out the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act (RSCCA). It‚Äôs a bill they passed where it allows the mother ( yeah it‚Äôs weird it‚Äôs only for women but it‚Äôs a barely new bill that was passed so you might be the first father to use it) of any child that was conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her rapist with regard to that child, which the court shall grant upon clear and convincing evidence of rape. So there‚Äôs a possibility that she might not be able to take your kid away from you. But only 32 states are using this bill. Politics and legislation is a bitch
Based on what I'm reading in your post it may do you personally a lot of good for your own happiness sake to try to let go of some of the rage and anger you feel towards her and the situation. Definitely not saying what she did is in any way right or acceptable but what I have found in my own life is holding onto anger about the past makes my present suck just a little more.. realizing we all die makes me even more motivated to try to cherish the present and try to be happy while doing it. Keep your head up, good luck man, sorry that that happened to you :(
She's breaking her end of the "deal". Your folks and you need to report her.
You and your parents need to speak with a Family Law attorney.  They can advise you on involving police and reporting the rape, on forbiddance orders against your rapist, and all other rights everyone involved holds as the situation currently stands (and how to get any of it changed so you are all safe).

You also need Family Counseling to get qualified emotional & mental support tools as you work through all of the issues..

Just those two things:  an attorney and a counselor.
This sounds like rage bait. The hospital would have to report a rape because you were a dad as a minor and she was an adult. Seems like you signed the birth certificate so she would have been reported by somebody.
I'm so sorry you had to/are having to deal with that, don't let her anywhere near him though... Unfortunately I'm dealing with something similar but with a failed justice system, ex raped me while I was in the hospital in a coma and after when I was on heavy narcotics In the hospital... Then got pregnant and have post partum and had a psychosis threatening to kill both of us... Courts gave her full custody even with all that and more against her, society is fuccing disgusting and fucc people who defend douchebags like that
Report her ASAP!! & stop relying on your parents to put your best interests first. They have repeatedly shown they don‚Äôt care. Put yourself first! Do what is right!
Unless you live in some backwards country without child protection laws, there's no way this story could be real.
Bro, report her she'll rape your son like she Did you people like that Don't change. The only way to keep them away is to get them legally removed and then enforce it. She will not have her parental rights in court if it is brought to light that the Was born from you being molested as a minor wile drunk.
There is very undeniable, living evidence of what she did to you and though I don't trust the law in cases like these, any good person would see that she's dangerous, especially and obviously to a little boy.  

You didn't ask for this kid but you took the responsibility that was forced on you and with no help from anywhere for what you survived, you became a wonderful father to your son, it says a lot that he feels loved by you.  

You're a good person who didn't deserve everything that happened to you, including what people put you through after.  

You're a good dad and you should trust your gut.  

I would go to prison for killing my own father before I let that pedophile go near even my fucking cats, much less my child, trust your gut.  

Edit: if she had really changed she would leave you alone because she would know she doesn't deserve to see either of you.
Fake story.
I would do everything in anything to keep her away from that child. she did you she would do that child  I had the similar situation done to me  For you it was one girl from me it was two lesbians  If anyone's bisexual or gay I apologize pedophiles hide behind the rainbow flag
please don't expose your child to a known predator, bro üòü sometimes it's difficult in ways you aren't necessarily prepared for to protect your kids.. this will certainly be difficult for you but you know in your heart it's right. your son will understand with time and more than likely thank you when he's gained some perspective. this predator is a lot harder and less glorious to protect him from than the creepy old neighbor who's listed on the sex-offender registry... while i'm mentioning the registry, reporting her could (and should) cause her name to be added, perhaps preventing her next victim from being so successfully preyed upon. so consider the fact that while it may not help you or your kid to report her now, it's still not too late for the Innocence which she has yet to consume. but hey, do you my friend... your wound, your call. anyway, back to what i was saying, in the short term, you may have to come to terms with him thinking he hates you for keeping him from his mother, some members of society may judge you before (and some delusional folks, still after) you explain the details. speaking of which, you certainly don't owe any non-involved-with-raising-him parties any explanation if you don't wish to share it; but it would certainly help to sway a large portion of the aforementioned opinion-havers to your side, if you feel comforted or aided by that at all. lastly, don't ever believe the snake that tries to tell you it is no longer venomous. if she was so changed, why is the cencept of "no" or "off-limits" still not registering with her like it should? seems like she's getting even worse honestly...
Report her now.
How old are u op now
Please protect your child. She doesn‚Äôt have any business being around children ever. I‚Äôm sorry you went through that.
Tell her "not while he's a minor, obviously" if he wants to meet her when he's 18 and she's still here, cool, otherwise tell her to stay away from your child as she obviously can't be trusted with them
God bless you. You‚Äôre right nothing will come good out of reporting her but should it. It‚Äôs reporting rape if you were a female it would be on full blast. You don‚Äôt have to feel embarrassed or ashamed about anything. She‚Äôs a predator you are a victim and she should pay. You were an innocent child what would you do if that happened to your son? Your mother ought to be ashamed of herself for making ‚Äúa deal‚Äù with a god damned predator, that hurt you! The police would have been picking her up right off the concrete if it were my child. Press charges on her. You will feel a lot better later trust me and you will also feel a lot better when you have to explain it all to your precious son some day. I‚Äôm so sorry this has happened to you. Be strong and do the right thing.
You'd think her priority would be to make amends with op  instead. But she overlooks him and pleas to the parents instead and makes no attemp at aknowledging him.
I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you
You seem so cold when talking about your child maybe neither one of you should have them.
User is deleted. This is probably fake
She‚Äôs a rapist, hell with her. That‚Äôs you kid not hers, not anymore, for what she done.
Depending on where u live it may not be. Some states have changed the time to report. You have proof via ur sons dna it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to look into it. Plus ur age gap. At the very least u could get it so she‚Äôd have to see him supervised because the very real thing is‚Ä¶ she is a pedo. U have a son‚Ä¶ u need to worry about
Don‚Äôt do that to yourself, and if you don‚Äôt care enough about you, DONT FUCKING DO THAT TO YOUR KID
You'd think the hospital would have done something when he signed the birth certificate as the dad.  In fact I'm pretty sure they should be thrown in jail for not doing something.
I would turn her in anyway, honestly. Fuck that ‚Äúdeal‚Äù, I doubt it was signed and notarized.
T H I S
She obviously wants to rape her own child.
At the risk of getting downvotes, I'm going to respectfully disagree.   
My two cent: I personally wants her to pay for her crime. Remind her of the original deal: if she goes near your son, you report her. She pays for her crime, and you keep your end of the deal. WIN WIN!  


EXTREMELY Minor reason: it's naturally for a mother to connect with her children, but I'm not trying to sympathize with her or anything. lol. I personally wouldn't want her to see her child either, but in this case she gets the punishment that she deserves.
Sorry wrong person I meant to text op
‚ÄúHim‚Äù. The child is a human being.

"it"
I think maybe she changed, I just don't want him to blame me,  he'll be able to meet her when he's older and I won't be able to stop him, so I thought maybe I should do it sooner so that he won't hate me later, also she has a kids and a grandchild so I know she doesn't want to go to prison so she'll do what I want
But if he hadn't hurt you, would you still want a relationship with him?
My parents got him from her
I guess her committing statutory rape of a 14 year old would be enough to lose custody of her child.
This is the question that brings the house of cards down. Unless she went to jail he wouldn‚Äôt have custody, unless he has been in contact with her already. If he‚Äôs been in contact why hasn‚Äôt he reported?
But she is neither because of this sus "agreement."  She is the mom and has 100% custody.  Them taking the baby is called kidnapping.
It's too late, she also has other kids, nothing good will come from this
üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
A male feminist trying to see if people will have double standards when the genders of the scenario are switched. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Absolutely agree.
It could be a throwaway account, due to the highly sensitive nature of the topic. But more importantly, what does it have to do with antinatalism except OP claiming they became one? It‚Äôs more suited for relationship_advice.
>I would advise caution when commenting on this post because it's likely rage bait after giving OPs profile a second look. It's a new account created today and they only have one post for this sub and four comments. Could just be some troll creating a dramatic elaborate story.

Yea when a boy is raped its fake news, when a girl is raped its real and if you have doubts your misogynistic

Toxic feminist logic

People make throwaways due to privacy
yeah this is setting off the bs bells
His parents got custody - OP said his parents made a deal with her: give them the baby and they won‚Äôt report her for r@pe, etc.
You‚Äôd be surprised how much shit flies under the radar. This isn‚Äôt far out of reality at all
Absolute dogshit, completely fake
If this weren't fake, the hospital would be reporting to the police based on the father's birthdate.  If he's not on the cert, he has no custodial rights and is kidnapping the baby.
Relax, the OP is just some lonely old pervert making up stories.  He's not the father of a child.
[deleted]
Calm down, this story is just some creeper's fantasy.
I don't want to see her or start drama because she has other kids
Christ, shut the fuck up.

Literally no one thinks that.

If anything it's the "red-pill" men who come out of the woodwork going, "Where were teachers like *this*, when I was in school?" Whenever a case of an older women banging a teen boy goes viral. Women are typically outraged about it.

And all that is assuming this post isn't just fictional rage-bait.
Wtf? Are you saying men can‚Äôt get raped?!?!
It‚Äôs rape. The UK (my home country) doesn‚Äôt recognise it as rape but it is.
You don‚Äôt put your child in the arms of a rapist. The biological mother of the child is a rapist and a predator. Your perspective is quite evil.
You‚Äôre actually insane. The child is endangered if they meet with someone who had kids but was still willing to rape another child. Especially as pedophiles are often not above taking advantage of the most vulnerable around them, such as their own blood. Ffs OP got assaulted because of the trust his mother had with her. Fuck you and your stupid forgiveness BS
He was a 14 year old given liquor. The wind could have blown and he would have been ready physically. Penises have a mind of their own, you can't really control arousal. It happens even when you don't want it to.
It's not his son if he's not the father on the birth certificate.  If he is on the birth certificate, his birthdate (which is also on the birth certificate) would cause mandatory reporting.  This pervert is just playing you.
No kidding. Aren't healthcare providers mandatory reporters in these situations?
No judge is going to throw the entire employee roster of a hospital into jail for not acting on information about which they weren't told.
I mean she's not even trying to honor the deal anymore. Seems like reporting is not only the right thing to do, it's also "fair game" going by their deal
Even if it was a contract that was signed, child custody is always modifiable by a court because "the best interest of the child" is the primary concern not "what was promised." Also, that contract would be void as a matter of public policy.
Every state has a statue of limitations if it's  been longer than 5 years of the last event .. there could be a exception to the statue if a kid was brought Into the world by rape. I'm unsure about that though
T H A T
I fucking hope not, but I would definitely be worried about ulterior morives.
as dark and twisted as it is she probably does want to do that to him now that he's gotten older. depending on the OP's age now, his son may be around the same age he was when she SAed him, so now she probably wants to relive it again through his son. i REALLY hope this post is not real and that this is just some kind of idiotic attempt at ragebait because this is insanely disturbing
Not necessarily.¬† Predators usually are into using kids to control their victims.¬†
In terms of sexuallt abusing them, many can and do have children without seeing them 'that way' (not that this means they should be left with said children).
seriously dude? seek therapy
[deleted]
She gave up her rights when she got a minor drunk and raped him.  Good people do not do that.  She is a horrible specimen of a human and doesn‚Äôt deserve her son.
First step of her paying for her crime is to never have contact with the child unless the child wants it, and then if OP agrees, never unsupervised.
This 100% percent. Plus being reported and be held legally accountable for her actions gives a better likelyhood of her not committing the crime again which is what you would want if she is gonna be around the child.
If this was your take away from this story you are a moron.
He's still his child and he's his parent? Tf
"It" is correct and can also be used. Yes even when speaking about a human child.
it's a baby.
I was trying to be respectful of a person (regardless of age) being able to discover for themselves who they are and what they identify as. The child was born male, but could not end up identifying as male.
Yeah that's a... that's a thing that happens bud.
Shut up.
Yes I am, to both. As a survivor of rape myself, I wouldn't belittle or disbelieve a person who says it happened to them because of their gender. Anyone can be raped.
pedophiles do not change.
Your job is to keep that child safe, even if he hates you for it. Do not let a known rapist anywhere near him.
He may resent you for a time (as i think all kids do for one reason or another), but if you explain the situation to him when he's fully able to understand then he'll eventually get over it. For now, just focus on raising him to be a kind and compassionate person.
Has she ever apologized and shown true regret for taking away your youth and autonomy and psychologically damaging you, for RAPING you? You‚Äôre probably not her only victim. I doubt she truly understands how horrible and criminal her actions were and she obviously has no remorse from the way she‚Äôs making demands to her rape victim. She belongs in PRISON. End of story. 

Your son can make his own decisions when he is an adult on how to process this and whether or not to connect with his birth mom. You need to protect him right now and provide guidance on these things.
Scientists have been trying to figure out for a century how to cure sexual predators and still have nothing to show for it besides chemical castration. I doubt this woman figured out how to do what they couldn't. She's the same wolf in a more convincing sheep costume.
Just because she has children and grandchild doesn't mean she won't offend again. Just because she says she has changed doesn't mean she has. Has she seeked treatment or gone to therapy for what she's done? If not, tread lightly as she just might not had the opportunity to offend again yet.
As others have said pedophiles don't really change... they might change their actions but still find young children attractive. IF you DO decide to allow this person access to their child, it should be under VERY strict supervision. You can't trust them around kids. They could also potentially use your child as a way to access other children... so I would be very wary, considering she's already gotten away with her actions once(or more) and is not by law a convicted sex offender.
She did a horrible thing.  She might let her friends do a horrible thing to him.  She is not a safe person.  Your child will eventually understand.  For now, go to therapy to process this.  Rape has lasting damages, and you need help.  Your parents didn't support you the way you needed, and maybe they didn't know how.  But please get help to understand she is dangerous.  She is not that child's mother, she is his fathers rapist and a pedophile.
You need the help of a therapist to help explain to him at an appropriate age and way why she isn't a safe person for him to be around as a child.  The decision will be up to him as an adult, but right now you need to make sure he is safe as his parent.  

Enabling is what happens when people prioritize their family relationships over protecting from abusers.  If she rapes him, he could blame you for that and rightly so.  If he blames you for not having a relationship with her, it is sad.  It is still better to protect him.  That's a parent's job.  Doing their best for their kid even if it makes the kid unhappy.
She is a child molester.  They don‚Äôt change. 

You were a child (yes at 14, you were a child), she raped you.  If you love your son, you will keep her away from him.  People like that don‚Äôt change, they never change.  Regardless, do you really want to risk your sons well-being finding out?
She hurt *you*. She hurts children. Do **not** let her near your child.
This is almost my life story except genders flipped. I believe once a rapist, always a rapist. My biological father was an emotional terrorist. He attempted to groom my childhood friends, but their parents got wise and I lost friends without understanding why. Even if he had been a decent person to me, he still raped a 13 year old girl before I was born. He wasn't sorry either... when I was in my early teens and found out about his past, he tried to justify it. The fact that this woman is bothering you at all shows she isn't sorry. She should rot in hell.
That's immaterial. He DID hurt her. Full stop.

The bio mother of your child makes TERRIBLE and CRIMINAL choices. Great for her if she's changed, you do NOT want to take that risk, a risk that you know could very potentially have HORRIBLE consequences and for a helpless child.
If this happened to me and I actually kept it , my rapist would 1 be in prison 2 wouldn't even know the kids name, and if they showed up at my house it would be a bullet to the face.
She rapes children and you want to let her near yours?
She has shown through her actions that she is capable of raping a child. Once someone crosses that line I'm personally not really inclined to believe that they are going to draw the line at family, especially since the majority of sexual violence is committed by family/friends.

Child predators thrive in situations where it is incredibly easy to build a lot of trust with a potential victim, I can't think of a single type of relationship that a predator would more easily be able to take advantage of then that of a parent and child.

I'm incredibly sorry for what she did to you, I know first hand how hard it is to even just live your day to day life after being raped, I can only imagine how much more effort it would take while also raising a kid.
I hope you and your son create many fun memories together and have a good life, you seem like a really caring parent.
No, am an example of this, no desire to be involved with a rapist. 

It‚Äôs your decision as his parent. It‚Äôs a safeguarding issue as she is a predator, and it‚Äôs probably traumatic for you to have to consider it which means it‚Äôs already an unfair burden on your family (you and son, maybe also your parents). 

Ultimately you need to make the decision, but there are plenty of us who hate/cut all ties with a birth parent for what they did to another birth parent or someone else entirely. 

Your kid can decide when he‚Äôs old enough (when exactly that is, is also largely up to you until he‚Äôs a legal adult) whether he wants to seek out contact. 

Only thing I‚Äôd say from experience is, don‚Äôt actively prevent him if he wants to. Explain it to him if you can, but if you can‚Äôt, actively stopping him if he expresses desire might make you seem like an issue especially to a teenager ;) (i say this cos I didn‚Äôt know with my parents, but I was actively allowed to visit if I wanted, and chose not to anyway). but equally, she is a rapist and a danger to him so make that clear if you can. again all up to you, just thoughts and ideas that I hope might be useful.
Just like that ? What is on the birth certificate? Did she give up her parental rights?
How does a 15 year old get custody?
There is no context to know if the rape was addressed and recognized, that is why I ask. For context.
This story seems sus.
I don't know if the story is true but he doesn't say that he has an official custody. He seems to say that it's an unofficial agreement between his family and the woman (no justice involved).¬†
I mean we don‚Äôt know the scenario. Making assumptions doesn‚Äôt help anybody. I doubt a kidnapper would come to reddit for moral advice
What state do you live in? Wondering about the statute of limitations for rape of a minor.

Edit: I read your other comment that said your parents made a deal with your rapist not to report her and they got your son in exchange. Keep in mind, you were a minor at the time and are not bound to that ‚Äúdeal‚Äù now.

Edit 2: Are you sure the child is yours?
But how did you get custody? Your parents can‚Äôt just ask her for the baby and she says ok without there being a legal transfer. Did that happen? If it did what did the legal document say? 

If they were just handed a baby and no legal document, unfortunately if she is on the birth certificate and you aren‚Äôt you have no say in the matter
She's a rapist and a pedophile.

if a male rapist and pedophile had children of his own living in his house, would you feel the same way?

protecting those kids its the good that would come from reporting her.

to which I'm sure you'll say "I don't think she has any intention of raping her own kids" but I'm sure people close to her would have said the same thing about her raping you....
It is never too late. Report her for the safety of other children.
It is never too late to report sexual assaults of minors. 

Source: my dads in prison on pedo charges filed with police once the child was an adult. Also, charges are forthcoming against my father and other family members sexual abuse of me. Its been almost 40 years.
She is a rapist and pedophile. Never allow her near children, especially your child.
Yes yr son won‚Äôt get raped like u did
Its never to late, usually in most countries child crimes dont expired.
>she also has other kids, nothing good will come from this

That's not for you to worry about. Nor would it be your fault if she goes to prison and her children are affected by that. That's 1000% her fault. She's the one who chose to do what she did.
Do not report her! Good to see you care about her other children
Do you really think so? I see a lot of people saying that, but I'm a bit confused about the reasoning. Why do you say that?
Nobody is saying men don't get raped clearly it's a thing but people have questioned OP and he's dodged or gave inconsistent answers about the situation that makes it more likely it's just a troll screwing with people. Privacy is an illusion, throwaways are a false sense of it. He my as well just post on his main if he even has one.
We aren't calling BS on the rape.  We're calling BS on the custody.  The birth mom is on the certificate so has 100% custody.  If the boy is on the certificate, his age is on there and hospitals are mandatory reporters so this little fantasy falls apart.  If the boy is NOT on the certificate, he has kidnapped a baby because he has zero legal rights.  People can't give babies away with a hand shake.  Come on, use some thought process on this.
Maybe just don‚Äôt believe everything you read on the internet.
There is no way OP or his parents have legal custody. It‚Äôs possible they have the child, but they are doing so illegally. The mom is automatically put on the birth certificate- there is no way she would put the father on it as it would out him as a minor. When mom left the hospital, the custody of the baby was legally hers alone. Now it‚Äôs possible she handed him off to OP and his family informally, but this is going to cause issues once they try to enroll him in schools or even take him to a doctor because they can‚Äôt show any legal ID for him. Since they legally have no right to the child. 

This story is probably fake, but if it isn‚Äôt then this kid is technically kidnapped and has no access to any services unless birth mom takes him or signs off on it. At some point OP will need to get legal custody and that will cause this whole thing to come to light.
Which is a very bs way to blackmail someone to giving you their baby. Both things are illegal and not at all going to happen without someone getting suspicious or pointing the law in their direction

OP has also failed to provide actual answer, just giving vague BS statements. This is made up and op should be ashamed
You‚Äôd be surprised how much shit flies under the radar, but somehow a 14 year old male is given custody of a child (someone else birthed so they must‚Äôve somehow given the baby to them) and now that 14 year old just has a baby? The mom legally is required to be on the birth certificate, the dad does not. If she did put a 14 year old on a birth certificate it would be pretty hard to not have some shit going on legally. If she didn‚Äôt put him down then why does he have the baby now? None of the story adds up
For some of them, it‚Äôs just the joy of someone feeding into it.
How did she have a child as a person with other children and then give the baby to a different family. How could her family accept that unless they knew she had this child with a 14 yr old. I don't believe it. Cool Story Bro
If she raped you as a kid, then perhaps she will rape the friends of her kids and you could have stopped that

If you talk to a lawyer perhaps you dont ever have to look at her and can still get child support and her in jail
In the UK they legally can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs so dumb.
Ehhhhhh... I don't know. I mean, you're not wrong, but if someone is forcing themself upon you and it's traumatizing you, you do not maintain erection/excitement.
They can't do anything about a situation they're never told about.
You have the mom and dad on the birth certificate.  Whoever saw them both sign it should be able to infer something isn't right.
There could also be an exception if he claimed that he had no idea that he could go to the court after that agreement was made. That's a thing sometimes
Fr
I honestly don't think she will rape her own child. If that was the case she would have had more children
Also they tend to stick to the same ages of victims. OPs son just learned about death, so they're probably under 10 years of age. The abuser likely goes for 13 - 15 year olds as a pattern.¬†
Why would he need therapy for recognizing that a pedophile will abuse her own child? It's extremely common and should be expected that pedophiles are a danger to their own children.
Not like she has a history or anything right? Heh heh.
Except technically she didn't give up anything legally. She could fight for custody and likely get visitation in many places. Probably wouldn't have a chance at full custody due to the kids age proving her crime, but a lot of countries allow rapists to legally have parental rights to their victims kids
the father hasnt been caring for the baby- no judge is going to take away the child without evidence of abuse which does not exist today. stop listening to people on reddit and hire an attorney who can help you get whatever you want. If you want to parent then you need to step up and do 50/50 if you dont want to thats fine but have to decide
I don't think it was 'him instead of your son' 

I think it was ' him instead of it' where 'she birthed it' bothered them
Especially when you‚Äôre being broad about a situation bc he‚Äôs not the only person this has happened/happens to.
I should‚Äôve kept reading , disregard above comment üñ§
Chances are pretty high though, that he indeed identifies as male. I mean statistics and all.
If uncertain of gender the best word to use is "they" or "them" since it works for any sex or gender. "It" implies an object.
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH NO WAY THIS IS NOT REAL GOD WAKE ME UP FROM THIS NIGHTMARE
How messed up your head has to be to use "it" to refer to a boy for if "it ends up identifying as not male", Jesus.
Then use ‚Äúthem‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äù is very dehumanizing to use for an already born human being.
Well...shit. ü§î
Well- as a male who was also supposedly raped by a woman, I was always told that women can't rape men. But I believe you nonetheless.  Thank you for your modesty. üôè
exactly its like if you‚Äôre attracted to the same gender you dont just start liking the opposite one day
Pedophiles are not even the majority of people who sexually abuse children, no reason to think this woman is a pedophile.

There also exist pedophiles who never abuse anyone and live moral lives.

It's not a crime to be a pedophile because it's a mental disorder, something you cannot control. The crime is raping a 14 year old kid and scarring him for life. I agree do not get this woman near that child and imo she should be spending life in prison. Just don't confuse rape and pedophilia, only one of them is immoral, the other one is amoral.
Yes 100% agree
Nothing to suggest here that she's a pedophile. Pedophilia is not immoral because it's a mental disorder, it's the terrible crime of raping a kid that is disgusting and punishable.

Most people who sexually abuse children are not pedophiles. Which means the person is probably even more terrible than we thought because they don't even have the excuse of being 'naturally attracted' to children.
This right here, OP.

***She takes joy out of victimizing children.***

##Nothing good will ever be gained by introducing a pedophile to a child.

The kindest thing you could ever do for your child - which needs to be the #1 priority - is keep them far away from their mother, forever.
This ^. She will hurt your shared child. Regardless of it being hers biologically, she is a child abuser and rapist. My mother went through that with her biological father at the age of four. No one is owed parental rights.
The excuses OP is giving makes it pretty clear that he forgives this pedo and only wants to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù his child so he won‚Äôt hate him when he gets older, not because he cares about the child‚Äôs safety.

Don‚Äôt waste your time responding to this post anymore unless you have this person‚Äôs details and can report to real life law enforcement. They are either a troll or equally as twisted as the pedo
I‚Äôm so sorry you went through this, that‚Äôs horrible.
Yeah, CPS needs to have a chat with this family ASAP.
Yes, they made a deal with her, we didn't report her
The OP and his parents still would have gotten custody of the child if they had reported her. The baby is evidence. She would have been incarcerated and the baby would have gone to the father, the OP. 

This is what makes me puzzled over this story.
The point being that this story is just... a story.  People on reddit need to work on their critical thinking skills because damn, this one is pretty obvious.  The father's name and DOB is on the certificate and doctors are mandatory reporters.  This wouldn't get past anybody for 5 minutes.  If he's NOT on the certificate, he's not the father and has no rights to the baby.  Parents can't just shake hands and pass their baby off to someone else.
Frankly, I don't believe this story.
You mean the ones she might rape or allow to be raped?
>Do not report her! Good to see you care about her other children

feminist

you would never say this about a man, only women get a pass
OP didnt mention state or country so we dont know exactly the rules or laws of where they are, we dont know the entire situation
Definitely a fake story, OP being way too dodgy providing details
>Which is a very bs way to blackmail someone to giving you their baby

It‚Äôs also HIS son, that was produced when she raped him, did you miss that part? Statutory rape is illegal.

OP said:

>She technically still has parental rights, my parents made a deal with her, we don't report her, and she gives him to us

So it sounds like OP‚Äôs parents have been helping raise his son, and now his rapist wants to see her son again.

The story could be made up, but not for the reasons you‚Äôre suggesting. If his son is not in school, why would the law ever be involved? It‚Äôs not unusual for teen parents to have a ‚Äúlittle brother‚Äù or ‚Äúlittle sister‚Äù (their own child) that their parents help raise.

Are you suggesting the rapist/mother would raise the child better?

Are you suggesting the state would raise the child better?
Nothing here implies he even has custody
I‚Äôm certainly not googling that, so I‚Äôll take your word for it. That‚Äôs insane
Good UK
Incorrect, that's why a lot of women have sexual trauma when associating enjoyable sex and feeling negatively afterwards. 
Your pleasure centers aren't on command. If you are blindfolded and forced to eat chocolate, you dint all of sudden stop your taste buds from working just because you don't want the chocolate.
Well maybe this isn't the case for OP's son, but my birth certificate has both my parents ages listed in big bold font right next to their names. This information was gathered by the hospital, so someone would have known. We're assuming OP is on the birth certificate because he apparently has rights to the child.¬†


Legally it might be a gray area, but ethically people should say something when they notice a child being abused¬†
according to his comments she DOES have more children now, so who knows what she's doing to them
Becasue she isn't a pedophile. Pedophiles target children. she is a ephebophile. Educate yourself. and not all pedos are automatically incestuous
It‚Äôs not that because she is a peƒèo, but she might not be an incestual one
Perhaps? Personally, I think she's just a hebophile that wants to be reunited with her rape child.
Depends where, many US states have passed laws that sever rapists parental rights.
Many US states have passed laws that sever rapists parental rights. If she has no rights she has no rights, there is no 50/50 to discuss.
Thanks for the correction.
No worries; will do.
Most likely, but it would be rude of me to assume.
Are we as human beings not objects, albeit a living, breathing, thinking, feeling object?
Because for all I know, the kid could decide they don't feel as if they are a human being, and identify as something else.
You have no right to tell me what I will or won't say if it's not in regards to you.
Hoping you don't have to reevaluate some of your past relationships.
Whoever told you that is wrong and an idiot. Sorry to be crass, but if you have holes that can be penetrated against your will, you can be raped.
FYI, please don't compare same-sex attraction to pedophilia. I know you weren't trying to put them in the same category, but the lgbtq+ community has to contend with this awful stereotype all the time. Please don't perpetuate it any further.
Can you please shut up
literally, stop.
A pedophile is someone who sexually abuses children. How do you get that pedophiles are not the majority of people who sexually abuse children. That's the definition.
Brother you‚Äôre wasting your time getting ratio‚Äôd in a Reddit comment section right now. It‚Äôs not worth it.
I believe those who commit zoophilia when they are young are the same that rape elderly people, children, anything they find vulnerable, and are the same who rape men in prisons, i don't know how they are classified.
"Most people who sexually abuse children are not pedophiles."

shut the fuck up
I think you are being too harsh b
Thank you for your kind words. Anger is what keeps me alive.  I'm too angry to die
Well, you have your answer : she is unhinged and doesn't love her kid. Keep your child away from her. If she didn't take responsibility for raping you, and gave up her child, she doesn't love anyone but herself.


Don't beat yourself up for keeping your child away from a molester, and get therapy for being assaulted. Good luck.
Ouch. Your parents really betrayed you here and failed to do the right thing. I'm so sorry you were forced into this. You are doing a great job for your kiddo!  I hope you can get away from your family someday soon.
I'm calling bullshit on this story.  The birth mother is automatically and always on the birth certificate.  No "deal" amongst unassociated parties is going to change that.  Unless the court took her rights away, she has full rights.  If the "parents" made a deal, that means they know the woman raped their son.  No parent in this world would just shake hands with their kids' rapist and say "Come over for tea later."

Bullshit.
Your parents made the deal.  You didn't.  You could still report her.  

If you and your parents effectively have full custody, that's unlikely to change.
I‚Äôm sorry to do this if I am wrong but you are full of shit and should be ashamed of yourself. This is impossible to do without getting the law involved. She just births a child, says fuck the birth certificate, then hands over a baby to you so you guys can do what you want? This is the story you‚Äôre selling?

Cuz as bad as the rape is, your parents just blackmailed a rapist to give away a baby. Buying people is illegal, blackmail is illegal. Unless you are listed on the birth certificate AND signed it or are going to prove paternity with a DNA test, you have no legal say in that baby. This is black market baby buying in the worst situation.

On top of blackmail, your parents are also kidnappers, accessory to aiding a rapist, and you need to go to DCFS for yourself ASAP.

Or you‚Äôre full of shit
I‚Äôm not defending her but there‚Äôs no evidence or indication that she‚Äôd molest her own blood‚Ä¶ what do you want ? : get her in prison and leave her children stray? The overkilling tendency of you modern generation is harmful
I'm a feminist and that means equity and justice. Every feminist I've ever met would say the same as me: Rape is rape regardless of who does the raping.
State is irrelevant as kidnapping children is a felony in every state.  Based on OP's decent grasp of English, the U.S. is a pretty safe assumption.  Let's not bend over backwards too much to find a scenario where this string of lies becomes reality.  We're not Republicans here.
Him being the father and him having paternal rights are not the same thing. If he isn‚Äôt on the birth certificate and there are no adoption papers, he has no rights to the child point blank. Again I am saying what is going on in the eyes of the law. Which is why this situation is completely made up.

If she wants to see her child and she is on the BC: she can see him and there is jack shit he can do about it unless they go to the cops about the rape

If she is not on the BC then he doesn‚Äôt have anything to worry about, as long as he or his parents are listed on the BC OR have adoption papers for the child.

If both are on the BC then the mother would be in custody and the baby would‚Äôve gone through the appropriate DCFS channels to get legal rights granted to the father

Idk why you are attacking me when I‚Äôm just explaining factually why his story is fabricated. None of it adds up unless this was some off the books baby and nobody else knows OP, OPs family, or the rapist. But considering she has other kids, it‚Äôs gonna be fucking hard to hide a pregnancy, let alone what you did with the baby after.

Child abandonment is a crime unless done through the appropriate channels. Everyone here is a piece of shit and only thinking about covering their own ass instead of what is right for this innocent baby.

Or, hear me out, OP is full of shit and none of this is true

TL;DR: please see literally all the other comments and don‚Äôt put words in my mouth
He said ‚Äúhis parents made a deal for him‚Äù. It‚Äôs a load of horse shit mate
Then he doesn‚Äôt really have a choice on if the mother sees the child or not unless he is A) going to the cops or B) making up a story
Then he's a kidnapper and his family are his accomplices.  Can't have it both ways.
That's a wildly different scenario that doesn't apply to sexual trauma...
I agree 110% on the ethics.  

My first child was born into an abusive situation while I was a teen mama, and I have hospital staff to thank for our safety - even to the point of having my abuser escorted off property and forbid to return.

Even with that, there were things they couldn't accomplish just from having our paperwork, things that had to be said out loud before they could act. So I've just always hated seeing people blamed for matters they never had any shot at all to overcome due to a lack of psychic ability or too much bureaucratic red tape.
A 14 year old is a child. Educate *yourself*
^ We found the woman who SA‚Äôd the kid.

Most pedos are because that's who they have access to
All pedophiles will be incestuous if they have access to children related to them. Every single one. That's not a line to them.
No one can explain the different kind of pedophiles without sounding like one
She shouldn't get 2% of any rights!! She raped him, over!
I think the issue is we tend to reserve "it" for objects that do **not** live, breath, think, or feel. Using it for a person who does all of those things is dehumanizing.

I'm not trying to jump down your throat or anything, just explaining the connotations of the word choice.
So following your virtuous high-horsed reasoning, we should refer to all kids as "its" for if they decide they don't identify as their genders. LOL
Ok, but it sounded like you outright dehumanized that child. Im allowed to point it out. I understand if that wasnt the intention but thats how it sounded and i clearly wasnt the only one to see that. ‚ÄúThem‚Äù would of been more appropriate is my point:)
Not at all. Everyone goes through shit. That's just life, I guess.
You have nothing to apologize for.
Well, most of my friends are assholes. But thanks nonetheless.

I have a theory that pedos don‚Äôt care what is between a child‚Äôs legs, they just have fun at the child‚Äôs expense.
What's the difference exactly? Pedophilia is, just like being gay, a sexual attraction. Both are amoral(don't confuse it with immoral) because you cannot control them. People shouldn't confuse pedophilia and rape: rape is the atrocious crime being committed here, being a pedophile is not a crime. It's just a sexual attraction like being gay, although a ,unfortunately, terribly incomprehensible one for most people.

most people who sexually abuse children are not even pedophilic, which means they're far, far more terrible people for scarring children like that because they don't even have that incomprehensible excuse to defend their actions.
It does suck for the lgbtgi community, but let's not pretend it isn't an issue...
i understand what youre saying but pedophilla is an attraction as is sexual orientation & my point is attraction is not something that just changes. there are no other comparisons that could be made here for this point regarding attraction unless you have any better analogys?
[removed]
no
No, a pedophile is someone who is sexually attracted to children not everyone who abuses children does so because theyre sexually attracted to them. Many do so out of a sense of control/punishment/power dynamic/...

Any vile reason they could have other than being sexually attracted.

The definition you're using is that of a child abuser/rapist, theyre not synonyms because obviously not every rapist is a pedophile as this source on the bottom shows.

16% according to this source. It's dsm IV and research on pedophilia is not very conclusive, but so yeah the claim that most of them aren't is pretty accurate. 16% is far from 50%.
Im not wasting my time by calling out societal misconceptions and harmful stigma.

The fact that people downvote just because they dont like to hear it even though i have said nothing unfactual, says more about them than about me and is probably more reason to keep doing this.

Did I ask what you thought?
Nah. This is fake. There is too much information left out.
she has other kids and somehow hid the rape baby from everyone, including them. Anyone with kids knows you couldn't¬†
She has rights, but she also has other kids and a life. She gave up her son to protect her reputation, and I was the one who forced my parents to not report her
Bio mom has custody unless the courts say she doesn't.  This story is BS.
>This is black market baby buying in the worst situation.

Calm down.

I don‚Äôt know the law either, but the baby is genetically his, and also genetically the son of the woman who raped him as a minor. Are you suggesting his rapist is fit to have custody? She‚Äôs not. So this guy is next of kin. ‚ÄúKidnapping‚Äù? It‚Äôs his own kid, and the mother doesn‚Äôt have custody apparently, due to being a statutory rapist and everything‚Ä¶
If the genders were reversed you wouldn‚Äôt be talking that way. A woman who would rape a 14 year old would be equally likely to allow her child to end up in a similar situation. Her kids would go to next of kin or foster care, not be left to fend for themselves. If someone had protected me as a child, I would have ended up in foster care, but maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have been molested by my step mother. You‚Äôre ignorant to the risk this woman poses because your life hasn‚Äôt shown you this kind of darkness.

Edit to say: maybe our generation is trying to make up for where your generation fell short and let us all get hurt.
She's a pedophile rapist. Why do YOU trust her around children?
>that means equity and justice

no it means its a womens liberation movement, nothing to do with equality and men and justice

if you disagree, provide evidence where feminism helps men, all i can find is stuff about women
Believe what you want, I don‚Äôt really care, this is just more common that not. You must not have read the post that legitimately references a felony
You two are arguing *semantics*. The specifics of what squeak said is correct, but in a general sense people refer to under 18 as children, so you are also correct. However in biological development, it is not just one big ‚Äúchildren‚Äù description, just as you don‚Äôt just call all the different bones in your leg as the same name. The predator in this case seems to like males that are in early stages of puberty which is a different time frame than say an 8 year old that wouldn‚Äôt see puberty development for another 4-5 years on average.

Is that important to differentiate? I don‚Äôt know. English has a pretty bad problem where people get lazy and bleed 7 different words together a lot of the time and that‚Äôs what is happening here

Case in point here would be; a 17 year cannot be a ‚Äúephebophile‚Äù because that would be their normal dating range, though, it would obviously come as a concern if a 17 year old tried to date someone that is 13. This same 17 year old can be considered a pedophile if they were to target 10 year olds or anyone that is pre-pubescent 

Just food for thought
You a special kind of stupid.
if anyone touches kids its probably you fam.
[deleted]
Fair enough
I understand where you're coming from; I guess I don't get hung up on words like it seems others do.
Fine by me. Oh, happy cake day btw; didn't notice it in the first comment.
Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.

Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.

Beep boop -¬†yes,¬†I¬†am¬†a¬†bot, don't botcriminate me.
You could've asked, since meaning/intention is hard to decipher through text.
Pedophilia is not a sexual orientation. It is a **disease**.

Sexual attraction to prepubescent individuals is simply not supposed to happen. Full stop.
because it's a much more accurate analogy to consider pedophilia as a kink or fetish rather than a sexual orientation. quite often, pedos are attracted to people of age too, but they just PREFER younger children. they're not 'locked in' the same way as a sexuality
I do agree. Simply being a pedophile is not something controllable. We should strive to treat pedophiles. Instead, we make sure that every single non-offending pedophile fears for their life/liberty - and so they remain incognito, and never seek professional help. And of course, that is far more dangerous to their potential victims.
don't normalize pedophilia, that's so fucked up

\*typo
Don‚Äôt fucking compare someone being attracted to minors who can‚Äôt consent to people liking the same gender
found a pedo! no way you are sitting here telling normal ppl how natural pedophilia is
yes exactly this is my point. Its not about being gay OR a pedophile the point is literally that you don‚Äôt just wake up one day and decide you‚Äôre not attracted to something anymore. its like pedophiles deciding they all of a sudden like adults or my gay friend no longer being terrified  and revolted by vaginas or zoophiles even deciding they dont find animals hot anymore. it just doesn‚Äôt happen
You could have made the equally good analogy to heterosexuality. Instead you decided to repeat a narrative that has been used to justify the murder, abuse, and imprisonment of people who have done nothing wrong.
Everyone who rapes a child is a pedophile. 

But sure not every pedophile rapes a child.
Umm - you do realize you posted a public comment on Reddit, and are now complaining that someone commented on your comment?!?!


You seem very confused.¬†
I think so too, but if a troll wants to unveil us malevolent antinatalists as "kid hating" "bad people", I will give him every compassion I, as an antinatalist, have ;)
there‚Äôs no way this is real. nothing about the custody makes any sense. and sorry but this woman dr*gged with alcohol and r@ped a child to impregnate herself, carries and births the baby, and then‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ hands the baby off, never to return until now??
oy vey, the story just gets worse the more the OP comments. a mother with *multiple other kids* not only dr*gged and r@ped *a different child* but did so with the GOAL of getting pregnant, then CARRIED the baby, BIRTHED the baby, and gave the baby away with ZERO legal arrangements made, and no one in her personal life, not even her SPOUSE & KIDS, are like ‚Äúhey where the fuck is the baby you just gestated and birthed?‚Äù ????? and oh btw the kid is 3+ because he is asking about death‚Ä¶ so no dr for the baby has ever looked into this at all despite the dad being a child, and the BABY‚Äôs pediatrician being a mandated reporter?? like this is just rage bait lol
Liar.  She did not give up her son.  That requires going in front of a judge.  And if you took the baby, congrats, you're a kidnapper and you're going to live in prison for most of the rest of your life.  You aren't on the birth certificate.  The father's DOB is on the birth certificate and doctors are mandatory reporters.  You didn't think this creepy little fantasy all the way through.
Absolutely, I think Op is trolling us.
She could have surrendered her parental rights. But OP hasn‚Äôt clarified, so I‚Äôm speculating.
I‚Äôm not suggesting what is right, I‚Äôm only stating the legality of it. If he isn‚Äôt on the birth certificate and there are no adoption papers, yes he hold no legal rights to that baby. I‚Äôm not suggesting a rapist is fit for custody either, but if her name is on the birth certificate and there hasn‚Äôt been any accusations of rape, in the eyes of the law she isn‚Äôt a rapist and she is the mother.

If you enter an agreement with someone to take possession of their baby in exchange for a good or service, that is buying a baby illegally.

It is legal to adopt a child for no financial consideration. It is illegal to coerce someone to do something with a threat of doing something to harm them otherwise.
I mean we can admit that the story very hardly adds up? Can‚Äôt we? Either that or OP has a hard time explaining himself.
We dont know if she‚Äôd molest her own blood. Many rapists don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ Her children are probably better off being with her than facing the cruelty of this world on their own‚Ä¶ you have to consider the consequences of making a bunch of kids orphan.
women‚Äôs liberation from whom, i wonder?
what‚Äôs ‚Äúmore common than not‚Äù?
I‚Äôm aware that there are different sub groups of pedophiles. The problem I have is that making a differentiation here, essentially insinuates that she should see the child, who will, if they aren‚Äôt already, be a teen. So we let the child bond with someone who very well may end up being a danger to him? 

The definition doesn‚Äôt matter because the child has a high likelihood of being in danger at one point or another if they aren‚Äôt already. 

The OC can call me uneducated all they want to. I said what I said.
Must be a troll. Fyi people who use rape culture as grounds to troll are just as bad as predators themselves. Also stay away from minors.
Not the person who is saying she **isnt** a pedophile trying to come insult me. 

You‚Äôre sick.
An adult has sex with a child, yeah pedophilia
I get that too lol, but I've been misunderstood too many times in my life and have resorted to very carefully choosing my words ig

Regardless, it was obvious you meant no harm with your terminology, I just thought some outside perspective of the impact your words can have might be helpful.

Have a nice day!
No wonder you find it fine, you are so delusional you prefer to ignore the reality of the world you live in by misusing the language.

I hope all this madness is just a silly trend, only to be substituted by the next one. Humanity has no hope.
Completely fair point, you‚Äôre right.
But no, it‚Äôs a paraphilia, which is an entirely separate thing from kinks and fetishes.
What makes you say it is much more accurate to say it is a kink or fetish?

Kinks/fetishes can be treated effectively with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, research shows. 

It is also known that pedophilic preferences cannot be changed with psychotherapy. Hence why it's called a 'sexual preference' or 'sexual orientation'.

So pedophilia is definitely much more akin to what we understand under 'sexual preference' or 'sexual orientation'

It is true that some pedophiles, not all, can be attracted to people of age and younger people at the same time, just like how you can be attracted to men and women at the same time. 'preference' in this context means that they will always have a tendency to be attracted to children and adults. You cannot change preferences. You CAN however decide to not act on them, having preferences is NOT an excuse to act on them.
What's fucked up is that you'd rather ignore this issue and let these people near our kids just to 'hope' they don't act on their desires.

DSM-V, APA and WHO agree with me: we need to allow people to seek help without fear of being lynched, so that we can identify them, get them the fuck away from our kids and prevent the risk of them committing a crime.

Anyone who commits rape, ESPECIALLY to children, doesn't deserve the light of day. They could be lynched if it were up to me.
huh? Why not? You don't give any arguments really.

Consent is completely irrelevant when talking about sexual attraction. I can find female or male characteristics attractive without needing consent or justification for it, there's no difference.

you only need consent when engaging in sexual activity, and in the case of sexual activity between an adult and a child, that is ALWAYS rape and should be punished without mercy.

But so consent is irrelevant when talking about sexual attraction itself.
Im a pedo for stating facts which align with dsm-V, APA and WHO guidelines?

Yes rape and pedophillia arent the same thing. If you disagree, feel free, but that doesnt change the facts.

Pedophillic people should be able to seek help without fear of being castrated. So that we can identify who to keep away from our children and help them prevent crimes by not allowing them to have opportunities. Otherwise we cannot find them and prevent these horrible things from happening .

If you disagree then you're basically saying you'd rather ignore the issue and let these people near our kids just to cross your fingers they wont touch our kids. If a 6 year old girl gets brutally raped by a pedophile, i'll let her know you thank her for 'finding' a pedophile.
stop trying to make it something that it is not. if i had an issue with the LGTBQ+, i would just be openly homophobic & straight to the point. my analogy still stands. i‚Äôm literally a person on the internet lmao. i‚Äôm not responsible for listing every possible attraction combination from the sexual orientation spectrum.

there is literally people who fuck cars. use your critical thinking to think of more examples of attraction and how it does not generally change instead of taking the point and making it something else
cause that‚Äôs what‚Äôll happen as a result of one reddit comment analogy describing how attraction is relatively stable overtime /s
"Only a small part (16,2 %) of sexual offenders against children meet the criteria (DSM-IV-TR) for pedophilia."

Another source:

"One common misperception is that all child sexual abuse perpetrators are paedophiles."

https://www.childsafety.gov.au/about-child-sexual-abuse/who-perpetrates-child-sexual-abuse

Statement 1 is demonstrably false.
Not complaining. Just pointing out that I do not care about your opinion on how ‚Äúharsh‚Äù I‚Äôm being. Keep it to yourself loser
I didn‚Äôt see the header. I thought this was just an advice post. This makes it more fake.
Yea this is a little confusing. Did the kid never get check-ups. Never go see doctors, go to school? 

How did he get all the legal information and how was he allowed to do all that without consulting the mother/father?

There was one reddit post of a mother and father just ditching their kid to the grandma but they ended up getting charged with abandonment and they came on reddit to try and brainstorm an excuse.

 They had legit let the grandma take the kid out of state and raise them. They were originally going to do an adoption, but just went whatever and let her leave. They were shocked you couldn't do that.
Dude. WTF.
The rules on birth certificates vary from state to state. And as for the judge...people aren't robots. Someone being a mandated reporter doesn't guarantee they will do the right thing. Especially if they are in the old school of thought that it isn't rape if the CHILD is a male and the rapist female.
I have no evidence to believe or not believe OP, but I 100% think it's possible.
I really don't care if you believe me or not, I've literally had people laugh at my face when I tell them
OP said she didn‚Äôt surrender her rights and the OP‚Äôs parents and the mother have an ‚Äúinformal agreement‚Äù‚Ä¶ aka it‚Äôs a fake troll post.
i honestly have never re read a post on reddit so many times i agree with you wtf is this?? this entire story has to be fake
This is true there would have to be some sort of legal documentation that the rapist signed over the rights to there child. Without any legal documentation done, they are setting that child up to be abducted by the bio mom / rapist and there would be nothing that family could do about it because she still has full parental rights. Nothing to say this person is an unfit parent has been proven or even explained in a court of law. 

Op if this is true you need to talk to a lawyer.
You also have to consider the consequences of leaving children with an actual pedophile. You're willing to just let pedophiles be alone around children? Or do you not think this one is as bad because it's a woman?
you're a rape apologist.
I'm not a troll but you are a genuine idiot. congrats.

>paraphilia

"To date there is no broad scientific consensus for definitive boundaries between what are considered "unconventional sexual interests", kinks, fetishes, and paraphilias."

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0325-z](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0325-z) 

the line between kink and paraphilia is entirely up to each person's morals but they are definitely not "entirely separate things"
Typically, CBT is used to help the patient control their mental state/emotions/issues/etc better. It cannot "change" a person in the way you seem to be implying. Ex: for a patient with intrusive thoughts, a therapist might use CBT to help them deal with those thoughts - not to actually fully eliminate those thoughts.
By extension, CBT is known to be effective with pedophiles. [Here is a study review of 10 different studies on the topic](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306624X16644501).
This point I agree with you on.  We only get to study the offending pedophiles that have been caught.  There's no good way to study the non-offending, which there are far more of.  They can't seek counseling, because of the mandatory reporting requirement.
Do not parrot things that have gotten my people murdered. When you do, you are contributing to homophobia and you are doing harm, even if it is a small amount of harm.
>use your critical thinking to think of more examples of attraction and how it does not generally change instead of taking the point and making it something else

I think u/Efficient_Dress_6101 did: "You could have made the equally good analogy to heterosexuality." 

No one said you were being intentionally malicious, btw. I think people are just trying to alert you to the fact that tying pedophilia to the lgbtq+ population hurts the latter community. Nonetheless, you're doubling down. You, too, need to "critically think" about what you're saying -- especially its ethical implications.
Comparing LGBT people to pedophiles has gotten us killed. How are you so heartless that you just don't give a shit about that and feel fine about parroting the narrative? You are a truly disgusting person.
Let me restate. Everyone who rapes a child because they desire them sexually meets the definition of a pedophile. If they rape them just to physically abuse and cause harm out of punishment or sadism I suppose that‚Äôs not attractive-focused. But this is more about how I categorize ethically myself not so much about technical definition or lawful definition. But I hear you.
Guy the kid was raped at 14, and, still as a child, has suffered the betrayal trauma of his parents sweeping this gross injustice under the rug and forcing him, to raise the offspring of his rape. 10/10 Stockholm recipe.
Well, I can't find anything to prove nor disprove the state-by-state claim.  Would be helpful if OP had mentioned that important part.  The thing with lies is that you want to remain vague.
How old was she when she raped you? What was your mom‚Äôs reaction ?
100% fake.  Just some creeper getting off under his computer desk.  The birth mother has full custody in every circumstance unless the court removes that custody, in which case this alleged "deal" would no longer be enforce.
Who cares about the technicality of ephebophile or pedophile. It‚Äôs still a crime and it‚Äôs still disgusting and she‚Äôs still likely to abuse her son.
> Well, everytime I try to speak out for mens rights on reddit

Neither men nor women have the right to rape children, wtf?

> If anything, it is reddit that has taught me that males can not be victims of women.

They say on a post about a man who was raped by a woman...
.. this post isn't about men's rights, it's about a rapist trying to gain access to a child they have no business accessing. Are you in the wrong sub bud?
Yes you are doing it, by not calling it "him" when he is a boy and her mother calls it as such. If he decides to call himself a woman in the future, fine, by preventively assuming he can do so and using a neutral "it" is just silly, dumb, a mock of the current society we live in where every silly little person likes to play the "look at how virtuous I can be" game. Nonsense.
Is there a scientific consensus on the line between all of them and a sexuality?
lmao ok buddy
i dont care because im not homophobic nor worked up over a reddit comment because i understand the significance one human being actually has to the world therefore it doesn‚Äôt matter
shut up lmao dont make it something that its not
Yeah, that statement i agree with. 

My goal here is trying to make people aware of the nuance and difference between pedophilia and rape.

It is in our best interest to not make monstrosities of people with disturbing sexual interests, if we want to be able to protect our children against these people with such desires. 

Being a pedophile is amoral, just like liking the taste of certain foods is. Meaning it is not a matter of morality because it is not a conscious decision.

I want people to be as righteous, angry, judgemental against rapists as they are right now. But I don't want them to have this attitude against pedophiles who aren't rapists. 

So I hope by speaking about this nuance, people will stop misusing the word pedophile as a synonym for rapist and hopefully this means we are better able to help, prevent, monitor and protect against sexual child abuse.

Thanks for the respectful talk, you rock.
If it's real, they really wouldn't want to put any identifying information on the internet.
Thirties, my mother just asked me what I want to do
It could be. I'm curious about the mothers age. One thing that sounds weird to me is why the mother would even tell anyone a 14 year old is the father? Unless it's a bunch God fearing rednecks.

But I agree it sounds fake.

Fuck off. Transitioning is an overwhelmingly successful procedure that helps people get the care they want.
Nobody is mutilating trans children.

They are, however, mutilating intersex children. So if you actually care about that, please redirect your anger where it‚Äôs actually needed.

Intersex children are operated on without their consent and sometimes without their knowledge. There are explicit carve outs in anti-trans legislation to allow this practice to continue. Because the people pushing this moral panic don‚Äôt care about mutilating kids. They care about conformity.

Watch the documentary [Every Body](https://www.focusfeatures.com/every-body). Again, if you actually care. Doubtful you do. You probably just hate transgender people, considering it's clear you've never actually talked to one. You're drinking the Kool-Aid, bud. Fix your heart.

babes its a troll who only shits on LGBT people, dont feed it
Nah just being realistic. In about 10-15 years when we have all these whacky children that are grown up and non functioning, then you'll see. 

We'll look back at this point in history as a major misstep towards catering towards the mentally ill.
I know a few, every one has mental issues. Fix your brain.
I think the people that are denied their rights as trans individuals care, yeah? And those with the heart to care. 

A lot of things have been removed from the DSM over the course of its existence, including being gay. That's science. It's not static. You learn and change.
how is banning religious imagery in government anti-american? America is not a religious institution
You could literally have purchased the "he is risen" yard signs from Michaels and nobody would've bothered you a bit. You can use it on April 20 next year, and then April 5 in 2026. 


Trans people are also not a religion. Being LGBT isn't a choice lol
Separation of church and state dingus. 

Also there's no reference to Trans people in the Bible so I don't know why you give a shit. There's no "trans agenda," just people trying to live their lives. Today is Trans Visibility Day. It is every March 31st. It also happens to be Easter. It ain't mutually exclusive.
Anti-American? lol what the fuck are you on?
No, catering to the mentally ill would be paying any attention to anything you say.
Trans people have existed for thousands of years. They are spoken of in the Bible but  not negatively two things can exist at the same time.
Fucking bozo
You think trans people are a new thing? My god, educate yourself or sit out of the conversation.
Yeah, you don‚Äôt give a fuck about kids. You‚Äôre just a stupid bigot, both a transphobe and an ableist.

You can‚Äôt even use your brain to recognize that you‚Äôre being sold a bogeyman in a trick so fucking old that it‚Äôs embarrassing you‚Äôre falling for it. Transgender people are just the latest demographic to fulfill that role. They‚Äôre the current red cape being waved around by the matador, and you‚Äôre charging them brainlessly while the people behind you stick you with spears.

You should be paying attention to the people with the spears. But you‚Äôre too dumb and angry, so you only see the red cape.

Thanks for taking your mask off though.
Wasn't America founded on the separation of church and state? I think I read that somewhere
Unlike James Hurley, my latest tattoo will always be cool
Done by Adrianne S of Joy in Sorrow Tattoo
This is Illegal
It's a young Hank Hill
![gif](giphy|l1IY2yT4fAo66oDPG)
Thought it was Butt-head from Beavis and Butt-head for a sec üòÜ
That's so awful that it's amazing.
It would‚Äôve been funny if you exaggerated the forehead a bit but this is cool too I guess.
Your sense of irony is toxic, God blessp
Hahaha 

Now this is art.

Love it
James has always been cool
Say you didn‚Äôt.
You put a shitpost on your body permanently and I respect it far more than I should
This is so dopeeee. üò≠
I looked up commitment in the dictionary and this picture showed up.
Except for the fact it looks nothing like James Hurley?
Sorry, forehead isnt big enough
UNLIKE!!! ü§¨
this tattoo was always cool
I don't recall James having two foreheads in the original show.
Five-head
Snipers dream
I mean yeah it's kinda funny and all but weird thing to want on your body for the rest of your life. I wonder when the novelty of that will die down.
*Peyton Manning has left the chat*
Now get Beavis
almost art garfunkel
Jesus wept
i like Tommy Lee Jones
So glad this is only a temporary tattoo. Very funny‚Ä¶ for a week or two.
Fuck man I can't believe people put little memes / gimmicks on themselves permanently like this. Downvote to your heart's content, I think both Lynch and James Marshall would think this is deplorable and Santa would say it isn't good behavior. 

Separately from being tacky it's that you're permanently mocking someone's appearance. For your entire life lol
Amazing
You didn‚Äôt.
Dat 4-HED.

I LOVE THIS.
üíÄ
Aight everyone, we peaked
His character in the last season felt so meaningless.  I wish he could have gotten the glove, then you could have had him acting strange in town and all the people thinking their hometown boy went crazy.  Then that line, "James has always been cool." would have carried more weight.  It would have been better than forcing in some needless side character from out of the blue, when James is right there; his only story arch was mowing other guys' lawns.
Show that to James Marshall lmao
its the way he thought he ate that song
This is the most amazing thing I‚Äôve seen on Reddit possibly ever.
This is an artistic masterpiece
Oh boy
Foreheads not big enough.
Oh man
FUCK YEAH
[removed]
Good to know you hold the right opinion on James. I mean, he actually liked Evelyn
Fuck yeah.
Curious about the capitalization though‚Ä¶
James looks like the smart hulk / The Leader.
The song is so weird. And grammatically shouldn‚Äôt it be ‚Äújust you and me‚Äù?
That is hilarious and amazing!
Massive respect.
Worse.

*UN*legal.
Illegal? An ill eagle ain‚Äôt nothing but a sick bird.
There is something extremely Mike Judge coded about this haha
I was thinking the forehead on the tat was a smidge large, but then I saw this gif.
There was an MTV cartoon in the '90s about a guy with a giant head and Butt-head has a cameo in one of the early episodes so you're not far off.
My only criticism is that his forehead is too small
Lies and heresy lol
Clearly you misremember his magnificent fivehead
You may remember James as having a small forehead. Well that memory is false!

A big, strong forehead.  His forehead tells a story.  Of greatness.
Twin Widow‚Äôs Peaks?
It‚Äôs at least an 8 or 9 head.
I believe it is called a ‚Äú5-head‚Äù
the song is good lmao, it's functionally the same as julee's songs. his voice being that high is the only strange thing but it's cute
he thought it was so good that he tried to use it again in the return lmfao
Its cool on Reddit, but most people IRL will wonder why OP has a  Butt-head tattoo.
**[No Real-World Politics:](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/wiki/subredditrules#wiki_no_real-world_politics)** This is not a subreddit to discuss or reference politics (political figures, events or ideologies) as it frequently creates incivility and drama.
"Me" vs. "I" depends on whether it's the subject or object in the sentence.

For example, "You and I are going to the James and the Giant Forehead concert tonight." Or "James and the Giant Forehead dedicated the song to you and me."

It's a little clunky because "we" or "us" would be more natural in an actual conversation, but the song is trying to be exclusive ("*just* you and I"), while us or we could include more than two people.

But going back to the lyrics, the phrase

> just you and I together forever in love

doesn't have a verb in it, so it's indeterminate whether it's the subject or object. You could use either.
The sheer level of cringe and secondhand embarrassment that song provides is honestly impressive
Yes! Looks like Boomhauer's face, Dale's beady eyes and Hanks gigantic forehead
I see some Beavis or Butthead there
Fun fact, they had to edit his head down in post, just to get it to fit on screen.
It was called MTV Oddities‚Äô The Head and was paired with an episode of the animated adaptation of the comic book The MAXX. Both shoes are pretty awesome and worth a watch
It‚Äôs a direct quote!
A fivehead sure, but this is clearly an eighthead.
We're lawyers!
Ah yes, now I remember. It's happening again!
James‚Äô forehead was always cool
This picture is the original unaltered version
Ha!
i think he sells it bc of how comitted he is and it fits the vibes so well lmao
I definitely read those last two in Cotton‚Äôs voice in my head hahah. Good GOD you have a fat neck, Hank!
Written by the guy, who wrote the guy who was ‚Äúcool‚Äù haha!
NOBODY LOOK!!  NOBODY LOOK!!
With the invent of birth control, we realize women don't want kids. 
Up to 1965, most women had 5 children. By 2021, it was 2.32 and in most countries it's below 2. **Birth control became popular in the 60s/70s and many countries started to legalize abortion around that time.**

We're one of the first generations to have more control over our reproductive choices (unless you live in post Roe America) and we're making it pretty clear we don't want o reproduce. We're louder than over about being childfree. 

How do you think this realization is going to impact the next generation of women?
I don‚Äôt want kids so I am thankful for birth control.
Having kids is a very bad deal for most women in most circumstances.
There have always been women who didn't want to reproduce/only wanted a couple of children. Birth control just gives them more of an ability to do that.
I don‚Äôt think the issue is that women don‚Äôt want to reproduce. I‚Äôm a young woman and I get the impression at least half of women like the idea of having kids and genuinely want them. 

I think the issue is that as much as Redditors love to say we have equality and that actually society is skewed in favour of women (not sure how both statements can be true but ok), the vast majority of parenting still falls on women. If you‚Äôre a woman who wants to have a kid, you basically need to accept that most aspects of your life will never be the same again and in fact, many aspects will get WORSE. Pregnancy and childbirth can result in many permanent health and bodily changes (for the worse), many women suffer from mental health issues as a result of childbirth trauma and just general post-partum depression, responsibilities still aren‚Äôt divided up equally etc. I still read so many stories about how people‚Äôs female friends just completely disappear when they give birth but their husbands continue living life as normal, continue to go out with their friends at the same frequency as they used to (sometimes even more!) etc 

As a woman, why would you choose to have a kid when it‚Äôs so unfairly burdensome on the woman while the man suffers almost no impact? And on top of all that society ostracises mothers, claps for men doing the bare minimum when they change a nappy once every few months and bullies mothers into getting ‚Äúmommy makeovers‚Äù while ‚Äúdad bods‚Äù get celebrated and circlejerked over in the media everyday. 

Every parenting mishap or anything like that gets blamed on the mother. Even in this subreddit people are guilty of it. ‚ÄúGahhhb why do women continue to shit out kids‚Äù. I saw a comment that was angry at women for continuing to give birth for thousands of years, completely ignoring there was no access to birth control back then and marital rape was fully legal and thought of as fine. In many parts of the world women still don‚Äôt get any say in whether they reproduce or not. 

Right wing men harp on about how women need to go back to being mothers but then post shit like ‚ÄúWomen didn‚Äôt work for thousands of years!!!! Enough is enough‚Äù as if having to shit out and raise 7 kids while still doing all of the labour at home and farm work isn‚Äôt work. You just can‚Äôt win. No wonder women are opting out. Motherhood is simultaneously expected of you but disrespected and not recognised as real labour. Why would you want to do something that is seen as your only calling in life but then is used to put you down?

Edit: I forgot to add that as the world continues to get worse and worse, more people are waking up to the realities of what‚Äôs to come (climate change, potentially another world war) and are deciding to opt out. A few months ago Putin called on Russian women to start having more children. I just can‚Äôt believe the audacity of it. ‚ÄúFeeemaaaaaleeees, please have 10 kids each so we can send all your sons off to get exploded to death by drones after you already spent 18 painstaking years raising them.‚Äù No fucking thanks.

Edit 2: I forgot to add how the cherry on top is the fact that after all the suffering you‚Äôve gone through to carry the baby and give birth to it, for some fucking reason society still expects the child to have the father‚Äôs surname. I mean wow, what a way to recognise the backbreaking labour. A man‚Äôs role in creating a child consists of ejaculation and that‚Äôs it. Why is it HIS name that gets passed down? It‚Äôs not right.
...birth control is ancient. There are records of women shoving pebbles in their vaginas as a makeshift cup in ancient Egypt, and the Romans famously drive an abortifacient herb to extinction by overusing it.
Actually women realise they can make their own choices without the influence of politics or worse religion. And now with the banning of abortion and restrictions of birth control you see the main influence being from politics and religion. 

Politics and religion are the biggest misogynistic ideology against women for centuries and yet women fight for them instead of against them ü§°. Politics and religion has shown time and time again that it doesn‚Äôt care about women beyond trapping them with marriage and children.
Around the time birth control became popular more women started going to college and having careers‚Äî 20 years before that they basically had little options aside from marriage and children. It‚Äôs due to a variety of things, right now economics plays a heavy part, kids simply aren‚Äôt affordable for most, especially lots of kids. 

Plenty, if not most women want kids. *how many and under what conditions* is most often the issue - I know women who do want kids but won‚Äôt have them because of the state of the world, the uncertainty. It‚Äôs not a moral thing to do to have kids with so many crisises going on like climate change and Trumpanzees. Lol. 

Elective sterilizations are on the rise with forced birthing laws, people would rather not ever have kids then be told if they‚Äôre raped they have to birth a rapey baby or that pregnancy related complications could result in death because politicians now think they‚Äôre doctors. There‚Äôs other ‚Äúchoices‚Äù being made.
If men ever start to be equal partners and valuing the mother in the home, then women will want them again. Nobody wants to work, then come home and take care of kids and baby a grown man too. We all saw our moms be underappreciated and neglected and we see how men's values don't evolve as fast as ours they are mostly still the same as then
Babe, abortions happened before birth control too. 

Women have never wanted a brood of kids.
[deleted]
Women don‚Äôt want kids are anything new, just no one was listening.
I would like kids, but I am straight up not sacrificing my happiness and independence for them.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone in this sentiment.
Reading this post and also the one questioning why there is a female orgasm, I really wonder where women's consent in reproduction lies. Not a pretty picture.
We also have much lower rates of infant mortality. If you have one or two children, you are likely to see them mature.  But agree with linkage between education and children - give people options and they are much more likely to have the resources to make the decisions right for them.
Women should have the right to not be an object (Incubator) if they so choose.
I think the reason y the catholic church is against birth control is because more people that use birth control = less people born = less church members = less money
While birth control is a good option it comes with its own annoyances and side effects my sister and I were the side effects of my mother being on birth control. on top of that it messes with already messy hormones. I've been trying to get sterilized for years and every time a man that doesn't exist in some distant future has more say over my reproduction. On top of everything I don't really want to pass on a thyroid problem to a future child let alone a shity world that we live in right now.
I'm a teenager and just got my IUD, as much as it hurt, in a total of 8 years I will be getting another one put in right after. I'm not dealing with all this kid bs. I LOVE BIRTH CONTROL. Fuck dem kids :)
Women have kids because males don‚Äôt bother to or are too weak to control themselves. Males need vasectomies. We need millions of vasectomies. Put the solution in the hands of the people creating the problem. Women do not get pregnant from the ether. It is always a man‚Äôs fault when a woman has a kid. He is the one actively making it happen. He has full control of where he puts his semen. Make men account for their actions. And start asking where was the father when something goes wrong.

Males are weak. They need vasectomies because they‚Äôre obsessed with their two second orgasms and using women like toilets. Women should shut this shit down.
I wish mens birth control was as readily available and pushed on me as much as it is on women. It would help so many unwanted pregnancies. It's just not worth having kids anymore in America IMO, it costs too much, the men aren't really trustworthy anymore (not all of them mind you) and women give up their entire existence and do 110% if the work. It's not fair anymore for women to have kids
Having children is not the way it was prior to the Industrial Revolution. Now, it sets you up for failure a lot of the time. It used to be profitable to have many children because since most families owned businesses, each child was an employee. Now, you‚Äôre better off being childfree. My husband and I live in Post Roe America, we both got fixed because of this. After the overturning there was an influx of sterilization procedure requests, they still cant tell us what to do with our bodies. You can‚Äôt go back to a time that is impossible to go back to without pushback.
sex is for the rich. (in a post-roe world I choose masturbation)
Makes me wonder how many people in the older generations wouldn‚Äôt have been born if their parents had a choice. If as time goes on, society might get marginally better because less unwanted and then broken people are being born into situations they‚Äôre not even wanted.
Because how do women benefit from having children, anyway? They carry the man‚Äôs name, the man gets to be involved in only the fun parts with minimal emotional load. Women today work and pay bills, and do 85-90% of the domestic and childcare. 

Being a mother means throwing your soul and freedom away in today‚Äôs age.
Men also don't really want them either imo.
I never really wanted them, but when Iw as younger I hadn‚Äôt yet been exposed to other life path possibilities, I just assumed it was ‚Äúwhat people did‚Äù. When I realized I wanted a different life, I made the decision to never have them. It‚Äôs just not for me. I respect people who dream of being parents and try their best to do it right and actually commit to it, but it‚Äôs just not compatible with the life I want to lead. 

But, being a woman and having known women from different parts of the world and of different ages/generations, from different socioeconomic backgrounds and cultures, I have to say this:

A lot of women do want children. But they don‚Äôt trust men enough to do it anymore. They also don‚Äôt trust the economy, and they don‚Äôt feel ready. Mostly because of job/money instability. It‚Äôs usually instinctive to women to at least postpone having children unless they feel completely safe and protected, with a stable home life and finances. Women had to grow up knowing very well they will be doing most of the work by themselves, and nowadays, just one source of income for a family just won‚Äôt do, generally speaking. They don‚Äôt want to be tied down to just any guy, and they‚Äôre scared of even getting married earlier than in their mid 30s/40s, because men haven‚Äôt exactly given them the idea they will be faithful and committed and work as hard as they would. It‚Äôs also the fact that woman are _expected to work _ now. Which means husbands often see stay at home wives as lazy parasites, because they would be still expected to do all the house work and child raising even if they worked. We were told that being a stay at home mom is ‚Äúlame‚Äù and out, and being independent girlboss is ‚Äúcool‚Äù and in, and with men pushing back on such concepts (as if they have a say lol) with such passion, women feel like they can‚Äôt trust men anymore. Most of them want to have children eventually I think, they just want to take better control over the conditions under which they‚Äôre gonna do it (at least from my experience getting to know other women), which I think is positive and very responsible! 

Also, they can no longer hide from women how _absolutely horrible and disgusting and terrifying pregnancies are/can be_ , so of course women would think twice before making such a decision LOL. Not to mention women who have health issues or mental health issues and want to be able to focus on themselves and their healing, which is more than fair. 

But yeah. Mostly economy, culture and fear/mistrust in the modern men, really. 

But some women, such as myself, are just becoming aware that this is a life path for women who _really want it_. It‚Äôs not for everyone‚Äôs taste, but it‚Äôs also not for everyone‚Äôs capabilities. Some women are gonna be great mothers, but I would be great doing other things. There are other ways a woman can contribute to the world. There are other types of ‚Äúchildren‚Äù one can give birth to (a project, a job, a dream, a community, a cause, an ideal). And to some of us, that feels like a more fulfilling path, where we can actually do good. And that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs best to let people who _want children_ to have a go at it, to ensure the kids are gonna be wanted, planned for, protected, and most importantly, loved. This is good. There is no universal good or bad when it comes to having kids or not, it‚Äôs gonna be different for every person/family. What‚Äôs important is knowing and doing what‚Äôs best and smarter/more responsible for _you_.

Why do you think most women had five children in 1965? I looked it up and it says the average number of children per family was about 2.5 in 1965. I do agree that a lot of women don‚Äôt want children, and now that they don‚Äôt have as much social pressure to have them, they‚Äôre not having them. I think that the population will fall off a cliff if Gen alpha makes it to adulthood(I think there‚Äôs a decent chance there will be some sort of extinction event that happens before then) for a multitude of reasons, with possibly the biggest one being lack of social skills.
‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre making it pretty clear we don‚Äôt want to reproduce‚Äù. Are we? Doesn‚Äôt seem that way given that in America we are above replacement fertility. 

What you refer to is the DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION. It occurs in every country worldwide as they transition from a rural agricultural/mining dominated economy with a bottom heavy population pyramid (lots of kids, lots of infant mortality, not many old people, lower lifespans) to a modern developed western-like economy/lifestyle (urbanization, high lifespans, education, wealth, health care, essentially the easy life when compared to history). This results in people having less kids, sometimes below replacement level (though this seems to be more of a housing/cost of living crisis more than anything else). 

This makes perfect sense; your kids don‚Äôt have a 40% chance of DEATH before they turn 10 now so you don‚Äôt need to have 7 to make sure enough survive. Kids also go from an economic resource in an agricultural undeveloped economy (child labor on the farm was the NORM throughout human history) to an economic burden (developed countries don‚Äôt have a need for child labor and we now have to work more to support them for 18+ years, whereas before they worked and helped us).
We realize women *don't want to get pregnant every time they have sex. And men don't want to have a baby with every woman they sleep with. 

Being on birth control doesn't mean you don't want kids at some point. Half the posts on women's subs about birth control are about getting off it so they can start trying for a baby. 

Most people are choosing to be child free for financial and current social/cultural reasons. If times were better more people would be okay with bringing a new life into the world.
Having kids sucks, drink gin and party.
I think economics have a lot to play in it too. Everything is more expensive so couples will agree to 1 or 2. Abortion is nothing new just how and where it‚Äôs done that changes. Women now work 24/7 at home and 40+ hrs at a job. Before you‚Äôd stay single if you didn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt have kids, now it‚Äôs optional
Child care expense insurance horrible schools if you want a decent school where I am you need to be able to buy a house that cost a miilion. Why put yourself through all that and if you try everyone will say you‚Äôre doing it wrong . I understand why women may say no thank you
Women want kids they just don‚Äôt want 12 of them. Most women still have kids just a lot are having 1-2 vs 4-5. Makes sense kids are expensive and a lot of work. From the women I know with 1-2 kids most of them actually wanted to be moms but any amount of kids makes you a mom so why have 5 when you can have 1 and still have the experience of mothering?
[deleted]
Some archaic laws will be passed and the oppression will continue
My girlfriend doesnt want kids too. Its way to expensive and we just dont want them to suffer like we do. Without own place, renting. Just to work even more for kids. No thanks, im gonna do some travelling and invest in myself to enjoy little free time.
Not all people want the same thing. Its incredibly foolish to generalize.
I think capitalism and neoliberalism also plays into this. Even if feminism never happened, I think reganomics definitely still would have. Most people simply can‚Äôt afford a nuclear family lifestyle post 1980s, even if they want one. Like idk how anyone is feeding multiple children right now, I have no kids no pets no partner and can barely afford the necessities

Edit: this is of course in addition to everything that everyone has already said re: unpaid labour, risk of pregnancy, etc etc
Total Feminist BS question..¬†


I thought antinatalism is about reduce suffering and the goal is as much as possible.


Most women want a partner a soulmate etc..¬†
If not a partner then a pet..
A lot of women still think not on the Baby but themselfs(their bond at least), this Post shows that the term Antinatalism is used without a thought, it should be stated in childfree
The rapidly increasing rates of depression and rising rates of financial instability also play a role in why people don't want to create families. 


The next generation of both men and women will have a more important challenge, which is Poor mental health that they'll likely develop from Generation Z and unhealthy technology habits. This situation will lead to high lonely rates across first world countries, dropping the rates of birth in general.
In Germany this development started more then a decade before the pill came to the market so I am not sure about this
Not having kids and my husband had a vasectomy so I don't need to be on birth control (I was until we turned 30 and he could get a vasectomy). 

I'm an aunt and that's exhausting enough I can't imagine essentially being forced into raising 5 + kids because birth control wasn't a good enough thing yet. I'd be miserable and it explains a lot about previous generations and family trauma.
I would absolutely kms if forced to carry a child. Pro ‚Äúlife‚Äù people don‚Äôt give a damn about me dying from that. I am autistic, it would be extreme torture and cruelty for me, hell, a rough sweater can literally hurt my skin because of sensory issues. Women have never wanted kids en masse, even if we have been brainwashed and told by men that ‚Äúall little girls dream of their wedding day, and want babies‚Äù, now when women are choosing not to do it, some men are losing it!! It always was them wanting that, not us.
in any case bringing someone to this world is not something reasonable.

BUT, if anyone really wants a child, better to have good financial stability and time for the child.

not just another chore that you have to do. most people think that getting married and having child is a life chore.
I have a fear of pregnancy and birth. I will never have kids out of my own body. I don‚Äôt know why any woman would do that to themselves!!! It sounds like literal torture!!
Honestly I would like to have a kid or two but don't know that I can provide them the same quality of upbringing as I had bc I am the sole provider at the moment and my partner works pretty low paying jobs. He's about to get a job for under 20/hr and that's fine. I've dated rich guys and it didn't work and I love my partner fully, but as expensive as life is now, my friends with kids getting on expensive preschool wait lists when they have infants, and my intrinsic belief that our species should probably just march hand-in-hand toward extinction is what has stopped me.
Actually US birth rates started dropping about 1830. If you lived during 1820, and before, it was really common to have about a dozen kids before you were done.
Im sick of people having kids 
Just sick of it
Empowerment of women = less babies............funny how that works.

I think there are "people" and i'm using that term loosely here who don't like current trends and would like women to get back to knowing their rightful place, you know before evil satanic liberal marxist feminist post-modern atheism ideology took over, getting back to being the birthing vessels that the good Lord intended.

Blessed be thy fruit

The General Social Survey results show that it isn‚Äôt working out very well.
>Invent¬†
> Upto 1965 most women had 5 children 

Uhhhh... that is a super biased and inflated baseline. This is the post war boom which significantly increased birth rates for a period of time. You're not making an apples to apples comparison.
Most women still want and have kids, just not 5
It may be more fair to say they don't want to be forced to have kids. Reproductive control in the hands of women is vital to the running of a functional society.
The issue isn't "women don't want kids"...

It's couples with a bit of common sense realize that they cannot afford to have children in the short term. 

Most modern young couples have 2 choices, work hard and maybe be able to afford a kid in the future or have kids and live close to poverty for the next several years.
Maybe the decline of kids has something to do with education and un-affordability.
sadly not enough  women choose freedom....
What next generation? We‚Äôre not having another generation.
The next generation won't be there, thanks to saints that don't have kids
It's not that women "don't want kids", it's that the Industrial Revolution happened. Prior to that, it was mostly farm labor and things that benefited greatly from having an extra set of hands--as many as you could possibly get.

After the Industrial Revolution, factories and foundries and whatnot became widespread and the main source of work. Around this time, crucially, *child labor laws* were put in place, preventing children from going to work in the factories... reducing them from contributors to income to a blackhole of income that requires 18 years of care. Suddenly, there was no incentive to have children. As a matter of fact, if you were intelligent, you were incentivized to have *less* children.

The numbers themselves do NOT tell the whole story, you have to look into the history of this stuff.
Advent, not invent.
So why is the population not rapidly decreasing
So happy I was born after birth control was invented
More resources for us
*with the advent (arrival) of birth control or you just meant invention‚Ä¶
The reasoning isn‚Äôt access to birth control. Women don‚Äôt want children due to lack of childcare and resources in the united states, which is unfortunate.
I mean... There are other more probable reasons for it. You might want to consider the rising costs of giving birth (literally a financial burden for at least 25 years), long working hours leading to meagre time with their children, BS maternity/paternity programs for employees, and a generally f*cked up capitalistic society in total. I think it's a culmination of all of these things that the birth rate is going down.
Personally, I believe we're at an optimal birth rate right now (hovering near 2). But the reason why the birth rate is going down is kinda messed up. 
Funny how my dad says "The means are more important than the ends." And I believe that the ends justify the means but tbh, I think it's a balance of both. In this case, maybe the means aren't justifying the ends.
Probably less than their mothers
While I agree that in general less and less people are opting for children, I think birth control mainly showed that people don‚Äôt want unplanned children. For example, I‚Äôm on many medications that are incompatible with a healthy pregnancy, but crucial to my health. I want the opportunity to safely go off those medications before trying to have a child, if I do decide to have one. I also didn‚Äôt want to have a child when I was trying to complete college or start my career. I hope that the next generation of women will just know that they have choices. They can decide whether or not to have children, and if they do decide to have them, they can choose WHEN to have them. They can choose their own priorities in life.
I think a significant factor in declining birthrates is the increasing price of life and difficulty of providing for a child. It's hard to pay for 5 kids nowadays, probably harder than it was 2 or 3 generations ago. Many people literally can't afford to have that many kids now, even if they want to, so they refrain when they otherwise wouldn't.
Don‚Äôt want kids. Don‚Äôt have sex
I‚Äôm an antinatalist (I‚Äôve posted here a lot, as you can see from my history). So, I‚Äôm not trolling, but I‚Äôm not a fan of this post. 

I‚Äôm really tired of this liberal ‚Äòfeminist‚Äô rejection of long term relationships and children. Please stop claiming that this was an organic thing women wanted to do... it‚Äôs what we HAVE to RESORT to because men are too dangerous and flaky to bother dating or have children with. 

You‚Äôre not radical or feminist if you claim this is an empowering thing we organically wanted. This sort of ‚Äòfeminism‚Äô is tiring and should‚Äôve died 30 years ago. 

Ironically the same person would probably say separatism is radical. 

It‚Äôs all about maximising women‚Äôs misery: 
Can I have long term relationships with men? ‚ÄúNo, they‚Äôre obsessed with sex.‚Äù 

Okay.. can I live away from men? ‚ÄúHaha no silly, that‚Äôs radical.‚Äù 

Okay, I guess I have no choice but to resort to living alone. ‚ÄúOh my god, you‚Äôre so empowered! You‚Äôve made this choice organically all by yourself and you want this <3‚Äù

Sigh

I‚Äôm antinatalist BECAUSE of misogyny. I‚Äôm antinatalist because I‚Äôd never risk bringing a daughter into the world where she can‚Äôt find a man to settle down with. 

You‚Äôre not feminist. You‚Äôre promoting a condition that men LOVE (no commitment no children never settling down) and claiming women want it. It‚Äôs rancid.

But hey, you got 1.6k upvotes. Reddit fucking hates women.
That just shows they don‚Äôt want as many kids, not that they don‚Äôt want kids at all.
How about overpopulation?
Feel like there's a much worse environment today than there was in the 60's. At least in regards to having children. Now it's almost impossible to raise a family on 1 income so both parents are forced to work. Tbh there's a lot to be said about that being the entire point. If women didn't want children then the bio clock wouldn't be a thing. "Modern women" don't want children because there's a pretty concentrated effort to make anything feminine bad. Being a good mother Is about as close to kryptonite as it gets for your average 18-24 year old. Which is the best age to have them.
Women do want kids


They just want kids after they can't have any biologically.¬†
If you don‚Äôt want children why not save your body from years of hormone treatment and just get a tubalectomy?
I‚Äôm a woman üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I want kids. Maybe not 10 kids helpn‚Äô on the farm, but I‚Äôll have as many as seem reasonable, and these days having more than 3 kids is very VERY difficult. Having any amount of kids isn‚Äôt easy, it‚Äôs never been. But if having kids being hard was enough to prevent us we wouldn‚Äôt be here. 

Why does this subreddit keep showing up in my recommended? You guys don‚Äôt have to have kids, but why do all your posts act like no one want kids?
This premise is untrue, and the follow-up question is absurd.
Isolation. Loneliness. Warped consciences. Depression. Lies. Dishonesty. Real hate the kind that is a silent killer everyday for your whole life, inside your thoughts, the nature of your thoughts, inside your emotions, fiddling around with your subconscious, reality goes, narcissism flourishes, slow normalized, microscopic marginalization, more normalized hate, across everything important, individuality hahaha forget it, self destruction. The thoughts that support that a human being is just a thing like how a woman can be viewed as a sexual object and people, groups, societies, souls becoming perfected üëèüèΩ if Jesus was the son of god, the creator‚Äôs son was crucified, so what‚Äôs another? You know it is true everybody does üòÇ everyone just does not want to deal with another life when life is horrible and selfishness/power and Lucifer like pride üòÇ is the guilty pleasure. Separation. And having to be silent about it and if you are connected to it than you are reinforcing narcissism and what all that morality means hahaha and more so having more women running to the Capital in Washington D.C. crying about it. Ain‚Äôt life Great? üëèüèΩ we can murder openly sacrifice children and call it Part of our Rights as Human Beings, Awesome üòé so kool
Unless it's to get financial advantage but we also live in a culture that over inflates single mothers for being one, and not for meeting an unfortunate situation that lead them to it. Rather than sympathize we idolize for it. So then you have a behavior where they have children with multiple baby daddies that financially support them. Or to financially trap a man.
It's all a huge cope.

Your own moms were abused and you were abused too.

So you are coping with it through anti natalism.
**What** "next generation of women"? You just said you don't want children. Where do you think those mythical "next generation of women" is supposed to come from? Zeus's thigh? Stork delivery? There won't be any next generation, if every woman decided she doesn't want children.

Or, more likely, next generation will be composed of a different society, which replaces the likes of your society of "childfree" people because they didn't degenerate into selfish "me-me-me" mindset. Happened before, will happen again, happening in many countries as we go.

Also, would you be - as a thought experiment - OK if your mother decided she shares your philosophy and never had you?

Also, while we are on consequences of being "child free", are you fully prepared to work till you die because those children you are "free" of, won't be born to pay your social security/pensions, or prop up asset values in your pension fund. Are you fully prepared for having no nurses to take care of you as you age, no doctors to treat you, no police to protect you from criminals and no armed forces to protect you from whoever decides you're too rich and defenseless to deserve having whatever assets you as a society have?

And since you (and this thread) decided to go all sex-wars on the topic, how would you feel if all the men who DO want to be fathers, skip your society to go to where women aren't "child free", leaving you with the dregs of men who don't care about consequences or future, which means they have no incentive to build/maintain/protect anything. Just have meaningless sex with all you "child free" women and sit in their mancaves/parent's basements playing video games and doing bare minimum to survive.

Humans respond to incentives. If they are incentivized to apply themselves to build a better future (because they are thinking about their current/future kids), they will. If they have no such incentives, they will roll back to the lazy monkeys they can be without having to care about the future.
Maybe it‚Äôs because of propaganda that having kids is bad for the environment.
That's some air tight logic you have there, chief...
My birth control is not being attracted to men and loving women :)¬†
I like to refer to them as period management pills now.
It‚Äôs life ruining for anyone not very wealthy
They want to downplay it and just call us negative, but as a person whose lived in a good amount of households, this is correct in every single way possible. I don't think most people know what to expect when popping out full fucking human beings and just labeling them as just *"My BuNdLe Of Joy"* and nothing else at all.
Exactly. I'm so thankful that I had realised it in my early twenties.


Easiest decision of my life at that time.¬†
especially men.... no upside
[deleted]
Same. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that we don‚Äôt want kids, it‚Äôs just that the expectations are still skewed towards one parent to do more in general (it‚Äôs in how we speak and express opinions as well - like giving ‚Äúa mommy a day off?‚Äù types of commentary) and the realisation that in fact, we don‚Äôt need to have lots of kids.¬†

Up to 1965 women didn‚Äôt have a choice, after the pill they did have a choice.¬†
This inifinity. You've basically hit on all the major points. If I could sum it up in a word, that word would be risk.

As women become more educated, and that includes learning about the dangers of pregnancy, which health class doesn't even begin to cover, more women are choosing to opt out because they see that motherhood looks like it freaking blows. I LOVE to see it.

Going back to the risk part. Women risk their physical, mental, and emotional health throughout the whole process of pregnancy and childbirth (ew), both of which are an incredibly overwhelming experience on your body (which is never the same afterward). Then there's the financial health piece where mothers are valued (and paid) less in the workplace vs. fathers who actually see pay increases. Civilization has continued to use women't unpaid labor for centuries, while having the audacity to gaslight us into thinking that pain is our "womanly strength."

Then, of course, there's the invisible work of parenthood, which is downright sexist. Like you pointed out above, men can basically go out living their lives, working, seeing friends, and not being relegated to being a side character in someone else's life. It doesn't matter how progressive your partner, husband, etc. may be, as the women, you will do over 90% of the work in raising the child. It's a thankless job. Maybe you get a pat on the head now and then, but at the cost of everything else. It's downright insulting.

Once you become a mom, you can never go back to not being a mom (at least not in a way that would be illegal or looked down upon in society). The reason why men want children more than women is because they don't really have anything to lose. They don't carry it for 9 months. They can't die during childbirth or sacrifice their health in other ways (over 50% of women have post-pregnancy complications). They don't sacrifice the body they like and feel home in. They are not expected to put their career on hold. They are not expected to put "good dad" at the top of their priorities. They are not expected to give up their free time. They do not have to lose their identity to be a "good dad" in the eyes of society.

You're damned if you do, damned if you don't. I decided years ago that I may as well be damned living my life as I want and choose to as a childfree woman.
I'm a man and can't help but agree with basically everything you said.  The societal expectations of the parents put most of the burden on the mother, when she already has the biological burden of being the one to carry the pregnancy.  I can very much understand why many women are making the choice to be child free.  It was almost inevitable.
And of course, if you do not immediately revert to your pre-pregnancy body and start voraciously begging your partner for sex the next day you will be scorned by your male reproductive partner as well - all you need do is read some relationship advice posts on this website to see the absolute insane expectations men have for their birthing partners.
Also here to mention that women in the U.S. are more likely to be murdered by their male intimate partners while pregnant or shortly after giving birth than to die from the three leading obstetric causes of maternal death.
Hear hear!!
I agree completely. I expected to have kids but I don't want to be a single mother. And that includes all the married single mothers who do 90% of childcare and housework. Even the childfree women I know do all the housework, cooking, and errands for their male partners. 

As a working adult it's hard enough supporting myself and my pets plus keeping house for myself. I can't imagine having to take care of a child on top of that.
All of this is true.  No fucking thank you, indeed!
>I don‚Äôt think the issue is that women don‚Äôt want to reproduce. I‚Äôm a young woman and I get the impression at least half of women like the idea of having kids and genuinely want them. 

> If you‚Äôre a woman who wants to have a kid, you basically need to accept that most aspects of your life will never be the same again and in fact, many aspects will get WORSE. Pregnancy and childbirth can result in many permanent health and bodily changes (for the worse), many women suffer from mental health issues as a result of childbirth trauma and just general post-partum depression, responsibilities still aren‚Äôt divided up equally etc. I still read so many stories about how people‚Äôs female friends just completely disappear when they give birth but their husbands continue living life as normal, continue to go out with their friends at the same frequency as they used to (sometimes even more!) etc.

Not too long ago the father's income was enough to live well, and women could stay at home without that extra worry. Also, yes, woman with kids and the man straying, bringing diseases home. S√≥ natural. A woman who didn't give birth at 30 was "barren", a major offense. Not wanting kids was ungodly.

I don't have the data, but perhaps post-partum depression wasn't as common (though I know it existed), simply because the women were homebodies, the future was laid for them (same husband forever) and not that many lifestyle changes in times when grandparents and siblings were close by. Now not anymore. Today's women worry about back to job, little or no support network, DRASTIC chance in lifestyle forever, the always present possibility of divorce, the getting in shape pressure, the perfect mom pressure... 


Still, many men and women want kids. 

>Edit: I forgot to add that as the world continues to get worse and worse, more people are waking up to the realities of what‚Äôs to come (climate change, potentially another world war) and are deciding to opt out. 

Rightfully.
God dammit this is the truest shit I ever read.
This is extremely powerful and well written. Another compelling argument that women truly are the greater sex.

I‚Äôm a man. I have a daughter that I‚Äôd run thru hell for. These words will echo for me for the rest of my life now.
I don't know, in some of the most progressive and gender equal countries (I am looking at the Nordics) still people dont have kids. I think modern capitalism just makes life too expensive, that people dont think having more then 1 or 2 kids is worth it.
Neither my husband nor I want kids. The true irony is when my husband stated "I assumed I'd be taking an active role in raising and kids I had, and when I put some thought into that, I decided kids weren't for me."

He literally did all the calculations that us women are expected to do by default and came to the same conclusion as me
Oh and lets not forget that a lot of men are unreliable children and straight up leave when things 'get too hard' - i haven't met a dude i trust to not leave me when life vets challenging...thats been my primary pass/fail on having kids.

Good point about the ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù thing, why can‚Äôt be also celebrate ‚Äúmom bods‚Äù?
Barf
> bullies mothers into getting ‚Äúmommy makeovers‚Äù while ‚Äúdad bods‚Äù get celebrated and circlejerked over in the media everyday.

Do you have an example of this, from youtube news there is a lot of stuff about plus size models being so beautiful and related, but i havent come across it the other way around

&#x200B;

> In many parts of the world women still don‚Äôt get any say in whether they reproduce or not

Do you have evidence to support this?

&#x200B;

>for some fucking reason society still expects the child to have the father‚Äôs surname. I mean wow, what a way to recognise the backbreaking labour. A man‚Äôs role in creating a child consists of ejaculation and that‚Äôs it. Why is it HIS name that gets passed down? It‚Äôs not right.

Other than those 2 above things i think i have to agree with everything else you said, and this as well, to me its fair that the child get both surnames and i think thats the case in Mexico or other latin american countries

Also in a lot of cases the women hyphenate but the men do not, but i dont think this is a societal issue, the women can simply say no, the man cant force this, i think most dont care about the surname thing

Its men that still propose, women have all the power in rejection or acceptance, they can say yes i accept but we will both hyphenate and our kids will take both our names
As a single father who has my kid full time, your views and opinions are outdated.
"As a woman, why would you choose to have a kid when it‚Äôs so unfairly burdensome on the woman while the man suffers almost no impact?"

Burdensome vs what?   When you are a 35-50 year old woman, what is it that you'd prefer to do during those years if not have and raise kids?  Marriages can get pretty stale after 5 years, and it's the kids that keep you going and keep things exciting. So if no kids and no marriage. Is it going out and to clubs?   Cuz going out single at that age is pretty sad when everyone is married and having kids.  You'd be like one of those few single old people dancing or hanging out together in a corner of a bar.  Where I live, most our friends are friends cuz we all have kids.  Playgroup moms get together and drink at each others houses all the time, while their kids hang out.  Backyard BBQ's all the time.  You got to the parade with your family friends cuz of your kids.  You go to all your kids sports and hang out with all the other parents.  My wife an i have a pretty active social life and it actually revolves around the kids.  Without them, our social life would be just us and a few other older friends that don't have kids.  Conversation would grow stale very fast.  Hard to meet other people when in a couple too unless you have kids.  It's just weird.
Haha. Really? That is fascinating. I'm going to definitely research that. Women back then even didn't want to have children.
They still have a small preserved sample of the herb you mentioned I do believe kept in the vaults of the Vatican or whatever and won't let anyone near it because it is in fact the only form of birth control that is 100% effective and they need people to keep reproducing. Honestly, they should release it to the science community so they can regrow it again. Since male birth control isn't really being developed outside the condom, women should have an option of never risking pregnancy if they don't want to get pregnant.

That 1-8% failure rate of the birth control we have now is still too high imo. Not to mention the horrible side effects women are just suppose to muscle through and keep quiet about least they inconvenience well men and ruin their lives. They aren't trying to get rid of that lingering failure rate and are doing nothing when it comes to the development of male BC so having a natural form that is side effect free would be amazing.
 not to mention infanticide
Mint is a well known herb that can cause miscarriage, as can clary sage.¬†
To think that we actually have safe tech these days to abort, and forced birth psychopaths try to deny people it
>the Romans famously drive an abortifacient herb to extinction by overusing it.

I read that it's the shape of a "heart" and that's how we got that "symbol of love" from <3
My personal religious beliefs don't force me to have children. I will fight for my religion because I love it.
Also giving birth is a major reason for gender wage gap.
Trumpanzee is an excellent drag! I like that and ill be using it in the future too haha
"most women want kids." Do you have any source for that? Because in today's times a lot of women even those who can afford to have kids aren't having them. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the fact that a lot of women actually don't want to have kids.¬†
For the sake of getting THAT pregnancy out of a woman, they instead get NO pregnancies out of that woman, forever.

Yes. The **married single mother**. The majority of moms make up that demographic. At least in my country of the USA. 

My own mother was that. She wasn't a great mother. But she worked so hard (including paying most bills) while my father did almost nothing in comparison. Couldn't be bothered with childcare even though he was always home.
Then let's hope they don't.
So true
This üëÜüèª right here.
Personally for me even an equal partner could not convince me to have children
üíØwe saw it and we don't want to recreate it. Simple.
I'm interested to see a graph of the increase of sterilisation procedures and drop in birth rates since that date.
Wish I could get sterilised too but in my country you can only do that when you're 35+ or have two kids, and even then with the current policy you will be discouraged until the very end or blatantly refused, unless you have a debilitating medical condition. I recently moved to the UK so idk how that stuff works here. I'm 22 and I'm prepared to get a lot of shit from my family and friends for doing that, especially from my mom. But I've known since I was 16 that any kind of child I'll ever have would be an adopted one.
A lot of women are having this same mindset which is perfectly okay. Having kids is a lifetime job.
Elaborate
Also less mind control.  There is power in numbers  and without a mindless, obedient population  how would they wield their power?

> Put the solution in the hands of the people creating the problem.

I actually enlightened a male acquaintance of mine regarding vasectomies. You know what he told me? He said he will now *lie to women he sleeps with that he has one*. Right after breaking up with an ex because she had baby fever. No desire to actually have one. And he also doesn't do vaccinations, because he *doesn't like needles*.

I really wouldn't trust someone regarding their vasectomy, unless I saw paperwork and/or scars.
Males are and always have been weak. The fact that they cannot  control  their own biological  urges leads to such suffering on our planet: rapes, murder, war, patriarchy. 

The sade fact is when a male in power like weinstein or diddy are exposed, no woman is ever surprised.  

What surprises us is that men can achieve such success and be extremely smart and still Cannot Control thier sexual urges, making them no better than animals  that run on instinct. 

However,  animals do not enjoy humiliation, degradating, destruction, sadism and especially  not  for the thrill of it. Males enjoy the power of controlling and subjugating others.


The üêª always.
My mother was told while in her 30‚Äôs that if abortions had been legal, she wouldn‚Äôt exist. My mom was born in the tail end of The Silent Generation. Her parents were born in the 1910‚Äôs
I know for a FACT I wouldn't be here if my mom had a choice. She reminds me every day lmao
Men want kids more than women because they have nothing to lose, if they get tired of it they can just dip
I think men don‚Äôt want to raise them but are fine with having kids, isn‚Äôt that what traditional roles are designed to provide?
Exactly. Most of my friends were tricked into fatherhood.

How did they have half a kid lol
Oh please, it‚Äôs not easy to just get sterilised, especially as a woman. Please do some research. Many women, even if they‚Äôre 35 years old and already have 3 kids, are denied in case their husbands decide they want more kids üôÑ TONS of women want to get sterilised.
[removed]
Tubal sterilization is the most commonly used form of contraception worldwide. But it is usually women who already have kids that get them.
Been trying to for just under a decade, being bounced around doctors despite it being 100% legal. Doctors are extremely reluctant to give it to you if you're female, no matter the method. You even get a lot of friction getting something temporary like an implant or an IUD. Hell, I even had to fight to get the regular oral birth control which I needed for medical reasons, they wen't, oh, we don't wanna mess with your hormones, what if you want a bayyybe, you haven't given birth yet. The condition that I have causes infertility in most cases and literally needs oral BC to manage it and stabilize the hormone levels. 

Even in private clinics, the doctors are like that, and I'm not in the part of the world where you can frivolously sue a doctor or a clinic for "malpractice" (giving you exactly what you asked for). Even in cases when there's actual malpractice involved, they will be like, yep, we investigated ourselves and found that we did nothing wrong! So, it's 99% not seeing women as full humans capable of making their own decisions and only 1% "oh, what if she regrets it and sues us".

Conversely, I've even spoken to several guys who got their vasectomies at *19-early 20s*. Meanwhile, I'm being dismissed or outright laughed at in my late fucking 20s. The situation is just not the same at all.
Yeah but only 1 or 2 would survive
can I ask why?

Ahhh yes how I should‚Äôve been having kids at 18 rather than going to college. I absolutely would‚Äôve been able to take care of them with no job, no education, and no family. The human brain isn‚Äôt even fully developed until 24 in women & 26 in men but yes BEFORE that is when you should be having children. It‚Äôs almost like y‚Äôall want us to stay barefoot & pregnant. Get a grip.

Man, that's one hell of a butthurt comment, please do more lmao. Nice to see at end of the post you going full unmasking on what you really hate, that being people who are having "mindless" sex, and you stereotyping all childfree people as sex crazed apes
lol, if my mom chose to be childfree I wouldn‚Äôt exist, the same way I didn‚Äôt exist for billions of years prior to my birth. Sex without the intention of children isn‚Äôt meaningless‚Ä¶what an empty and dispassionate way of looking at making love. Not having children isn‚Äôt embracing a ‚Äúme me me‚Äù lifestyle‚Ä¶I think acknowledging that having kids isn‚Äôt what you want to do and not having them is much less selfish than breeding for the sake of breeding.   To reduce women‚Äôs fears to ‚ÄúSex wars‚Äù in regard to birth and child rearing‚Ä¶to deny that women bear the brunt of parenting is a big part of why women are opting out. And lastly, there‚Äôs 8 billion humans on the planet. We aren‚Äôt running out any time soon.
Just because someone doesn‚Äôt have kids doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt care about the future. Some of us do care and worry about the world that the next generation will inherit. There are other ways to help people and give back and be a productive member of society that don‚Äôt involve reproduction. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a good thing when people have kids if that‚Äôs what they really want, and if they have the means to support them. I‚Äôm glad that we live in a time where we can choose. Unfortunately, some want us to go back to the old days.
I'm the same yet receive 100x more attention from men than women üòî
Wish I wasn't bi some days.
You won the lottery
Same but that makes it anti-birth control for me...
You‚Äôre so lucky
Sperm donor usage demographic.
When I suggest a similar thought, people always say I "must already be a miserable person"
It can ruin lives, even if wealthy.  There have been wealthy women who died in labor or had severe health consequences because of pregnancy.  If you think about it, nature really screwed women.  The whole concept of pregnancy and labor is utterly horrifying.  It baffles me that some women willingly go through this.  Pregnancy was one of my greatest fears, but severe PCOS is nature‚Äòs birth control.
Facts.
>It‚Äôs life ruining for anyone not very wealthy

not a huge fan of kids myself, but that's a very very very wrong and negative mindset you have over there.
So every single mother who isn't very wealthy is ruined and unhappy? You genuinely believe that 99.9% of mothers in the world are miserable? What a bizarre distorted belief removed from reality
Even the people who have it regret it. You can check some posts from Autism parenting group.or any other such groups.  They just dont tell openly how much they wish they could go back and stop.
At least for me, on the matrimonial sites that I frequent (sigh), the women there absolutely want children. I'd say the rate is close to 95%+ have myself being sterile as a major deal breaker. 

Now, it could just be that folks that want to get married want kids, but that feels wrong?
Fantastically said. I don‚Äôt have time to address everything you said but the invisible work of motherhood is, from what I have observed, soul destroying. 

What I hate the most is how the divide in labour is so unequal that women become ‚Äúmummy‚Äù to everyone else while men get to keep their identities. I don‚Äôt know how well I explained this so I‚Äôll use an example. If you live in the UK, you might have noticed that a lot of tabloids and newspapers just refer to women as ‚Äúmum‚Äù in their articles. Like ‚ÄúMum of 3 gets hit and run over by drunk driver‚Äù - it‚Äôs always articles where the woman‚Äôs parenting status has absolutely no relevancy to what‚Äôs being said. I NEVER see men who happen to have children being described first and foremost as ‚Äúdad‚Äù. And we all know why that is. When you become a dad, you still get to be yourself, whereas when you become a mother that‚Äôs it, the outside world doesn‚Äôt see you as anything else but ‚Äúa mum‚Äù after that point. 

Why does this happen? Because women still do the vast majority of childcare. It‚Äôs just what‚Äôs expected of us, to the point where if a dad actually does something for the child people comment on how ‚Äúhe‚Äôs babysitting‚Äù. YOU CAN‚ÄôT BABYSIT YOUR OWN DAMN CHILD PEOPLE. It just shows how many fathers just don‚Äôt give a shit. They just had kids so they can say they passed on their genes and that‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt actually have any interest in raising the kids or seeing them develop. 

My dad was like this. My parents are still together but I think of my mum as a single mother because she basically did everything while working a full time job (earning more than my dad may I add). Meanwhile he‚Äôd get home and immediately go on his PC to play games. His only interactions with me were to scream at me if my grades weren‚Äôt good enough (I.e. I got a B on some inconsequential test I didn‚Äôt bother to study for when I was 12 while the rest of my grades were As). He barely talked to me outside of screaming about my grades. We just sat in silence if my mum was out of the room. He didn‚Äôt know a single thing about my friends or anything like that while my mum could list all of them and every fact about me. I doubt my dad could tell you what musical genre I listen to or what my favourite colour is. 

My mum is the one that actually sat with me to help me study for my GCSEs and A Levels. My dad would scream at me and then go back on his shitty online game. If you want me to have 100% test scores across all subjects then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Instead he just left all the hard work to my mother and nowadays has the audacity to brag to people about his daughter getting into a good university. Dude, why are you bragging? You literally had no input in this - it was 100% my mother. 

Sorry for the rant but I really want people to read this so it finally sinks in why so many women are opting out of motherhood. WHY would I subject myself to this after observing the way my parents parented me? I know I‚Äôm not the only one that experienced this. I actually have 2 friends with shitty dads as well that basically got solely parented by their mothers. Oh, that brings me to another thing I hate: how single mothers are bullied by society and incels even though they‚Äôre the parent that actually stuck around. I‚Äôd love to see the same energy directed at deadbeat dads (of which there are too many) or men with a secret second family, but I know it‚Äôll never happen.
100% my mother practically works herself to death to support us and then comes home to cook (my sister and I cook and clean) and my lazy father sits on his fat ass and doesn't do a thing, and then pretends to be a good dad in public. I'm sick of it and next time I'm going to laugh and let everybody know how full of it my 'father' is. A stranger in my own home.
Very well said - I'm with you : )
....not to mention the majority of the domestic burden, as well as also being expected to work. While I think it goes without saying that many moms choose to be working moms, it should also go without saying that it also isn't as "optional" as it was 60 years ago.
Same here.

How many single fathers vs mothers do you know?
Just because you lack creativity and ambition so much that you think the only two things to do with your life in your 30s are a) kids and b)clubbing doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else does
There‚Äôs PLENTY to do in those years! Travel, hobbies, supporting the arts, volunteering, excelling in your career‚Ä¶I‚Äôm in these years right now and I am more content than I‚Äôve ever been. I am deeply in love with my husband, we spend amazing weekends together, all of our friends are either childfree or their kids are almost out the nest. Many of my friends are gay and they arent out here having boring lives bc they don‚Äôt have kids‚Ä¶it‚Äôs quite the opposite. I love hosting dinner parties for my fellow adults, going camping, checking out live music, or dreaming about an upcoming international trip I‚Äôm taking with my friends and husband. I have freedom, extra income, and only my cute little dog to worry about. My mom and all my sisters support my choice to be child free, though they have kids.  My mother in particular loves that I am living a good life without the burdens she had.
I worked on my career, traveled for work and fun, started my own company, mentored a new business student every year for 13 years, made stained glass windows, designed and crafted my own jewelry, drew and published 2 Tarot decks, ran for an hour every morning, went kayaking with my husband on weekends, checked out new restaurants with two other child free couples, and that just top of my head.

The most boring thing I could do was hang out with mums and parents. All they could do was watch their kids, talk about their kids, pay attention to their kids. So mind numbing...

>They still have a small preserved sample of the herb you mentioned I do believe kept in the vaults of the Vatican or whatever and won't let anyone near it because it is in fact the only form of birth control that is 100% effective and they need people to keep reproducing.

The things TikTok makes kids believe
You‚Äôre thinking of pennyroyal, which is a member of the mint family. Regular peppermint or spearmint doesn‚Äôt do that.
Miscarriage and abortion by herbs can be dangerous and can result in death or permanent sterility. It's not popping a pill or getting a shot lime it is now. So while forms of birth control have been around forever, as has abortion, preventative birth control is fairly new.
Yes plants can be very deadly and harmful to us. At the right dose, we get hormesis and they turn into medicine. Good to know about mint. I will keep that in mind.

[~20% of women don‚Äôt want to be mothers.](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7119845)I think there‚Äôs also nothing wrong with acknowledging that there are probably a lot of people that want kids and know it‚Äôs not a great idea or they can‚Äôt afford it.
Just because they aren‚Äôt having them doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they don‚Äôt want them though
Fertility issues are a way bigger factor than people realize
People who want to be parents will always be the majority. That‚Äôs just how being a living creature works. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with not wanting kids, but just statistically it can never be the MAJORITY of people

The birthrate increased
If you want to get sterilized I would definitely ask! I was sterilized at 21 no kids no husband and had no push back other than my obgyn double checking I was still sure! My obgyn performed my surgery too! I thought it was going to be more of a hassle too but was surprised. There is also a list of drs somewhere that will do sterilizations without having met the ‚Äúcriteria‚Äù search it on Reddit or Facebook and it should come up

My mom was born in the 80s and I‚Äôm in my early-mid twenties. She told me that if she could‚Äôve afforded it at the time she would‚Äôve aborted every single one of me & my siblings. I can‚Äôt say that I blame her after hearing the horrors of her life.
That‚Äôs horrible and probably just projection from how she feels about herself tbh. I‚Äôm sorry and am glad you‚Äôre here!
Men are fine with women birthing and raising the children, then pointing at children and saying "those are mine" LOL.  It's such a joke.
How does a man "have"children?

He doesn't.
Not really imo. They give lesser f about social expectations like women, plus they didn't have to fear of getting pregnant and social pressures in general aren't so hard towards them. They don't really want to have kids either, just not fearing of getting preggo makes everything way easier for men.
Edit: Don't know why i'm downvoted... Men just don't have to fear of pregnancy, but they also don't want to make children. I also know more childfree men than childfree women.
anecdotal. As a woman in my late 30s who has dated a lot of guys throughout my lifetime, all the men were the ones pushing to settle down and have children. My friends also experienced the same. Of course, the men were basically man children who expected me to do all the work and also pick up after them (the men) and cook/clean, basically a bangmommy. 

There are MANY men who love the idea of children and a "legacy" but absolutely want no part of the actual work of children, yet still push women to have them.
When you have someone that takes no responsibility for birth control, it‚Äôs hard to feel sympathy.
*average*
Tons what type of women donyou talk to oit of my 29 years no girl ever wanted that invasive sergery and had hopes of a partner. Just one  girl that was a heavy dtinker and smoker said she would want tubes tied. I deep dive in conversations with hindreds of regular people. So no many live just fine regular lives. The body is delicate
I would have absolutely gotten sterilized 30 years ago if a doctor had agreed. But yes, birth control is extremely important for all women
Not true. The numbers from my family history was maybe 20-30% died before adulthood. A really large percentage never made babies however, or got married.
Im sorry that this sub doesn‚Äôt speak for itself for you
U must be one of the people that don‚Äôt have inner dialogue-

The world is painful- life is shitty bc of nature and the systems we live in make it worse
Why forcing someone into this world? Why forcing someone to live ?
Also it‚Äôs egoistic bc the parents do it for themselves and and and so many more reasons
Leave the people off the earth
Don‚Äôt bring them
Into this life
Let them rest
So he‚Äôs full of shit basically lol?
Immigration can‚Äôt explain growth of global population. Unless the immigrants are extraterrestrial
Any amount of money says you'd be happier with a big family and a husband that loves you. There's a reason it's worked since the dawn of man. And look how many women in the US are either chronic alcoholics or on antidepressants/anxiety meds. There's a direct correlation between level of education for a woman and less kids. Its gonna be nasty when the women of this generation hit early 40s and realize they've been scammed.¬†


Not to mention third world women are having 5+ children in literal huts and managing just fine. It's not nearly as hard as they push, not to mention you'd have a family if you picked a good man. Someone hardwired to care for and literally die for you if the need arose.
How do you tell it to stop?
I get your pain honestly :(
I just had a talk with a young lgbt+ woman explaining the dangers of straight women. Emotional terrorist to women willing to date them. She said, I‚Äôm young but I already wasted two years on a straight woman, so that is a lesson I already know.
So sorry, but somehow the forbidden fruit is subconsciously the sweetest, I will pass around the word that men are being weird. 

I hope us males have not made it uncomfortable for you.
Proof that sexuality ain't a choice
I always say if sexuality was a choice, I wouldn't be attracted to men
I wish I wasn‚Äôt straight everyday. Being a lesbian looks so nice.

I did but it would've been better had I been born in a less conservative country :(
They're just jealous that you have the courage to live according to your beliefs and preferences.  Fuck'em.
Miserably counting my money üí∞ and loving it
It depends on whatever factors affect them, such as mental health, finances, child tolerance, etc.

My mom worked and my dad sat at home with his hand in his pants. He molested my sister was inappropriate with me and was a tyrant. He was useless. And all he did was buy porn with my mom‚Äôs money. Thankfully he croaked from a blood clot at 45.

I have been to his grave twice. Once when they put him in it and once 21 years later. He died 35 years ago. He is buried near a highway and in winter it is bleak and cold and gray just like his heart.
I'm sorry you have a crappy dad. I feel similarly about my own father. It wasn't the same as your situation, but he had a stroke in his 50s just out of the blue and became a reclusive, bitter person. Things were obviously a lot harder for him as he is physically disabled, but he still had his mind. There were a lot of ways he could have made everyone's life easier but he basically became a third child to my mom (I was about 11 and my brother was 8). To this day, I resent him so much for how much harder he made my mom's life. She's basically his nurse. She didn't sign up for that. My mom took it all on and did the best she could in trying to keep things normal for my brother and I. She did not always do well, but she did the best with the tools she had. Looking back, I constantly find myself wishing he had died the night he had the stroke. It would have sucked losing a dad that young, but I would have remembered him in a more positive light than I do now. I don't know that I'll be all that sad when he does finally croak (I'm kinda amazed he's still alive as he's not a healthy man, but I know spite can keep people alive for a long ass time).
That's so frustrating to hear about your father. At the same time, it's nothing new. Men have been taking credit for things they have no business or part in for centuries.
I Love this sub.
As someone who works for working moms, the amount of guilt I see on regular basis is beyond gross. There is zero reason to feel like you are missing out on stuff when your kid is literally in school during the day and if you were a stay at home mom you just be at home. It‚Äôs terrible edge sort of like you have to work work so that you know your family can survive but also you can‚Äôt work because how dare you not spend all of your time with your child. But if you do stay home then you‚Äôre considered lazy and you‚Äôre just feeding off your husband and insult you for being a ‚Äúwife‚Äù even when you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs absolutely just a grossest thing and honestly as women like we just can‚Äôt win.
And if they don‚Äôt work, they don‚Äôt have any finances to fall back on if/when their partner leaves them, financially abandons/abuses them, dies, or they want/need to leave their partner.

More than you'd believe, I'm not even the only full time single father in my friend groups.
So what do you do or would you do at that age without kids?
you travel a lot with kids too. Can‚Äôt tell u how many times I‚Äôve been to Disney, the beach, water parks, and at swim meets with them. I have hobbies too. I collect leather books and coins. I walk most days after work and before the kids get home from school. We eat out yo. So I can match you one for one with kids, plus I get all the extra hugs, I love You‚Äôs, and time just looking at them and having cute conversations with them.¬†
Yes please???
Yeah I don't remember where I heard it, it's why I put "or whatever" in my reply so good luck on your journey to find it.

I heard about it back in the 90's so no TikTok.
Yep, that'll work, but if you don't dose it right it can also be "goodbye liver!"
Christianity. I think I have mostly baptist beliefs. The Bible says not everyone is meant to have kids and that's fine.
Wow. You got a point. Seems like an heavily unfair deal for most moms all over the world.

You are absolutely right! And the way they pass that blame onto everyone and everything else is astonishing.  Male insecurity and testosterone  is a deadly miserable  combination

Same way a man has a wife by asserting a possessory right- if by have you mean only gestate and give birth then so far no men have signed up for that and a lot of women have shifted the job to surrogates yet still claim that they have children.
I submit that it harder to tell if a man doesn‚Äôt have children than a woman.
Yeah, there are men like this, on the other hand there are men as well who are repulsed by the idea of having kids. I know way more childfree men than childfree women.
Word salad
English please

This was me. I would have had my tubes tied so long before I did if doctors would have done it. 
But I had no kids, and I was so young I might change my mind is what they all said.
classic reddit, asks someone why they hold a certain opinion and gets insulted for it. this sub came up on the popular page and while i know what antinatalism is i dont have extensive knowledge on why people subscribe to the philosophy.

i certainly agree that life can be very painful, but i would argue that there is an equal amount of joy as well. i would argue its a biological reason to have children not an egotistical one
As I said I‚Äôm not sure where they‚Äôre getting most countries. Is it possible that most countries hover just under 2 but a number are so far above 2 that turn the average to 2.3. The global population can‚Äôt decline till we are under less than 2 kids per partner.
In third world countries like India, population rates were still fairly above replacement.
‚Äúit‚Äôs worked since the dawn of man‚Ä¶‚Äù Yes, because women had no choice back then. And it‚Äôs always benefitted MEN.
Why do I need a man though? And I‚Äôd love to see stats proving literally anything you said about women being happier with a big family.

Do you extend that sympathy to straight men who date straight women?
Hahaha I sure hope you passing the word leads to change, ahah I'm actually laughing out loud that's funny.
It sure isn't. I keep falling for stressful men. My long standing ulcer has now begun to bleed with the last gaslighting BS he did with me. I wish it was easier to leave toxic relationships.
Same with me. It truly is not a choice.¬†
Love this! So true
Ugh then bi brain tells me its only attracted to men because its scared to be sapphic in Texas

So unreasonable. Need a brain transplant
Oh boo to that. I hope you're able to live your life without too much input from outside sources.
Maybe they're jealous, idk. I don't really think so. I think that there are a lot people who want so stubbornly to believe that people who don't want kids (1) surely MUST hate kids (I don't lol) and (2) are inherently miserable, cynical people (I'm cynical for sure but..)

Ppl like to make assumptions, especially when it's a sensitive subject; it is abundantly evident that for some people, it's a triggering, baffling idea to think that procreation could possibly be unethical. How could it be unethical if it's "natural", right? Right????
Or, maybe it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre making a sweeping generalization about something that genuinely brings many people joy, even if it‚Äôs hard
[deleted]
Yeah, that's my point. The idea that only wealthy mothers are happy and every other mother has had her life ruined is hilarious, I can't even take it seriously because you have to be some depressed teenage redditor to unironically claim that
The subreddit regretfulparents.

A lot of parents that regret having children don't talk about it because people will judge you hard, and it's not some mistake you can reverse so they stay quiet about it. This subreddit is a place that parents go to tell their story or seek support.

My god ... I'm so sorry. What a horrible, degenerate piece of filth! I hope you and your sister have been able to find peace.

No money to fall back on but also:

- having missed out on promotions while raising the kids

- not accustomed to newer technology integrated into their work sector

- lacking the confidence to excel in a job interview after having missed out on work for years.

It's rough.
You‚Äôre joking, right? Surely you can use your brain to think of all the things an adult can do that aren‚Äôt raising kids or clubbing.
My goals and dreams are personal to me and I only share them with my partner and my close family. We are coming up on our 5 year anniversary and in the past few months, our relationship has actually experienced a revival - even an uplift - since we moved in together. We‚Äôre excited for our future together. We have so much in common that we don‚Äôt need a kid there just to make sure we don‚Äôt break up.

I‚Äôm happy you and your wife have a good social life but I just think it‚Äôs a bit sad you think there‚Äôs nothing else to do in life but have kids. There‚Äôs so many other pursuits to dedicate your life to. And no, none of mine including clubbing.
You‚Äôre not convincing anyone by bragging about having shit we don‚Äôt want and are actively choosing to prevent lmao. 

I‚Äôm really glad you have the life you want, but you‚Äôd get more respect around here and everywhere else if you didn‚Äôt use your own goals in life to shit on everyone else‚Äôs goals.
So then  go and live your life üôÑ  without telling others hiw to live theirs.

Your  life sounds so pathetic and mundane as compared to someone  who is a world traveler, astronaut, elite athlete

Why dont you go defend your life choices to them?  

Y'all  stop explaining  yourselves to this ignorant  troll. 

You dont need to justify anything.
I don't doubt the existence of the herb. I doubt the conspiratorial shit said about it
So do you think that all the people who fight against birth control and abortion and gay rights and literally anything that's not conservative are not really christian? I ask because they always explain their beliefs as being christian and coming from the bible.
The Bible (old testament I believe; I‚Äôm ex-Pentecostal) also says to be fruitful and multiply which iirc is telling people to have more kids.
Women aren't allowed to have any kind of sexual agency in a patriarchy.  Once you see that you can't unsee it.  Women are finally pushing back against it in a meaningful way and the ultra right is panicking.

No this is not fcking classic Reddit

What the actual fuck?

I think much more and deeper then most people
I hate the internet and these things u describe that are shitty on Reddit

I hate that myself
Why r u using it against me???
U don‚Äôt even understand and just use those things against people when this isn‚Äôt the case bc I‚Äôm on the complete other side

How r u acting like we‚Äôre the sheep‚Äôs???
U are 

It‚Äôs so nonsensical how r u not using that brain of urs?
I don‚Äôt understand this at all
Seriously

There‚Äôs a billion reasons for not having kids

U just wanna fight me rather then using ur brain and ur hands to search on this sub for reasons
Lmao this is embarrassing stop searching for fights
This is one reason why u shouldn‚Äôt have kids
-
The fact that people like u exist that are just pure blind and evil sometimes
That just are Ignorant and wanna  make war rather then love

U don‚Äôt even understand how painful it is to be a live bc u already gave up
‚Äî
The worlds in war all the time
Live is war
Why can‚Äôt u see that pain and feel it and use that to be better urself
??
How r u not getting it how?

Next reason
U force someone into his life
That‚Äôs bad- they didn‚Äôt ask to live
Also we‚Äôre too many people
Everywhere
Cars recources
Killing animals
What not-
Nature everything
Go into ffcing city and u see how we‚Äôre too many
It‚Äôs too much ppl too much things too much crap too less space

Also capitalism
The more we are the more money and capitalism won‚Äôt work - we shouldn‚Äôt need money

And all this shit going on and having to work and what not‚Äî-
Why would u do this to anyone? Why would u born anyone into this????

And if it‚Äôs bc U WANT IT then that‚Äôs incredibly fucking egoistic and another reason

Use ur brain
Not ur ego
classic reddit, asks someone why they hold a certain opinion and gets insulted for it. this sub came up on the popular page and while i know what antinatalism is i dont have extensive knowledge on why people subscribe to the philosophy.

i certainly agree that life can be very painful, but i would argue that there is an equal amount of joy as well. i would argue its a biological reason to have children not an egotistical one. Is the general consensus around here that humanity needs to die off?
There's no stats for common sense. You're comfortable saying these things now bc I assume you're young and pretty. You don't need a man bc you're so used to automatically attracting their attention and benefitting from their proximity. I promise you when a woman's youth and beauty fades and she becomes invisible to the average dude the story changes.¬†


You won't have any children or a husband, your immediate family will begin to drift unless they're in the same boat. All you'll be left with is your material possessions and your surrogate children (pets). I couldn't think of a worse hell on earth, and ofc you aren't going to listen bc the powers that be want you to believe as you do. So there's a great effort going into convincing young women to think just as you do. But ask yourself who has your best interests at heart? Your family members who love you and have no doubt told you close to the same things I am or the "mainstream" culture and academic scene that stand to profit from you thinking exactly as you do.
Ok thanks
Straight men, probably due to species-motivated reproductive imperative, have evolved to deal with straight women. When straight women date women, they wish they could be sexually into it, may even fool themselves,. really they just need someone close by , to build an emotional and supportive bond, with someone who is not going to try to pressure them into anything physically. They want a girl to talk with, to care about their feelings, and to hold them, but they are just healing to build up the courage to date the next man.
i also get ulcers from the stress of relationships. i wish i could live with female friends instead of a man or lesbian partner cause im ace
Work hard to attain financial independence. That‚Äôs what you need most to get out.
you arn't falling for anything

youre attracting all types of men and picking the stressful ones

take accountability for your choices
Tru lol lowkey same but instead of Texas, heteronormativity or my conservative family lmao and I‚Äôm also some form of ace so still figuring it out üòÖ even if I do like guys tho, realistically I can‚Äôt see myself ending w one for many reasons and I might lean girls?
LOL great point.  I personally don't even like children and I really, really hate it that it's expected of women to enjoy them.  I never have.  Do I "hate" them?  No, but I do strongly prefer not to be around them.  

I also love the argument that "it's different when they're your own" - of course it's different, you can't get rid of them!
That's my mother in a fucking nutshell.
Don't forget being financially indebted to a man!
I get it but I rather be in the former position and be able to provide than the latter position, with that one always playing out because poor people most of the time lack the concept of keeping their hands off of each other and mindlessly popping out children all the time.

Yeah but a lot of your time would involve being in an empty house probably watching tv or surfing the web and a lot would be doing just that except with a spouse.
What do you mean by ‚Äúpartner‚Äù?
I‚Äôve traveled much of the world, deal with satellites, and have kids and a father who were elite athletes.
The Bible also condones rape, incest, & slavery. But bans mixed fabrics, shellfish, divorce, and so much more that people don‚Äôt follow at all. The Bible has & will always be about hypocritical cherry picking.
If you say you're okay with gay people getting married that doesn't stop you from being a Christian. If you say that you're okay with abortion, it could just mean that you don't mind abortion which would also not stop you from being a Christian. 

I'm a Christian. I don't mind people insulting eachother online. It's bad but it's not something that I'm super bothered by. It's still wrong to casually insult people all willy nilly, you don't know what kind of an effect your words have on people. But people should be allowed to speak freely.
God told Abraham (and a few others) to be fruitful and multiple for the sake of the kingdom. They also weren't supposed to interbreed with the pagans so that Judaism wouldn't be stamped out.
Women make up 53% of voters. Let's hope they show up to defend themselves from Christian nationalism.
Bro you're the one who mentioned politics. That commenter clearly just didn't understand what you were trying to say, and you chose to clown on them wth
brother i mean this in the most sincere way I can. 

get some fucking help you‚Äôre clearly not well
That shows how much you know. Women don‚Äôt want children because they don‚Äôt want to deal with literally everything while their husbands do nothing. I am almost done with my Masters degree which means I‚Äôll make more money than my husband that I already have.
How many older women do you personally know who don‚Äôt have kids and are desperately unhappy? Or is this a fantasy of yours? I personally can think of 4 childless women in their 50s, 60s and one in her 70s who are not unhappy at all. But many women, my own mother included, wishes she could have experienced life on her own terms without children.
I see, that's what you mean. Not that women can't pressure other women though.

By evolution, what adaptions do you mean? Like the straight man evolved to deal with the straight women, but the gay women haven't evolved to deal with the straight women yet. The straight women treats the other woman like a man, and she doesn't like it.
Your words make me feel heard and seen. I am however sorry you go through them too. They are ridiculously painful. 

I really wish men weren't so egotistical and fragile *on the whole*.
Yeah its all fluid anyways tbh

Brain seems to rule the show, not much choice from me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Plus if you land with no one its better than most guys at this point
100% I don't hate children but I don't like them either. I mean, I'll never disrespect a child or treat them bad but I don't want them around. 

Why ppl get upset when they want to hand over the baby to me and I say no thanks? Why do they get upset if I don't want to play or talk with them? Baffles me, I hate when they think I'm a bad person because I don't like kids.
I told someone the sound of babies crying irritates me and triggers my fight or flight and they said it means I'll make a great mother. Right because if I can't handle hearing random babies in public I should have one screaming in my ear when I'm trying to eat sleep shit and piss
Whose house is empty? The minimalists? And not every childfree person has or wants a spouse. 

Sounds like you have no imagination for anything your life could be outside of parenthood, and that is really really sad and is a bad example to set for your children.
And so what? YOU have absolutely  No right to judge and dictate Other people's  life choices. 

That is the point that you keep missing. You think that your life is so wonderful  but it would be miserable to many others. 

According to your comments then, everyone  here should have the same lifestyle  as you , how utterly  patronizing and small-minded of you.
Please and thank you!
also turn the computer off and go outside, some fresh air will do you wonders :)
Then don't marry a man that's subpar. The greatest part of my life has been raising my children and watching them learn/improve. If you think all men are as bad as the ones you've picked you are mistaken.¬†


Also men do not care how much money a women has. We don't care how much education they have. We are capable of both these things. Men choose women who give us those parts of ourselves that we are missing. That feminine touch, compassion, and patience that we are literally not capable of. And sadly that's the biggest thing missing in modern women. Just as men are becoming more and more feminized, women are becoming more masculine.


I'd also like to argue that more education doesn't always equal a good thing. Some of the vilest and most unhappy people I've met have also been the highest educated. I don't wanna bring Christian teachings where it won't be appreciated but the more importance you put on material possessions the more fleeting and temporary your happiness will become.
Before recently, you didn‚Äôt act gay if you weren‚Äôt. So many people had to act straight even if they weren‚Äôt. How do you build up a tolerance to straight women pretending to be into women, if the punishment for homosexuality is high? Men and women relations are excepted and expected, so men openly had more behavioral exposure.

If you enter a relationship with someone who wants forever, then it is ethically wrong for you to do so, when you know you are not going to be there long. In generalities, women are less sexually motivated, therefore less likely to sexually offend. Recent study about pedos found that women and men are equally affected by pedophilia, where the age of sexual preference stops aging with them once they hit a point, but statistically, women are in a tiny percent amongst offenders. If the options were bear, man, gay woman, it seems straight woman mostly select the gay woman.
Weird how it sounds terrible when a straight woman won't do anything physical or straight up "friend zone" an interested/committed gay woman. But if it's done to a respectful man, not pressuring for anything until the straight woman is ready, then we are evolved for it ands it's not exploitation in any way of the guy.
Got it.
I'm glad we could clear that up.
They are so unintentionally abusive because of their enormous mental and emotional blindspots while being 10x more afraid of not being well received/being a bad person, causing further lashback when you try to approach the situation productively

And you cant even hate them because you see how much it must suck and be frustrating and scary to be them. You just want to help but it feels so impossible, because its like they never did any of the childhood learning that you did.

Sometimes i just want to make them all do lsd or dmt so they can experience ego death and get out of their own heads
I find that people get the message real fast when I say I'm "not comfortable" holding a baby LOL.  I've never had anyone get upset (at least to my face) but I'm pretty sure if I let them know I don't want to be holding their baby, they don't want me holding their baby!!
hahahahaha hmmmm yeah that's some weird logic right there...
No kids and no spouse is extremely sad.
Yet this entire sub is about attacking people for having kids or criticizing their lifestyle. Lol¬†
>Before recently, you didn‚Äôt act gay if you weren‚Äôt. So many people had to act straight even if they weren‚Äôt. How do you build up a  to straight women pretending to be into women, if the punshment for homosexuality is high?

I think tolerance would be built up because mostly straight people had kids, but not homosexuals with each other: so no adaptation.

>If you enter a relationship with someone who wants forever, then it is ethically wrong for you to do so, when you know you are not going to be there long.

For sure

I think this is a different category than emotional terrorist, more physical.
Yes. Perhaps it is true. Because women are much less likely to be rejected in total. Evolutionary, if you get rejected as a women, you are done. Like what cave man refuses free sex? You must be so ugly and it destroys confidence.

But they want to pretend there is equality when everyone is equal only to God. And then say stuff like this when it suits them, but ignore all the problems men face. 

I chalk it up to women (and some brainwashed men) being so sensitive that even talking about the truth hurts. So they would rather stay in a comfortable lie.
What would you say some of those emotional and mental blind spots are?
Facts! I totally get it. Then they won't address their health problems and end up even more stupid in the brain lol.
Thats your extremely  limited  view. Who are you to dictate what another person chooses for thier lifetime?

This. Right here is the messed  up mentality  that allows male government  officials  to make laws governing the bodies of others. This idea that their lifestyle  gives them the right to legislate how others live.

YOU maybe sad without a spouse and kids, but what Right do you have to say that others  would feel the same wayü§î 

Would you say that to the men that choose to not have a spouse  or kids instead choosing to be bachelors foverer? Because society doesnt give them shit about it?

Exactly. You don't get to impose your views on others. Sounds like a troll if ever there was one
If it were you, it would be sad. Because you don‚Äôt want that life. 

For me, being stuck in marriage with kids that I don‚Äôt want would make me die or leave. 

For me, having your life would be sad, because I‚Äôd be sad.
Trollolol.  No its obviously not, its people expressing their opinions. 

But, with a world full of simpleton breeders like you, there's another reason for people  not to reproduce and have a kid either  1. Have to live in a world with people like you or worse 2. Become a person like you!

Go back to claiming how wonderful your life is, maybe ask your wife whose obviously  raising the kids nore than you, how she feels about it.
it really depends on the guy. there is definitely an overarching theme among them all but its hard to pin down what the universal root of it is without getting distracted by neurodivergence or specific personality type stuff. 

A big one that is common though, is that they tend to confuse logic with emotions. They often treat emotions the way you should treat logic and treat logic the way you should treat emotions. What this causes, is nonreaction to emotional sharing, as its all treated like useless facts they dont know what they could do with, and criticism of their logic gets received as emotional invalidation and personal attack or dismissal which is big fuckin danger. It makes even just having casual conversations completely impossible. Its often really hard to communicate this to them as well because they literally just dont understand the difference between emotions and logic, or have solidified the meanings in their brain backwards. You can teach them all the lessons about emotional validation that you want, and they will just apply it to situations of discussing logic, it will never click in their brain how and when to use those skills appropriately.

The few guys i know who arent like this are aware of the difference and how to treat them and can have sane interactions, but dismiss the importance of emotions entirely or only desire to be destructive with emotions.
Kyle MacLachlan joined Letterboxd and gave us Dale Cooper‚Äôs top ten movies
How do we think he‚Äôd react to Blue Velvet? ü§£
Of course Coop's favorite movie is Fire Walk With Me.  It's how he figured out who killed Laura Palmer.
Yes, Suspiria!
Persona!! üñ§üñ§üñ§
I want Dougie‚Äôs Top 10
Suspiria is such an incredible movie
Wait. This is dale coopers picks. And Kyle is in blue velvet. What in the meta ?!
I thought canonically Dale Cooper‚Äôs favorite movie was The FBI Story starring Jimmy Stewart?
I was just reading the Secret History of Twin Peaks, and Hank‚Äôs favorite novel that he left in the book house was Double Indemnity üëÄ

Coincidence? Probably. But still-
Double Indemnity doesn‚Äôt get enough praise.
Original Suspiria made the list? I love Cooper even more now, even if I‚Äôm more like Rosenfield personality-wise.
Being There is perhaps my favourite movie, certainly my favourite Peter Sellers film. I don‚Äôt see it referenced all that often, so I‚Äôm happy to see it here.
He forgot Vertigo
Persona is so fucking good and gets better each watch. So glad to see it get some love.
A lot of these are going straight to my watchlist!
Now we know how Coop spent some of his time in the waiting room/lodge. Seriously, can you imagine if he did watch FWWM in there? Real ‚Äúwe live inside a dream‚Äù moment.
Double Identity, Laura, waitress... I think he is trying to tell us something in character with the titles of these films.
Being There! Dougie approved.
Love Kyle leaning into his Victory Lap Era in recent years. 

Great wine, too.
Being There is a good reference to the Dougie character
Being There?

Suspiria??

Persona????

I love him so much.
If only Coop had just watched FWWM, he'd have solved the case a lot faster.
Helluva list.
Oooooo
He just like me frfr
Sunset Boulevard?
‚ÄúThe FBI Story‚Äù must have lost some prestige for Dale‚Ä¶
Copper watching *Blue Velvet*? It must be a wild meta moment for him!
Undeniably based list.
What's Letterboxed? Perfect choices!
I was so happy to lean today that Kyle and I have the same favourite film, *Apocalypse Now*
Jeesh, I remember watching Rear Window in English class in HS and it just *opening my eyebarrs* to what film could do, mean, signify.

Heck yeah. I'm really interested in Laura, I've heard things about it being a TP inspiration. ;D
Waitress!!! Early Troma is great!!
That‚Äôs a hell of a mix.
Oh I think Coop dropped some clues in there.
‚ÄúLife is a state of mind‚Äù

Dougie Jones:  ^of ^mind
wow, that's a great selection. Seen them all apart from Waitress. Actually watched Being There and Suspiria on the same night after picking them from an 1001 movies book.
The Lighthouse should be on here
I have new profound respect for MacLachlan picking SUSPIRIA on this list.
I always thought Audrey and Donna had a very similar look to them and now I wonder if that is a reference to Persona where the two women also seem similar.

Mulholland Drive has strong Persona vibes too, even more so, but I can't remember, Rita talk much?
Could you send a link I can't find it
I don't get the WAITRESS one. Any clues?
Anatomy of A Murder is not one I have seen or heard mentioned here, not like the others. What's the connection?
Who recs their own movies? yikes
Now I want that scene from Spaceballs where they watch their own VHS to find out where the heroes went, but it's Dale Cooper renting FWWM.

Wouldn't be the weirdest thing to happen in this franchise.
What‚Äôs wild is that‚Äôs not far away from a few plot points in season 3. I love this batshit crazy show
DOOOOD. SPOILER ALERT!?? Ahh, well...
My initial thought, I know he listens to the goblin soundtracks in his car
I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about this movie from social media, now I have to check it out.
Being There is the one that seems the most perfect for Cooper. It makes so much sense that he would get a lot out of that film
[deleted]
What a film! Its setup is relatively simple, but the results are mind teasingly complex. I don't know any film like it.
Being There, 10 times.
Top 10
Top ten...
He likes it because the girl reminds him of Diane.
If that was only in Cooper‚Äôs ‚Äúautobiography,‚Äù there‚Äôs a big chance MacLachlan either never read it or last read it decades ago.
Our taste change over time‚Ä¶
One of my all time favourites
Nonsense it‚Äôs considered to be one of the best films ever¬†
Abrasive, yet secretly tender?
Seems like a Dougie kinda movie
So happy to see Being There on the list
I just saw it for the first time a few weeks ago. I quite frankly have no clue what happened in the last third or so but much like Lynch, I keep thinking about it over and over. The shot of her hospital room with the TV was so surreal and haunting.¬†


I've been meaning to read up on theories. The ending was especially "okay..." for me.
The blue flashes on Laura's face look like a TV, therefore the angel at the end of FWWM represents... the angel at the end of FWWM
*indemnity, though
I‚Äôm starting to think Doppelg√§nger‚Äôs might be a recurring theme in Twin Peaks ü§î
It‚Äôs a social media app for film nerds. Basically a film diary where you can rate and review what you watch and see what other people are up to as well.
[Here](https://boxd.it/uKaAG)
Could just be because of how much time he spends in diners. It‚Äôs also an old pre-Toxie Troma film, so he could just be hinting at Dale‚Äôs weird side.
The hallway scene with Jeffries‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs not a spoiler.  If anything, it‚Äôs an anti-spoiler.  It‚Äôs not like I said who the killer was, I just indicated that the movie reveals who the killer is.  I‚Äôve said as much many times on this sub to try to let people know that if they watch FWWM before watching the series, it absolutely will spoil the central mystery surrounding the original series.

In fact, I‚Äôll even double down:  the 1992 film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me reveals who killed Laura Palmer.  Don‚Äôt watch it if you haven‚Äôt seen the original series!
I'm jealous, wish I could see it again for the first time. Truly visionary in it's visuals and atmosphere. If you like it, I'd recommend watching "Inferno" from the same director after that.
Make sure you watch the original first.
It's great!
Both the old & the üÜï are great! Wildly different, but such a üÜí sendup throughout üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü©∞üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Also a very Dougie Jones pick, tbh.
I think it probably boils down to style. Lots of luscious reds. 

Oh, also, there is an old witch woman and a little boy in the film. Similar to Mrs. Tremond and her grandson. Could be a stronger connection there.
Being There is basically a Dougie movie.
Maybe one of those slots swapped for Awakenings

Edit: oh and you probably have to throw Sunset Blvd in there since we actually have evidence of him watching it
10 times
And play time by Tati
There is a resemblance. But I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on what it is
Maybe after spending all those years in the Lodge he needed something a bit weirder.
He did record the audiobook though didn't he?
Kinda. Though I like to think of myself as being more like Rosenfield trying to be Cooper.
Chill out, it was a ruse...
I saw a special screening of it in theaters recently and if you ever get the chance, take it. Seeing it on the big screen is magical.
Thanks for the suggestion! I have to admit, Italian movies are just a total blind spot for me.
Definitely watch Inferno but then drop the Three Mother's trilogy like a bad habit after. Argento does have good movies after Inferno, but the next Three Mothers movie is sooooooooooo bad.
You mean the original, right?
And one of the Monsieur Hulot films
It's driving me crazy. Gosh Dern It!
Richard, Linda?
Poe‚Äôs Law strikes again‚Ä¶
I got to see it with Goblin playing the soundtrack live during the movie. It was incredible!
We have a local bar that has a big screen and I got to show it to my husband for the first time there. (along with possession which is an entirely different beast to get into) it was my first time seeing it in that format and it was almost like seeing it for the first time again üò≠
If you like it, be sure to check out Deep Red too. Same director, same weird tone, same band doing the score, they make for an awesome double feature.

I don't think it would be a stretch to call Dario Argento Italy's David Lynch.
Be warned: the dubbing will be bad. In Italian cinema back then, they always recorded the audio after shooting.
The poster in the post is the original, so of course I'm talking about that. The "same director" who did Inferno is also Dario Argento and not Luca Luadagnino, so I thought that was obvious. That being said: I love the remake too because it's a very different reimagination in style and feel. The original is super colorful and vibrant while the remake is bleak and cold. Love that. Both great movies!
Ohhh yes. I went to high school with Linda. I heard she dumped that dead beat Richard. Left him in some seedy motel room with a note
Possession is amazing!
Deep Red is my favorite even over Suspiria.
Really? Argento has made some bangers but most of his movies are intentionally meaningless art-trash. He‚Äôs more like horror John Waters than David Lynch
I've avoided the remake like plague. Not a fan of that director lol.
I feel like Argento isn‚Äôt really trashy to that degree (at least for his first couple decades) he‚Äôs more like the Brian De Palma of horror, although De Palma has made some horror himself. If someone was gonna be the John Waters of horror I‚Äôd think more like Lucio Fulci.
I'd definitely say he is closer to Waters than Lynch.
Well, your loss. It's a fantastic movie.
I did that aswell for a long time. However - i may think its even better than the original
True, trashy isn‚Äôt quite right. Maybe pulpy would be a better word?
Yeah, pulpy‚Äôs right. I described Suspiria as proper pulp art cinema after seeing it the first time week ago
A cool couple of people promoting human extinction at a random market in portland
I love it so much seeing stuff like this in the wild makes my heart warm they were pretty friendly. 

They even gave reasons for why every natalist excuse for wanting a kid is terrible and alternate ways to satisfy those urges 
That‚Äôs not just a cool couple. The man sitting on the chair is Les U Knight, a literal AN legend
They make a good point. I really like that they offered alternatives. Very well thought out. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to argue well against their points. I appreciate that they promote adoption and community service, such a good idea. They really promote taking responsibility for oneself, like the point about doing great things with your genetics instead of waiting for the next generation to do so, or the point about dealing with regrets and leading a fulfilling life instead of living vicariously through your children. I also like the idea of donating blood to spread your bloodline instead.
Breeders love to call antinatalists selfish for not wanting children, but if you ask them why *they* had kids, the answer almost always starts with, "I wanted..."
Vhemt are the OG antinatalists. I've talked a few times with Les on FB. He's a lovely chap
may we live long and die out üòä i love this
Nice to see antinatalism in the wild.
I wanna be friends with them
They get it.
Amazing. Where was this?
I love this. Thank you for sharing.
Extremely based. Wished their merch page was working, I‚Äôd wear the fuck out of that shit.
Love this so much
I got emails from this organization when I was dialing into AOL.
I love this. At my local fair a couple weeks ago there was a whole pro life booth, huge posters w pictures of fetuses that said shit like, "I'm not a CHOICE, I'm a HUMAN BEING", about 15 feet away from a scientology booth. I nearly lost it but just settled for the most disgusted look I could muster. I'd love to talk to these people lol.
He is a super nice man.
I'm surprised they're older, I was under the assumption mostly younger folks were anti-natalists. btw I love your username lmao
Omg I love this ü§£
What's in that jar? Condoms?
The world can‚Äôt support our population.  Not breeding isn‚Äôt the path to extinction, overbreeding is.
Where‚Äôs the flipside? I wanna read more of it
I love them both ü•∞
First time seeing these two people and I love them already.
Guess I'm pro-extinction.
When I saw this post and read their list of reasons I thought "hell yeah, I agree" but I was afraid of finding out people in the comments were mocking the couple. 

I didn't realize I was in this sub. It was a relief. Let's stop having children please.
Looks like Portland Saturday market. It's open every weekend, more civic centerpiece, less random market.
Goddamn legends ü´°
This is the exact reason why I‚Äôm on this sub! <3
I really want to have a deep discussion with them . It‚Äôs good to see even old people appreciate antinatalism .
They are there every year, saw them today too.
If you don't want an extinction event, do I have bad news for you...
I'm 100% all for this
If Portland Oregon then there was an Indycar race there this weekend. Maybe even more people to hear the message of not breeding.
Shoutout Hawthorne üî•üî•üî•
This is great. Where can we donate lol
That worksheet is amazing
Oh my god they are still active! Remember I found them as a teenager around 20 years ago. Amazing!
This is the first thing I‚Äôve liked about Portland in a long time.
Love it. Can we talk about that first "real reason"? It seems harsh especially given that it's the first statement. Is there a better response?
Bold of them to assume most breeders can read
I just saved this!
This is gold
King and Queen!
Dang, I hate finding out about this stuff the day after. Wasn't expecting to see a post like this so close to home. Guess I'll mark it down for next year and hope I get to see them! Did they have anything coo for sale at the market?
Lol would have never thought i would agree with this lol
Doing God‚Äôs work. And look at that that guy in the chair. Grinning ear to ear
Not all heroes wear capes!
I fucking LOVE this
This is brilliant 

Wouldn't be able to do something like that where I am though but mad props to them for doing that
Although I agree with literally everything on that chart, the middle column does come across as condescending or hostile at times. 

Like, although I would love to see that, and say those exact things, calling someone racist isn‚Äôt exactly the way to get them on your side, in fact it sometimes makes them dig there heels in more. 

Still though, it‚Äôs inspiring to see this. I‚Äôm glad for the alternatives list.
I feel alot of ANs are truly caring people
The website is from the 90s lol but lots of good content - vhemt dot org
they look like such kind people too
I'm doing my part.
Sigh sometimes I think the only real choice human society as a whole has is the choice to choose how we decide to end it all, or just letting nature run its course and end us ultimately anyways. Tbh I think it will be the latter lol. Most people when it comes to reproduction just don‚Äôt put too much philosophical thought into it.
Amazing üòÇ
love it, kinda inspiring ü§≠
where is the other side of the page ?
‚ÄúThank you for not breeding‚Äù
so cool!! love to see it
My kind of people
you can be anti natalist & not want humans to become extinct though.
I actually like the idea of donating my blood to pass on my bloodline. I'm not sure if anything works that way. But it might help me to actually remember and make appointments to donate blood.
Extinction? Hardly. 8 billion people is going to take  all g time to go extinct. Last I checked, humanity did fine when there were only 1 billion people.
They look so cool
Not gonna lie, they have valid points here üòÇüòÇ
We love you Sir Knight
If I was there and saw this stall I would not believe my eyes I‚Äôd be so happy
Hey I saw that today too, was really confused
What these people did to Homer, Monsters!
I saw this group a year or two ago! One may say that they‚Äôre keeping Portland weird but honestly? They‚Äôre getting the point across.
Legend
Let them cook
‚ú® They‚Äôve got a point. They‚Äôre icons, they‚Äôre legends and they are the moment ‚ú®
I read "at a human market" lol
The natalists are going to freak out about this
Exactly what I needed to see
My type of folks
More power to uncle and aunty üí™ üôè üôå.
I remember them from when I lived in Portland.  I had some condoms, with the slogan, that I got from there.
You gotta love it
Im 4 it!
Wow I love this ahahah 

Gives me hope
Need this print out in my life üòÇ
Is this on a website somewhere? I would like a more readable copy!
I like the message, where I'm at there are more oopsie babies than 3/4 of the population wants to admit. Lack of sexual education and access to resources is by design here too.¬† Oh, "pregnant and scared at 17.. Don't worry, the lord will provide, honey"¬†
I love the chart debunking all of the arguments. They clearly are intelligent. I would love to stumble upon these people and have a conversation with them.
That‚Äôs cool but did they need to make their logo IngSoc from 1984 üò≠
I think that if you are religious, the bible says something like, go forth and multiple, and you will live forever in heaven, but if you are not religious, you live, maybe have some fun, suffer and die, so Non breeding makes sense. If we had food replicators and the technology to live for as long as you wanted, maybe it would be ok to have kids?
Beautiful
This is so so so amazing!
Bravo for them !! ü§© I love it !
They make such fabulous points. I want to send this to everybody I know
Lol love the note "why breed?"
Can someone tell me whats on the paper?/nf

I wanted to read it but its very tiny

EDIT: nevermind I (think?) found a pdf [Why Breed? - VHEMT / why-breed-vhemt.pdf / PDF4PRO](https://pdf4pro.com/view/why-breed-vhemt-31623e.html)
Just rent kids
Some are good points, some are very Big distorsion of the initial whish and then the solution given is unrelated. Donate blood? How does that continue your bloodline since the donated blood vanishing from the system and that doesn't make the person related to you
It‚Äôs good to see Les Knight and VHEMT still doing activism. It‚Äôs not exactly the easiest thing to advocate antinatalism and voluntary extinction in a society like this.
I am not particularly antinatalist although i dont want Kids, but most of these just feel like sassy gotcha that wouldn‚Äôt work on someone who actually want Kids. Also it doesn‚Äôt dismiss the root reason of all of them which is "i want to".
I love the Voluntary Human Extinction Project! Good to see them out there!
it is inherently selfish to conceive - my favorite thing to tell people that makes them upset lol
I was worried the feminine-presenting individual was Nina Paley, a vehement transphobe. I hope Les has severed all ties with her, other than continuing to use her artwork (which is shown on those posters).
This is probably best for the planet. I won't have kids. I might adopt.

Reminds me that I saw a YouTube video with someone I enjoy recently with one of those sorts shirts. I'm gonna go wild today trying to remember who
There is a book series set in the ‚ÄúBobiverse‚Äù where one Robert Johansson has his brain uploaded to a self replicating space drone.  He also has a lot of dealings with all the humans still on earth. 

One of the antagonist of this series is a terroristic group called ‚ÄúVehement‚Äù  that advocates for the voluntary extinction of human beings, but as willing to ‚Äú help us along‚Äù if we take too long doing it. 

I‚Äôm not sure if that was a reference to this, or just an odd coincidence.

That list had me cracking up but it was all mostly true anyways

These people have come up with a solution.
The fact that it's a satire of people seriously making others have kids even when they can't afford to or want to makes you realize which side is actually standing for the wellbeing of humans

The solution of ordering a custom doll for people who want a mini me is actually good advice. 
I'm was once into ball joint doll collecting and you really do get the sense of fulfillment with ordering or making outfits and customizing the doll's face/eyes and such. It's a huge community for artistically inclined people. I don't know if any of us actually wanted a "mini me" human child but you can see the family resemblance in usually one doll in the collection

That is soooo Portland. Reddit is the effing because bomb.
I see it was continued on the other side! I wanna see it lol.

I wanted to add one reason that i didnt see on the paper that i hear breeders say often these days (my age, 25.)

Their reason, "I need some strong sense of responsibility in my life." To me, thats a nice a variation of "I had kids so i didnt kill myself."

Real reason, *they dont even know how to live for themselves.*

Alternatives, get therapy and find a good hobby worth dying for?
I'd drink the Kool-aid.
u/toxictiddies420 can you share the other side also. I love this
I love living in Portland. ü•∞ Lots of wonderful, like-minded folks.
People who don‚Äôt reproduce will be replaced by those with breeding kinks.
VHEMT strives for an Earthly utopia devoid of humans. 

It's not AN as such, but hey, since they're advocating for people to not breed, they're a pretty decent ally.
interesting
i often wonder what the world would look like if people weren‚Äôt pushed to have kids
I have terrible arthritis - 6 joint replacements and 10 back surgeries. I don't want human extinction, I just don't want to pass along my fucked up genes.
When I first saw this my initial reaction was not good. However their reasoning is based on sound logic. I have 3 kids and want grandchildren one day but these folks made me think. My wife will tell you that isn‚Äôt easy. üòÑ
I found my people
Ridiculous people
These kind of people and their virulent pseudo psychoanalysis make this group look like nutjobs
Next level starts.
Some of these suggestions don‚Äôt make sense. Saving money for retirement makes no difference if there are no young people to pay to care for elders or maintain society. I don‚Äôt really care if people support human extinction through voluntary population attrition but they need to be realistic about it: it means the last people on earth will be suffering in collapsed economies. There won‚Äôt be food, utilities, healthcare or any creature comforts because everyone remaining will be too old to produce or maintain them. It will be a lot of old people dragging themselves around through filth and decay until they die.¬†
Yep, they're pretty rad.
lmaoooo ‚Äúdonate blood to pass on bloodline‚Äù
What the actual heck? Some people just want to have children. No hidden agenda. Idk why it's such a hard concept for yall to understand. Why so obscure with what comes out of someone else's body? Holy hell.
This entire subreddit is insane lol.

Nothin' to do but folk and fish and the fishin' ain't no good.

Honestly anti natalists should start with themselves by killing themselves. Pathetic losers.
Okay, now I want see the opposite of this.  I used to be a teacher so it‚Äôs turned me completely away from kids. üòÇ
They're both old & ugly. Lol
I‚Äôm not anti antinatalist, actually discovered this word here and now. For some reason this showed up on my feed. I have a daughter.
HOWEVER I love this hahaha I think it‚Äôs both hilarious and true. Maybe hilarious because it‚Äôs true.

What a weird fucking sub that came on my page
BOBIVERSE!!!!!!!
Renting a kid from a talent agency to pass as their own kid is deception and would just hurt their ability to get a promotion.


They should have suggested that the employee can just work harder since they have less burdens to deal with at home and the spouse can also work to get more income thus getting a promotion may not be necessary for a good quality of life.
I can hardly wait till the earth is void of all living sentient creatures and it becomes just another lifeless rock drifting through the cosmos awaiting its eternal destiny to be swallowed up by the sun.

Those alternatives don't look voluntary
Nothing against promoting a philosophy, I simply find it disgusting to do so while misrepresenting the opposing side. 

At least do your due diligence of steelmanning the opposing argument.

Not only is this just dishonest practice, its also deeply hurting the sake for antinatalism.

I presume the goal of setting up camp is to convince people of your case: by misrepresenting and somewhat ridiculing the other side, you will only attract people who already agree with you. You also just create a bigger divide and hostility between both positions. 

People who might be on the fence or have some capacity to think rationally will see right through it and be pushed away from your message just because of your lack of integrity and inability to communicate with intellectual honesty.

You're hurting your own case with this behaviour.

Its fine to be somewhat dramatic with eyecatching and thought provoking imagety and slogans, but its not fine to straight up strawman and misrepresent the opposing side. Its never fine; not when natalists do it and not when antinatalists do it.
Weird
So portlandia is coming back?
I LOVE the list that calls people out on their bullshit reasons for having kids. 

I've not yet seen a single person who didn't have purely egoistical reasons, which means they're unfit to raise a kid, but do it anyway of course.
The real reasons have bad arguments. Oh it‚Äôs ego. You have to argue why it‚Äôs not good to have kids. You have to say life is bad and they didn‚Äôt choose it. If the central point is just an ad hominem attack at the person wanting kids no one will care
Lol now I have seen everything.
the why breed paper is really low iq stuff lmao
I think it would be better if they dont make population control sound a nutcase cause‚Ä¶
Given reason: ‚ÄúI just love children!‚Äù

Real reason: ‚ÄúOut of touch with inner child, and with existing ones.‚Äù

A couple of people not having kids isn‚Äôt going to make humans go extinct. Lmao
what about, ‚Äúi want to share the gift of love and life with another conscious being to create yet another conscious being of infinite possibilities that will someday hopefully wish to do the same, or not! i don‚Äôt care, and i don‚Äôt care because i care! doesn‚Äôt have to make sense to you to make sense to me‚Äù

Uh.
I hate the way people throw out, ‚Äúadopt or foster‚Äù as if that‚Äôs not a huge emotional and traumatic thing to rely on.
Shouldn‚Äôt animals be kept from breeding also?
The alternatives listed on that sheet are wild. ‚ÄòRent children.‚Äô Yeah no, don‚Äôt do that.
And why *ought* we listen to these people? I'm willing to bet their morality/epistemology is based purely on harm reduction. If that's the case and a loving couple wants to have a child for the sake of loving it, is that not causing harm to that couple by forbidding it?
‚Äûbut my child could cure cancer!!‚Äú so could you.
‚Äûwe need to breed kids who care about the climate‚Äú so the responsibility doesn‚Äôt fall on you? Also that your child specifically would be the one who magically finds a solution to climate change isn‚Äôt very realistic. More kids will just mean more emissions and resources used
So is this belief like Ultron? I.e. ALL life must die? Or is it only Humans that deserve extinction?

Additionally, do not most of their "real reasons" also apply to their own beliefs? Is it not pretty egotistical for you to decide and believe an entire species deserves to die out?
I want a sex trophy.
Relieved that my reason for wanting kids isn‚Äôt on the list. 

It can absolutely be achieved with adoption, but I want to pass on my morals and lessons I‚Äôve learned to the next generation. I believe the best thing I can give back to the world is a good person
They should think about taking one for the team.

Lol what in the world. The Diogenes reference is insane. I mean yeah he didn't have a lot of hope in finding a rational man, but he wasn't advocating for the extinction of humans. Wtf... this is like textbook anti-intellectualism; quoting some long dead figure, out of context, to promote nonsense.


Kyle Rittenhouse did something similar on his website. I'm not sure if it's there anymore but his homepage had a Malcom X quote on there. This reminds me of that, like wtf
This is actual parody from the book series "bobiverse" by Dennis E. Taylor.  
From the acronym VEHEMENT and everything. 

They are not serious about this.
It‚Äôs saddening how instead of thinking about colonizing other planets, curing cancer, achieving immortality, making life better, expanding our understanding of the world, and advancing science, we want to make ourselves go extinct. Pathetic.
Such a strange cult. It's one thing to privately decide not to have kids. Actively campaigning for the end of the human race is some next level mental sickness, though.
That‚Äôs fucked
Wow wow wow some loony people around.
This is so insaneüò≠

How about "continuing the human race"? I think that's the most obvious reason but it's not adressed.

Exactly, I don't hate children. I definitely think the ones already here deserve a loving home and a good life. I just don't think more of them should be created. I rely on plasma for my medicine, so the donating blood thing hit close to home. I call it my life juice. Those who rely on donations definitely appreciate everyone who donates.
Donating blood is great and noble but it doesn‚Äôt pass on your genetic traits, which is the idea behind ‚Äúbloodlines‚Äù. If someone is truly concerned about the health of the human race, then they should focus more on preimplantation genetic testing to optimize ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù genes prior to IVF treatment. It‚Äôs actually a pretty great concept but probably bit expensive (and controversial) for a person without significant genetic defects to be doing when planning for a family
>I really like that they offered alternatives.

Not here to debate AN or not I ended up here because of a cross post. I just want to point out that they may be "good" alternatives, but as someone who isn't AN alot of this reads as straitgh up hostile.
They're not making philosophical arguments, there's no need to argue against any points. It's a premade funnel for different common bad reasons for birth. If they were presented as actual AN arguments they would all just be bad strawmen. Though tbf those are quite popular here anyways so who knows
yea except donating blood does absolutely zero for your blood line lmao
You can literally live a fulfilling life and do great things while also having kids, the people who made that list are just being ignorant
>appreciate that they promote adoption

Supporting adoption doesn't make any sense if the goal is extinction. By this logic, everyone could have as many children as they want so long as they put it up for adoption and adopt other kids in return.

>They really promote taking responsibility for oneself, like the point about doing great things with your genetics instead of waiting for the next generation to do so, or the point about dealing with regrets and leading a fulfilling life instead of living vicariously through your children.

Having children doesn't and shouldn't stop you from doing any of this.
Well they definitely can't say "my kids wanted..." because then that wouldn't make sense and their heads would explode
Most probably are not even aware of their subconscious urge to reproduce much less have it under control ‚Ä¶ more accurate probably if they started their answer with ‚ÄúI needed‚Ä¶‚Äù sigh ‚Ä¶ and so this cycle continues sigh
Not having children is the most positive environmental impact you can have. Nothing can offset the impact of additional people in our industrialized societies.
[removed]
This is the key question, and if they did think about it, which I think the majority don't, it will be how the kid is going to make their lives better.
Me and all my siblings are accidents lol. My mother definitely did not want us. I can‚Äôt imagine what she would say to someone like this
I asked a close family member why they did and they responded, 'I felt unfulfilled in my life'.
How else would the answer startüò≠
Where do you see them call people selfish
When you cut off their response like that you cut out any actual context.

Is someone selfish if they donate hundreds of Christmas presents to poor children every year and when asked why they do it they said ‚ÄúI want‚Ä¶ to let children know that they are loved and valued just for being who they are.‚Äù

Of course people do stuff because they want to do it.  But just because they want something doesn‚Äôt mean there is anything wrong with that.  If someone runs into a burning building to rescue a child and when asked why they say ‚ÄúI wanted that child to not burn to death‚Äù, are you really so cynical that you see that as a selfish action by that person just doing what they want?  They didn‚Äôt even ask that child if they wanted to burn alive or not.
>but if you ask them why they had kids, the answer almost always starts with, "I wanted..."

What? That is quite literally how a motivation works. I donated to a homeless shelter. Why? Because I wanted to help the homeless. How selfish üòî
Stumbling across the VHEMT website 27 years ago was a big deal to 14 year old me. It was the first time I realized that there were other people out there that saw it the way I did.
At least when we die we won‚Äôt be worrying about the trauma our deaths will cause our kids
I certainly hope for ANs, except the first part (:
Yeah these guys and Stop Having Kids are out there putting in the work!

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a CHOICE, I‚Äôm a HUMAN BEING.‚Äù 

All the more reason not to bring them into this messed-up world where they are guaranteed to suffer and die. A lot of ‚Äú‚Äùpro-life‚Äù‚Äù slogans actually make good points for antinatalism.
Yeah they had condoms with endangered animals on the boxes
I'm gonna ask my bf if he wants to use the polar bear or cheetah condoms tonight lmao
FINALLY! 

This is THE most screamingly obvious fact. I don't know why almost everyone's kneejerk reaction to it is to try to deny it.
if we didn't breed, all living humans would die of old age and we'd go extinct.

Yeah, maybe that one could be moved near the end. It's not really a common justification, or if it is, it's not something that most people would say out loud thinking it's a good argument.
Are you referring to ‚Äúunexamined motivations‚Äù? Genuinely curious in what way that is harsh. Here to learn, just curious :)
They are blinded by cognitive dissonance, that‚Äôs for sure.
Most of the smartest humans in history were breeders...
We‚Äôll be at Clinton SF 9/7 Belmont SF 9/14 Sunday Parkways 9/22. Be great to see you there.
Limited space probably drove them to being blunt about it but ya, I agree, people are going to get defensive.
I read it as a way for me to better defend my own choices rather than as a way to proselytize to others.


So if/when someone says, "but don't you want to carry on your bloodline?" now I'm better able to articulate, "I see nothing special about my own bloodline and often find that others who care about their own bloodline tend to have a racial superiority complex."
Unless you're a natalist, or aren't comfortable with the idea of allowing humanity to die out. Then, you're a selfish monster.
Do you think ANY OTHER LIVING THING does? No.
the fact that our species has reached 8 BILLION is extremely problematic. when animal populations start hitting the thousands, humans are quick to want to cull and reduce the numbers. 

it‚Äôs insane to think that humans are still trying to reproduce and grow the number. like you‚Äôve got to be insane to think our resources and environment can handle this. forested areas have been depleted by 90%, how are we going to stop that from hitting 100%? the answer is no more breeding!

Not really. Doing something as catastrophic as bringing a new child into this world just because you ‚Äúlove children‚Äù really does imply that you‚Äôve got a weird take on that love. 

If all it is is that you love kids, wouldn‚Äôt it be more logical to adopt children then? I mean I love dogs but the very first thing we did when we got ours is we got them fixed. You don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúI like these and I‚Äôm making more‚Äù.

So there‚Äôs either an issue inside of yourself that needs processing or you‚Äôre just not connecting to the children already in your life and you‚Äôre bringing more in hoping that next time‚Äôs better.
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about buddy. Good job, you caught on!

I'm so confused, can't be real.

What's cultish/brainwashed about it?
the dude didn't even talk to me until I started asking him questions so pretty hard to brainwash the willing. Also if you're easily swayed by just a booth being visible then you shouldn't really be having kids with that intelligence level anyways.
Humans would destroy other planets like we have earth. We are leeches and need to die off
Extinction is not necessarily a bad thing if you are not aware of it. How much did you care about the future of humanity prior to your birth? And how much do you think you will care after you expire?
Why is not wanting children to be put in harm's way and promoting caring for the people who already exist a form of "mental sickness" to you?
may i ask why?
My favorite part is they list people wanting children as driven by ego....what's more egotistical then waking up one day and deciding "Boy I have figured it out! The entire human race should not exist. Every single human should die out."
I know that this will be ill received in this subreddit but you nailed it. It's not about making this decision alone. It's the fact that they are building a community with eachother. They get the gratification of believing these things because they are no part of a growing group of people they consider "family". It's the new Flat-Earth and soon I hope some of these people will realize that before they alienate themselves from people who actually care about them.

  
The internet brought us unlimited communication. People need a sense of "having a tribe". That can get formed from radical ideas easily because it pushes the idea that they know all these things that the vast majority of society doesn't....even when it seems so ridiculous, it feels empowering to know something that most people don't "know". Their little group grows and they are reinforcing the idea that they are right. Sadly, they don't realize that the community they built is a facade based around having a common thinking group of people who are "superior" in their new knowledge. And like every online "group" that grows like this, the thing they gather around doesn't matter, it's that they are together.
Please refrain from asking other users why they do not kill themselves. Do not present suicide as a valid alternative to antinatalism. Do not encourage or suggest suicide.

Antinatalism and suicide are generally unrelated. Antinatalism aims at preventing humans (and possibly other beings) from being born. The desire to continue living is a personal choice independent of the idea that procreation is unethical.  Antinatalism is not about people who are already born. Wishing to never have been born or saying that nobody should procreate does not imply that you want your life to end right now.
exactly
Why does the human race need to continue? What exact reason is there to say it is necessary or beneficial that humanity continues to exist?
Denying who? The future generations don't exist and if nobody creates them never will, so in turn cannot be denied anything. It is those who have children who are allowing more people to be denied enjoyment.

You cannot deprive someone who doesn't exist of anything, because "they" have no needs or wants.
To create a person is to create needs and wants - which have no guarantee of being fulfilled.
They must have read the Bobaverse series (by Dennis E. Taylor).  Or maybe Taylor heard of this group?  Either way, it made my day to see this.  If you like nerdy, funny, sci-fi, I would recommend the series--especially as an audiobook for long road trips.  

That having been said....regardless of capitalistic societies screaming about low birth rates, the Earth has plenty of people.  Live if you want.  Exit if you need to.  So long as you aren't an a-hole and take others out against their will, end of the day it is your life to live or not.

So you want us to go extinct but expect people to donate blood to keep you alive?
Bless your soul. I hope you find your way.
It absolutely spreads your life force. Is that really that different from reproducing and having the genes themselves passed on. Both are temporary; I think not.
I feel stupid for mentioning donating blood to spread bloodline lol it sounded like a cool, good idea at first
Yeah this first one isn't an alternative, it reads like sass mixed with threat.
it's not very good rhetoric
My favorite part is that I read almost this exact same list in a Zero Population Growth propaganda pamphlet from the 1970s when I was researching immigration at the Carter Presidential Library.  Truly, no need to update something when it was perfectly insane in the first place
A lot of the answers are sarcastic, the first one for example. Or the "have a white picket fence installed".

The reason is nonsensical, so the retort is equally nonsensical.
My dad genuinely believed that souls DO want to be born and choose their parents. He believed he was infertile due to a childhood accident and thought I was a miracle baby. This was backed up (only in his mind of course) by the fact he had lots of unprotected sex in high school with no issues until he knocked my mom up on the first date.
How about: ‚ÄúI believe my kids will be happy and will want to have been born and get to enjoy all the things that come with life; as I have gotten to do thanks to my parents. I want to pass along the blessing that is life so that others get to enjoy it too‚Äù

If not for the continuation of humanity, what are we protecting the environment for?  

The earth will be perfectly fine no matter what humans do to it.  There are constantly multiple species dying off as new species emerge.  Give the earth 100,000 years or so after humanity dies off and anyone looking would have to search extensively to find much of any sign that human civilization ever existed here, but there will be countless species of plants and animals.

Right? I would hope the first answer provided with someone having kids is because they want their children lol
I've *personally* had several people with kids or who wanted them call me selfish for not wanting them.¬†¬† When I asked why *I'm* the selfish one, one of them said that kids are "a woman's purpose," and that by not wanting them, I was "part of the reason for the decline in population."
Was it a Saturday possibility?
i can‚Äôt believe this comment paired with this post is real. like this has to be the internet specifically generating a hilarious moment just for me
> plus size thrift store

So much personality fit into this
Hawthorne street fair is not a random market lol, it's one of the largest street fairs Portland has every summer.
As a woman they convinced me because why would I want to have choice? I‚Äôm a woman after all people impose themselves on me all the time why shouldn‚Äôt _unborn_ people do it as well? Logic /s
So you live in absolutes.  It‚Äôs either all or nothing.  In 1900 there were 1.6 billion people.  In 2000 it was 6.1.  In 2023 8.1 billion.  

It took about 125 years to go from 1 billion to 2 billion.  50 to go from 2 billion to 4 billion.  50 to go from 4 billion to 8 billion.

There is a finite amount of space and resources.  So many people live with water, food and shelter insecurity now.  What happens if we don‚Äôt stop and reverse the population growth?
Thank you

You're overestimating people if you don't think none would say so out loud, and even show pride on it.
It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúInstitutions await those who cannot control their biological urges.‚Äù Insulting people that you are trying to convert is not a great way to start off the flyer.
And so were some of the dumbest. It's pigs fucking, not some miracle
I think most people are in Bad faith when they Say "continuing the bloodlines" like people are renaissance evil noble families trying to branch out their power.

I get the core message, but everything else feels simply "i'm better than you for not wanting kids" - cool, no need to insult others for answering to their instinct as they were biologicaly programed to. It's like insulting someone for eating or drinking.
If you have so little faith in human kind to reproduce - might as well kill everyone. But I think that's such a depressing view of the World.
How is it messed up?
Yep. Basically all of her recent online content (mostly on Twitter) has been TERF-related garbage with no antinatalism/VHEMT in sight. That makes me hopeful that the ties have indeed been severed, but obviously I'm also disappointed that she's hopelessly lost as a JKR wannabe. Perhaps she sees the contradiction in that allowing trans people to transition often involves allowing procedures that cause sterilization (which is a good in any antinatalist's eyes), so she chose the side of her that gets far more traction these days (mostly among bigoted idiots on Twitter). It's not like Les and other antinatalists are blowing up by espousing AN loudly and proudly. Doing so seems to bring mostly ostracization.
Can you name one good reason to force someone into this dying world? Also, are trans women women?
Congrats, you've just summarized this entire subreddit
"I want..."

Literally started with your own wants not even a need lol
Adoption is a great option, but I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with bringing other humans into this world. The issues we‚Äôre all facing is from resources pooling at the top. We /could/ uplift people and make the world a better place, but we‚Äôre still barely out of the jungle, and focus on team politics instead.

Edit: it‚Äôs also not /just/ because they like kids. This is a surface reason that people will give you. There are many reasons a person could want a kid
It‚Äôs sad sometimes to see how unhappy some in this sub are
Every species is invasive
That's all u got
No I‚Äôm being for real like you only see whites doing this kind of stuff. They‚Äôre always on the front line of these types of causes, sterilization, gender reassignment etc
True, its still just hysterical to me to be anti birth
Everything! Sorry your philosophy sounds cultish and all about controlling the uncontrollable. Young people would fall for this easy.
I had two kiddo 27 and 21 now
Im14andthisisdeep
Well I don‚Äôt plan to expire, David Sinclairs research is promising, and I want to have a future in science, I don‚Äôt think I am expiring, but if I am, I want to pass on my knowledge, like my predecessors, who have enabled me to understand this beautiful and intricate universe

Shit man, maybe because life is worth living? Like unless you are seriously suicidal, you can't possibly view bringing new human life into the world as a thing that should literally never happen again. Simply being alive isn't so terrible that it should be viewed as some sort of affliction to be cured. You aren't sparing anyone from overall harm or increasing the amount of goodness in the world by advocating for the "voluntary extinction" of the human race. Hell, this way of thinking is only one step removed from straight-up genocidal accelerationism. Like at what point does the cult stop believing in the "voluntary" part of human extinction and start seeing it as their responsibility to save mankind from its woes by deliberately snuffing out all life. Like why bring about extinction by persuading people to not fuck, when you could instead support industries and politicians who ignore climate change as a way to try and accelerate humanity toward an extinction event or mass death scenario. The rhetoric is that of a Doomsday Cult. 

This "Antinatalism" stuff is weird af. I'm surprised this subreddit is even allowed to exist. Somebody else replied to my original comment and got it 100% right. This is like an even sadder movement than flat-earthers.
Socrates wasn‚Äôt an antinatalist nor was he a nihilistic pessimist.
True. If Natural Selection is your god and there's too many humans, then by all means. Stop taking medicine and supporting longevity

But they want to live forever. That one Love Death and Robots episode with the Rejoo shots is what I envision.
It is a threat. It reads like threatening people who reproduce with death camps.
Rent children from a talent agency for special occasion  and install a white picket fence lmao
I grew up in the mormon church. A common belief is that children chose their parents in the premortal life, a life before we were born on Earth.

But if you look at this belief, did children really choose sexual predators, for example, to be their parents? That belief is very harmful. Makes it seem that children are somehow responsible for any abuse they get from parents.
But you can‚Äôt really refute it right? Cause neither of you really know if souls asked to be born as some religions believe. 

Pitting one‚Äôs personal beliefs against another person leads nowhere.

Stick to the facts. Mine are: We need lower population but keeping natality rates under replacement levels for too long may lead to sudden collapse.
> I believe my kids will be happy

You can't guarantee that.

Unpredictable disease, physical/mental disorders, accidents, global disasters.

Even as a person who grew up in a 1st world country, I've had to suffer through unimagineable hours of mental and physical trauma.

Ultimately, givining birth is forcing a whole person into living an involuntary, competitive and unpredictable life.
They aren‚Äôt born, and thus cannot experience being deprived of that desire. Meanwhile, life is all but unbearable to countless people and you viewing life as a blessing doesn‚Äôt at all mean that they‚Äôll feel the same. There is nothing you can do to truly prevent their inevitable experiencing, witnessing and even causing pain, suffering and de@th once they‚Äôre here.

It‚Äôs still you saying, ‚Äúbecause I believe it‚Äôs justified‚Äù, ‚Äúbecause I like it‚Äù and because ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôll be happy‚Äù, which are all very selfish reasons to force the cruel and constant gamble life is onto someone.
days gone without people asking us to end our lives because they dont have any other counter-arguments: still 0, as usual
No. Antinatalism just says "it is wrong to do something to someone else" (create them). It doesn't follow that antinatalists have to do anything because this same thing was done to them. They did not birth themselves after all.
please elaborate on the argument that leads to that conclusion. AN want to decrease suffering, suicide would in many cases increase suffering, so it is not the logical conclusion to advocate for suicide if you are AN
Please refrain from asking other users why they do not kill themselves. Do not present suicide as a valid alternative to antinatalism. Do not encourage or suggest suicide.

Antinatalism and suicide are generally unrelated. Antinatalism aims at preventing humans (and possibly other beings) from being born. The desire to continue living is a personal choice independent of the idea that procreation is unethical.  Antinatalism is not about people who are already born. Wishing to never have been born or saying that nobody should procreate does not imply that you want your life to end right now.
Life is a gift, unfortunately you don't often get to choose the gifts you're given and equally unfortunately, it's considered quite rude to throw away even an unwanted gift.
What does that even mean?
Same
Oh, you mean Portland *Oregon*. I was so confused for a second (as someone who lived near Portland, Maine for a long time).
We will reverse population growth. Population scientists say that the world population will start declining in the 2080's, and it may happen sooner than that, maybe in the 2060's.
That's not even insulting. It's a threat. Definitely screams "unhinged".
Because it‚Äôs like writing ‚ÄúI was here‚Äù with people instead of spray paint.
I found out about another TERF Lierre Kieth, an anarcho-primitivist type radical green who wrote a book against veganism, and it reminded me of Nina Paley. Regardless of how one feels about veganism, the inclusion of TERF shit in her radical green group's message was disturbing to many.
[removed]
I think sometimes, because they don‚Äôt feel confident enough to have children, anti-birth takes the place. Which whatever, that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not a problem, until they try elevating themselves above normal people. By normal, I mean those with kids, or those who just don‚Äôt want any and don‚Äôt need a reason.
Nope, biologist here. Invasive species are those who unbalance the ecosystem because they have a high natality rate and zero natural predators.
Dum dum
Yeah I know, I'm serious too. Only whites wish for their own extinction. You don't see it in Chinese, you don't see it in Hispanics, Blacks, Indians. They like having families and kids and a strong domestic sphere

Just white people desperately wish for their own extinction because they are "morally bad"
Right? It‚Äôs alright for people who don‚Äôt want children. No way will everyone be like that. That‚Äôll never happen.
Good thing young people grow up and can make their own decisions later no reason for 19 year Olds to be making babies anyways
Explains why you're so unfulfilled as you feel the need to find groups whose views you know you don't align with 

because either you think you can change everyone's views or just to trash talk someone else's interests because you literally have nothing better to do with your life.

I'm sure your kids LOVE to be around you now that's why you have all this free time lol
there are literally tons of examples of this‚Ä¶. you‚Äôve never seen a pro life booth? at the last fair i went to there was a booth for people who were nervous to have kids because they were poor, and the owners were basically ridiculing those people and calling them selfish for not having children. imo thats the same thing, and while i dont agree with it, i respect their right to advocate for their beliefs. What I cannot respect is they were using a microphone and actively shaming people into having kids, which i can almost promise you wont catch one of these guys at these booths doing.
Unfortunately for you, freedom of speech exists!! But also, to so confidently say that our movement is worthless and we must just all be suicidal crazies who need to be locked up without actually doing any kind of research or looking into why we believe the way that we do, is absurd. Now, I can‚Äôt speak for every AN, but as far as my beliefs go, the human race is corrupt. Always has been, always will be. Of course humans do have some fundamental positive qualities, but our collective negative qualities far outweigh those imo. Look at any society at any point and history and you will find that it collapsed due to greed and/or hatred of the ‚Äúother‚Äù. ‚ÄúOther‚Äù meaning any meaningless line we draw between one group of people and another to convince ourselves we are different, so that we may feel superior in some way. Whether this be race, gender, religious belief, political affiliation, sexual orientation, it will always be something. Humans are incapable of co-existing peacefully with each other, yet human connection is also one of our biological needs. The human race is a snake eating its own tail. As hard as we try, and as humane of a government as we try to conjure, eventually, somewhere down the line, greed and hate will come in and thousands if not millions die as a result. It is a pattern we have proven time and time again we are not capable of breaking. And why subject innocent life to the greed and hate that they will eventually grow into, when they could just never exist? When we could all just cease to exist? Our movement is not out of hate for children, or even hate of humans necessarily, but more-so out of a desire to protect the world, its creatures, the universe, and potential human lives, from our sickness.

Edit: typo
what does that have to do with it? you're on an AN sub "bragging about how smart you are"
That is absolutely ridiculous lmao. If you can't read between the lines that's your own issue and exactly the type of person that shouldn't breed. Please don't make another human especially if this is the caliber of critical thinking you are going to pass on.
Hmmm I didn't know that. He wasn't Mormon but did have a childhood friend who was. I agree the belief is very harmful and I definitely felt responsible for a lot of the abuse, at least until 14/15 when that critical thinking really starts to kick in.
I definitely did not choose mine; feeling like a failed trophy kid & a bent charm on those kind of bracelets.
I'm not trying to refute or support anything. I was merely adding a personal anecdote where I saw fit.

Maybe you misunderstand the facts yourself because as per the definition of anti-natalism, natural human extinction is the ideal end goal.

I don't know why you chose my comment to try and start an argument but kindly piss off.
>>I believe my kids will be happy

>>You can‚Äôt guarantee that.

You can‚Äôt guarantee that they will be miserable. 99.99% of people rather be alive than dead; I‚Äôll go with the significantly more likely scenario rather than a unlikely fringe scenario. 

Do you not play board games if it give your joy just because there‚Äôs a small chance you may choke on a game piece?

>>It‚Äôs still you saying, ‚Äúbecause I believe it‚Äôs justified‚Äù, ‚Äúbecause I like it‚Äù and because ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôll be happy‚Äù, which are all very selfish reasons to force the cruel and constant gamble life is onto someone.

This is exactly what your viewpoint in saying too:

‚ÄúYou believe it‚Äôs not justified‚Äù,  ‚Äúbecause you don‚Äôt like it‚Äù, because ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be happy‚Äù, which is all very selfish reasons to prevent others from being able to enjoy life.
You can still throw it away, so it‚Äôs ok
If you check, the world population moved negative in 2020 and so far has continued that trend.

None of that changes the fact that we need more non-breeders either now or then.  I think it will be better now than to wait for famine and disease to do it for us.
It's a threat if they're one of the rapists the line is referencing, sure.
After quickly Googling her, yeah, she looks like she's cut from the same cloth. I don't understand how one could be an environmentalist and antinatalist without being at least *sympathetic* toward veganism and trans rights, but these women instead show open hostility. I guess there's a niche for everything.

Over a long time scale species migrate into new areas
I don‚Äôt think whites are ‚Äúmorally bad‚Äù at all. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm suggesting. It might have something to do with the Rh- blood type. Idk but I definitely see whites as being more prone to this type of way of life.
This post was in popular, the person you are responding to probably did not seek it out.

This is a pretty poor response to their criticism; you're making a lot of assumptions about this person and being unnecessarily rude. 

I generally agree with antinatalism (and put it into action myself) but if I were on the fence and saw you talking this, it would be off-putting. Not that everyone with a cause needs to be a perfectly polite exemplar all the time but your personal attacks on this person offended me enough to get me to comment. Maybe think about your motivations.
You don‚Äôt know me, you would not know if I‚Äôm fulfilled or not. It‚Äôs my opinion your philosophy, the philosophy can stand up to an opposing opinion right? I don‚Äôt need everyone to align with me. I just thought that that booth is creepy as shit. Here‚Äôs where An‚Äôs have it wrong nobody wants you to have a kid unless you wanna have one.
"Institutions await those who can't control their biological urges" doesn't sound ominous as fuck to you? It's like a phrase a 1950 abusive husband would say to hint he'd get her lombotomized if she didn't behave. Do you not get that?
Same here. The most insidious thing about child abuse is gaslighting the child that it's their own fault. So terrible üò¢
The difference is I am preventing future otherwise inevitable pain, suffering and de@th with no real guarantee to them of safety, happiness or health in the first place, and you are seeking to perpetuate that senseless and constant gamble.

They cannot experience deprivation. You want them to experience deprivation and other horrors just for some supposed ‚Äúchance of happiness‚Äù. That is what is selfish. Stopping those vicious cycles is not.
Like how the Ancient Greeks did?
What's your source on that? The world population increased in 2020.
It's not rape to birth a child though. A lot of people get "baby fever" where your mind is just constantly screaming "HAVE A BABY HAVE A BABY HAVE A BABY-" I've just come out of a case of it myself, damn hormones. If I had a partner, I wouldn't have been able to control that impulse, because I wasn't thinking rationally during it. That doesn't mean I belong in an institution!
No I'm saying white people think they are morally bad themselves. That their species is bad for the earth
Traditional-self is a regular here, actually. They've made dozens of comments in this sub. So maybe think about checking before you assume someone is just an innocent bystander who doesn't regularly insult people here? Here's a comment of theirs from 18 days ago about how they feel about antinatalists:

"That is because they are teenagers (most) that are pissed at their parents, you know pissed for no reason or they had a bad upbringing. Contempt is their communication style which causes the behavior of superiority. Superiority is a tactic they use to make other people feel unworthy & careless. (parents or people that have kids) it boosts their ego. Any attention is good attention. I also stopped in here because I like different points of view as well. hmmmmm... the posts are dark. They are just caterpillars with butterfly dreams."

They've made plenty others like this one. They really like the "butterfly dreams" catchphrase for some reason.
Nah it's not my job to promote common sense that's what the dude with the booth is doing I'm never going to change her mind and the same back 


Maybe they shouldn't call random people sitting in a booth minding their buisness a cult while religion is out there and everywhere.
Why on earth would you think that the author of that message - those people in the photos - have any reason to make or power or intention to execute that threat. 

Clearly, the author is simply and solely pointing out, acknowledging, that it is a generally accepted social practice, nearly globally, to separate from the general public humans who succumb to their base biological instincts that harm others. I will myself point out that all procreation harms others, as nobody would experience suffering were they to have never been created, and this is undoubtedly true and totally inarguable. 

It's ok to disagree of course
Yeah, sure is ‚Äî> Karma is overdue for a visit.
What percentage of people in the world do you think subscribe to the antinatalism viewpoint? There‚Äôs 500 million Reddit accounts and 222k subscribers to this sub. So 0.044% of the population?  So 99.966% of people likely don‚Äôt agree with your viewpoint. 

I don‚Äôt know about you but it‚Äôs normally better to act in the interest of 99.966% of the population and not the 0.044%
Sure
Worldometers has population growth declining since 2020.  That year wouldn‚Äôt be much of a surprise though.  Statista shows a less than 1% growth rate since 2021.

If the population continues growing, the earth will eventually start to balance things faster than technology can fix.
Baby fever is not real. It‚Äôs just people seeing a baby and thinking aww cute I want one.
Oh ok guess we don't need to lock up rapists who act on their biological instincts screaming "HAVE SEX HAVE SEX HAVE SEX". Because they shouldn't be at fault for doing something irrational and not controlling impulses, yeah? 

If someone has anger management issues we shouldn't lock them up for getting into fights and killing people, right? Anger is a perfectly natural emotion and it's been a part of our species for thousands of years.
I didn't assume. I said because this post was in popular that they probably found it that way. I am not going to go through someone's comment history unless it was made relevant, and it was not. I do not have time for that.

I'm not sure why either side feels the need to insult the other but this subreddit doesn't seem chill in general, which is sad because I think it's a worthwhile cause.
Not really interested in engaging with you any further, agree to disagree
>Why on earth would you think that the author of that message - those people in the photos - have any reason to make or power or intention to execute that threat. 

When someone tells you who they are. You listen. It doesn't matter if they dont have the power to execute it. Because one day they might.


If someone says something to you thay sounds alot like they want to lock you up for being different it's extremely reasonable to assume the worst. 


>Clearly, the author is simply and solely pointing out, acknowledging, that it is a generally accepted social practice, nearly globally, to  humans who . I will myself point out that , as nobody would experience suffering were they to have never been created, and this is undoubtedly true and totally inarguable. 


So hang on now. You beleive that people who "succumb to their base biological instincts that harm others" should be "separate[d] from the general public". You also believe that "all procreation harms others". Then you think all people who reproduce should be in prison? 


You understand that completely undermines your responses to me at all right? That would mean I was justified in saying that it sounded like they want to round up breeders and put them in death camps? Infact I was actually giving them the benefit of the doubt by saying it only "sounds like" they want to lock people up for reproducing. What I actually have said is that "that actually want to".
Appeal to majority fallacy. It doesn‚Äôt mean a thing how many people agree with something. The majority belief being so doesn‚Äôt make it right at all.

I‚Äôm acting in the interest of preventing the perpetual cycle.
It bloody well is, I experience it first hand when I'm on my period. It's so much stronger than "Aww cute I want one". Not everyone experiences it but for those that do it's real.
Incorrect
I don't agree with having kids, but you're fucking crazy if you think giving birth should be punished like rape.
How arrogant of you to say that you know better whether or not other people enjoy life and whether they want to live. You know better than them do you?
I don't think it should, and I never said that. What I'm saying is people should be called out for trying to justify cruel acts with "it's natural, it's just biology". Punishing parents for giving birth usually isn't great for the poor kid resulting from their actions anyway.
Of course I do, as I‚Äôve unfortunately been here and cannot possibly know the sheer unbearable extent of the horrors that exist here, but can absolutely understand that the good doesn‚Äôt make up for it. I am selfless enough to prevent their very potential of pain, suffering and de@th despite knowing that I unfortunately wasn‚Äôt saved from the same thing. I use that knowledge and understanding, painful as it is, to prevent the cycle from perpetuating and allowing them to remain safe, free and at peace far away from here.
Already existing life, beyond helping them to be as happy, healthy and safe as possible despite the tragic circumstances, are simply not the subject here.
some photos I shot in Twin Peaks 
Thought I‚Äôd toss up some more photos from my time in North Bend/Snoqualmie. 

Such an incredible place, I‚Äôd highly recommend visiting if you‚Äôre able. 
Golly, these look and feel like season 1! Love
You can't just screencap the TV show and say you took pictures.



Just kidding.....those are really great and really captured the TP vibe.
You absolutely nailed the color grading on these
Beautiful photos! The PNW is such a beautiful place
1000/10 so dreamy!!!
the color is spot-on! these are great
Damn, these are absolutely perfect.
Wait, I been there but missed a few spots you found:

The Palmer house in not in Snoqualmie AFAIK, I get it.

But do you mind sharing how and where you found the mossy rock in the trees and that super scenic piece of road?? Will try to hit those next time
The orange tint, excellent!
Truly captured the feel, great shotsüëç
Lovely collection, my friend! Thank our for sharing your experience!
Wow! Stunning.
Would you share high-res of these pictures?
What camera/lens did you use? Love the photos
Damn, those are some spot-on moody pics! üî•
wow! thank you so much for this batch of absolutely amazing wallpapers üôåüèª
Great pictures! You really catched the vibe
Excellent coloring and atmosphere! I love the clouds above the RR.
I saw these on twitter last night and ended up showing the post to some of my friends when I met up with them today lol. Really amazing! 

Any info on your camera/lens/editing process you'd want to talk about? I'm not that good at photography, but I think it's interesting to hear about how other people work :)
[Atmospheric whooshing]
Excellent shots! I was in Bellevue for work about five years and had to drive over and check it out myself. So worth it! This was the only worthy pic I got though.

Honestly Ive taken hundreds of pictures in Snoqualmie myself and seen a hundred posts here of pictures taken in that town but none of them have actually reminded me of the show, it's tone and feel as much as your pictures, great job well done.
These are truly incredible. Thank you for sharing!
Fantastic job man!
Did you sit on Harry Dean‚Äôs bench?
beautiful
I love you
Outstanding
Incredible
OP, I'm not a professional photographer and editor but I can certainly appreciate it - #8 & #9 are a fantastic homage to the original in terms of color, framing, etc. thank you for sharing your art!
Lynch should hire you. These are great
Thank you for posting this. I haven't been able to make the tour despite desperately wanting to go to the festival since the mid-nineties.

The quality of the photos is great and I immediately went to your profile to see if you had been posting in photography subs. I'm not a photographer but love that you provided details on the gear and settings. 

Great photos. Exactly how I wanted to see those places.
Great effing photos, OP!!!
Obsessed with these photos! Great work üå≤üå≤
Brings it right back. That was the creepiest TV show ever. Legendary. Brilliant theme music too.
god the first one is literally stunning
amazing pics!!
Rad! I got chills!
I hope you know how special these are , as a photographer and a massive fan of the show this hit every bone in my body
They should call you up for season 4. Stunning shots that very much capture the essence of the show.
you went in...
Amazing!!! Brings me right back to the show :)
So beautiful can‚Äôt wait to go there next year!! Where is the last photo?
Are you David Lynch in disguise?
Wow!
beautiful photos, gosh! üò≠
So sick
You have serious skill
These pictures are incredible. What gear did you use?
Legitimately thought some of these were Ai from how close they look like the show, insanely well done
What a magnificent set of photos üëèüèª
Gorgeous pictures!
Fantastic!
I was going to also say, these look like they could be screenshots!! Incredible photos! I could hear the theme song while looking through them
those are great!! as everyone mentioned, perfectly encapsulated the feeling of season, even though is shot on digital (I saw you at r/fujifilm earlier this week hahaha GFX is a dream camera)
Absolutely fantastic ! üî• like from the show üòå
Slay
The pics are great!  That trip is on my bucket list, but it‚Äôs across the country and expensive. Trying to combine it with a ‚ÄúBigfoot‚Äù event for my husband, üòâ
At first thought they were screenshots , id love to travel there :)
Great shots!  Meticulously curated and so seasonally appropriate.  A night of flickering neon imagery.  Solid stuff here.
You absolutely nailed this. Super nice mate
You match the colors incredibly well man! First I thought they were frames from the show 

You should share the preset or selling its so good
These are great! How fun was it to visit?
Is the diner open to the public? Do they have a tour of the town?
These are amazing üòç thank you.
my god, these are beautiful! I kinda want to buy these off you, like, high resolution printable versions. absolutely nailed it <333
wow. incredible composition and energy in your photos. beautiful art. beautifully framed each shot.
These are absolutely stunning!!
I love #4
Oh that‚Äôs beautiful, you‚Äôre tearing my heart out
Amazing shots. As everyone else is saying, you totally nailed it!
LOVE
You got the coloring down!!!
Utterly brilliant mate üëçüèº
What year is it? üòÆ
Wow! No joke these look like they came right out of the production department of the show. Beautiful images thanks for sharing!!
Legit these make me emotional!! So gorgeous.

Weyerhaeuser still standing. That's good news as I want to see it as well someday. Wasn't there a rumor about it being sold to a developer?
Wonderful! Inspiring me to take a drive out there soon :)

woah those are beautiful
These are simply stunning. That forest shot is phenomenal
Fabulous shots.
These are awesome
Wow! Incredible shots. I took some of my own on a visit this year but yours have the right colour palette to match the original series, well done!
these are absolutely stunning
Wow ü§©
Honestly, like others have said, these look like promo shots for the show! Great shots, very moody. Love it.
Insanely gorgeous work. For a second I thought you weaved in some shots from the actual show to troll us.
Breathtaking, especially in the fall season.
Very nostalgic!
I can‚Äôt place photo 10, or is it there simply for the mural?
Great shot of Ronettes Bridge.   When I was there , there was a lot of underbrush I had to deal with.
So beautiful. Thank you for sharing. Absolutely need to visit there some day.
Im from Europe but this is one of the very first places i would visit in US, photos are great.
Wowow these are making me want to step up my photography game. I am local to the area and these capture something really special in each one. Gorgeous pictures!
Ommmggg I‚Äôm obsessed! These look awesome! I got to go once and it was just too dreamy
Holy guacamole these look stills from the show!
Do you think the people who bought the Palmer house know why random people take pictures of their house all the time? Or rather, do you think they knew the first few times it happened?

Edit: because I am very aware that the current homeowners bought it from a Mrs Chalfont.
Beautiful,  definitely on my bucket list
please tell me how you edit these oh my goshüôèüôè
These are REALLY good photographs. I've been to Snoqualmie/North Bend many times now and never got such good photos. how do you get the colors so great? Filter?
Where was that indoor shot taken? I would have thought they'd use a set for the sheriff station.
where is the last photo?  Back of tweeds?
An excellent project and series event directed by David Lynch, as well as the iconic scenery of a mysterious and beautiful town
thanks so much! tried to stay true to the show
I grew up here. I can say it's beautiful, it's my home. When I see pics like this, it's always a strange feeling.
I thought they were stills from the show for a second there.
Lynch could have taken these.
Haha thank you. Tried to stay true to the show with the color grading
thanks so much!
thank you!
thanks! ü§ù
thanks so much!
Yes, the Palmer House is in Everett, WA - about 45 minutes from North Bend.

The mossy stump was on a hunt to find Jack Rabbit‚Äôs Palace, in Olallie State Park outside of Snoqualmie. There‚Äôs quite a bit of information online about these trails and the locations used for filming, but I was unable to find the exact location of the ‚ÄúPalace‚Äù. Being back there on the trail felt close enough though! 

That spot from the road was on Reinig Rd, close to the original sign location but not exact. I got yelled at/chased off someone‚Äôs property back there after shooting photos of a bunch of their bombed out vehicles, so I decided to just head away from that area for a bit üòÖ
thank you! ü§ù
thank you!
Would love high res downloads
shot these on Fuji GFX50SII, gf32-64mm. 

All editing done in Lightroom
yes! as a fellow photographer i would love to know more about the equipment used.
haha thank you, and thanks for sharing them!

I shot these on medium format. Fuji GFX50SII, gf32-64mm f/4 lens. 

All edits done in Lightroom. I typically don‚Äôt like to go into too much detail discussing the editing process / color grading. Every photographer has their preferences and ultimately it‚Äôs just important to have your own style and ideas for what you want to convey with an image. 

Typically, my work is trying to convey a sense of nostalgia - which in this case felt pretty straightforward, since the source material is something we all already know and love!
that‚Äôs super kind of you, thanks so much ü§ù 
really not lost on me how much this place means to people, just wanted to try and do it justice!
thank you!
thank you!
I did, it‚Äôs located in a park a few blocks from the motel I was staying in
would be a dream! no artist has had a greater influence on my work
you‚Äôre welcome, and thanks for the kind words!
thanks!
thanks so much!
that really means a lot to hear, thanks so much!
for David and Mark I am always available! Lol thanks so much ü§ù
thanks my friend ü§ù
hope you enjoy! that was taken right behind Twede‚Äôs/Double R
Could well be.
keep your eye on the donut, not on the hole!
thank you!
thank you!
thank you!
thank you, and thanks for the gold! means so much, glad you enjoy them.
thanks! I plan on doing a print run of a few of these eventually, I can definitely let you know when prints are available
super kind, thank you ü§ù
it means a lot, thanks so much!
thank you!
nah, just in the middle of some brick work on the front steps. had to throw a tarp over because it started to rain.
There are bricks and buckets in the yard, and a shop-vac on the porch. I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs some sort of repair going on, and it‚Äôs covered against the elements.
It is, at least partially! I‚Äôm not aware of anything regarding development though. 

It‚Äôs right across from the Sheriff‚Äôs Department, which is a school for rally car racing called Dirtfish. They‚Äôre really cool about Twin Peaks fans coming through the office to poke around - they‚Äôll even let you sit at Lucy‚Äôs desk.
thank you, I hope you enjoy it!
thank you! I do all of my own color grading/editing in Lightroom
yes!
Seriously, even the color profile is on point, wicked impressive, love these!!
For sure, looks great.   For others, here's a comparison of an Average Joe Photo Guy....

I  was just there during sunny weather and it simply did not feel nearly as evocative as these shots

How do you feel about a portrait crop for that first shot?

Thanks for the info, much appreciated. 
Absolutely gorgeous photos!! Kudos galore. Challenge accepted to get better at picture taking
You're welcome!
Yeah, I know about Dirtfish. Reckon they'll be charging admission fees if it continues like that lol. My daughter's name is Lucy. She can sit at that desk if she wants to. I'd be happy to walk across to see what's left of Weyerhaeusers.
Haha you‚Äôre probably right - they do have a tip jar for Twin Peaks fans coming through, and are also selling tiny pieces of Lucy‚Äôs original desk for $20 lol.
Tiny pieces of the desk? How tiny? Will be gone before you know it.
TP folks must be one of the craziest bunch of people around. Count me in.
about matchbook size lol
Imagine...having a splinter of wood in a tiny box. I don't know ...lol. All because of Kimmy Robertson playing the role of Lucy.
Apeks Twin
My friends who own a bar apparently keep this VHS of the original series and insist it's primarily to attract anybody who have reorganized it to spell Aphex Twin. Is this a meme? They barely even watch it, I love the show, I just find this fascinating
Come to daddy.
This is funny as both a huge Aphex Twin and Twin Peaks fan.

Laura?
No but Depeche Mode has, sort of. Martin Gore is a David Lynch fan and even covered In My Other World on his Counterfeit 2 album. [Great cover, too!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlUixv4Ac4c)

Diane: I've been to the Double R, licking¬† their windows and I have to tell you that they are, excuse me, some damn fine windows.
Went nuts for this in 99 when a friend had it, I was surprised he was cool about me borrowing it to make a copy. He also had a bizarre Residents-like short I copied called "Lick of Fury" by a Matthew Sidle I can't find anywhere online.
This was a re-issue low quality VHS boxset. Whoever did the graphic design probably hadn‚Äôt even seen the show.

My friend actually claimed the overlap is significant üòÇ
I know that Bowie was a fan; he even appeared in *Fire Walk With Me*. Don't think it's Richard's sort of thing, though, he's a bit more cryptic.

Took a day trip this weekend to Twin Peaks
Well, really North Bend but got a few fun shots I thought I‚Äôd share ‚úåÔ∏è
[deleted]
The town has a "real twin peaks day" celebration in February. You can Google it. There's nothing better than spending time with other Twin Peaks family.
Forgot to add, hotel pics from FWWM and S3. Super creepy dive place had NO VACANCY lol

How was the pie?
Very cool. Bucket list.
North Bend/Snoqualmie, Washington is my Disney World.
Where pies go when they die!
Nice photos üòä I definitely want to make that trip at some point
Where is it? I mean, which state? Assuming it's in the US
I can hear the theme song now‚Ä¶
My dad and I went to all of the spots around there; it was fun!
The pie is delicious! I love that little town. I visited in May.
This is awesome! Thanks for sharing. I'd love to do this someday too :)
On Blank Check I heard that the pie is not well liked. How did you find it?
All it takes is a few snaps of the location and we're hooked. Lol. I'm in for good!
Heard the pie is really awful, true?
I almost took the drive down from Vancouver BC this weekend, but decided to sleep late instead‚Ä¶

Would like to get a trip in before it gets too rainy
I think the DirtFish Rally School there still has the SUV from the show. Been a few years since I was there.
How was the pie?
Nice! Was there like 15 years ago. IIRC the falls aren‚Äôt far away either?
That last one has some Jay and Silent Bob looking after the kids vibes
You are literally a young log lady.
Is it true the pie is trash ?
Were your kids scared of the robot doll on the counter?
You look like you say ‚Äúactually..‚Äù a lot
Definitely giving Log Lady
Haha maybe I should get some glasses like her!
Came here to say this
Yaaassss! I wanna go so bad!
Did u meet Philip Jeffries? üò≥
It's been derelict for a while...right? Would be weird to stay there...and I would love it.
Actually REALLY good. Coffee was damn ok lol. We asked for the mugs and they said they were out of stock - BUT they got a shipment in literally as we were walking out the door so we scored a couple Double R mugs! üôå

I had breakfast there a few times when I visited. Everything I had was pretty good. Definite thought into making the meals a great part of of the experience.
Was on mine too - and I‚Äôve live in WA most my life! Hope you‚Äôre able to make it, it‚Äôs a cool place.
For reals, much rather be there than Disney any day!

Forever in my mind üé∂
My adult kids watched the series with my husband and I last year and they loved it too! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I hope you can! It was super cool!
I don‚Äôt eat pie - I‚Äôm a texture girlie - but hubby ordered a slice and for the sake of nostalgia o took a bite and I actually thought it was delicious! I don‚Äôt know if my love for the show have it a little extra oomph but it was good!
I thought it was delicious, but it was the first time I‚Äôd ever tried cherry pie so I may not be the best judge.
The weather was quite nice! Hope you can make it down before it gets cold and rainy!
Oh man that would have been cool to see. We went down there but a bunch of employees were side eyeing from the front porch area so we just took pics of the mill smokestack real quick and bounced.
Delightful!
Another 15 mins or so from North Bend. My 3 year old was getting restless - a 2 hour drive there, over an hour wait to get into the Double R and taking tons of pics she had had it so we skipped it this time. ü•≤
Haha those are my boys - 15 and 19. Their style is interesting but my parents didn‚Äôt understand me at that age either so I just let them be. üòÇ
What year is this? üòÇ
Noooo! I thought it was so good! But I‚Äôm no pie expert by any means!
I don‚Äôt think they noticed it
I actually say like more üòÇ
No one was there to unlock the door üòâ
I‚Äôve only heard that the pie tastes like shit.
The food was good too - I was pretty impressed
Come out in February for the big weekend long celebration!! Ray Wise will be there and a good chance Kyle will come out too. He was there last year.
I travelled from Australia last year to visit Snoqualmie, was incredible! Seeing the lake where Laura was found and the RR Diner was bucket list stuff.
Can relate
üòÉ it's like it's just for me!
I've pointed it out to someone years ago. Now I get to ask you the same question again...weren't you tempted to change it to ...where pigs go when they die?
Thank you! I don't think I'll ever go, since I live in France, but thank you üòä
Ah, lovely to hear!
Gotcha I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs good I just heard that on a podcast this week
Ha!üòÑ
Haha I liked it but I‚Äôm not a cherry pie guru
Now you've read that it doesn't! Isn't that great?
Oh man I would LOVE TO! I‚Äôll keep my eyes peeled for more info as it gets closer!
I‚Äôm just now finding out about this celebration and I would love to attend this some year
Wow - I bet your neck of the woods is gorgeous too! Australia is definitely bucket list status for me!

Recent episode of Blank Check podcast has them try it on the air. I hear it‚Äôs edible! I used to work at a pie shop so I have some bias.
How is it that most people who grew up there say it‚Äôs a common running gag the pie sucks and it‚Äôs a tourist trap? Or that most people hate it? Sorry I triggered you for saying pie from a place may suck.

OMG I am on holiday in Paris rn but I'm leaving tomorrow! I didn't know there were shooting locations in Paris üò≠ it will be for next time I guess! Thanks for the piece of info!

And yes, France is beautiful, like any place on earth it has its unique beautiful views and locations. I'd love to visit more of the US (only been to manhattan and Boston), I know it's gorgeous too!
I was looking for a stray blankie in this thread. Hello from a huge fan of The Two Friends.
I'm not sure that most people there are of that opinion. Basically I don't care. I've never been there but someday I will and Twede's is high on my list. Aok!
If you went to the grocery store and got the pie from there, you wouldn‚Äôt think anything of it. 


It‚Äôs just that you are going to a place that is presumably known for their pie, and you get something equal to what you would get from the grocery store. It‚Äôs not actively gross but after driving out there you would probably want something better.
Yay!! So excited, thank you for this info!
Except they are. Literally just listened to a podcast where someone who grew up in this town was a guest and talked about growing up in the town of Twin Peaks grilling locations.
I worked in a pie restaurant as a baker for a whole. I heard this is worse than grocery store. You‚Äôve been and enjoyed it? You know everyone who grew up there? Please keep digging a hole where you defend mediocre pie because you‚Äôre a super fan of a show. I love twin peaks. But I don‚Äôt need to fawn over a tourist trap.
I‚Äôm from Seattle so it wasn‚Äôt like some grand trip to get there. I‚Äôm not even saying it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs just not gross. 


I‚Äôm also not a pie guy, I literally only have it at Christmas/thanksgiving sometimes when someone brings a store bought one so I have no idea what elite pie would even be like.
I worked in a podunk town pie shop - a town smaller than the towns that are where twin peaks was filmed. We baked pie every morning starting at 4am. Most of our customers were local but occasionally got folks from the other state (border town) and the Big City to our south. It‚Äôs not elite pie. Just standard baker shit. For instance my friend who went ages ago said the filling tasted like it was canned or made a decade ago.
Yeah the canned description is probably accurate, like the filling is pretty gelatinous. Personally I just wouldn‚Äôt describe that as ‚Äúgross‚Äù but if I got it from a restaurant (particularly one that is presumably known for their pie) I would be pretty disappointed. But if my aunt brought it for thanksgiving or whatever I wouldn‚Äôt be revolted or anything. 


But I‚Äôm also the guy that (before I went vegan) would eat dinner from 7/11 and loved toxic shit like Little Debbies pastries so I‚Äôm by no means a culinary expert lmao.
Saw this at a shopping mall in Tokyo! 
This Japanese fashion brand called Undercover did a collab with our favorite show! The products were so sick but unfortunately out of my price range, so I haven‚Äôt bought any of it. 
I live in Japan and I remember when Season 3 was released on Bluray, there was a campaign at the movie theatre. If you bought the Bluray, you would get a free coffee and pie in the lobby.
That's cute enough, but the ads that run before the feature were just supercuts of Dougie doing goofy stuff accompanied with slapsticky music. People that bought the show based on that were probably surprised
that jacket is TO DIE FOR
That‚Äôs awesome. I like the Double R diner shirt a lot
"That TV show you like will come back in style"
This one is so cool but super pricy: https://undercoverism.com/gender/item/detail/1_1_UC2D4806-1_1/Q01
$350 US for a plain White T-shirt with the word(s) TWINPEAKS on the front, there really is another world.
Why do these officially licensed t shirts just have the screenshot from the show. Why not use the license to create some custom art
If anyone is interested in more Twin Peaks haute couture, you should check out Raf Simon‚Äôs A/W 2016 and Veronique Branquinho AW 2004.  Both are beautiful collections and are much more inspired than this imo.
I think these items might be from Jun Takahashi‚Äôs Undercover brand. He did a Twin Peaks-themed collection recently and is a high-end Japanese designer. The prices reflect the brand, but as people are saying, you can buy similar items far more cheaply:
https://www.eyecmag.com/news/2024/1/21/undercover-autumnwinter-24
Have you seen any other Twin Peaks/David Lynch type stuff there? Im going to Tokyo later this year. I heard they got a cafe that is sort of inspired by him.
I don't know why this is the first time it's hit me this way, but it feels very strange seeing the dinner in my hometown on the back of a shirt in Japan.
the snow jacket is 2gs... womp womp
Love Undercover!! Jun Takahashi the brands creator has always been into like alt youth and pop culture and makes it a part of his work, if people want more Twin Peaks fashion crossover definitely take a look at Raf Simons‚Äôs FW19 collection he used a lot of imagery from Blue Velvet and I think some Twin Peaks it‚Äôs awesome, also for something a little more under the surface his FW02 collection has always felt very much in the vein of twin peaks, it took place in this like forest-y environment with lots of trenches and plastic ponchos and varsity jackets
"Give yourself a present" day is the best day.
My bank account would be so cooked dude
That's how enduring Twin Peaks's legacy is in Japan. It hits many of the right notes.
While that‚Äôs cool to see in public Imo those designs are pretty crap. Slapping a screenshot on a shirt is lazy. I‚Äôve seen and purchased better designs on trendy online T-shirt shops.

Undercover‚Ä¶ crowd funding for season 4
Ummm NEED!!!
I want every piece in this collection ü•π
These threads are so tight
heattt
Atelier New York has a listing for one of these shirts at a whopping $405 USD. 

Ssense has one of the sweatshirts listed at $550. 

How on earth people can justify "high end" fashion prices is beyond me. The quality of these brands have decreased as time has gone on, objectively, and the prices have only risen.
Cool If a legitimate collab. Fucked if they are just ripping off TP with no consent or compensation. It would not have been the first time.
Which mall did you to find this? I happen to be visiting tokyo soon.
Tons of good Twin Peaks shirts and prints on the usual suspect websites like taobao, aliexpess etc. $5 with shipping and import duties. Just saying.

Official collabs are fine, expecially the Japanese like to do collabs regarding older topics such as Twin Peaks, John Woo's The Killer, SNK vs Capcom, Tom & Jerry etc, but the prices are usually just off the charts.

I'll stick to the unlicensed stuff to get 20 shirts, longsleeves, hoodies and jackets for the price of 1. And no, they won't fall apart after one wash - they are made in the same facories as the others anyway :)
‚ÄúYou are Mr Sparkle?‚Äù
I NEED THAT
BONZAI!!!!

The whole line is pretty cool looking. I like their choice of art and that it seems to have placement in unusual areas and not just a bunch of t-shirts. Some look like they‚Äôre sewn on, too. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs very limited, hand made, and being marked up 50,000%‚Ä¶.but I like
I lived in Japan until recently and it‚Äôs much more talked about than in America. Me and all of my close friends adore the show
Lol is that last one an image of Laura dead? Who signed off on that one?
That‚Äôs really cool
How did I not hear about this dammmnnn, I bet it‚Äôs spenny tho
Undercover has released some really cool clothing based on popular media; check out their 2001 and Evangelion collections.
You can go to any website and upload a jpeg of the show onto a shirt and have it printed and it‚Äôll look better than this
This is awesome!
Oh wow!
buy me the jacket
Shirts with just square photo's are always the laziest designs and always look bad.   Just plain next on them or a tiny logo,  kind of a lazy collab and scammy asking more for it.

That denim jacket looks cool though.
I've heard that japanese people are fans of twin peaks
Dude! ... I want all that stuff so bad. Very cool.
Undercover are a sudo luxury Japanese brand, they make some amazing stuff if you're into streetwear, but yeah, the prices are on the higher end. I might grab a few things from this collection tbh,
Wish I could get all of this in the US! The jacket rules
Cash grab

Same shirt for 1/20 the price.

https://amzn.asia/d/87kFk74
Not only is that awesome, but I can imagine the confusion of those who bought it based on that! Thanks for sharing :)
Japan is either on the other planet on in the other dimension. You keep suprisisng me with your approaches
I wanted it so bad!
Double RR = four Rs though
Damn. That‚Äôs like $450!
Cardigan with Coop & Laura patches on the elbows is badass
Holy snap
Well its expensive streetwear like Supreme. Expect those prices
You could probably make it yourself far cheaper at one of those custom tee sites like spreadshirt or printerval.
You make a good point! I‚Äôm not mad at it however, each one of those shots are iconic
this is jun takahashi's style as a designer. if you're interested, here's the full runway show, which shows the vision in a little more detail: https://wwd.com/runway/mens-fall-2024/paris/undercover/review/
Same vibe as Balenciaga. 350$ for a shirt a toddler could design.
Because that costs money. This is just a cash grab.
These are absolutely stunning!! Thanks for sharing :)
I have not, but that may just be because of how large Tokyo is, and how limited my time in that city was. It would totally make sense if they had those there :) I know in the 90‚Äôs Twin Peaks was so popular in Japan that they had the cast in commercials for [Georgia Coffee](https://youtu.be/akBPZwxlZXk?si=0gVSB3Lp_B5H7Pd9) !
Awesome! Gotta look into Jun Takahashi more :) You‚Äôre also the second person to comment about a Raf Simmons collection, love his stuff. Just took a look at the photos and they‚Äôre so cool! Thanks for sharing :)
that raf show went crazy. i wish i'd picked up one of the laura dern tees when they were still available.
Ummm OVERPRICED!!!
iseitan men‚Äôs in shinjuku, don‚Äôt remember which floor but you see it coming right out of the escalator :)
?? it goes hard as fuck
I just looked at that!! That stuff looks seriously so cool
Yes, I know that. I just thought it was cool because it‚Äôs not every day you find a big ass photo of agent cooper or Twin Peaks stuff at a shopping mall or even anywhere.
https://preview.redd.it/0rwds677i0id1.jpeg?width=807&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b551df3a5f2e18ff51b870e209bcb29a7c6e5861
Back during the original run, TP in Japan was probably a bigger phenomenon than it was in North America.
Streetwear is cool just not cool with my pockets lol
Imagine just randomly giving it a shot expecting to see a wholesome sitcom featuring that hilarious man in the green jacket - in a series all about his life back home in Twin Peaks!! The kids will love this‚Ä¶

Then getting the family together on the couch, some popcorn‚Ä¶then, ‚ÄúThe Return‚Äù starts‚Ä¶.ü§£
Nope, they are humans just like us, on the same planet and dimension. It‚Äôs just called culture.
[deleted]
That's ridiculous. Are those price tags from the black lodge?
Why so much?
Agreed about the shots and it‚Äôs not twin peaks t shirts in general. I‚Äôve seen these licensed shirts everywhere . A lot of brands have started doing this‚Ä¶ like atleast mask the edges and make the image blend with the t shirt lol. My complaint was a general complaint regarding this new trend not specific to twin peaks though. Cheers!
Awesome! Thanks for sharing :)
Based on watching the video, Japanese people seem to think Agent Cooper is a Columbo type character who snaps his fingers when he's about to solve the case. It's pretty hilarious that they featured the red room in one of the commercials too
Same!! I was able to grab one of the shoulder patch sweatshirts on SSENSE sale a while ago, I think it was my first designer purchase I still love it
True
Thnx, for educating me. Now I'll go to kill the mammoth with a stone and than join my tribe
For that price I would sure hope so! :)
Black lodge market is a total rip off!
If you read tgis price backwards it is not so costly
Undercover is a high end street wear brand, their prices across the board are high.
Because its fast fashion all the way down. It's cheaper and easier to just print a jpeg onto a black tshirt than to commission artists, sew whatever the artist comes up with onto the shirt etc...
And *then*, maybe you can go to school
Went there once. Never again. Especially Windom as a sales rep...no chance.
Right. Still not worth going to Tokyo for it.
Maybe it‚Äôs just the quality of the picture, but the quality of the print looks like it would start peeling off after just a handful of washes
It is not my native language
I got a refund from him but when I got home my house was empty.
Kyle MacLachlan at the Charli XCX Tour, September 2024! üòãü•∞
He genuinely loves her music and I love that hahaüíöüíö 
How's *bump* Annie?
I can‚Äôt figure out why we can see the arms on either side of the mirror and it‚Äôs freaking me out
His line from the video he did with that brand High Snobiety lives rent free in my head. 

‚ÄúI am, and have always been, leader of the baby girls‚Äù

üò≠üíö
The Brats are not what they seem
How‚Äôs Charli?
I‚Äôm so Laura, ah ah, ahhhh
Man is taking party bathroom selfies at his age. He's winning at life fr.
he‚Äôs so Julia
Is that Benny Drama on the left??
Laura Palmer IS brat
damn fine concert
So cute
I may be out of the loop, but what is Kyle's relation with Charli that makes him promote her a lot? Family relatives? Or just a famous superfan?
Dale is brat üòÇ
cool
whose arms are those
I listened to brat for the first time this week, it was actually pretty good. There seems to be a bit of a trend going around where producers are using a lot of electro house sounds and synths in modern pop and I am all for it. Used to listen to electro house nonstop back in 07-11.
I love this.
With BennyDrama!!!
MR BBYGIRL BRAT!!!!
awww he bumpin that
Brat!
‚ùÑÔ∏è
She seems like a cool person.  I wish I didn't think her music sucks.
Omg is that Benny Drama?
I guess he found closure after all
I think the cherry's rotten right to the core from all the things passed down from all the cherries coming before
I need a Truman x Cooper fan-edit to ‚ÄúGirl, So Confusing ft Lorde‚Äù ASAP!!!
HAHHHHHH!!!!!! BLUE EYES COOP? U OK IN THERE?
KOOPER
I think it's one smaller mirror placed on top of another, wall-sized one
Because he is the arm, and the sound he makes is like this
There had to be something
It‚Äôs a beveled mirror.  Something like this‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/witujzayj0qd1.jpeg?width=224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b6e58f56a88dc0d485537c7a8b4910b9c8759ae
I think the gold metallic frame is also reflective so we‚Äôre just seeing that reflection in addition to the mirror.
Oh my god, do you happen to have a link for that ? I need to see / hear that üò≠üò≠
I dig your picture
Yup, he and his boyfriend are buddies with Charli. Pretty sure his boyfriend is on her team actually
yes
The original brat
I think he's just a fan, he's been promoting lorde too
Right!? All my gay worlds colliding.
please watch my 9 hour video essay to fully understand
*Thru the bratness of summers past, maclachlan longs to see*

*Three chant out ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so julia,‚Äù*

*Do, a bump with me*
It‚Äôs the best, I hope this link works! If not, look up @highsnobiety on IG and tab over to their reels, his mic‚Äôd up video is about 10 down from the top.

thanks, we gotta believe
That‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day and now I need my Pacific Northwest Cherry Pie.
Kyle is one of the few celebs I keep up with on social media, he is such a delight. He‚Äôs fully aware of his legacy, and overall effect on the girls and gays lolol
Well as a bi man I find him iconic.
I‚Äôm a bi woman and same. He is right up our alley haha.
I did it, got the surgery yesterday!
I was a little nervous, but I‚Äôm feeling great already.

Your cat has the cutest face
How many doctors did you see? I heard they like to deny people constantly because "what if you want babies in the future" kind of stuff...

Oh my god your cat is so freaking adorable!

Just like your RBüòÇ, I have one too!!
Ooooh, unique colors on this cat...
Please tell me anything you‚Äôre willing to share im looking to do this very soon. How‚Äôs the recovery process going? Pain level and medications? Any digestive issues or GI unhappiness? How shit do you feel in general granted that it‚Äôs surgery?

What surgery is that?
Congrats and happy healing! May your sterilization scars be just as cute as mine!
Congratulations
Congratulations!! Wishing you a speedy recovery! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
Yay!  When I did it, the worst part was not being allowed to drink water for 12 hours before, and then it really hurt my throat how they removed my breathing tube but that was the worst of it!  Happy healing!!! ü§óüôåüôåüíñ
Hope you recover soon, may your post operation wounds heal soon without complications. All the best, your cat( I am guessing Egyptian Mau) is really cute by the way.
Nice! And don't worry, once the stitches are out and you're healed, your belly button will look like before.
congratulations! also : very VERY beautiful cat!
Your cat is smiling. I love him/her. I bet they are the best baby.
Don't you ever consider having more cats in the future?
Unfathomably based.
That cat looks soo happy
Cats are better than kids all day, every day.
Congrats!

Having completed the necessary rituals for entry I happily welcome you to the all juice, no seeds club. Where adults have whatever, they want for as long as they want as long as its not a child made of their own DNA.
This is my favourite post ever!
Congrats and cute cat. God that scar looks so painful I'm about to gag
That is a silly looking cat <3 what's their name?
Your belly actually looks like one of a woman who‚Äôs had kids . More than one.
Why was I suggested this community
Mods, are we banning trolls from here or nah?
And you have that animal all over your wounds.
scary
Good for you! It's always great too see a white person making this choice. You are very brave to never be a mother, and to make sure that there won't be more future colonisers!
Good job removing yourself from the gene pool!
An almost admirable dedication to cringe.
mentally ill
Why is that necessary? I'm so confused. Is it difficult to put a rubber on the hot dog before it goes in or what?
Do you treat your cat like a baby?

Do you think this is a coping mechanism?
[removed]
Demencial
Is it just me, or is getting surgery a little extreme?

Like I get the moral argument about not having kids, but I think that getting tubes removed is just doing the most for no reason.
So glad you dumbasses are deciding to not have children. We really don‚Äôt need anymore idiots in the world
That tattoo is terrible though
[removed]
Everyone on this sub is a crazy cat lady or man. If you want to worship and obsess over a pet cats are the worst of them all, they don‚Äôt give a shit about you. Your ‚Äúbaby‚Äù will never tell you they love you or they miss you. This is peak mental illness.
Yep, definitely a cult.
Best thing you could do is put the cat to sleep and put it away. I bet you recycle and offset that positive action by owning an animal. Secondly this is just like a natalist holding up their newborn for likes. I say again, Put it down and put it away.
What did they do? I got my tubes cut, tied, and burned but i only have a small scar under my belly button well its really faded now but still
cat is so adorable they looks like they have more energy idk why haha

and congratulations for your procedures it might have been difficult to get it done idk but I‚Äôve heard stories of doctors who refused to do it on women because ¬´¬†they might want kids someday so no¬†¬ª like wtf?! Anyway hope things are okay!!
Bolelo to?
Huzzah! Congrats and happy recovering :)
Congratulations!
what a precious kitty
Hey! Congratulations üéâ.
Here's to happy and quick healing.
Aw yasss.
Congrats!!! That‚Äôs one damn cute baby ahahah
Congrats!
Does it hurt? I am a guy and just curious because I will never know what it is like from a females perspective.
Freedom
RESPECT O7
Prune juice is your friend. Make sure you get those guts moving; stasis is no fun at all, and rummaging around in the abdomen can make the guts forget what they're supposed to be doing.
What a beautiful cat.
Your cat is just as proud of you as I am lol hoping for a fast recovery
More cuddles and treats for them!!!! <3
It‚Äôs all going to plan for kitty ü§≠ü•∞
Hi! I‚Äôm not OP but I got both tubes out in March. It really wasn‚Äôt bad at all! I‚Äôve been more sore after an intense workout at the gym (no machines just a crazy fitness coach making me do body weight exercises) and I was able to walk my dog for an hour 24 hours post surgery without it being an issue. My insurance (OHP community solutions) paid for all of it. Give your doctor a visit if you think this is what you want!
It hurts about as much as when you‚Äôve had a good abs workout the previous day. So, very mildly. :) I didn‚Äôt even need a painkiller. My procedure was a tubal ligation with partial tube removal.
Can't speak for OP, but I had a bisalp via laparoscopy and nope. I did squats to bend down and get medicine the same day. They encourage you to walk as part of your recovery, which tells me they expect a majority of patients to be able to walk right away (this held true for me). I basically just hung out for a week with my ice pack on my tummy to ease what felt like mild cramps, but it really wasn't as bad as I was expecting (or really bad at all, for that matter). 

My friend had the same procedure done and it was the same experience for her, too. Obviously, your results could vary, but I will say that the relief I feel would be worth it even if it was more painful.

Bonus (sorry if it's TMI): orgasms feel better for both of us now, but again, ymmv
Ditto. And I'm worried about early hitting menopause or other stuff
I had a tubal ligation in Sept 18, and the worst part was busting a staple laughing at An Idiot Abroad during recovery. Bellybutton scar is bigger because of it, but my life has been so much less stressful.
Genuinely the only thing that hurt afterwards was my shoulders! They did good with the meds

Edit: I am not sure why my shoulders hurt, that was just the only thing that did. They never did anything to them lol
They prescribed me oxytocin for my pain and I didn't even need to take it. My doctor said most people can't coast through the recovery on just Tylenol like I did but I did it without issue.
I'm not OP, but usually, they give you something to relax you pre-surgery and post-surgery pain killers that are not available OTC. I had mine done with laparoscopy, so there is no big incision. It's really not bad. I Think OP did. too. Well worth it! No early menopause because they left the ovaries intact. I actually wanted a hysterectomy, but my doctor told me it has a longer healing time.
I've had a laparoscopic complete hysterectomy and bilateral salpingovariectomy as part of my medical alignment due to transsexuality in April 2022, when I was 20 years old. Which means they took out my uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries. 

To begin with, this is a surgery. So yes, it hurts. There's no way around that. That said, the recovery was very quick for me compared to other surgeries I had. I was able to do most things fine a week after surgery and it was only mildly inconvenient a month post-op. I'm talking stretching your back or bending down to pick things up. Running, too. 

My scars are almost not visible anymore (I do have stomach hair though, which helps) and I suffered no consequences whatsoever.  The whole surgery was done in one and a half hours and very mild in comparision with my mastectomy, for example. 

If I could choose again, I would do it exactly as I did. No regrets here.
I got mine out in January, and the only pain that was actually painful was from my shoulder. Apparently Trapped gas they fill into your stomach, can travel up and cause nerve pain in the shoulder. But it goes away.
I just had it done last year and I should've taken a solid week off of work. I found it to be pretty painful at the incision site for which I used advil and Tylenol. I opted out of narcotics. You're able to walk right after and everything but I'd definitely prep some snacks and a comfy spot with everything you need, for when you get home.
If you are white it does not hurt and is very recommendable!
I had a tubal ligation = my fallopian tubes severed by cauterization; nothing changes hormonally, but eggs can no longer reach uterus.
Laparoscopic hysterectomy if I had to guess, my gf wants it done but she‚Äôs worried about hormone complications and other side effects.  I‚Äôm hoping I can just get a vasectomy but apparently those can reverse themselves randomly.
Will do! She is an absolute treasure, my pride and joy.
Still suffering though
You can always get yourself a vasectomy?  Lol
Likewise to you! It has been going super smoothly for me so far.
In my location (Czechia), it is the right of any woman of age to request this procedure, and it was fairly cheap (600 USD). I‚Äôm 26, no children, and I faced zero pushback. If you have the option to travel, I‚Äôm sure you could get it done as well!
Bingo, Russian Blue girl. üòä
Ooh, interesting! I don‚Äôt mind the stitches though.
Thank you and congratulations! ü§ç
Mine too!
Working on it!
Only one doctor, they cannot deny you if you‚Äôre over 18 years old in my location (Czechia). It is only required that you request the surgery twice with at least 14 day in between, to prevent rash decisions.
You have a good taste then! üòé
Hi, sure! The recovery process has been very smooth. I had my surgery on Wednesday morning, woke up in the post-op ICU, dozed on and off for a couple of hours, then the nurses asked me to try to stand and walk around. The pain was very mild, comparable to sore muscles after a good abdominal workout. I only took an ibuprofen on Wednesday and another one yesterday. The place under my collarbones hurt a bit on the day of the surgery because of the laproscopy gas gathering there, a usual occurence. No digestive issues. I stayed one night at the hospital, was promptly released in the morning. My stomach is still a little tender, I avoid sudden stretching/straining, but otherwise I‚Äôm back to normal function. I just had to run to catch a train, haha, it was no problem.
Thank you, I‚Äôm excited to enjoy the benefits to the fullest once it‚Äôs healed! üòä
Good luck, it‚Äôs not too unpleasant at all!
Bilateral salpingectomy, I had the same suregery last year
Her name is Maya, sometimes also Little Rascal.
Haha, no, I have zero kids. It‚Äôs a lovely slender belly when it‚Äôs not swollen/bruised post-surgery, not that it would be any of your business. üòâ
Guess you haven‚Äôt met many women. Having a little belly is normal.
Fr
Just stay here and grab some popcorn it WILL get funny over time I promise
Do enlighten me, how is a light-hearted celebration post about getting a permanent anticonception surgery trolling on an antinatalist sub? There‚Äôs not many places I can find kindred spirits about this issue, you know.
It‚Äôs actually not that bad! Less painful than a hardcore ab workout.
Just what this sub needed, pointless racism
Racist
It‚Äôs not necessary, that‚Äôs why you generally pay for it yourself even in my country which has free health care. It‚Äôs a voluntary upgrade from other means of contraception ‚Äì no foreign bodies or hormones in my body, less exposure to latex lubricants which disrupt the vaginal microflora (unless I‚Äôm sleeping with a new, untested partner of course), zero chance of failure.
Haha, no, I do not really treat her like a baby, that‚Äôs kind of the point of not having children. I simply enjoy her company and cuddles, same as with my favourite fellow humans.
Wtf.

What the fuck is your problem
It‚Äôs actually the best option once you‚Äôre sure you don‚Äôt want children. Ironically enough, I‚Äôm an expert in reproductive biology, I teach it at the uni and it is safe to say that all other means of contraception are more invasive in the long run as they involve introducing foreign bodies (IUDs work by inducing a chronic inflammation around themselves, not something you want to have in your womb if you don‚Äôt have to), substances (condoms very often disrupt vaginal microflora) and hormones to the body‚Äôs highly finetuned system. They are also much more likely to fail.
Banning abortions are extreme. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I don't want kids and I would never want to kill a kid with an abortion so why is that the most?
Rape exists and 1 out of 5 women will be raped, if I don‚Äôt want to use the factory why keep it open?

I suspect you have not experienced cat ownership, you can very much tell what opinion a cat has of a person or that they miss someone.  However, this is a light-hearted post, I do not actually ‚Äúbaby‚Äù my cat and I do have a very rich social life among fellow humans (love life, friends, shared interest communities and family).

Nope, I‚Äôm not that kind of an antinatalist (ecoantinatalist, if you will). I‚Äôll put her to sleep once her life becomes permanently more suffering than pleasure, same as myself.
Wtf is wrong with you
Y'all are fucking insane, like full stop. Get help, go see a therapist and fix whatever issues mommy and daddy gave you growing up.

Didn't think anti-natalists were about murder
Similar! They cauterized my tubes in two places and removed the segment between them to ensure no spontaneous reconnection.
Thank you! Luckily in my country, autonomy is enforced and they cannot refuse to perform it for a woman of age if she so wishes.

I first read that and took it as a double entendre lol did u mean it like thatüòÇ
Thank you for your perspective, and I'm glad you're feeling great.

I got a salpingectomy scheduled in December, Planned Parenthood is referring the surgery center and Family PACT is covering the costs (California).
Hysterectomy is different or no?
Dies it actually stop you from getting a period?
I concur. I had a complete hysterectomy with removal of cervix ovaries floating tubes and and uterus as well. Did  have to leave one ovary intact but it was still disconnected from everything else. It just was adhered to my intestinal walls and it was deemed more dangerous to take it out than to leave it in.

I have PCOS and always had basically messy cycles and a lot of bleeding and there was a lot of scarring and it still took quite some time to convince a doctor to just take it all out because I was not ever going to want a child nor was I going to be able to have a child. So it was just a bunch of malfunctioning equipment taking up a lot of my bodies, nutrients and time and healing.

I only add this bitin to give you a little bit of perspective on what it felt like for me. I don't feel like it was really painful at all to recover from it. I had a slight bit of cramping but honestly my cycles before everything was just simply removed. Had been very painful. I had already had an ablation which did not do the trick in terms of relieving pain and issues with my cycle. So for me this was a great relief. If everything is on the up and up with your reproductive health, it might seem like relatively more pain to you, but honestly I think we're talking Tylenol level here.
Awesome! üòä
Does that cause early menopause? Every single gyno I've ever seen insists that fussing around with my ovaries/tubes/etc = early onset menopause and won't do it for me. :(

EDIT: NVM, I see this was addressed a few comments down!
[deleted]
No worries about that. You only would hit menopause if they took out the ovaries too. Cutting out the Fallopian tubes will not cause menopause. :)
Fallopian tubes have nothing to do with hormones
Hey, I responded to your parent comment with some info about my own bisalp experience if you're curious, but you won't hit early menopause if you get a tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy (what I suspect OP got via laparoscopy), or even a hysterectomy. Those all block the tubes or remove the tubes, or remove the uterus (respectively). Doctors will most likely leave your ovaries intact if you're just looking for sterilization, and having your ovaries removed is what would trigger menopause.
Don‚Äôt mutilate your hormone production parts pleeease. There are plenty of effective ways to prevent pregnancy that don‚Äôt carry so much risk and pain and side effect potential.
Same
Oh my god, Karl is a fucking godsend.üçä üôå
Its from the gas they use to inflate the abdomen so they can see inside and from the upside down positioning on the table.
I think there's a nerve that's aggravated when they inflate your torso and it makes your shoulders hurt. Mine hurt too. It's common for this surgery.

Edit: I THINK being the keyword here. Maybe look it up
I worry about getting addicted to it
Do you still get periods? I want something permanent after my IUD expires in 4 years but I definitely don't want a period again
Hiya, no hormone changes will occur so long as the ovaries are left inside during any procedure (they most likely will be, my understanding is doctors are reluctant to remove those for that very reason). If she wants it done, I would encourage her to speak with her doctor about it. I also don't believe they will perform a hysterectomy via laparoscopy, I think they do a large incision for that one. But I believe they typically will do either a tubal ligation or bisalp via laparoscopy (I'd encourage her to ask about bisalp as lower risk of pregnancy *and* cancer afterwards). 

I had a bilateral salpingectomy done via laparoscopy and it really wasn't a bad experience, plus now I have peace of mind. That said, if you want a vasectomy, I encourage you to go for it too! The peace of mind taking control of your own body is very validating.
Modern vasectomies use multiple steel clamps on each cut end of the vas deferens and then those ends are cauterized. Even if a spontaneous reversal were to occur (which is *highly* unlikely), no sperm would ever make it past the clamps. As long as you wait to get cleared by your doc (they'll test a sample after 6 weeks or so), you're not going to get your girl pregnant.
I always say my cat is the only son i'll ever have hahaha
This fucking troll again üôÑ.  No one waste your time on this idiot.   Can we ban people, mods???
Sorry to hear that! What is the recovery time from your surgery? It gets worse before it gets better, thankfully! üòÑ
I know, lol, but it‚Äôs expensive
Damn, even cheaper than a vasectomy! Glad to hear that the process is no different for women here as well (just the 14 day wait before the procedure)!
Wow! My mama was born Czech Prague in 67 and her family lost everything when the communists took it all. She moved to the states and had never come back despite me wanting to go with her. You Czech ladies have more reproductive rights than us in the US! How I long to see my mom‚Äôs county, how do you love living there?
I‚Äôm in the process of getting it done too, didn‚Äôt really face any obstacles either as the OB-GYN I saw was absolutely understanding and supportive ! I‚Äôm 25, no children and a virgin still because of how scared I am of ever being pregnant. The only thing is that it costs over 2500 USD in my country, and it‚Äôs not covered by insurance or any parental plan of any sort‚Ä¶
She‚Äôs beautiful! My daughter can‚Äôt have children due to medical issues but she and her partner gave me a gorgeous tortie fluffy boy grandchild and I could not be more proud. Congratulations on your lovely girl xx
Russian blues are the best! I had a blue boy growing up and he was my baby and best buddy.
Very cool, thanks so much for sharing all of that information! I definitely feel a bit better about it now. I‚Äôd probably end up getting a full hysto which is obviously very different, but even if I just went this route that would be fine too. Shedding the light on it definitely makes the idea less scary!
Can you tell Maya I love her?
Sure it ain‚Äôt my business but you posted your abdomen online.

What is it?
That... actually makes sense, fair enough.
That's fair
Oh please you‚Äôre only antinatalist because you‚Äôre gay
Why would I want to be part of an incel cult lmao.
Eco as in ecology or economically. I‚Äôm assuming ecology, but you are keeping an animal that is detrimental to our ecology? I don‚Äôt follow that logic.
I tend not to be a hypocrite.
The fact you don‚Äôt see any irony in this post at all speaks volumes. Lifestyle AN. You may be the one with mum and dad issues I‚Äôd wager. Plus your AN complaints of a terrible world whilst supporting a drain on it‚Äôs resources is hypocritical. pick and choose what you stand for by all means, but expect to be called out on it.
How is it unhinged? Firstly I don‚Äôt believe death to be bad. Benatar himself admits that could possible be the case. Therefore putting down a cat in my view will logically reduce its suffering. Secondly, owning an animal is a selfish act, it contributes a significant amount to a persons carbon footprint, whilst offering no social benefit and increasing suffering for us all. Thirdly a main reason not to bring a child into existence is often  future environmental factors. So being part of a philosophy that believes that, whilst simultaneously creating the conditions for that to occur appears to me to be highly hypocritical. Finally, is it not ironic that the same sub that mocks natalist for showing or discussing their virtuous births is praising someone showing a procedure supporting the virtue of not creating existence, both designed to garner internet praise. What is inco-fucking-herent about that. Hypocrite.
I‚Äôm not AN. My point is surrounding the hypocrisy of AN shown in this picture. One owning an animal which is suffering for selfish reasons. As I believe death is a neutral state and not bad the logic follows that suffering must be ended (I personally don‚Äôt hold this view as I‚Äôm not AN. 2. Owning an animal that contributes to ecological problems they use as a reason not to have children and 3. Showing an image exclaiming the virtue of non existent children procedure, just as a natalist would show a picture of their existing baby‚Ä¶.for likes. Something ridiculed at length on this sub
Thats crazy tho they put so many cuts..one little horizontal is all i got. I dont know if its different cuz i got it done the morning after i had my daughter. Id be so scared of that one thru the belly button. Im glad you got your surgery and never have to worry again, hunüíïhere's to a speedy recovery.  Your baby is beautiful btw
Me too, exact same ‚úåÔ∏èü§ó
Do they give you any pain relievers or put you under??
Stock up on some jolly ranchers and popsicles to have afterwards in case your throat is sore like mine was!
A salpingectomy is removal of both tubes, while a hysterectomy is removal of the uterus, sometimes including the tubes and/or ovaries and/or cervix.

I can imagine the more is removed, the more sore you are due to more or bigger wounds on the inside.
Nope. I still bleed because I still have a uterus and ovaries. The tubes were removed that connect the ovaries to the uterus so I still ovulate (I didn‚Äôt want to start the menopause process early so I kept those) but since I don‚Äôt have fallopian tubes the egg just kind of floats around until my body reabsorbs it. Since there‚Äôs no egg to be fertilized getting pregnant is impossible.
No, it does not, there will be no hormonal change. The fallopian tubes are simply disconnected, but even if they were removed, it‚Äôs the ovaries and uterus that produce hormones. I didn‚Äôt go to a gyno ambulance, I contacted a hospital that had the procedure in their price list directly. Also, in my location (Czechia, EU) a physician can‚Äôt deny you this procedure if you‚Äôre of age and have expressed the wish twice at least 14 days apart. I‚Äôm 26, no children, and I faced no pushback, trying to talk me out of it etc. Only the mandatory ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù
The belly button incision is usually where they insert the laparoscope (the camera and light). The side incisions is where they enter the small surgery instruments to do the work. It‚Äôs actually unusual that you DIDN‚ÄôT have the belly button incision.
I'd like to add that sometimes, a hysterectomy also includes removal of the tubes, and/or cervix, and/or ovaries. 

>having your ovaries removed is what would trigger menopause.

In all cases, this is true.
Straight facts.
Oh neat! I was wondering why that was! Thank you
I had the same surgery and was told to expect that but luckily did not experience it myself
I understand. I come from a family of addiction. I grew up around that shit. I'm probably genetically predisposed to succumb to addiction. Which is a huge, HUGE reason I didn't take it, along with not wanting to build a tolerance to it at all as well as just not wanting to take an unnecessary drug when Tylenol worked fine for me. 

You'll be okay though. Just take it following your doctor's instructions and don't worry too much. I think for the VAST majority of people it takes a lot more than just taking it for a few days/a week to become addicted, especially if you're taking it at the correct amount and intervals.
I do, but you can ask to have your uterus removed as well (hysterectomy) and then you would not get them. It would mess with your hormones though.
Uterine ablation is an option as well
I‚Äôm not the OP. I meant the cat existing.
In the US there are lots of ways to get it for free ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Oh wow what?? Why can‚Äôt I get this in the us? What country are you living in?
We sure do! It‚Äôs not exactly hard to have more reproductive rights than in the US. I‚Äôve travelled a lot and Czechia is seriously one of the best places to live, on par with Scandinavia. I especially appreciate the secularism of the Czech society, free education, high-quality free essential healthcare and affordable non-essential healthcare, beautiful living environments and bustling culture scene in every city. 

When it comes to sterilization, a person has to request it at least 14 days before the procedure, to make sure it‚Äôs not a rash decision, but that‚Äôs the only restriction.
the US is very conservative compared to many EU countries.
Ah, sorry then! Thank you, some people are just mean.
It certainly varies from woman to woman, but it was true for me and it seems to be true for the majority of women who have shared their bisalp experiences. I religiously read about sterilization procedures and experiences on the daily!
Dude sent a death threat, so I reported him
Thank you for reading with an open mind, it‚Äôs not easy or taken for granted! :)
I might be gay but that has nothing to do with Antinatalism, so go on, keep showing everyone how stupid you are though.
I don't know; Antinatalists aren't incels so you tell us what's wrong with you then.

Do you... do you think she gave birth to the cat? It's not literally her baby. It has very little to do with AN. And why would you assume the cat is suffering?
It‚Äôs really not that invasive, I‚Äôm glad that they did it in this surefire way rather than the single-spot cauterization. Thank you! ü§ç
Not sure about OP, but it seems like I had the same procedure as OP, which is done with robots. ü§ñ  That's where they put in some of the surgical bits, then remove before surgery is done.  It's actually very minimally invasive, considering (although certainly not as minimal as a vasectomy!).
It‚Äôs done in general anesthesia, no painkillers beyond a pill of ibuprofen needed afterwards though.
Thanks ‚ô°
I had a hyst and it was not really painful at all. Especially compared to a period, it was a breeze. It was laparoscopic and I had four tiny incisions so external healing was fast. (Edit cause duh)
You're welcome. I'm trying to get the same thing done for myself.
Okay, thank you!! I'm not predisposed to it, but I still have a fear.
My pain tolerance is really low. And I'm not really a pill person. But I everyone says the recovery hasn't been bad.
That would be amazing for me. My hormones are fucked anyways üòÇ

Like, even if I wanted a child it would be a big problem for me to get pregnant since my body doesn't really understand how hormones work.

I've literally had chest hair grow and deeper voice development at one point because my body made the wrong hormones... And now it doesn't know what to do with a period. It's on and off and on again, then it's off for 3 or 4 months... Then it's 2 days, and next time it's a month. I've had a period lasting for almost 6 months straight (with heavy bleeding some days and light bleeding on other days) and I've had them lasting just under a day.

Getting them out I think would be an amazing solution. I don't want children and I don't care if I'd look more manly because of the hormones. 

I don't even care if I'd be a man or a woman... I've littrally had talks with my parents if it would be an idea to fake being trans to get them out and they said they'd support me if that's what I want and I'm still somehow thinking about it.
Lmao! My bad, I have a nasty habit of speed reading.
> In my location (Czechia)
Czechia also has excellent gun rights, for what it's worth.
Wow it really sounds amazing! I wonder if I could ever get some dual citizenship from my Mama? I don‚Äôt have much family alive in Czech. However I would love to see it one day.
It's a major surgery. I had it done as well. I wouldn't say it's as chill as sore abs or anything like that.
Ah, I was actually wondering what that string of numbers was but looked it up and apparently it's just a reddit glitch with deleted comments. But uh, yeah that's fucked up
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want kids‚Äù but you can‚Äôt have kids because of your sexual preference. It has everything to do with Antinatalism.
Yea because it‚Äôs strange as fuck to follow up this type of operation by writing a message about your cat on your stomach, then posting it on Reddit. 

Fuckin weirdos.
I‚Äôm not a hypocrite. That‚Äôs what is wrong with me. Relative to everyone here hypocrisy is obviously the norm so not being a hypocrite must be what is wrong. Please keep up. 
Your morality is being challenged. It‚Äôs understandable you can‚Äôt handle it. Your AN viewpoint cannot support what has been shown here without being hypocritical. If you can‚Äôt see that, you have the problem not me. You‚Äôve not thought it through fully obviously.
Your use of Dawg also speaks volumes. Not sure how it‚Äôs incoherent. You are supporting someone who is keeping a pet that is a selfish drain on resources of the planet, this will increase suffering of existing humans, as well as prolong suffering for the animal itself. Whilst you no doubt would agree that the ecological disaster that awaits us is a good reason not having children, you support something that is helping create these circumstances more likely to arise. You, I‚Äôm afraid, haven‚Äôt thought enough about the philosophy you choose to champion and have lost any ability to take a moral stance.
I‚Äôm not comparing cats to babies. Although you argue for AN should to relate to all sentient life, which I happen to believe. I am relating the ownership of a cat to be incoherent to other stated AN values. The cat has nothing to do with the final point about showing the procedure. Do you not see a hypocrisy of this sub belittling people on other subs whilst praising exactly the same content here just in reverse?
I‚Äôm not saying the cat is her baby. AN is 
also relatable to all sentient life. Not just human life. This is a widely understood view.
Thank you so much!
That sounds so good! I am very happy that I was wrong. Four tiny incisions is not what Iwould have guessed.
Laparoscopic*

Laparo- comes from the Greek word for abdomen. Ortho- is the prefix for bones (e.g. orthopedic surgeon), and orthoscopic surgery would be looking inside a bone using a scope, which is not really a thing that is done. Arthroscopic surgery (arthros being from the Greek word for joint; think "arthritis," literally inflammation [-itis] of the joints [arthros]) is a thing that is done by orthopedic surgeons.

It is indeed a major surgery, which is why I was surprised that recovering wasn‚Äôt too bad. I didn‚Äôt mean to simplify the whole thing. The pain for me did not surpass the pain I get from an ab workout. This certainly isn‚Äôt the case for everyone though.

I think not. You don‚Äôt like your superior morality challenged, simple as that. You feel you are apex. Uncomfortable isn‚Äôt it when that gets thrown back at you.
Hypocrite
Er‚Ä¶.no. I think you have poor understanding of the points at hand and Please show where I have compared a cat to a baby. AN as per Benatar relates to sentient creatures.
No, in this case the cat already exists, it has been brought into existence and is therefore suffering according to AN. It‚Äôs not about future cats. Personally I believe that AN is a pro mortalist philosophy so the logic would be it‚Äôs better to kill the cat in painless manner now if you believed that sort of thing. They would argue that point, death is always worse than suffering etc, but that seems incredibly contradictory. So that‚Äôs the bit about killing the cat. I don‚Äôt think the cat should be killed I just think it hypocritical to keep an animal in suffering if that‚Äôs your world view. 

Owning a pet obviously contributes to ecological problems. I can‚Äôt remember the figures off hand but humans keeping pets have a significant effect on the environment. AN often cites ecological problems as to why they wouldn‚Äôt bring someone into the world or further, it‚Äôs selfish. A cat is quite a luxury given the AN view above. Its selfish as well and contributes to the exact problem they cite as a reason for their AN belief. But they like cats do it‚Äôs fine to forget about those things.
Have you checked out the childfree sub? They have a list of doctors willing to do sterilization all over the world.
Ah so your just a dipshit with zero iq, got it. Everyone who's reading this feel free to report this dumbass and get them banned faster ü•∞
stop embarrassing yourself damn
[edited]
Move. On. Kid.
[edited]
"kill everything painlessly because it might suffer at some point" is not and never will be a winning point.
Yep. I did. I actually emailed the mods at one point because one of the Drs on the list I called had moved out of state. I have a consult appt in Jan for one of the others that was in his same office who seemed willing to do it.
You‚Äôre so cute. You can‚Äôt ban me for telling someone to not be an asshole. Rethink your choices.
You just want the last word. I‚Äôm not a kid, I‚Äôm old enough not to use ‚ÄòDawg‚Äô anymore unlike yourself, kid.
Firstly stop calling me bro and dawg and shit like that. 

Secondly. I find it an interesting subject. And it has very strong arguments. Usually let down by the people in here who don‚Äôt understand what their thought processes mean. Such as the OP and yourself. 

Now, What has saying the cat should be put down got to do with comparing it to a baby? It is a sentient creature separate from a baby that suffers the exact same logic that AN applies to it. It isn‚Äôt a baby. 

So what if the cats adopted? You mean it now has a life worth living? Well if you hold with Benatar that death is the ultimate ‚Äòbad‚Äô and thus life is worth pursuing once you exist, then great. The cat lives to fight another day. I don‚Äôt believe that. I believe that at the point of death it is neutral. At this point if this is true, (Benatar admits this, as it is the thing he is most unsure about.) then it leads to pro-mortalism. He admits then he would have to hold that view. In this case the cat should die. 

The second point is about the hypocrisy of having a luxury (a cat) that is increasing suffering (ecology) whilst using that increase suffering as a reason not to have children. Again the cat and the child are not being compared here. The cat is causing causing a situation where someone decides it is not advisable to give birth.

3. Remove the cat from the photo. It is still analogous to someone holding a picture of their child posing for their belief. Something often ridiculed here. Again no one is comparing a cat to a baby.

Byebye now
And yet that is the logical progression of AN depending on your philosophical view on death. As I don‚Äôt believe in AN or post mortalism I would agree with you and it‚Äôs of no concern to me. If however you do agree with AN then it is a danger you risk. It is the point Benatar is most unsure of and freely admits if he‚Äôs wrong and death is not bad then he would have to adopt the pro mortalism view on killing humanity as being the preferred. Not my words.
Ah I see. Good that you emailed the mods to update that. I hope your consult appointment goes well next year! Stand your ground! Wishing you the best :)
Lmfao I'm not a mod, all I said was for people to report you so you CAN get banned. I take it reading comprehension isn't your strong suite.
Move. On. Kid.

Looking into Benatar's views it just looks like someone putting a lens on the worst possible stuff to try and make everything as depressing as possible... No wonder ANs have the reputation they do

Just make sure you watch Fire Walk With Me between season 2 and 3 and don't watch it before episode 1.
Whoa! *major spoiler*!!!
Grab a log and get comfy.
Even the beef chow mein ones

finished watching episode 3 last night, cried every time Laura‚Äôs theme started playing. the scene with the Tibet method of deduction almost made me die laughing. that first dream sequence is genius!!

im not a fan of fish in my coffee either
I think it's much better to watch fire walk with me between season 1 and 2! But that's just my opinion.
Ugh. I really don't care for that, it's meaningless, forced 'If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands!' fun.

Sorry, but it's like the least fun person's idea of fun. I'd switch that off if I could. And I don't mean this certain cynicism.
Why you telling me what to do, you don‚Äôt kill yourself . Second why you asking what to expect while Simultaneously saying that you haven‚Äôt been spoiled anything , on the twin peaks subreddit lol anywho your in for great acting , good writing , and Nepal teachings
For a first-time viewer??? That would just completely spoil the show.
Nah no worries, I find the place mannerable enough and go around with far more positivity than I do in public as a result. I don't spend enough time here to get jaded by it, I tend to avoid socials, so I understand. If I wish someone a happy birthday it's because I saw someone else do that. When you're dealing with people in the hundreds, you don't have time to do it. It's another example. Have a good one mate ‚úåüèª
He ate the spice, but refuses any prescience that reveales any part of season 3, obviously!
average reddit post
Don't know, that's how I did it and didn't regret it.
Funnily, I'm not a negative person in public - if anything I'm obnoxiously chipper most of the time, I just love the things I love and have that same sort of passion in dismissing things I don't.

I don't think we have to be 'positive vibes only' (I tried for a stretch, it was mostly great, but I found myself just adapting into passive aggressiveness, which is what I see happen with almost everyone who tries).

I don't think we're all that different really, I just think people are irked by different things. I happily embrace it!

By the way, I love being wished happy birthday. It's specifically the 'here's the day you made an account for this website!' that I'm not a fan of, because it feels inauthentic, and its inauthenticity that I feel passionately about.
I don‚Äôt even know what the hell you just said lol
I watched the movie first because I wasn't aware of the show lmao. Honestly I don't think it ruined it for me at all. Just gave me a slightly different perspective on it.
Sorry, I've been getting into the Dune novels lately. Still prefer Lynch's adaption tbh
No bruh I‚Äôm sorry I ain‚Äôt Lynch enough to catch h the reference ! I only hear good things about the Lynch adaption I don‚Äôt know much about it . On a personal note I just watched inland empire and I wasn‚Äôt a fan lol
Thanks for reminding me to watch Inland Empire! Heard mixed reviews for that one, I gotta get on it at some point
It's the only way you'll learn about the Inland God Emperor.
Trying to create a baby ruins lives
Yet these people will scoff in your face and get offended when you suggest adoption. 
Regardless of whether you‚Äôre antinatalist or not, the low rate of success and tremendous trauma that comes with fertility treatments is something that should be more widely known about. People think if you can‚Äôt have kids you can ‚Äújust do ivf‚Äù and there are hordes of people who have only found out the truth when in situations like this person‚Äôs.
The lengths people will go to not adopt
If they really wanted a kid that bad for that money they could have given a wonderful life to a child waiting to be adopted.
üéª
I can't imagine spending all that money and not once pausing and considering other options. Fostering, adoption, kittens....
To think there are people that bang once and accidentally make a kid, RIP this ladies bank account
this is seriously mental
Ok but heres the real tea, what if the last, the very last embryo took.

What would you have left after gambling your life away to make said child‚Ä¶ how would you afford to take care of the child after?
People are waayyy too obsessed with having biological children
Impressive that she lost all those things WITHOUT having a child, as well lol
Imagine what good that $165k could have produced if it was used to contribute to society rather than be wasted in a baby making lab. It's so privileged and tone deaf

Edit: She just posted a follow up tweet saying she is going to block and report anyone who brings up adoption to her
\*deep breath\* I absolutely cannot stand the victim act/martyrdom. YOU willingly put yourself through this multiple times. You CHOSE to spend enough money to buy a house to try to reproduce. You could have chosen at *any point* to stop this.
Having a baby is already an outrageous scam when it's for *free;* imagine paying 165k for it ...and still not getting it . People are so stupid ü§£
IVF is informed gambling. Of course you were going to lose money. So why are you complaining.
There‚Äôs something so frustrating seeing people that desperate for a child, but that much against adoption. 165k is well beyond the lifetime cost of raising a child. Flushed down the toilet. I still feel bad seeing a person‚Äôs life in shambles, but, RIP a kid in need missing out on a rich family wanting to raise a child because it just had to be ‚Äòtheirs‚Äô.
What really gets me mad is that we have some people coming after abortion rights, saying that life begins at conception. But then those same people got upset when Alabama fucked with IVF.

If you seriously believe life begins at conception, then this woman and countless more are mass murderers. I would like to see some consistency, but I know that‚Äôs a lost hope
165,000$ would change so many lives but just create a new one with the same problems I guess.
Imagine using that money to buy a boat.
Selfish. You don‚Äôt want a family you want a designer pet.
This was a risk of IVF when you started it, it's not a guaranteed way of conceiving. There's always a chance your body just says no.
I'll never understand people that actively chooses to go through this hellish thing
That is an absurd amount of money!
[removed]
Is there a reason people don‚Äôt want to adopt? 
I feel bad but I feel like this is a self inflicted problem.
If I was trying to get pregnant and the first go was a bust I would think, "okay that was probably a fluke." Second try was a bust? "Okay that's it...I'm not meant to have kids, I hear you loud and clear now universe. Time to give up and focus on other more important things." I can't imagine then going to dump thousands of dollars just to try. The free version wasn't working I can't imagine being desperate enough to spend actual money when the free version failed. I've never been desperate for anything that would make me say, "spend whatever...I need this now!" Ridiculous and crazy!
Could have adopted‚Ä¶
Why do people insist to keep trying for a kid when their body is telling them that they cant
Jesus if you have that much money to burn just adopt
I honestly am incapable of understanding why someone would try this hard to get pregnant.
ADOPT.
MUH LEGACY.
These people are paying to be burdened with responsibilities of another human!?? How stupid can these people be! üôÑ
Having kids is not that great if I could do it over I for sure  wouldn‚Äôt had any for sure
But you know, you have to have a stable income and be of known good standing (yeah, there are procedures but that's the gist in most countries.) to adopt.




It is clearly an an unfair and unrealistic bar and obviously going below that won't dissuade me from trying to make my own. /s
I want to feel bad for her‚Ä¶but I honestly just can‚Äôt.
This is just sad. All of this for another human that‚Äôs selective to being born?? Is it really THAT important and to die for?? This is quite disturbing, actually.
Listen to your body
Adoption is more expensive than it should be, but this? This is insane. Same amount of money could have brought a loving home to multiple kids, specifically siblings.
I went to the thread and they said 

>When I lost my son at 18 weeks, everyone either 1. said the wrong thing (someone actually made jokes about it) or 2. they ignored me and hoped I'd get over it and be fun again.

>I lost 90% of my friends because they didn't know how to just say "Hey I'm here for you."

90%????? There's no way... Well there is. I don't think I could be friends with someone self destructing like that. Especially since she makes it clear it's all she cares about and it's her identity

Hope she gets help my God it's so tragic that people will go to these lengths for some stupid societal expectations. Humans are much more than baby making machines

Edit: there's more

>Adoption was my FIRST choice, but I wasn't elligible to adopt being single, with a mediocre income, poor credit, etc. They wouldn't even consider me.
Same with fostering, the house I owned at the time could not be made safe to foster standards.
I don‚Äôt understand the need to try to have a kid when your body is screaming ‚Äúno‚Äù through a process like this. It seems insane to me.
It‚Äôs almost like she could‚Äôve adopted an already live baby ü§î
What an avoidable problem lol
I have a friend who has definitely spent over $100k on IVF and literally has never had any implanted embryos, never had a real miscarriage, her body is literally not been capable of giving any sort of life to fertilized eggs and yet she still continues to try. I will never understand spending that kind of money on something that has time and time again been a complete failure
Gee, lady. It's super difficult for me to feel empathy because you did this to yourself. Instead of adopting a child who is left to rot somewhere... you wanted your priceless genes to live on because of vanity, ego, stupidity... Insane. Some people are so self-absorbed. So egocentric. What was it called when you're so in love with yourself? There was an adjective that escapes me...
$165k? Just adopt a child.
This is either mental illness or a religion that told her shes going hell if she doesnt create life.

how does ivf not have standards where if you go through enough troubles they cut you off? because natalists belief not having kids is the ultimate depression/sin for some reason
Imagine if her state passed the insane ‚Äúembryo personhood‚Äù laws and then she goes to jail on top of all of this. Only way it could be worse
i mean, you‚Äôd think the person would get the message that nature doesn‚Äôt want her to have a child. sheesh, the self entitlement of some people.
Will never understand why people would rather do this to themselves than adopt a beautiful and needy child that is alive right now and needs a loving family. I can‚Äôt with these people.
Randomly got recommended this post, I am absolutely dumbfounded that this person sold their house, moved in with their parents, and all just to have money to try again, like they have no money left, how will they pay for the child if it succeeds?
It fills my heart with joy to see that this person will never force someone to live a life and to be HER kid.

Holy fck is that a disgusting person lol
They could have adopted like 3 kids at that point. Breeders are so worthless.
Not to expose the original Twitter user but I saw this post on the tl as well and they had a Palestinian flag in their bio and my mind just instantly went to how desperately in need the country of Palestine is rn for aid and how many families have been destroyed by the missile strikes leaving children without their parents‚Ä¶couldn‚Äôt help but think the $165,000 worth of resources could‚Äôve went to a great cause and if this person wanted they maybe could‚Äôve found a way to adopt someone who is suffering as a result of this stupidly inhumane war
They‚Äôd do anything except adopt
Wish I was that infertile üôÑ
it makes me happy seeing the amount of entitlement people express blowing up in their face

hallelujah for their infertility
This is so sad. We are raised to believe our value comes from the ability to get pregnant and produce children. We all are valuable for we are and not as a mean for others to be
And all that for a kiddo who will be a 40 year old worker who works in a office with wage that only will be enough for himself lol
Yikes
God said NO! take the damn hint lol
Why do people feel the need to do this? I could never it‚Äôs the universe telling you you shouldn‚Äôt- if you were meant to have kids- they will happen. Adopt if you must- but your fighting nature to have science to the impregnating for you it‚Äôs weird.
Just adopt. For fucks sake.
That money could save so many existing childrens lives but no they have to have their "mini me"
They Could Spend All That Money In Party
Wow. Really could‚Äôve just adopted or fostered for that much. I got pregnant on accident and had a kid (also want to foster soon) so I can‚Äôt really shit on her too hard because I don‚Äôt understand her position but that‚Äôs insane to me. Such a waste of money that could‚Äôve gone to help a kid, or multiple kids, that is/are already alive and in need of a home ):
Wow consequences for people that want kids post Roe too just like the pro choice activists fuckin said there would be lel
I‚Äôm really just curious, even if she was able to conceive, 165,000$ is a lot, and combined with hospital expenses i wonder if she‚Äôd have enough money for the child afterwards.
Bruh, some people just won't give up
Never started.. the only good sentence or thought this naive breeder ever had(sorry but its so ridiculous to not adopt especial if ya chosen to not procreate)
Another indictment of existence that there are those who crave reproduction yet are sterile, while there are others who undergo medical procedures to nullify their fecundity.
honestly, why not adopt instead of going through all that pointless hassle and waste of resources
Anything to not have to adopt a filthy dumpster baby like I was.
I‚Äôll never not think that being infertile is nature‚Äôs way of telling you we shouldn‚Äôt make another of you, something is defective and it will make any children you have defective too. IVF is playing God and the definition of unnatural, yet people are STILL shocked when it doesn‚Äôt work. No shit! Your body is saying no we shouldn‚Äôt do this and you‚Äôre fighting tooth and nail to force it into something it can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt do
I could have put down a sizeable down payment on a house with that money! What the fuck?! Why waste money like this?!
I get it can be painful for some. 

But if you can‚Äôt have children the best thing to do is accept your fate and be happy. 

Having no children can be actually quite wonderful.
It's almost as if IVF is an incredibly bad idea.
Doctors are getting rich capitalizing on people's dreams.
This woman are way to dramatic there are billions of kids in this world who need a home go shopping for them‚Ä¶ üôÑ
I am SOOO against IVF it boils my blood. If these people care so much about having a baby, why won‚Äôt they STOP ACTIVELY KILLING THEIR EMBRYOS!!! Their body is clearly rejecting being pregnant. It‚Äôs a sign from the universe.
It's important to know your limit, when you should stop. Ideally before you reach that point. IVF is not guaranteed. The biggest advice I have for others struggling with infertility is to know your reasonable limit.
This makes me feel sad for her. That being said, maybe it's just that I've never wanted anything in my life bad enough to put myself through that pain, sacrifice my health and safety, AND cost me 6 figures. 

I don't know if I can have kids, never tried, and I don't plan on it. But my caveman brain that worries sometimes I might "regret it" later needs to remember that there are like, thousands of kids to adopt that need capable parental figures. Give em a chance since someone else forced them into existence. That much time and money and pain can go into an adoption process as well, I am fully aware, but again I would have stopped trying a long time before my life gets that messed up.
I WANNA SEE A MINI ME
Babies are people
They are not pets that can be breed like rabbits.
Being a mom is a gift and responsability, not a whim
And somehow my dumb tattoo decisions don‚Äôt seem so dumb anymore
The amount of money paid for this is crazy! In my country you pay max 2000usd for medicines and like around 200-300usd for consultations at the hospital for the first try. Meaning using up all the successful embryo gathered on the first trial. If those failed, the 2nd and 3rd will be for free. If all of these fail, then that's the time people will consider if they want to go private or not. (usually it works after some transfers). They even offer free couple's therapy (drop in).

In our country, we consider infertility as a medical issue that everybody should have access for treatments.


It's not the IVF that's the problem in this case. It's the health care system that you have in your country.
Damn, that is one traumatic and expensive lesson she learnt to realize that she couldn't conceive children via IVF.
I find it kinda gross when people choose IVF over adoption. Like really? So many kids need some good parents.
Hey, it‚Äôs kind of the same thing and cost as raising a child to 18 and them ‚Äúthrowing their whole life away‚Äù while you watch in horror refusing to realize they‚Äôre an autonomous being that doesn‚Äôt have to listen to you at all
Just adopt ffs
Yeah.. I‚Äôm an IVF baby. I‚Äôve had cancer twice, and recently my doctor brought to my attention something that could also be cancer again. Gone to multiple geneticists, and a few IVF clinics, and they all say that IVF most likely was the cause (the original clinic I was ‚Äúconceived‚Äù in has long since been shut down). I‚Äôm sure that the process has been improved now, and they can actually screen for cancers before hand, but at this point when people tell me about them wanting to start doing IVF, I tell them my medical history and how much it has cost me personally over the years, and then point out that adoption is a much better option. Not only are you potentially helping a child who deserves a home and loving family, but you are saving yourself years of going through this, saving a lot of money, and not putting someone through what I have and am still going through. 

Seriously, please go adopt. No one has cared about someone‚Äôs bloodline since medieval times.
For some reason, this whole IVF makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't want someone retrieving my eggs. It's just sooo... invasive.
but adoption isn't an option cause it's "too expensive"
Should have just adopted instead of being selfish and trying to use science to get pregnant.
All this when they could've just adopted an orphan. But nope, probably some weird complex about needing their OWN child. Natalists astound me
I seriously can't imagine being this stupid and wasteful.
I feel bad for this person
It's sad to see the anti-natalists having an overlap with anti-choicers.

Sucks to suck
Hmm
As an adopted person, lolz.
Wait, you guys have to pay for in vitro?
This people really hate adoption, huh?
Sucks to suck
This is so sad.
Jesus christ. this is absolutely unreasonable.
This is so selfish and unhinged. Imagine what all of that money could've gone to
Yeah I have tried to talk a few people into adoption and they either flat out refused or they only consider it if it's a brand new baby the same race as them. I worked in social services and there are so many awesome kids that are just sitting, waiting in group homes for someone, anyone, to give them a real home and love them.  

I feel guilty that I don't adopt myself but the truth is that I have NEVER wanted to have kids. I don't want to be a Mom. I can barely take care of myself, my poor dog is even not getting the attention he needs.
Just adopt jfc
90% of couples are completely satisfied on their choice of I‚Äôve. You just point out one sour example of someone that didn‚Äôt work for them. Ignoring the majority of people just to spin your narrative and confirmation bias
Oh yes she said she was blocking anyone who said adoption
This is a bit of a reach. Your opening sentence is a wild assumption. 

This person who is infertile and wants children failed.  Now they are sad and have consequences of medical treatment, therefore anyone who tries to make a baby has their life ruined ?
Trying to get a baby (this way)
Now rub their nose in it
You know after the 9th failed attempt, I might look for a surrogate mother for the tenth one, just an idea if you're that dead set
Sadist sub more like.
If I don't care about their feelings I bring up the topic of eugenics
Uhhh‚Ä¶adoption is not a solution to infertility. Just putting that out there.
Bruh downvote me all you want, But ya'll are crazily judging someone else for their choices when the entire point of this sub is to be a support group for people who don't wanna have kids.

If someone doesn't wanna adopt that's their choice. You all aren't going to have kids anyway so why do you have your panties in a twist?
I would actually like to adopt if me and my sweetie can't have one naturally or at least IVF... Or a surrogate for at least my genes (She really wants to give me at least one bio baby for my side)

Honest to everything, I'd go down this path too if my sweetie wants to. We're just realistic and we'll know if it ain't gonna happen, it ain't gonna happen and we'll adopt some. Those will likely be older kids to adopt anyways, we hate how the system will fuck them up if they're not cute or young enough.
One example among the many who will say IVF is the best thing that happened to them, but I do agree with adopting first.
Well life's not supposed to be easy
Absolutely and I do commend her for attempting to shed some honest light on that for people who don't know the reality, which I believe was one purpose in her posting her experience. Sad that she had to learn the hard way and I hope it informed others!
People will ruin the lives of themselves and even worsen those of others before they ‚Äúresort to‚Äù adoption.
This is just another example of shitty US Healthcare. The success rate of IVF in women under 35 is about 40% wth each transfer.
It shouldn't cost half a life's savings.

If she had 7 miscarriages there's another underlying issue that her doctor's should have informed her about. But I assume if they have such prices for IVF then they'd rather sell her yet another try.

And I do agree, people, especially with such conditions should really be more accepting of adoption.
I feel it's downright medical negligence at this point? Who let her keep trying if they knew that it was impossible??
If they want a kid so much they should just adopt, I have no sympathy for these people
IVF is horrible.¬†


Wonder how old the OP is?
God forbid people research such an intensive, invasive, and expensive procedure
Muh legaaacy!
"Adopting is expensive!"
Meanwhile infertile breeders:
But don't you understand how goddamn special THEIR genes are?
What‚Äôs crazy is this lady could have adopted 4 brand new babies with 165k. She could have had her dream family, if she wasn‚Äôt closed minded. She chose to put herself through IVF for no reason. How am I supposed to feel bad for that ?
Anyone wanna break down how many kids you could support adopting with $165k?  
  
  
  
lmao watch it be like less than one, exposing how much I've invested into learning about the cost of/having a kid
Literally came here to say the exact same thing. Working in the foster care system it honestly infuriates me that people don‚Äôt consider adoption or at least fostering if they are dedicated to loving a child and making a family. Not that people have to pay for others mistakes or whatever but come on, that much money for nothing but trauma.
That‚Äôs why I laugh at these posts. They have no empathy but want folks to feel bad for them.
As an adopted kid, yeah
People like this are upsetting. But I was also adopted by people who ended up never seeing me as their child, so people like this who are so obsessive over having their own children would maybe pass on the trauma of the kid not truly being theirs like mine did. So maybe it's better that they obsess like this without further hurting an already self-conscious child who feels unwanted.
Some woman just want the attention pregnancy gives and once the baby is here and the jew baby attention wears off they resent the children.
It‚Äôs not so simple. Not everyone is allowed to adopt. In some countries the number of people who want to adopt surpasses the number of adoptable children. Adopting from other countries is a whole other beast which brings its own moral pitfalls.
Too bad she's blocking everyone who gives her that suggestion because she wants her own genes
Yeah but then that would mean she actually cares about children. Clearly all she cares about is herself and her huge ego.
Multiple children, siblings who are risking being slipt up for life
Ever wondered they don't want to adopt? just like people here don't want to have a kid?
Not small enough
And then don't even want the kid. The world is so unfair. If only people who never wanted or were never interested in kids could forgo their fertility for others. At least then IVF and the other predatory practices wouldn't exist.
How would she even afford the hospital bill from giving birth? It‚Äôs averaging on $10k in my area just to deliver a healthy baby with no complications
Inorganic children are all the rage nowadays anyway!
I read her reply to someone on Twitter asking how she was able to afford it. She sold her house and moved in with a parent.
>She just posted a follow up tweet saying she is going to block and report anyone who brings up adoption to her

Report for what?
>report anyone who brings up adoption to her

Daaaaayum, somebody's sensitive.
Gene fetish lmao
The 165k would have just gone to some other type of grift.
I mean, she probably _wouldn't_ have used that money for social benefit. Nor does she have any particular obligation to.
I don‚Äôt think anyone should have an obligation to give all their spending money to ‚Äúcontribute to society‚Äù but I do agree that it‚Äôs extremely stupid to spend so much money on an IVF just so you can have your own kid. Adoption exists! If you‚Äôre willing to go through all the hoops that she was, then you‚Äôre absolutely able to go through the hoops to adopt.
It did contribute to society. She purchased services. A business and doctor will pay tax on it.
Given her probably incredibly fragile mental state right now, people immediately telling her to adopt it would be incredibly triggering for her. Not saying I agree with the IVF decision or that I would ever make that decision myself, but I get the response.
People are allowed to use their money however they want to. It‚Äôs not a privilege. You don‚Äôt know how hard she worked to save up that money. I do agree she could have just adopted though and saved herself lots of pain
Besides not having children, what good do you do every to create a better world for all?
I mean it created jobs and just went back into the economy so who cares
Yea it's not a rollercoaster. You can stop and get off the ride at any time. Sunken cost fallacy is a very strong motivator though.
Having a baby is not for free. In america, giving birth in the hospital already wipes you out of half a mil for that one day! 

Then you have to house/clothe/feed/school the damn thing for the next 18 years‚Ä¶‚Ä¶plus medicals & utilities.
I can (sort of) understand why people attempt IVF, but to put your body and emotions through the wringer like that, year after year, instead of drawing a line on how many attempts you're willing to make, or how much money you can realistically afford to lose?

And she's gained *90 pounds* through medication? That sounds real healthy!

After a certain point continuing to pursue IVF is a form of self harm.
Informed consent is literally impossible, given the way the human psyche functions. I can‚Äôt possibly be truly informed about the potential outcomes of a procedure if I haven‚Äôt already gone through it. And even then, we are very good at forgetting our experiences when we believe this is something we need in order to be fulfilled.
Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs well beyond. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs in the ball park/below what raising a child costs. Imagine monthly daycare bills and if u pay for part (or all of) their tuition for college. That is if u can afford to give those things to ur child in the first place.

Edit: I googled it just now, it costs ‚Äú237,483 dollars‚Äù (in the us) on average to raise a child to 18, and that‚Äôs not including college üòÖüòÖüòÖyeeeeeesh üòÖüòÖüôÉ no thanks I‚Äôll just travel the world with that instead lmfaooooo
Catholics are pro-life and anti-IVF for the same reasons. I don't know what's going on with other conservatives.
Boats are also widely known to be an AWFUL investment tho lolol
I'm sorry you got hurt.

A woman will do all this just to lie and say the man raped her and she'll leave him anyway and claim for child support. Having kids with women is not with it at all

See how bad generalising sounds lol
It is a self-inflicted problem, and apparently she's shunning adoption like a vampire shuns sunlight. I suppose she's following the demand that it be from her loins, with her genes, or bust. And now she's gone bust. 

I'm finding it real tough to feel bad for her.
I agree!

Poor woman was brainwashed into believing that she‚Äôd never be happy or useful without being a biological mother. And she ruined her life for this lie. Probably still believes there‚Äôs something wrong with her and she‚Äôs cursed. Some sad shit.
How can you be happy when you see this? Just because you don‚Äôt agree with someone doesn‚Äôt give you the right to laugh at their problems.

Same, I hope she finds value meaning and purpose without having to impose life upon another. And clearly someone failed her along the way allowing her to keep going, draining all her monetary resources and continuing to suffer trauma and miscarriage.

She‚Äôs actively blocking people who so much as mention adoption. She‚Äôs def got something against it.
First, the sub for supporting ppl who don't want kids is the Childfree sub, not this one. Antinatalism is a philosophical school that states that creating sentient human life is an immoral act. 

This thread is pointing out the larger breeding culture that contributed to this woman choosing trauma, bodily harm, financial drain and "ruining her life" by attempting to partake in that immoral act. Even though no sentient life was created, we can still speak to the nuances of the situation and recognize the root of it (natalism).
Don‚Äôt bother. These people are as mentally ill as they claim the woman in the post to be.
[deleted]
They see people like kortney Kardashian having kids at 46 not sure if she ended up doing ivf or not but she has a bottomless pit of money to throw at the situation and the very best doctors to assist
While I agree with your sentiment, adopting is a completely different thing to do. Incredibly altruistic when all parties are in it with suitable psychological, relational, social, emotional and financial resources but there‚Äôs no denying it is ALWAYS in the face of incredible trauma. Most people definitely could not handle it, and many do it for selfish reasons that are no different to the ones of biological parents.
Watching a friend go through it now, and it just seems like medical torture. Some women get so locked into this "dream of motherhood" that they will do anything to try to make it a reality,  and it's sad that there are people out there taking advantage of that. There's no way this woman is healthy enough to conceive and carry a cold to them,  but she is throwing away essentially her life savings trying to force it. I wish more women could see their value as people,  not just as mothers/ future mothers.
To most people spouting the ‚Äújust adopt‚Äù comment here: while it is understandable that that seems obvious,  it‚Äôs quite clear many of you really don‚Äôt understand the complexities of adoption and the effects, most profoundly on the child. Many people also adopt for selfish reasons and the long term effects are‚Ä¶ more suffering.
‚ÄúJust adopting‚Äù is as straightforward as ‚Äújust‚Äù doing ivf. See my other comment on that.

Lol for real. This is why I don't understand the "but adoption is expensive and difficult" argument...as if IVF is affordable and uncomplicated? I don't get it.
And now some large companies will help with adoption fees + provide the same leave benefit to adoptive parents regardless of the child‚Äôs age. If you have this available there‚Äôs no reason adoption isn‚Äôt a consideration, people are so narcissistic
That's not a thing. There aren't just babies waiting around to be adopted. My wealthy relatives spent years trying to adopt until it finally worked out.¬†
Its not even allowed to speak "bad" about these people
(My Post was too harsh, deleted;)

to me that article above screams: I'm sooo narcistic and perfect that couldnt see the spoon besides the plate, mental illness, genes dont make people good or better, its education, expierences, Luck, Friends, books whatever..¬†


Is Helping not allways helping?! Is raise a child not raising a human being to function in this society, are these people soo hooked on fairytales that they think it needs another special ME?!!
So just don't have kids then.
But we don't know if oc belongs to such a country or if she tried for adoption at all. We can just assume.
Her genes are messed up. That's why she can't reproduce on her own. If she did have a kid, the kid may also have fertility issues. I think it's messed up that she wants a child so bad but won't consider adopting. It's weird.
**correction: is obsessed with the fantasy of parenthood and multiplying her genes and self ü§£ü§£ü§£
And based on that I'm glad she's not adopting, she'd be a shit evil stepmother type of parent
Who was she trying to have the kid with?
This!!! My old classmate wasn‚Äôt very obsessed with passing her genes but she‚Äôs talked about giving a child a life since we were like 15. She‚Äôs hella infertile and she said even if she weren‚Äôt, she‚Äôs not obsessed with multiplying her genes, she just wants to give a child a life. She was confirmed to adopt the child 2 years ago and they‚Äôre happy. I love that for her. It wasn‚Äôt out of greed of multiplying or feeding her ego or saying ‚ÄúI did it!‚Äù But more of ‚Äúthis is my calling and I‚Äôm gonna help and love someone else!‚Äù This woman kinda had that coming, I don‚Äôt feel sorry for her at all.
what's the difference in adopting vs having a biological baby, especially if it takes this much struggle to have a biological baby?
We‚Äôre aware of this, that‚Äôs why we still suggest if you want one THAT bad üòÖ
Sorry, times are rough mate. I'll do better next time though I promise.
And that she lost most of her friends
Jesus H. Christ. There are thousands of people who dream of being able to afford a house and this chick sells hers so that she can pass on her DNA.
It seems like having a child became an obsession to her.

It would be good if people were required to go through a psychologist before being able to start this kind of treatment.
She sold her house to afford IVF?¬† Where was she going to live if it was successful and she had the baby?
Logic
She wouldn't be that sensitive if she didn't know deep down that people are right. It's easier to ignore it and not have to constantly question your decisions, but it looks like that's happening to her anyway.
This along with breeding
Ivf isn't a grift, a grift is a scam. Ivf is just a tremendous waste of money/traumatic/selfish when you could adopt.. whether or not you receive the outcome you wish is up to chance and genetics, not the will of the one doing a grift. Pedantic I know, but I think it's very important to make these distinctions, if anything and everything is a grift it makes it much easier for grifters to get away with it.
If she did get the child she wanted, that child would now be born into a family without money or a home. Like ok you got the kid at the cost of that kids best statistical chance at a successful future..? "What comes next" doesn't seem to factor with some people who pursue IVF.
It's not an obligation, but it's tone deaf to whine on the internet that you spend an MASSIVE amount of money creating dozens of embryos while many people are struggling to survive. We aren't owed a baby, she is not being deprived of anything beyond her own selfish desires. Blocking people who suggest adoption proves that
And not only that.  Let‚Äôs say the last option she tried actually worked.  She had a kid and now all of her money is gone having spent $165,000 to make this happen.  So now she and her new baby are destitute, living in her parent‚Äòs home.  Who would choose that?  She has messed up her life big time.
I agree that suggestions of adoption would have been better placed at the start of her journey rather than at the end. Though I'm sure it was before and throughout, and she chose this other path.
Yes exactly. It's especially traumatic because she's pushed herself to the point of cognitive dissonance. She's questioning herself and her decisions and she desperately needs to believe her basis for making at least those initial decisions was logical in some capacity otherwise she'd be forced to change her worldview or stew in self hatred. Both are hard so the brain chooses the easier path. All humans do this.
It is a privilege to be able to spend an egregious amount on IVF, while most of the world is living in poverty. Of course it's her money, but to use it for something so immoral like creating dozens of embryos due to her own desperate desires is...immoral. And clearly ruined her life.
Seriously?

Spending almost $200,000 just so she can have a copy of her DNA is absolutely privileged. There are people who can't afford basic human necessities like healthcare and shelter and she goes and blows enough money to buy a house on IVF.
You clearly don‚Äôt actually know the definition of the word ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù because yes it absolutely is.
ü§£ she didnt work to save up the money.

She sold her house & moved in with mummy dearest like a g‚Äôdamn teenager!

Which by the way, if you dont have the money for the ivf without losing your home, guess what? You sure as fking hell do NOT have the financial means to support the dang kid for the next 18 years‚Ä¶or more if the kid comes out damaged in some way/gets damaged later via a car accident or whatever.
Personally, I am a social worker being trained to help disabled children in bad situations, and have spent my life volunteering and working with marginalized populations. What about you?
I think they meant getting pregnant is free.
"In america, giving birth in the hospital already wipes you out of half a mil for that one day! "


¬†Honestly, what are you talking about? A vaginal, unmedicated birth, even in one of the most expensive COL areas of the US, cost us ~$7k in 2020.
It‚Äôs an addiction just like gambling. But she‚Äôs addicted to the idea of being pregnant, and so like any addict she threw all of her money and self at it and ended up at rock bottom. It‚Äôs hard to cry for someone who did it to themselves
I believe all humans are masochistic to some extent, as of the ego. The ego is born of fear and the belief that we are bad, so it makes sense that we believe we deserve to suffer, on some level anyway. That said, I can‚Äôt imagine what it is like to want to be a mother so badly, and to not be able to have a baby. I wanted very much to be a mother from the time I was 6 or so, but getting pregnant was very easy for me. See, just by me posting this here, I‚Äôm showing my masochistic side.
IVF is at most 30% successful. IVF is very expensive. People know these facts.
I‚Äôm super pro-choice, but at least they‚Äôre internally consistent. I was surprised, but I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have been, when I saw that Mike Pence, Mr. Anti-abortion guy, had a kid through IVF.
Still a better purchase than IVF!
One of our ‚Äúgeneralizations‚Äù is more common than the other. A look around the infidelity subs will confirm
Yeah. I just don‚Äôt get it. People say it‚Äôs hard to adopt. Ok‚Ä¶ maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be a parent if adoption agencies reject you?
I feel like this is a silly reason but that‚Äôs just me. Kind of reminds me of when parents are rooting for their child to become one sex or another. I find that disconcerting.
Ridiculous
[removed]
Of course it's sad that her life was ruined. I'm not laughing here- this is grave. The point is that a culture that contributes to women choosing spending a small fortune and ruining their lives (her own words) through artificial creation of dozens of embryos and miscarriages is a tragedy, and should not be encouraged or normalized like it is.
when i see a narcissist crying i will be happy. 

i never asked to be right
Our inherent human dignity of course?? Weird question
Better question: why do we have to have a value? This aint a grocery store, sweetie.
I think our value comes from our ability to validate the existence of other human beings. And by ‚Äúvalidate‚Äù, I mean to see, hear, touch, smell, and even taste another human as they are, without judgement. Because of our egos, none of us can do that, so we lose our value when we develop an ego. So then, it‚Äôs pretty easy to understand why people want to have children so badly. The baby they have will be the only human in their lives who will ever validate their existence and make them feel truly alive. It sounds fucked up, and it is fucked up. And what makes it even more fucked up is that when the baby attempts to validate their mother, she rejects them because she is so afraid of herself and of connection. In a sense, she is protecting the child from what she believes she is. She longs for that connection and validation, but once it comes, she is scared and she runs away. Kind of like a borderline. 

This is all very metaphysical, and I have absolutely no evidence for what I‚Äôm saying right now. So then the baby develops an ego, as a result of being rejected by their mother. In a perfect world(or one suited to humans and the way we evolved to live) nobody would have an ego, which means everyone could validate everyone. Babies would be conceived unintentionally, without the expectation of validating their mothers placed upon them before they are even born. There would be no boundaries or expectations of judgement and rejection. There would be no ‚ÄúI‚Äù and no ‚Äúyou‚Äù. In your presence, I am alive. In my solitude, I am dead. There would be no yesterday, nor a tomorrow. We live together and we die together. My pain is your pain, and your joy is my joy. 

In this world in which we exist, individuality is king, but it always has been and always will be an illusion of the ego, just as is everything else we believe. The ego cannot survive genuine human connection, which is why it does everything it can to prevent us from experiencing connection. Maybe right before we die, we can feel it. Once we have let get of the fear of being validated and seen for who we truly are. If I am about to die, I can no longer hurt you and you can no longer hurt me.
It‚Äôs not just the meds, the whole thing is turmoil. Interesting you mention ‚Äúexplosive crying‚Äù. As someone ADHD I have suffered from that my whole life. I wish I could change that about myself, it would change my life.
I am not convinced most people can handle raising a child of any relation. Whether adopted, conceived by their partner and a donor / surrogate, or conceived solely within the relationship. 

I fail to see what difference it makes. It is just as likely they do it for selfish reasons. It is just the act of adoption itself is generally more likely to result in better outcomes for the child. They are already a sentient, human life that is suffering.
But the original cause for traumas of children who were adopted is that they were born. Traumas of adopted children often come from being abandoned by their birth families and how they were treated while in orphanages.

Ivf will always be worse act than adoption.
It‚Äôs not altruistic. You‚Äôre buying a baby.
I agree, the answer isn't so simple when there's literally an entire universal cultural upbringing pushing this as "women's purpose". 
But still, at this degree the medical professionals should to a degree be held accountable. At what point is it just snake oil? 8 times miscarriages?? They're knowingly lining their pockets at that point.
Exactly, "just adopt" is disgusting. Plus, the adoption industry is largely anti-choice, so adoptive parents end up indirectly supporting the denial of birth control and abortion.
Exactly, in my country there are literally zero local adoptions available and people have to go abroad, which requires an immense amount of red tape. Our neighbors were in their early 50‚Äôs before they could bring their 1 year old boy home. He had a host of behavioral issues and one day the dad lost his temper and yelled at him. Our POS neighbor contacted the authorities because of this and they nearly lost their kid.

Turned me off adoption forever ‚Ä¶
I mean they did drop the fact they had $165,000 to drop on IVF, with that amount of resources I‚Äôm sure they could‚Äôve figured adoption out
Don't worry! I have the ultimate fixer-upper for it!   


How do you evade every nasty effect of a nuclear war? Easy! By not having one.  
How do you prevent all forms of infertility, pain, grief, trauma, and ill-effects of any physical and psychological level for all children?  
EASY! By not having kids :)  
Magic.
I'm not sure that's backed up by statistics, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.

Yeah, but once you spend all your money on failed ivf attempts,  you can no longer afford an adoption . üéª
[removed]
I'm a little confused by these comments. Adoption is not an option for most people because there literally aren't enough kids to adopt. There are thousands of couples with money at aside for adoption that just have to hope it works out for them.


People who adopt oversees aren't normally all that altruistic, they do it because it's difficult to adopt here. Not because it's "expensive".¬†
Not to mention, adopting from foster care is not only free but some states PAY YOU to do it¬†

üëè I've always said this. You're infertile for a reason. Nature doesn't want you to reproduce. Harsh but true, nature isn't nice or pretty. There's something wrong and your body is like nope, can't do it. I can't have a healthy kid.
Imagine if people threw this much money trying to overcome their other mental or physical ailments. But suddenly when your body is screaming at you that a living being should not be growing in there, humans want to spend their last dime intervening with biology.
Riddle me this: If Adoption is so much simpler and less painful and better than having Biological children, why does pretty much everyone who wants kids do it Naturally instead of Adoption?

  
Perhaps you are intentionally ignoring their reasons because you get off on being mad online?
One is your baby the other isn't. Some people can get over this hump some people can't. Everyone deserves to pick what they wanna do.
She‚Äôs not exaggerating when she says it ruined her life üò≥
How did this make her lose her friends?
The privilege is astounding.

As much as her situation sucks, she could have‚Ä¶ not done that. There‚Äôs many more things in the world for me to feel sympathy for.
>that child would now be born into a family without money or a home.

What makes you think that? She didn't say she's homeless or destitute - just that she lost $165,000.

I wouldn't be homeless if I lost $165,000, and I'm single, middle-class, and fairly young.
Yeah this is all true. Some people are just selfish assholes and in our current society, those people can just hide behind the status quo because our society is fucked up and doesn‚Äôt care about human lives.
>Blocking people who suggest adoption proves that

that part!
I mean I don't see Tay Tay selling her private jet to pay a year's rent for a couple of people, not sure why cruella Deville here ows society her money
Lol. I get reported and blocked here all the time when questioning or challenging AN. And I am not a natalist. I am not an antinatalist, but I find the AN and logic and ethics inconsistent and arbitrary and, indeed, the arrogant sense of superiority and constant judgement and condemnation and condescending comments, like this thread, unnecessary and unearned. This story contributes zero to any conversation re: AN. It's esteeming oneself by shitting on another. It's a fucking weird fetishizing of other people's failures and struggles in life to "prove" how unselfish you/antinatalists are.¬†
I am a teacher. Everyday I have the privelege to work with high school students and learn with them. I also work as a tutor and am a mentor to many of the students, many with whom I remain in contact after they graduate. I am a father to two children, and I work with them and their mother in formal and informal ways via advocacy, planning, engagement, and action for social and environmental justice.¬†
Getting pregnant doesnt count as actually ‚Äúhaving the baby‚Äù though.
2020. Oh honey we aint 2020 anymore.

Also depends what state.
Plus, it's so hard to wreak havoc on your body like that. Almost continuous pregnancies would be punishing enough if they were natural, but when you add in all the hormones needed for IVF...
üòÇ Here's hoping no one gives you shit for your decisions and rights to your own body (regardless of the fact that your bodily autonomy directly contradicts the bodily autonomy of the unborn, they don't cancel each other out, they both exist simultaneously in perfect dissonance).

And yea I could see that being true. Curiosity and masochism are hard to tell apart sometimes. Like you know touching that thing will hurt, *but how badly?* Gotta find out. There was a scientific research done on that actually. They sat people in a room with no stimuli for a length of time, but there is a button in front of them that the researcher already told them would shock them if they pressed it. Almost everyone did.
There's a difference between knowing and *knowing*. Like how a child can mechanically know how sex works but can not give informed consent. They haven't been through enough of life to make those decisions and be truly informed. Ivf is so unnatural you don't know how your body and mind will react until you go through it.

Idk if I fully agree with what I just stated, but felt the other user had a good point so I wanted to make an argument for it.
Like IVF kills more embryos. I guess some people just see it's wrong when it happens with women trying to control their own bodies.
So that means generalisations are okay? Lmao
I get trying to help nature once, maybe twice. But dishing out the equivalent of $41,250 per year on *maybes* is just nutsy.

Yeah, we don‚Äôt. I was only asking her to explain her claim. There‚Äôs no need to be smug, as if I‚Äôm oblivious
I agree with your first point. However there are many differences between having a biological child and adopting and people don‚Äôt want to talk about that. Look up ‚Äúfailed adoptions‚Äù and ‚Äúadopted children against adoption‚Äù for more details.
Adoption is literally still a net positive from a AN perspective. When considering there is nothing you can currently do to stop people from conceiving-then-abandoning their children. You, if you are someone who wants kids, have a moral precedent to limit yourself to adoption.
I agree to an extent. Birth of either child ends up with suffering. The suffering of an adopted child is not just from being born, and, as much as people don‚Äôt like to hear it, there is often much suffering for adoptive parents too. Again, like the failed IVFs, not well talked about in our society.
I said with certain conditions
It‚Äôs almost like people aren‚Äôt entitled to parenthood.
OP was saying in the original twitter post that they did IVF and couldn't adopt because they were queer? Is there really a restriction against queer adoption?
But will blue eyes and white skin exist in the future if I don't? Wahhh üò≠

I think it should be free but should not pay you to do it. The lengths humans will go to to get money is crazy
That article is talking about foster parents, not adoptive parents (it‚Äôs written confusingly), and the amount of money they receive doesn‚Äôt even cover the cost of food, let alone the other expenses. No one fosters children for the money.
also imagine how much pressure is going to be on that kid if she has one. thats child would have what 10 deaths behind them. the mom would definitely be using in reference to him oh your my miracle you should be great full there was 10 other ‚Äòbabies‚Äô who didnt make it exc. that kid is going to have a hard life if shes successful
My parents went through hell to have me, before IVF was an option - I don‚Äôt feel miserable at all lol
Nature is metal as fuck. I wish people would accept this in the reproduction arena most. They want it to all be skittles and rainbows and aren‚Äôt willing to accept the harsh reality. MOST fertilized eggs don‚Äôt implant. MOST times you have sex, you don‚Äôt get pregnant. If you can‚Äôt sustain a pregnancy, maybe that‚Äôs a clue.
You are ascribing rhyme or reason to nature which it just doesn't have. 

Nature isn't nice nor pretty but also not deliberate. Random things happen all the time and a good chunk of it isn't directly beneficial but doesn't evolve away because it isn't a drawback either.
Most woman are not even infertile. They are literally to stressed to get pregnant. Or their husband seed is not fertile. There are so many reasons other then infertility, why it doesn't work out. Not to mention the fact that woman expect to get pregnant immediately after years of taking the pill. Woman that get pregnant immediately are the exception, not the norm. The norm is that is takes months to reset the body after years of hormonal crap.
that's a good question idk. i'm not mad, nor do i get off from being mad online. that's gross
while that's partially true, and obviously if people don't wanna adopt you wouldn't want to put the kid into an unloving family. but when you adopt a kid, that IS your baby. i wish everyone could get over this hump and just love the child regardless of whether it has your DNA or not
Yeah except for the fact that adopted kids are legally your kid & we are all human so its all part of the same species & most likely related to you via 100‚Äôs of thousands removed relatives. All in the human race.

But either way, it is legally your kid. So that is NOT an excuse.
At what point does she accept she did it to herself
Obsessions leave little room for anyone or anything else.
Because it‚Äôs probably all she talked about anymore and became insufferable.
Yea ok sure. Totally not tone deaf or outta touch with this comment. Plus did you not read the part where I said *statistically* the best chance at a successful future? Stop being obtuse. I didn't say she was homeless either, I said she doesn't own a home which is true by her own admission. She's living with her mother, that house isn't her asset which means she's less likely to be able to guarantee that her child and her wouldn't end up homeless. What if her mom died suddenly without properly planning for giving her daughter the house? Then she and her child WOULD have been homeless.
Do you mind explaining why this screencap is not relevant to AN? We aren‚Äôt a sub purely for debate, and tend to accept posts with some humor and drama. But we do have a rule that can delete posts based on relevancy. If you‚Äôd like to report it feel free to do so.
The number you quoted is 72x greater than what I paid.¬†


Sure there's been some inflation. Maybe prices even rose by a third! (doubtful) year-over-year from what I paid! Which would put the cost at $22k.


You quoted $500k! You made that shit up and you should own it.
It‚Äôs horrifically unnatural. It‚Äôs actually disturbing to me. But her life her choices, I can‚Äôt imagine all those drugs and hormones are gonna do good things for her down the road
These people did IVF multiple times. I get doing it once and regretting it. But doing it multiple times and then complaining is just wrong.
Yeah, trying once or twice seems reasonable. 
Side note: imagine the mental state of this woman if she did get pregnant.
The doctor should have told enough long ago
Pretty sure I know how my mind and body works bud. Biological woman here. Kind of shitty to use hormones as an excuse to go off the deep end to that extent. Honestly the doctor should have told her enough. I blame them a lot for her situation. 60-70 years to have kids or adopt? Huh?
‚ÄúAdopted kids against adoption‚Äù embodies the same kind of rhetoric to me as ‚Äúhomophobes raised by gay couples‚Äù or ‚Äútransphobic de-transitioners‚ÄùJust because they had it worse off doesn‚Äôt mean they speak for everyone. 

And it isn‚Äôt a valid reason to gatekeep the already-dwindling practice. Not when statistics exist that demonstrate adoption at certain ages improved outcomes compared to growing up in the foster system. It is a net good, even as the byproduct of an overly-natalist society.
You do realize the adoption industry is part of the anti-choice movement? And that supporting adoption ultimately leads to more kids being born. 

 >there is nothing you can currently do to stop people from conceiving-then-abandoning their children.

You can donate to abortion funds. You can volunteer to drive women to abortion clinics. You can provide childcare for women getting an abortion. 

Or you can make false stereotypes about poor women "abandoning" children, which is exceptionally rare, to justify still having kids as an anti-natalist.
even though one‚Äôs country has made it legal for LGBTQ+ people to adopt, many adoption agencies highly prefer if the adoptive parents are straight. in sweden, same-sex couples have been allowed to adopt children since '04, yet there has only been ONE singular international adoption in 20 years bc so few agencies want to give the adoptee to queer parents
Hahaha üñ§ imaginary upvotes accepted!
It‚Äôs not a lot of money. Even barely keeping the kid alive would far exceed what you get¬†

To raise someone else's child is a superhuman level act of charity and self-sacrifice.

Unfortunately for the Orphans, most people would prefer to have their own children, rather than raise someone else's and play pretend.
Lmfao "goshh jolly why cant people just get over millions of years of biological programming and love all the kids as one! regardless of if they birthed them or not" buddy you might as well say why can't we all get along and why do we have war.

  
The inability of this place to see other POVs is crazy to me considering in the real world you guys would be the abnormals to society.
Huh? Buddy it won't be your kid until you legally adopt them. The question here was why people don't wanna do adoptions. How did excuse come into the conversation? 

  
lmfao you sound 12 when you say "we are all humans so we are all related by 100s of thousands of relatives removed" That is the most technically true/but would never fly irl shit i have ever heard.
Never.
People probably suggested to her that maybe she should stop and she cut them off
>Totally not tone deaf or outta touch with this comment

You claimed she's homeless and broke. That's just 100% assumptions on your part.

>Plus did you not read the part where I said *statistically* the best chance at a successful future?

...statistics that don't matter if she's neither broke nor homeless. Because for all you know, she's got a cool million in the bank.

>I didn't say she was homeless either, I said she doesn't own a home which is true by her own admission. She's living with her mother, that house isn't her asset which means she's less likely to be able to guarantee that her child and her wouldn't end up homeless.

"Lives with parents" and "would be homeless without their parents" aren't the same thing.

>What if her mom died suddenly without properly planning for giving her daughter the house?

It would go to her next of kin by default. Which would be... her children or spouse.
What's this post have to do with AN? Just another example of a selfish person who made a decision with which you don't agree? So sharing and mocking and/or enjoying her suffering validates AN or anyone here in what way? Oh, yeah, since y'all love to fetishize the self evident and obvious: she made a shitty, selfish decision! And it failed! If she only cared about others and adopted! So let's spend all our energy congratulating ourselves for our smug superiority and channel our energies into creating and courageous ways to cultivate greater empathy and come up with ideas to mitigate, ameliorate, and eliminate suffering - by reminding ourselves that there are people who act selfishly and that we aren't those people!!!
Nahhh, I‚Äôve truly seen ppl post 1mil+ medical bill statements for their labor and delivery. Granted they were usually more than one baby or their baby spent time in the nicu, but I‚Äôve seen it. As for paying that out of pocket, I doubt it but still with a bill that high, you‚Äôre likely to still be in medical debt for a long time even with insurance.
A week in the NICU for a minor birth snafu will absolutely put you in that price range. I worked for one, I saw the bills and what insurance would refuse to cover
Yk what grinds my gears... people don't turn out as *you* want. They're autonomous units. What would've happened if, say, she skipped 10 years and the kid didn't turn out the way she wanted (like her girly-girl turned into a tomboy). Or Jr needed a sibling, so back to the IVF she goes, to suck up more time and money and energy on more maybes. 

Ugh. I need off this thread.
[deleted]
What I‚Äôm saying is people here are like ‚Äújust adopt‚Äù as if there‚Äôs not much involved. Over all, when the resources are suitable, yes adoption is a net reduction of suffering but I absolutely am not going to dismiss the experiences of people who suffered and have evidence for the cause. Are trans kids damaged by being ignored? Absolutely. Do some people go down the transition route and find they actually weren‚Äôt properly assessed and prepared? Also yes. I might not agree with everything they say, but I am going to listen.
> false stereotypes about poor women 

I never mentioned ‚Äúpoor women‚Äù? What are you talking about? 

> The adoption industry is part of the anti-choice movement 

It is also part of the pro-LGBTQ movement. Your point? What it has been weaponized to be, by either side, is not relevant. Neither side is AN. Not really. I am talking about what it can be for ANs.

yeah it sucks. not playing pretend tho. adopted kid is still your own kid
lol that's not even what i said. and humans have the ability to make unselfish choices, despite our "biological programming" bc we aren't wild animals anymore. all i said was that i wish everyone would. not "why can't we all get along and not have war?" it's like you're purposely misinterpreting what i said to make it sound like i've got no ability to see things from others POV. i have empathy.
Thats why i said ‚Äúadopted‚Äù kids. Try again, sweetie.
That‚Äôs sadly probably what happened. It became an addiction at this point, no different than hard drugs or gambling. She stopped caring about her life
This is a projection of your own misunderstandings of the philosophy itself. The purpose of this thread is not to bask in the misfortune of another. Rather, it is an example of the larger culture that contributed to this woman experiencing trauma, bodily harm, financial drain and "ruining her life" (her words) by steering her towards choosing drastic means to attempt to create a child. 

Even though no sentient life was ultimately created, we can still speak to the nuances of the situation and recognize the root of it (natalism). And in an antinatialist sub which you are for some reason seeking out, you cannot be surprised to find discourse about this overarching culture being immoral. No one is smug (at least they shouldn't be) and rubbing her decision in her face- she is a victim and it is tragic. And no I do not think I am better than her.
Thanks for explaining. Coming up with ways to eliminate suffering besides non procreation is a great cause but frankly put it‚Äôs not the point of this sub. I hope the enjoyment of your time here improves and I hope you feel your voice has been heard, if you feel you have anything more to express about how we can make the sub better please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to the mod team.
The post is relevant because it's discussing the lengths at which people will go to ruin their own lives in search of something they by chance just aren't going to get. A lot of what's discussed here is the social pressures, which HAVE influenced this woman in some capacity.

She's ruined her life. Why? She's blocking people for pointing out adoption. Why? She spent insane amounts of money. She is angry and hurt. Did she know this was a possibility? Surely not everyone is 100% informed about IVF before committing to it. There is a lot of white washing done around birth and IVF. The gruesome and terrible reality of it is often hidden from us. People here discuss these factors that push people to have children.

It is relevant.

And your points about this sub being toxic are played out ad nauseum. Yes we know this sub tends to be a shit hole of self congratulatory and mean spirited takes (and worse plenty often). However none of what you replied to in this comment chain fits that description from what I've read so your stance is the most irrelevant atm.
NICU bills for multiples _can_ be that high when the babies are there for months. But the person I'm responding to painted it as a single-day expense.


They were intentionally grossly exaggerating the cost of a standard birth.

That's not how insurance works. There is an out of pocket max for the year. For an individual it's usually not higher than 7k.¬†
I made a similar comment to someone saying something along those lines!
Sorry. I became enraged by your answer. The whole topic upsets me. I was born via IVF coming from a family where ‚Äúanxiety ‚Äú runs through the family. That‚Äôs some white washing if there ever was. My mom was 40 and after a certain age the risk for mental illness goes way up for your children. So of course I‚Äôm mentally ill, it costs a fortune and most of the time I‚Äôm miserable. 
Also having a kid in this day and age with how shitty schools are, the political climate, social security funds are almost exhausted‚Ä¶To have a child is selfish. I can‚Äôt even fathom learning you‚Äôre sterile because that would mean you‚Äôre trying to have a kid. Morally I‚Äôm against having children. Are you just here to troll?
And my point is that adoption is only way of raising children without contributing to the norm of natalism. However difficult, any good natalist would limit themselves to it if they still want children. 

And if that ends up significantly increasing demand at some point, that makes it more likely that the foster system admin improves and adoption become easier. 

Of course, that does NOT take away or minimize the struggles of adopted OR foster children. And I am willing to hear them out. But no amount of hearing them out will change the current facts we have. Or that they are wrong to outright oppose or gatekeep adoption.
>I never mentioned ‚Äúpoor women‚Äù? What are you talking about?

According to you there's tons of abandoned children. I suppose you were actually implying that rich women abandon their children? 

>It is also part of the pro-LGBTQ movement.

And the LGBTQ movement isn't AN. Due to high surrogacy costs, people without a uterus have a vested interest in promoting the birth of children who can be adopted. 

>I am talking about what it can be for ANs.

Sure, it can be a loophole to avoid personal reproduction. But if the child wouldn't have been born without restrictive policies created by anti-choicers, I don't see how that makes you any better than a normal natalist parent.
It is *A* kid, which is in Your Posession. But it's not "Your Own Kid".
Self-Loathing isn't Empathy
are you being purposefully daft? i was not even talking about already adopted kids. Why did you even bring them into the conversation?

My original comment was for people who don't want to adopt at all.
I understand antinatalism very well. I think it is - or can be - a robust and productive thought experiment akin to Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence and the trolley problem. I am not a natalist. I think there are myriad legitimate and moral reasons to not have children. But I reject antinatalism on what I think are unsound premises, as they are absolutes and must AN thinking here eschews nuance and contingency. I think the intractable avd immutable notion of morality presupposed by AN is arbitrary and, ironically, only emergent with the very existence that AN taken to it's logical conclusion would eradicate. There are logic systems - like 4-value - logic that are more applicable to real world application. The default binary logic upon which AN is predicated relies on the unnatural language of logic to address a much more dynamic and fluid real world. Abd please don't be disingenuous. Fid every thoughtful individual like you here, there are tens of others who do not exhibit logic or empathy. The AN practiced here breeds resignation and lassitude. I seek out opportunities in life to contribute to a culture of creativity, courage, community, avs opportunity. Affirming the potential value existence is not tantamount to endorsing deleterious social or cultural norms. Having children is not universally an immoral or unethical act. All-or-nothing thinking is a cognitive distortion that does more harm than good. It's protective by way of projection. Physician, heal thyself. As you claim I misunderstand the "philosophy" one can question your grasp of logic and morality and empathy. But that kind of thinking is de rigeur here. I am not interested in that. Read this sub, then get back to me about who understands, let alone practices any kind of ethical philosophy here. Challenge is not the same as ignorance. Leveraging that language - well, you said it: projecting . . .¬†
Reduction of suffering isn't one of the points of this sub? That doesn't make sense. It should be. What's the point in talking about a philosophy in which the main point is to reduce harm (regardless of if that's the motivating factor or not) if harm reduction isn't the point?

Discussing the untold dangers of IVF and birthing IS harm reduction since it informs people of dangers they may not have known about. That's definitely something a lot of people here want to do as community outreach. This sub might not have organized channels for community outreach but self motivated people will take what they get from this sub and bring it to their own communities, so I definitely think it is at least *one* of the points of this sub. At the very least it should be.
The gruesome and terrible reality of birth? Lol. Says everything . . .¬†
Well idk about other states but I‚Äôm from ny and I‚Äôve seen it as high as 10k. But the ppl I saw talking about it said they were paying 30ishk out of pocket so.
> I suppose you were implying rich women 

I was implying no particular demographic, actually. Rich women, poor women, MEN of all backgrounds, etc. Anyone who can and does reproduce, but refuses to raise their kid.  Why did you assume that was poor women? 

> LGBTQ movement isn‚Äôt AN

Sure, but it is definitely less natalist than the ANTI-ABORTION movement. In fact, it is barely ‚Äúnatalist‚Äù at all, all things considered. 

> People without a uterus have a vested interest in promoting the birth of children who can be adopted

Is this your backhanded way of pinning natalism in the foster system on‚Ä¶ gay men? Or women without a uterus / fertile sex cells? You think they (can) make sure the foster system is as much of a saturated market as it is? And not, you know, reproducing heterosexuals? 

> The child wouldn‚Äôt have been born without restrictive policies by anti-choicers

You are right. The child should not have been born either way, but it is. I am working on the assumption that those children get born, whether we like it or not. They are in that foster care already, way too many of them compared to the families that are willing and ready to adopt. What other way do you have to get a net positive out of that situation?
lol what an assumption
Are you an r? Re-read your first sentence.

>Huh? Buddy it wont be your kid until you adopt them.

Now re-read what i wrote.

>Yeah except for the fact that adopted kids are legally your kid.

Adopted kids.

Adopted.

Kids.

One again, try again sweetie‚Ä¶.
Have you actually read any antinatalist literature? If you had, I think you would realize that is not merely a thought experiment but rather a logical and moral formula that many well reputable contemporary philosophers have demonstrated with valid logic proofs. If you are genuinely interested in learning more, I can recommend literature outlining the net loss and gain of existence in a really well done and formulaic/mathmatical way, to demonstrate that nonexistence is always net-preferable.

What scholars have you read or are familiar with, and what is your intellectual background with philosophy, to be able to interact with the nuance of the doctrine at such an expert level to say you single-handedly disprove it? Because it sounds like the majority of your arguments  and characterization of antinatalists comes from...lurking a subreddit?? 

Your asinine characterization of antinatalists also demonstrates a misunderstanding. While of course in this sub (as many others) there are many miserable people, they do not represent the philosophy itself.  You are here trolling, yet you do not represent nor understand the philosophy, like many others, even those who claim to be AN. It's hardly a reliable source. I believe that since we ARE here, despite our consent, we do have responsibilities to each other, such as to do good and to make the most of the lives that were forced on us. So, I have dedicated my life to upholding social and environmental justice (and no, not by merely promoting antinatalism).
I also like how you didn't mention anything on the part where I called you out for being toxic about this sub being toxic. Guess I hit the nail on the head with that bit.
Yeah, that's not half a mil
>but refuses to raise their kid.  Why did you assume that was poor women?

You do realize that CPS targets lower SES mothers? Most of them don't "refuse" to raise their child. The overwhelming majority of foster children come from poor families who do want them back. This article chronicles the story of CPS refusing to action against a clearly abusive mother because she was a white medical doctor. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/04/mackenzie-fierceton-rhodes-scholarship-university-of-pennsylvania

>They are in that foster care already, way too many of them compared to the families that are willing and ready to adopt.

I don't remember you specifying that foster adoption of older or undesirable children is the only moral adoption. There is absolutely no shortage of adoptive families for healthy children under the age of 3.
legality=/=actuality
You really want to discuss AN, I am happy to, and I am happy to do so with humility and engagement. I don't get the sense attention or listening are modes of operation here. It's mostly a safe space and echo chamber. And that's okay. If you find birth terrible and gruesome, challenge as toxic, that likely says more about you than me or anything. These are impositions or projections, similar to the values you and others seem to impose on various facets of life, such as struggle or hardship. Morality and binary logic are emergent properties with the existence AN would eradicate. I don't think you or most folks here have any interest in genuine discussion about the premises that underpin AN - about suffering and disparity. AN offers a hands-off way to rationalize a shitty reality. I am concerned with the movement from theory to praxis. Are you? It seems zero sum here; across the board. Debate and nuance and contingency are eschewed in lieu of being right.¬†
There is no right answer

"I want to supply cheap labour for our corporate overlords."
My personal favourite is "My relationship is crumbling because of lack of time with and/or attraction to my partner. Having a common goal like a child will fix it." 

But I literally profit off of people's divorces, so I guess I can't complain too much.
[removed]
Someone once told me I was selfish for not wanting to have kids and I replied that I think it's more selfish to have them because if you were being altruistic you'd adopt a kid who needs parents.  She was very offended I called her selfish, which I felt proved my point quite well.
People talk about legacy like they are some kind of royalty. No, Susan, your cashier/waitress legacy matters little. If that's why you want to put another soul to suffer in this dying world, give up.
There are literally "people" who breed children for trafficking, sex abuse, and human sacrifices.  This planet is a hellscape.
The love bit always makes me cringe. Your kids have the potential to hate you. They may love you in the beginning but that can fade as personalities strengthen.

It likely won't if you're a halfway decent parent, but it's not foolproof.

And that's not to criticize someone having a kid for that reason, but like to criticize me for not having faith in it or a desire for that is ridiculous.
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I literally have NO idea what is so ‚Äúselfless‚Äù about having your own children. Adopting parentless children? Yes, very selfless and admirable. But your own? Isn‚Äôt that having *what you want*?
unrelated but I love the outfits the artist gave them lol
All sentences begin with ‚ÄúI want‚Ä¶‚Äù
The singular most selfish statement of all. I tell people this all the time and they can‚Äôt argue back really.
Life itself is selfish, it emerged 3.6 billion years ago by selfishly consuming and replicating, its the natural condition of life that we cant change, unless we become immortal machines or something, ehehe. 

Problem is, according to our moral system, being selfish is wrong, so that means procreation is also wrong, because its to fulfill the selfish desires of parents. Its physically impossible to make kids for the kid's sake, because nobody asked to be born. lol 

Yet, according to the same moral system, procreation is not wrong if you plan it well and reduce the risk of harm to an acceptable level (a standard that changes over time). It is basically saying that if you could give your offspring a "reasonably" decent life, even if bad luck could ruin it at any time, then this "selfishness" is justified. 

They also claim that procreation is self interested but not "pure" selfishness, because decent parents will make lots of sacrifices for their offspring, so its somehow justified. Apparently only pure selfishness is bad. 

Yes, its a weird rule of breeders, makes no sense to me. ehehe
"I want someone to take care of me when I'm old" is saying the quiet part out loud. I'm a selfish, insecure weirdo who expects people's free time to be spent on me, and I'm not giving parenthood freely because it's something I want to do, but using it instead as a bargaining chip against someone later in life.
F makes literally NO sense to me. What makes your bloodline so special?
‚ÄúBecause they I want to give a good life to a child‚Äù is what one friend told me. Then I asked them why they didn‚Äôt just adopt then? Since there are a ton of children that could use adopting. Didn‚Äôt have a response. 

It ultimately is just selfish.
Imagine thinking that a creampie is a big deal and a "miracle" lmao I can't with breeders üò≠üò≠üò≠
But MY baby might solve world hunger! I mean, sure, we have the solutions already, but they are woke. Look, i just want a kid, ok??
I had a best friend in middle school who wanted a child to carry on the bloodline, and was surprised I didn't want children, she has a child now and I wonder about her sometimes if she's happy
I) there‚Äôs only  a 50-50 chance my child will inherit an almost-always fatal cardiovascular genetic syndrome, but I‚Äôll take those odds
I want. This is the key word here. You wouldn't have children if that isn't what you wanted. If you did that, it wouldn't make it better.
Never feel bad about not wanting children. It‚Äôs far kinder than having them and not really wanting them. Not everyone should be a parent and there is nothing wrong with that.
The biggest downside is the window women have to conceive children I've witnessed a few swear they never wanted kids and at the last minute when all their friends and family had kids then totally panic and try having them it's just crazy
Literally‚Ä¶‚Ä¶n all soooo delusional
I want free labor and to raise an army of little Vikings that will terrorize the hell scape that will be left over post apocalypse. But also enjoy traveling and not having the responsibilities of being a parent. I think I‚Äôll just keep drinking and drugging and fucking my way into Valhalla
G)  I'm having this child to lock in my spouse.
H)  I am trying to gamble on the gender of my child and hoping I get either an innie or an outie.
‚ÄúI want to give somebody the opportunity to have a life, even though they never asked nor consented to it!‚Äù
If you want unconditional love, get a dog. Kids love is on the condition that you don't treat them like crap all through their childhood. I would've replaced that one with "I want someone to take care of me in my old age." I hear that one a lot.
options A,B,F all get satisfied by just adopting, E you can hire someone, 

C get a pet or AI waifu , option D is pure selfishness.
My girlfriend and I were at her company Christmas party.  We do not want kids.  This mom came up and unloaded on us about how over worked and stressed and, in my opinion, how truly awful it is to be a parent today.

She asked us how we are doing with our kids.  Told her we don‚Äôt have any and don‚Äôt plan on having any (this woman is 5 years younger than us too).

She paused.  Looked to the ground.  Pulled up a smile and said ‚Äúoh! I‚Äôve met couples like you!‚Äù

Okay? And I have met a couple that has spend 145,000 dollars on invetro and now that they are pregnant - they are currently selling things to ‚Äúmake rent‚Äù his words.

Terribly selfish parents.

Not the mention the GoFundmes he advertised every time his fat ass couldn‚Äôt get his fat wife pregnant.

They are 20 and 22.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt - pregnant, and selling things to make rent.

I do not have words how stupid I think they are.
There is the "I want them to experience the gift of life" nonsense. It is not selfish, but it is narcissisticaly assuming your offspring will share your worldview.
Yes, childless life can be selfish and that's ok.

Only selfishness that harms others is shameful. Childlessness is a selfishness that does no harm to anyone and does not even concern anyone except the childless person.
I think it‚Äôs pretty selfless to understand that a child doesn‚Äôt deserve to have a parent that doesn‚Äôt want them
What is a cheap counter to: if I don‚Äôt have children the species will eventually end?
Stealing this!
I want to be a guide for a soul to escape the cycle of death/rebirth.
I‚Äôm not ‚Äúanti‚Äù anything and am unbothered by other people wanting kids, but this is a great response to such a stupid comment.
Nobody ever seems to bother asking WHY people don't want to have kids these days.

It's because nobody can afford to have kids anymore, grandma.
Exactly!!
Love her art!
I'm unable to have kids for various reasons, but i often feel the urge that i wish i could have one. When i analyze that emotion i think its rooted in wishing for control. I feel like so much of my life has been missed optertunites or miss managed and wish I could give somone better circumstances that I have.
I want to shut my parents up.
There's nothing more ironic than parents calling childfree people as "selfish" üòÇ
As a guy I don‚Äôt want kids purely for these reasons.

I don‚Äôt have any paternal instincts. I don‚Äôt know any real ‚Äúman‚Äù shit for the little one to learn like how to do an oil change, etc. I have never had a job that pays enough for me to be able to take care of myself let alone the mother of my child, our child and any/all living expenses or occurrences. A child of my own‚Ä¶cant imagine it. 

Also I‚Äôve never had a real relationship in my life and don‚Äôt expect to tbh. But yet due to wider society‚Äôs machinations I am signed up to be a father against my will and I‚Äôm supposed to be taking that lying down. No I won‚Äôt be. 

Have I met people with kids already? Yes and that‚Äôs been a dealbreaker without the conversation ever being had for one reason or another. Do I have platonic friends with kids and met those kids? Yes several times and they‚Äôre great kiddos with great personalities. 

I‚Äôm not father material. I wish my family would understand this. And ex friends to understand that further.
Try a reason that's doesn't star with I want lol.
I want tacos is a shit reason to have tacos, right?
If you want taco, I make you taco is a little better but we live in a society where people are like.

Her: I don't like taco.

Me: you should have a taco, taco make you happy.

Her: I'm gonna not have taco.

Me: *makes taco* look at my taco üåÆ üòã, I'm sure when you meet the right person you can be happy too.

Her: I DONT WANT TACO üò§. 

Me: "I'm literally making taco as I write this, actual food taco not a euphemism"
Notice how every sentence starts with "I want..."
Not having children is selfless. Why bring anyone into this shit world?
everyone should have the right to decide whether they want or not. I‚Äôm saying this bc when we say we don‚Äôt want ppl say it‚Äôs selfish‚Ä¶. Like no it‚Äôs not selfish we just don‚Äôt want something lol.
Used to want to be a mom. Now that I‚Äôm an adult and see that it‚Äôs not feasible - instead of waiting to give my unconditional love to my nonexistent children, I shall give adopt a couple more pets
G: The soul gets a vessel to incarnate  
If you believe in that sort of thing.  
Anyway I don't generally associate parenting with selfishness, but I'd never have a child in my economic conditions--I think people having children born knowingly into a world that is as coarse and sandpaper, without some kind of great advantage... Kind of wrong, y'know, IDK.
No selfishness? Alright then op, donate all your possessions to charity.
It‚Äôs funny to me because I consider my choice not to have children to be a deep personal sacrifice. But ok.
I wish I could upvote this a million times

I want a kid so bad. It would be so fucking cool. But I just won't do it. I won't subjugate an unborn soul to a broken system. How broken? Broken enough for me to not want to have a kid.
‚ÄúI want unconditional love‚Äù. 
Children and babies don‚Äôt give that. If you abuse them, any love that they had for you might be lost.
Only reason i'd want a kid would be through adoption to leave them with cool shit, lessons on what i did wrong, and money when i die.
üëè
scrolled the whole comment section. Still no logical arguement against anti natalism. Just what if my child could cure cancer. Bro your child could have cancer.
Anything anyone wants to do, which they then do, is selfish.
Good meme
If only stupid people breed, humanity and the world is doomed. Just my 2 cents. Of course, y'all probably hate humanity too
So many people have the wrong motivation for having kids, even when it's intentional.

You want kids because you have romanticized the idea of a loving family. 
I want kids because I need to make sure that the next generation doesn't fuck everything up because of incompetent, natalist parents.

We are not the same.
They left out the main one.... 

To perpetuate the human race
I don't want the government to take all my millions when I die.  I already pay enough in taxes.  And I don't own a cat to give it all away to.
This post is also known as a straw-woman.
Antinatalism creates a stalemate in life. All things you do for yourself are selfish.
Antinatalist or natalist I'd argue that almost all human behaviors and motivations have a selfish origin.
Would "I want to give my kids a better life than I had" be a bad reason?
Where is ‚ÄúI want to have a family‚Äù?
A person should not be selfish but the maintenance of a species requires selfish acts. Ultimately no wrong can be done by humanity for failing to survive as a species. However, if we are responsible for the suffering of those we bring into the world, we are responsible for the suffering that they bring into the world. You see, we knew there was a possibility that our kids would have kids and that we would not be able to stop them. in some number of generations the number of potentially suffering human beings resulting from your decision outnumbers the people who could reproduce today. Are we not then obliged to minimise harm and stop everyone forcefully from committing this atrocity?
The world sucks, but good people can make it better. I'm in a fairly stable position, and by the numbers, children born into similar circumstances generally have better shots at being in better positions themselves. Furthermore, raising them with the ideal of improving the world would make it likely that they will have the desire to continue to do so in adulthood. Such a situation improves the chances that in 20 years, there will be more adults in stable positions who are trying to tackle big problems.  


A thought for the last panel. The first is just rude on green-shirt's end.
Im fucking watching real life the movie Idiocracy happen fuck man I hope man I hope this shit isn't
üòí If this is real you people suck
The only right answer to me is : I think life is beautiful so I want another one to experience it, or, life need to continue even tho it sucks. I only see these 2 options.
Its neither selfish or selfless. Its just a thing you can do.
I want other people experience the joy of living
‚ÄúBecause new life is a gift! Be fruitful and multiply!‚Äù
If you're posting Lainey Molnar unjokingly you've already lost the intellectual high ground.

I'm sure I'll get significant pushback given what sub this is, but it keeps popping up in my feed for some reason so here goes:

1. I don't want the human species and millions of years of evolution to come to an end because of my personal preferences.
2. I don't want society to collapse due to depopulation, which would lead to mass unrest, violence, starvation as countries become 90%+ elderly.
3. I don't want to have to rely on the work of other people's children to look after me and keep society functioning once I'm old.
4. I want to raise a child as well as possible, as a properly socialised and educated human can bring a huge amount of joy into other people's lives and can help alleviate significant suffering from the world.
5. One of my siblings has had several children already and I want my nieces to have the emotional and physical support of a big extended family like I had. If I choose to not have kids now because "society is too fucked", I'd feel like I'm abandoning my sister and my nieces in a way (they'd end up living in the fucked up society I described that's majority old people).
The one I get from my parent is that it's my duty as given by god to bear children.
The only acceptable answer to this I‚Äôve ever heard:

‚ÄúI wanted to be a parent because I love children, I‚Äôm patient, I‚Äôve always wanted to be a parent to help raise kind, loving and hardworking people and members of the society they‚Äôll enter into one day.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember who this person was but I applaud them. That‚Äôs a good and only answer to why someone wants kids that isn‚Äôt selfish.
"I want to see a person truly happy,and see how big of a difference having a good parent is"
To be a better father to them than my dad was to me
"I have surplus resources and I can provide a home and guidance to a child"
Cause life deserves respect, even the ones that aren't born.

If the point of antinatialism is that there's no selfless reason to have a child then why are we bitching about it and not trying to change society so it's a selfless act all on its own?
I want to share my life lessons with a little one that is just as dynamic as me.
The choice made by someone for themselves sounds selfish? I need Peter for this
"to help prevent the inversion of the population pyramid and maintain a favorable dependency ratio"
I want another life to to get to experience the beauty and wonder of our planet and share in perceiving the marvels of the world, and continue the human race so these experiences may continue to live on.

G: Because I want to give the gift of life to someone, and just because a minority of people see it as a curse doesn't diminish their chances of having a good life
It's obviously wrong to call someone who doesn't want children "selfish". And many people
do have children for selfish reasons.

But you can drive satisfaction from cultivating an idillic childhood, and watch them learn, grow and appreciate life?

I mean you can do lots of selfless things and feel good about doing it. Does that mean it's selfish?
I can never understand why the experience of life is just not enough reason for having children. From both materialistic standpoint, and emotional standpoint they sacrefice a lot, for wich I am grateful. 

Actually good parents would never make anyone their caretakers.

Also forgot to mention just how much unconditional love the children gets, it's never a one way thing
To love *them* unconditionally.
Everything except C is ok. And E

Experience unconditional love by giving unconditional love. It‚Äôs not something you automatically get when you have a kid. 

E is fine except you actually have to be a decent person to your kids or they won‚Äôt wanna take care of you when you‚Äôre old
Both are selfish. We are selfish creatures. 

Wanting to not have them? Almost always, there is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sacrifice my life for kids‚Äù hidden behind. 

Wanting to have them? Almost always a need to feel accomplished and a sense of purpose. 

Choose your selfishness.
True but I‚Äôll up you this one. Name one decision that isn‚Äôt selfish on some level. And yes, efilism counts assuming you personally want life to end
Great ! But now name anything that you do that isn't selfish since starting everything with "I want" seems to be
‚ÄúI want to give the gift of life and the human experience is the only infinitely valuable thing we have in this universe‚Äù
It is neither selfish or unselfish to have or not have children. Simply a choice that each petson/couple is free to make on their own.
It's fine to not want kids, but all this talk about how miserable life is and this and that. If you're miserable then go out and find joy, go do what makes you happy instead of bitterness taking over and just complaining. You didn't consent to living but you're here so might as well make the most of it that you can.
Me when strawman
I want another soul to enter this beautiful but flawed world. Wouldnt call that selfish, now would you.
I want them to experience the beauty this world has to offer, and I believe I'm a good example of someone to learn from.
Neither is selfish, this whole sun is over correcting way too hard
Oh yeah? A natural urge that will benefit the human race
I have one: to continue the existence of the species. You know, the reason all life exists
D, E and F for me thanks, got two mini me's running around. üòÅ

If you want to experience unconditional love just get a puppy.
That's alright but is it not selfish on my part to expect others' children to contribute to my wellbeing when I am old and incapable (directly and indirectly as health workers, tax payers, etc). Is it not equivalent to relegating the very difficult process of developing a human resource onto others and then covertly taking advantage of it later on while not contributing to the mix.
I want someone to grow up and be better and happier than me.
Isn't it also selfish to choose to not have children? Is it really so bad to be selfish when it comes to life-changing matters anyway?
I want my kid to do, and become better than I ever did.
Is there a reason to not have kids that isn‚Äôt selfish? Living for yourself only? I have no problem with this, but seems selective.
Honestly this is kinda dumb because there are people who just want kids with no alternate motive
There's no such thing as true altruism, everything is done for a selfish reason, even not wanting to have kids.
This is so stupid
I believe that I am in a position to raise a child who will be the type of person the world needs more of. This will be fulfilling for both me and my future child, with whom I will share a highly supportive and loving relationship.
This cartoon touches upon an important fact unintentionally: selfishness is righteous and good, and selflessness is evil and stupid.
lol you cant just put i want in front of something to make it selfish
It's their personal choice, if you can brag about a life with a child , so can others , people who didn't have a child .
"I want others to be able to experience and contribute towards all the joy in this world, and realise this will require duty, love and hard work on my part."
I am biologically compelled to continue my speeches.
‚ÄúI want to undertake the most unselfish project I can‚Äù is a more fitting reason. Surrendering heart and soul to a helpless creature is not exactly selfish. 
   
That‚Äôs why babies are very useful in order for people to grow up; they understand what sacrifice is and the meaning in being a servant of something worthwhile. 

As long as people (generally speaking) believe it worthwhile to rear children, they‚Äôre going to need children in order to grow up. 

It just so happens that children are the incarnation of the single most powerful instinct in nature, as well as being inseparable from divine instinct.
What about because you want to help give the gift of life to another person? And yeah I do want my bloodline to go on because I'm a pretty good person and I'll be able to raise a good child. Antinatilism always boils down to the fact that you hate life and you yourself wish you were dead or not born so you call other people terrible for enjoying and accepting the experience of life.
The continuation of the species. So I can teach them to help others. So they can help save the ecology of the planet.
Biological imperative.
Well, to be honest: antinatalists will also need younger people to work for them when they age and  they physically get old, ill or just want to do groceries.

There are many reasons to have children and not all  are selfish.
I would like nothing more than to raise someone who would positively change the world.
Just saw this sub as it got recommended to me. Read some responses. And I‚Äôll just say that it is the best news I have received all day that the people in this sub are removing themselves from the gene pool. Life has a way of working itself out, I guess.
I literally had kids because I wanted to show this world to them. Why isn‚Äôt that option available? None of the options listed are even secondary reasons for my choice.

I‚Äôm feeling like maybe I‚Äôm a lot more privileged than many people on this sub.

PS this showed up on my main page, I‚Äôm not a member of the sub.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so simple minded I can‚Äôt think of any other reason why people might act differently than I do.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the real reason anti natalists don‚Äôt understand others. 

You‚Äôre welcome!
"Yes , I'm selfish.



There's Evil in the name of supporting others. "
A and F are not. If those are somehow selfish, that means literally any interaction between two humans is selfish.
How about the pure biological response: I must ensure the continued existence of my species, which an inherent need programmed into my genes through millions of years of evolution.
I wanna set them up to be happy
So i can give someone else the chances i wish i had.
"Name one reason to be a good person that isn't selfish" -energy
This is so weird. Why is having children seen as a bad thing?
I would like to do the biological duty of continuing the human race.
You guys are too angry here. Children are a beautiful part of the world. Nothing wrong with not wanting your own, but having children does not make you selfish, unless you are having them without truly wanting them. There is nothing selfish about people wanting to responsibly bring a child into this world and raise them thoughtfully.
It‚Äôs a biological imperative to reproduce
I wanted to give the greatest gift in the universe to someone else. Life.
"I want someone else to take care of me when I'm old, but I won't have children, instead I'll free ride of someone else's " 

This is the most pathetic meme
Well, when you only offer selfish choices, then the answer will end up selfish. Let me give you an example.

Which of these reasons has the smallest influence on why you are an absolute asshole.

A. Your crazy love of stomping puppies to death.

B. Your insistence on setting all the homeless people you meet on fire.

C. Your hobby of pushing old people down flights of stairs.

D. Your love of starting forest fires.

This is what you are pretending is a legitimate question when it's really just another whiny, pathetic "everything is so tough in the world" post.
This sub is full of little bitches

No one says it‚Äôs selfish to not want kids 

Grow up and stop circlejerking your hate for people who want to do the very basic human thing of have kids
How can I get reddit to stop showing me this sub? Does anyone know? It's even more depressing than the vegan sub.
This whole sub is hilarious.
I want to get it right.

I want to raise my children and give them the best shot at living genuinely happy, fulfilling lives. I want the love in our family to outweigh the issues they may face in life.

I want to raise them to be good people. So that they go on to make others happy, including their own children if they also desire to have them.

And I believe I can get it right.

I think that's about as selfless a reason as any.
Well, someone else‚Äôs kid will have to take care of you when you‚Äôre old. At some point in life, you‚Äôll have to not only hope someone else has kids, but you‚Äôll need to rely on someone‚Äôs else‚Äôs decision to have a kid

It‚Äôs cool that you guys love to be all depressed and hate people who have kids, but there‚Äôs billions of humans here already who all rely on more humans being born. That means you too, antinatalist, rely on someone else‚Äôs kid to keep society alive so you don‚Äôt suffer. Unless you think a societal collapse will bring less suffering than society as it is now
I wanted someone to play LEGOs and videogames with me. So we had kids. 


Who's forcing kids on all the miserable people in this here sub?
You poor souls
Doing what God called you to do.
No mention of propagating the human species, but adding that would negate your argument which is based on crafting a narrative that you are somehow oppressed because you choose not to have kids. The reality is that your just an annoying prick
Having a child makes you understand your parents better and improve that relationship.
You discover more of your true self through your child.
You can enjoy activities with your child from your youth.
It's great to see a child form into an adult.

If you think children are products of selfishness, then dont date those products.
Interesting. The image is true enough, there's almost no part of wanting to have kids that isn't a reflection of something self serving or self centered. 

But the actual reality of being a parent is a much more selfless existence for most people than being childless. I've no doubt this subreddit has already worked out a way to frame the sacrifices parents make as somehow being narcissistic or selfish though.
Why is it wrong to be selfish?
If you raise your kids right it‚Äôll be a net positive for future society.
So society doesn't collapse from an already failing birth rate.
Humanity needs help from as many minds as possible, we can‚Äôt find solutions that will help us if we simply die out, or allow ourselves to do so.
It is my biological purpose, and everyone else‚Äôs. I was given a gift of life so I will return the favor. The world is amazing and life is a blessing
This sub is fucking insane...
Here is simple answer, because seeing somebody grow up and experience things for the first time is it truly beautiful, they get to see something we take for granted with new eyes and truly appreciate it and while everybody says nobody asked to be born we also don't ask to not be, some people want to give comfort and nurture someone who really needs it whether that be by having their own children or adopting children or hell even fostering, our experiences are what makes us want to live longer their what makes us want to share that with others, I don't care if any of you guys have kids but I don't think it should be selfish to have them either if it's unselfish to not. The two groups don't have to be at odds with each other.

Sometimes  helping someone grow up can be fulfilling.

We all got to grow up, got to do the things we liked, got to form our own personalities and preferences, some people want to share that and give someone else the chance to do the same.

One answer is to reduce suffering, as argued here: https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/17s4kvr/negative_utilitarian_argument_against_antinatalism/
What is this from? What country?
I boss said I was selfish for not wanting kids. I just don‚Äôt understand how they get there!
Lol obviously pulling a soul from the abyss is the unselfish part
I think a good counterpoint would be to prevent social collapse. Places like china will face massive set backs due to an aging demography. This could possibly lead to, particularly in the case of china, a national collapse unprecedented in our life time. To summarize, it's economy  is heavily reliant on low skilled manufacturing. A young work force is necessary to maintain this, and there are few other markets they could successfully occupy due to not breaking out of the middle income trap/ geographic reasons. This means pretty soon low birth rates could send the country into a death spiral, which would cause untold levels of human suffering for people who are pretty happy with there lives. The historical precedent for national collapse in china, is war lords and lot and lot of dead people.

Not saying internationally this is hold true as of now, but an aging humanity would not be gracefull. It would be back to ye-olden days for most people, and not in Tolkenist fantasy type of way, more in a get pillaged, raped, and enslaved type of way.

Governments should try maximally improve peoples quality of life, and make reproduction incentivized and family building subsidized. However ironically, even some of the biggest, winners in rolling out these types of reform this, France and Sweden for example, still have dwindling sub replacement birth rates compared to people in hell on earth circumstances in Africa, the middle east, and other places. To some extent personal responsibility to humanity and the continuation of our species is going to have be expected for us to have a prosperous happy future.

I'm a proponent of fazing in some new-deal esq reforms in America to resurrect the American dream. But it seems like, even in the best case senario for most countries, some social conservatism and baby making pressure is going to have to exist if we want to avoid catastrophe. At least that my opinion, if you have a counter argument, I'm all ears.

And then end up just inflicting their traumas on their kid.
H and B is the reason I ‚Äúwant‚Äù to have a kid, I always thought I could give a child things I never had growing up and it would fix everything, I could have a ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù finally. Which is self admittedly incredibly selfish and dumb
There was a brief time when I was younger that I entertained the idea of having kids *until* I realized I just wanted to prove to myself that I could be a better parent than mine were to me, *and that's a bad reason*. If you really care about and want the best for your offspring, you won't bring them into the world and gamble with the outcome of their life. If you really believe you could be a good parent and want to raise a child, there are thousand of kids who are lonely and unloved who desperately need and want a home and a family who loves them.
Slash, save my marriage, that absolutely won‚Äôt still fall apart regardless of whether there is a kid

Such a good point
Adoption should be considered prior to having children, but you shouldn't really have to adopt though, society needs to fix dating, education and parenting desperately
Triggering the "what about my legacy" crowd by asking them what their great-great-great grandparents names where.

Like seriously that "legacy" is going to last like 2-3 generations max unless you end up doing something good enough or bad enough to go down in the history books. It doesn't take long in the grand scheme of things until your just another nameless ancestor in someone's bloodline.
Exactly!!!
Maybe a legacy isn't just about wealth? That's such a sad and soulless way to look at the sum total of someone's life. Most people don't make their biggest impact on the world through their career, they do it through their personal life.

The world isn't dying. It's greener than it has been in history. Across the world, median wealth and life expectancy are still increasing faster than any time in history.

The doomer worldview isn't based in facts, it's just mental illness.
The planet isn't hellscape. It's just polluted with garbage.
Where did you read that at?
Do you want a syndicate of assassins with nothing to lose? Because that's how you get a syndicate of assassins with nothing to lose.

Strange things also happen: people can be very variable for unknown reasons. For example, my parents were fairly okay parents, and they had five children, four of whom were fairly normal-and who loved them.

One of my brothers, however, who had the same childhood as we did, seemed to grow up as a psychopath. He stole *every single penny* my parents had-and even defrauded them of all of their possessions. My father died a broken man and I strongly believe my mother‚Äôs life was severely curtailed by the whole affair. I can‚Äôt even begin to describe the suffering of the whole family.
Yes and I always thought the parents were supposed to give the unconditional love to the kids, not experience it themselves? Like they should have experienced that with their own parents and if they didn‚Äôt then that ship has sailed.
Same lol
Just like your sentence lol
I agree with the general direction but not the conclusion. I like AN content because I have seen some stuff in my life that has led me to believe that only certain people should be allowed children. All Kids deserve parent but All parents don't deserve kids.

>Apparently only pure selfishness is bad

Well, yeah. Basically anything we as humans do can be labled as selfish. You go shopping and buy things you like? Selfish. Why not buy the cheapest things, or the things no one else buys, and leave the good things for other people? But something being selfish doesn't inherently make it a bad thing. Does the selfish thing *actively* harm anyone else? If it doesn't, then it's not a bad thing to do. Selfish, yes. But not harmful to anyone. 

That shopping example is quite terrible, i will admit, but let me explain it a bit. Something being selfish means it's something you do predominantly for personal gain. When you go shopping, you buy things only with your own personal interest at heart. No one goes shopping and thinks, "I'm gonna buy this specifically so that other people can have the better alternative." Therefore, shopping is selfish. However, it doesn't actively harm anyone around you. So it's not a problem. 

Much like most things in life, selfishness isn't black and white, good or bad. It depends on *context.*
How can something non-sentient be selfish, if it isn't sentient it cannot have a sense of self, if it doesn't have a sense of self how can it be selfish? How is an amoeba selfish? How is a virus selfish? You're anthropomorphizing all other life. Why?
Also there's not wanting to bring an end to the human race and tens of millions of years of evolution because of personal preferences.

I happen to think that what humans have been able to create and achieve over hundreds of thousands of years is absolutely astounding. I think it is worth fighting for our survival as a species and seeing what things we can achieve in the future.
I like the condition "unless we become immortal machines."

The flesh is weak, we'd solve a lot of our problems by becoming more mechanical (assuming we can create a sustainable form of machinery such as lab grown brain cells for computing and lab grown limbs/minimal lab grown organs for structure and function).

Not fully metal, but nowhere near as organic as we are now and much more repairable.
Just a reminder, if you plan to live past 60, you too will be relying on young people to run the world and take care of things for you for the remainder of your life. 

Someone‚Äôs gotta pave those roads.
I expect the money that I save on not having children to create jobs for people who will take care of me. Win-win-win ‚ú®
They might cure cancer...even though statistically they're  a million times more likely to get it
I understand the thing but because the solutions exist doesn't mean they're gonna be applied.
Almost anybody could make school and education free since education exists but someone had to do it at some point in history. It can be the same for almost every problem in the world. So yeah, the baby of someone somewhere will maybe solve world hunger applying one of these solutions.
I hope she is, (maybe you can ask her ?) I hope the children is happy too.

And finally, I hope you too are happy (anybody reading too) and having a nice day or night and if not, me and maybe most people here are all ears to help you or at least listen to you
Im 36. Hasnt happened yet.
There isnt really a 'last minute' so to speak, it takes longer to conceive in your early to mid 40's but fertility doesnt fall off a cliff. Hoping they actually looked at some data before making their decisions!
They didn't say they didn't want it either, if you ask most people if they didn't want to be called in this world in the first place, most would say they're fine with their existence no matter the amount of suffering they had.

It is an unfortunate and sad thing in my opinion that we can't ask the non-existent beings if they wanna become existent, but what I see is that there is more people happy that were given the opportunity to have a life than the opposite.
Well, i do hear that small children love unconditionally (probably because people see small children and dogs having similar mental capacity?) and that it's adults who don't love unconditionally. But they shouldn't have a child just to experience it tho.
Exactly this. Also it‚Äôs still selfish because if you have the money and resources to share the good parts of life with someone then you are depriving a kid in foster care of that experience.
Most antinatalists also believe that humanity causes lots of pain and suffering especially to animals and other creatures. So reducing the human population even to the point of extinction is the ultimate solution to prevent all forms of pain.

Having children also causes harm to a potential child that didn‚Äôt want to be alive (aka all of us antinatalists me included) and the potential children of these children, for generations to come.

The only selfless choice is to avoid birthing, even if that will hurt the quality of life of our generation when we get older, eventually it will create a more sustainable society and hopefully extinction
Aslong as the childless person doesn't expect anything from society when they can no longer contribute. 

When you retire, who will be keeping society running for you while you sit at home..... 

Other people children.
Technically if you plan on living in a functioning world when you‚Äôre 60, and didn‚Äôt contribute to raising a new generation, then you can be described as a freeloader in that aspect. 

I personally don‚Äôt harbor any ill will against childless people, I just know we‚Äôre all going to want running water when we‚Äôre 73. And it doesn‚Äôt run by magic lol. That‚Äôs all
Reply with ‚Äúand?‚Äù
"Good."
Want to explain why. Or is just calling an argument a strawman a good enough criticism for you.
Exactly. Children make you live for someone else. You can never understand true selflessness until having children. It‚Äôs not for everyone but not having kids is just as selfish. It‚Äôs 18 years of sacrifice as a minimum.
Yes
Who doesn't
Two people make a family
Forcefully how???
Obligated why? Reproducing in your words isn't the only harmful thing we do. We eat other animals too for example. At the core of the argument, we are trying to draw the line to what we are morally obligated to do, and what we can let slide, and while i can fully support a person doing that for themselves, i think it's ignorant to think you are the one to draw the line for humanity. 

Unless you have stopped doing anything at all and starving yourself to death, then you may be what we should all be aiming for anyway :D idk
It's already happened.  Have you seen congress?
Nooo life is nothing but suffering üò° how dare you be happy and share that happiness and a positive and healthy mindset
And what if they don‚Äôt enjoy life?
Says the selfish fool forcing someone into a miserable world like thisü§°
1. Sunken cost fallacy.
2. Suffering and life are intertwined, some antinatalists want humans to be willing to have a last generation, so it ends
3. Yeah, people don't want jobs or to help others if it's not their own blood...go back and rethink that one.
4. I agree with this one.
5. Kinda a 2 parter. Part1. What are friends/neighbors/communities for? Don't give me the 'ooo it's not my bloodline it's not the same' though there are societal/cultural structures that make us way less communal than we are meant to live. Part2. This is almost emotional self abuse, can't help ya on that one.
Now, pretend I am the child that you had to fulfill all these reasons.

1. I resent you for birthing me without my consent just because you care for the blimp that is humanity in a galaxy with a sun set to explode and obliterate us anyways

2. I resent you for birthing me so that I am now forced to work to survive and ultimately sustain this system that will force others to work to survive in a never ending cycle without being able to do anything about it

3. I resent you for birthing me to be your caretaker, even though I might have a disability or cancer or die before you and force others to take care of both me AND you instead.

4. I resent you for birthing me so that I now have to make others feel happy though I owe nothing to nobody and am dealing with my own existential crisis and trying to fulfill your wish and expectations when you could‚Äôve used the thousands of dollars you used to raise me to adopt or donate to charities that would‚Äôve done way more than I ever will in my lifetime 

5. I resent you for birthing me to be your nieces playmate, and for providing them with support in a world of older people, now it is my problem to take responsibility of their happiness when I could‚Äôve very well not have been born and not have to deal with all these expectations. I also might not even like your nieces and be hurt by them and force myself to be their friends for your own sake.

In other words, I am glad I was not born as your child, and I feel really sorry for whatever soul will be created for your own selfish purposes.
I feel the same but it‚Äôs hilarious because you spent so much time and thought into this but you might as well be talking to a lamp. These people have to be bots or trolls. It was on the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù page and I took the bait and I can‚Äôt stop reading! Very glad none of these people will be repopulating tbh
There is absolutely no unselfish reason to have children. The only unselfish reason you have listed is continuing the human race, and even then, you have 8 billion people on this planet. Until the human race actually needs to fear extinction, you making a decision to have a child is NOT going to affect the human population. Sorry, you aren't that special.

3 & 4 are insane. Have children "make a better planet"? Lol, humans being the active destroyers of this planet. Adults clearly are incapable of teaching future generations to give a damn. Also, you're having children for them to care for you in the future? Absolutely disgusting and 1000000000% selfish. How you dubbed that an unselfish reason to have children is mind-boggling. The LAST thing you should want is your own children wipping your ass for you when you're too decrepit to do so yourself. Literally, that makes you a TERRIBLE person. "Yeah, let my children shoulder the responsibility of being care givers while I die slowly." Absolutely abhorrent.

Edit: spelling corrections
Haha thats fucked up
It‚Äôs still selfish. That child did not consent to be alive nor to have to experience fear of death and pain in order to be someone else‚Äôs life goal
How is this not selfish? So you THINK you would be a great parent, produce a productive member of society? 

And what if you parent the next major serial killer, who just snapped one day?

Still. Selfish. There isn't a single reason to have kids that aren't completely selfish. Humans are 8 billion strong - don't think you can even use the argument of population number. 0 unselfish reasons to have kids.
Then you can also provide that to an adoptive child
"I want"
There are plenty of already existing humans that you can use your money and resources for that purpose
‚Ä¶While removing that potential of unconditional love from someone that is currently alive and waiting in the foster system
False. A lot of antinatalist actually suffer because they want kids but force themselves not to have them for the greater good.
Not birthing :)
Just because it‚Äôs valuable to you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs valuable to us
historical fear rain fragile apparatus touch squeeze seed test scary

Unfortunately there are a lot of people that wish they were never born which is why birthing someone is actually considered non consensual.

Also if you have those resources to show someone the beauty of the world you should use them towards people that are already alive and struggling to see beauty rather than creating a brand new human and using all your resources on them instead
All parents of people that wish they were never born though they were good examples too :)
How is the continuation of our own species not a selfish act?
Do you feel like our species is in jeopardy of not continuing?  I‚Äôll give you a hint; the answer is: no.  Be honest, you felt the biological urge to reproduce and so you did.  There is no need to put lipstick on a pig.  You did what you wanted and contributed to the destruction of the earth.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
our species is destroying all life on earth though
That's an *argumentum ad naturam* fallacy, and a monstrous one.  One of the strongest tools in humanity's propagation toolbox through prehistory, antiquity, really its entire existence prior to the very recent past has been rape.  Are you good with that practice in the name of continuing the species as well?
No, I expect the money that I save on not having children to create jobs for people who will take care of me. Win-win-win üî•
Not my problem.
You cannot control that
and if they don't...?
Very egotistical of you.
Of course, birth is good for society, but that doesn't mean it's good for the child, and just because you don't accept something doesn't mean you can call it evil or stupid.If you don't agree with what I say, give a situation where selfishness is good for the child, not because it is good for society. If you give such an example, then we will understand that selfishness is a evil and stupid thing.
To you
What if they don‚Äôt want to or care to? Does their opinion not matter? My parents wanted that for me and I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù. Where‚Äôs my choice in the matter? Now my only options to leave are pain or more pain. Thanks dad :)
So you‚Äôre an NPC lol
The most unselfish project a person can undertake is using the money, time, resources and knowledge that they possess on someone that currently exists and is suffering. Creating a brand new human being and then raising it yourself is like you‚Äôre a firefighter in front of a burning house and instead of putting out the fire, you start a fire yourself in another house and then you put it out and expect credit and recognition while the other house in front of you is still burning and now you have less water to put it out.
Antinatalism always boils down to the fact that every single one of us in this sub was born and raised exactly by someone like you. Parenting style does not dictate weather someone will become an antinatalist or not.
Still selfish...
having one child adds 9,441 tonnes of carbon dioxide to the carbon legacy of each parent. This equates to more than five times their own lifetime carbon emissions. The potential savings from reduced reproduction are therefore dramatic.

Statistically, you help more to save the ecology of the planet by not having kids.
Sooo you‚Äôre an NPC‚Ä¶?
1. Most antinatalists agree that once they reach that point they will just end their life

2. The money that antinatalists save on not having children to create jobs for people who will take care of them.
Then raise someone that is already alive? Or become a teacher and educate thousands of kids to make that change? There are so many better things you can do with all the money, time and resources you would instead be putting into having a brand new child that will only add 9,441 tonnes of carbon dioxide to the carbon legacy of each parent. This equates to more than five times their own lifetime carbon emissions.
Everyone says this and most of us end up being just wage slaves, no change no positivity.  And it all ends in painful death anyways.

Let's just skip a bunch of steps and not be born at all.
Jokes on you, every antinatalist on this sub was birthed from a breeder like you lol
My parents birthed me for that same reason, now I‚Äôm 25 and I straight up told them I resent them for birthing me.

I saw the world. Now what?

Gotta work a 9 to 5 until my legs can‚Äôt hold me up anymore or dementia kicks in.

Thanks mom :)
You wanted to show them this shit world? What are you going to tell them when they suffer?
>because I wanted to show this world to them

This isn't Narnia. This is a capitalist hellhole.
I guess the main argument against this is why don't you just adopt or "that is a selfish reason" but it is honestly one of the better reasons to have a kid if only everyone thought like you do but sadly we have millions of people having kids simply because they think it is time and neglect them.
Agreed... I think there are some really beautiful things in life. I find joy in cooking, baking, painting, creating. I don't think wanting to share the things I love with friends is selfish.
Genuine question - could you enlighten us with a non-selfish reason to have kids?
If people here are arguing the benefits of mass excitation that means that our biological evolution got us to the point of questioning our existence as our own inherent need programmed into our genes.

Maybe you just got an old update lol
What if they aren‚Äôt happy?
What if they don‚Äôt want them?
The child never consented to being born. Once they are born, their only escape consists of a painful death and causing sadness to all those around them.
No I expect the money that I save on not having children to create jobs for people who will take care of me. Win-win-win ‚ú®
There's a button top left where you can get them to show "fewer posts like this". After clicking that, you can choose to not see any posts from the sub. (To clarify, I am also not a member of this sub, I just stumbled across it recently by chance).
You forget that every single antinatalist comes from a family line that started from someone that thought the same as you.

Even though your own children might love life, there is still a very high chance that your grand children or great grand children will resent life so much and hate every part of it.

You cannot control the view your generations will have of the world. The only safe way to prevent all suffering is to not have any children.
"I want" still selfish. but good for you I guess, as long as you accept them for who they are
No I expect the money that I save on not having children to create jobs for people who will take care of me. Win-win-win ‚ú®
And if there are no more humans left to take care of me because they are all extinct, then that will be the end of me, everyone else and all of humanity‚Äôs suffering.
So I guess everyone is selfish
Great, as long as you acknowledge it was a selfish decision
Somewhere a kid in a foster home that loves LEGOs was left to rot because you chose to create a brand new one instead
Lol. Your username speaks volumes.

Free will. Us all thinking like this, thinking that we dont want kids, is apparently all part of "God's" plan. I love how Christians conveniently leave out the fact that, if God is all knowing, that he would FKN KNOW that we would think this way. 

This is identical to Christians who don't do "modern medicine" because "God will heal them". Lol, if that is what you believe, who the fk do you think put doctors on this planet?

Ever think that people thinking this way may be God's way of checking our out-of-control population? We were supposed to be caretakers of this Earth, and we love destroying the shit out of it. We are on a fast track to making this planet inhabitable for us, and you're worried about the mission from "God" to be incubators.

Who the actual fk are you to think that you know the plan, function, rules, ect. of a GOD?! Don't say the Bible - it was written by men. People who follow any religion, really, are incredibly laughable. The people who try to apply their religion culturally, or on other people in general, are dangerous.
Worked at a job where we, as women, were absolutely treated differently for not having children. The women having children, taking months off of work, not putting in an ounce of effort into the job, but reaping all the credit could get away with MURDER. Hell, they would get PROMOTED for having kids at my work. Never showing up, always saying, "Oh well, my kids [insert excuse to not do a goddamn thing at work]." In my experience, children are exclusively used as scapegoats for a person to do NOTHING when it comes to being productive members of society.

I know this isn't the case for all workplaces, but to say that we aren't treated differently for making the choice to not have children is hysterical.
Yeah, still selfish...
If you create a problem for yourself to solve you can‚Äôt just call yourself selfless. The problem was never there to begin with until you created it for yourself to solve.

Also you‚Äôre assuming that all childless people use those thousands of dollars that would instead be going to a brand you human being to themselves. That money would instead be going to currently existing people, people that are here right now and deserve to find that happiness that you wish so much for your own child.
Username checks out,
The goal is to reach mass extinction to avoid endless suffering
What if they don‚Äôt view life as a favor but as hell?
What about those children that end their lives because of how much they resent being born?
copro is shit, our shitty overlords xD
"You mean Amazon?"

"Yes"
oh shit can't come up with a good argument against antinatalism time to call its followers *involuntarily* celibate for being... *voluntarily* celibate and/or practicing safe sex. that probably makes sense! time to ignore them and keep pumping out new consumers.
*sighs in collateral damage*
It sounds like you all had terrible upbringings and I'm sorry that happened to you but stop basing your entire personality around your projections. Thanks.
And in fact, I'd suggest the addition of a kid to an already shaky marriage will only increase the odds of failure, as children, especially in the early years, significantly add stress from increased financial and time demands.
They want to be better parents than their own parents were, they think having a child will fix them. There are so many, children will complete you blah blah blah.
I doubt it very seriously. But then again anything can be a rule violation. I am EMS worker got hit with a violation for talking about how I've seen people commit suicide. Or the grey scenes I've seen, especially the burn victims.
Are you okay? How did you find that out?
I think some degree of selfishness is necessary. We‚Äôre all selfish every moment that we‚Äôre failing to sell all our possessions and give all the resultant money to known causes of saving lives. Doesn‚Äôt mean one must. Maybe it‚Äôs that ‚Äúwhat if everyone does this‚Äù idea. I don‚Äôt know, but I like what you said.
This is such a good point!!! We all end up forgotten  anyway. Even the more rich and famous people, it just takes longer
Yeah sure, the war on Ukraine and Israel, the imminent threat of a new economy collapse, a possible WW3. Yeah, must be all in my head.
This planet is absolutely hell. You just see the world through rose coloured glasses.
That's a good point too! I mean I have people in my life who I love and who love me a lot to begin with, so I definitely don't feel like I'm missing anything that a kid could potentially provide (not that they should have to provide anything for me, but that's your entire point).

But, that's also how I know I'm not maternal. If someone craves that bond, it's fine. And I think that's more in line with what they mean, but they don't say it right. At least, I hope.
Bringing someone into this shithole is way more selfish than not doing so. 
Are you daft? Took at look at your profile‚Ä¶.
Please don‚Äôt ever  breed. Gross‚Ä¶
Exactly, there is no philosophical consensus that selfishness is immoral or unethical.
I'm gonna be honest I did recently go shopping and specifically pick up stray items rude customers had left lying around so that the people working there didn't have to deal with putting them back in the right place, and so that they wouldn't expire and contribute to food waste. Also considered picking up a more expensive toilet roll in case someone could only afford the cheaper version of which there was only one pack left.

where was i going with this

uhhh don't be a dick to minimum wage employees. yeah that's a good moral to take away from this i think.
Love that the person below you thinks picking up stray items rude customers left behind is selfless. It's pure selfishness disguised in selflessness. It's about accruing ethical capital to use later or now. Which they literally just cashed in on the internet to prove that they are a selfless person. Pure examples of how one selfishly remembers one's selfless acts. If they were selfless, why does the self need to remember them, let alone recount them to strangers who weren't there to witness it? The "selfless acts" are obviously good for the self.

There's a reason why they tell you not to air your good deeds out in public view. It's just proof that they're ethical capital to you. Not that non-disclosed good deeds aren't ethical capital either.

I work in geriatrics, but thanks for the heads up.

I didn't say young people wouldn't take care of me, I said I'm not squeezing them out so they can. That's what home healthcare and care facilities are for. We're in no danger of the world becoming unpopulated. We are, however, in danger of the poverty cycle stunting the advancement of those who are forced to give birth in christofascist states instead of, say, going on to school to become a caregiver.
We can solve these problems NOW, without adding fresh fuel to the fire, chill on having kids just because you want kids and actually make the world a much better place. Who knows, maybe one day it might make sense to have kids again. Let‚Äôs chill on these weak natalist talking points for a sec, realize that blindly reproducing only helps the 1% keep us all in line, revolt with all our hearts and stop giving the bastards anymore of our life and blood.
After 30, the chances of complications or deformities  jump significantly.

Having kids at 40 is just irresponsible.
That makes sense. I was thinking more when the kid gets older.
Good point
Do pensioners get water for free? No. They pay for water from their own funds, which they have accumulated over the course of their lives, just as they pay for everything else they use and consume. And the infrastructure that they use was built with the help of taxes that they paid to the state during their lives and continue to pay, legally buying services and goods.
Hahahaaaa
It's pretty self-explanatory. There are an infinite amount of reasons to have children, and plenty that aren't selfish. Choosing only a finite amount with answers that are all specifically chosen to be selfish as the sole option is clearly a straw man.
A lot of people
No that‚Äôs a couple.
The point is that it is an arbitrary line that is being drawn. If having children is wrong because of the suffering it may incur, then it is also wrong because of the suffering one's children may incur. After n generations, the number of children born to your poor decision becomes greater than the population now. Since this is true of anyone who might reproduce now, all have a similar moral obligation not to. Yet at some point the difference in the number of people who would suffer if forcefully made to stop reproducing and the number of people who would be born suffering if humanity continues is so vast as to make a ban in children a trivial act.
Idk maybe that‚Äôs just your crippling depression and pitiful social skills.
Jokes on you every single antinatalist was bred by a natalist lol
Antinatalism isn't genetic sweetheart
Doesn‚Äôt sound like rationalisation at all.
You then refuse to procreate for your own reasons which I find completely okay, but since you didn't ask it because it doesn't exist in the first place, how can you tell your potential children didn't want to experience life ? How isn't that selfish that you don't want to contribute to our society and the perpetuation of humanity ?
Fun fact: you just fell victim to the argumentum ad hominem fallacy
1) ‚Äúbiological urge‚Äù you are proving my point
2) I have not reproduced and therefore half of your reply has been invalidated
No. Our species is the best hope for life to survive.
That‚Äôs just not what appeal to nature is.
True, butci can inprove the chances by being a good parent.
That's what good parenting is. If you are a good parent your kids will do good.
Well apparently parenting style does if everyone in the sub was raised by someone like me lol. Bottom line is you hate life so I feel bad for you seeing as how you are alive currently. I hope you find peace and acceptance.
It's selfish to make the decision that life isn't worth it and that the millions of lifeforms that could potentially exist because of your actions won't get to because you decided for them that life is a waste of time. Why not let them decide themselves?
Yes, so you want others to have children first you to hire when you need them. That‚Äôs also pretty selfish. 

I‚Äôm totally fine with people that don‚Äôt want to have children. But don‚Äôt use false arguments or fallacies to justify. You don‚Äôt need justification. It‚Äôs you body, your life. Do as you please with it.
Damn... I genuinely feel sorry for people who are so perpetually miserable.

BTW I, too, am not a member of this sub, just have seen it mentioned and it showed up on my page and I've refrained from commenting until now.

I've read through every comment on this post in utter fascination. 

No one is obligated to have children, nor should they be faulted for choosing not to.

But my god, it's like you have truly never experienced joy in your life and can not fathom how others might enjoy life and want to share it with others in an attempt to make the world a better place.

Truly, you seem a miserable person and I commend you for not having children if this is the kind of toxicity you bring to the world.
>You wanted to show them this shit world? 

Lol, I swear I've never seen an anti-natalist who isn't just a miserable person who thinks everyone else must inevitably be miserable too.

>What are you going to tell them when they suffer?

What does this even mean? It sounds like your intend it to be some kind of zinger, as if no parent in history has successfully helped (reactively or preemptively) their child through 'suffering' before. I'm sorry that you find life so bad, but it doesn't have to be that way for everyone
He cannot do so, there‚Äôs none, that‚Äôs why he feels triggered by this post without being able to bring a satisfying counter argument.
Life begets life. 

It‚Äôs just your personal opinions that humans doing what all other life does is ‚Äúselfish‚Äù only when humans do it. 

Most people don‚Äôt agree with you. 

Is it selfish when a dog has puppies? Is it selfish when a plant sprouts or puts off seeds?
What about all the beauty in the world that we get to experience? Life is difficult and messy, but it is also magical. Every year I feel thankful for the flowers in Spring, the smell of fresh rain, the summer sun on my skin, walking barefoot in the sand, the colourful leaves of fall and the first snow of the year in winter. We are at an incredible moment in history where we can actually choose to have or not to have a child. I am so grateful I can choose to bring a new spirit into this world and to show them all the beauty and love I can. I hope you can experience some of that joy for yourself, even on days when it feels isolating and dark. You are not alone, but you are trapped in a time that demands individual success instead of community support. It is unfairly hard, but it can also be changed in our only little slice of this complex and bright blue world. Don‚Äôt forget you breathe in trees and breathe out flowers. You are apart of this world and very much wanted and needed. Your creativity and being has more impact than you could ever know.
This is literally impossible
Not everyone will be an antinatalist - that is almost guaranteed. So the question is not whether I am able to stop all suffering but whether I am able to have a positive impact on future generations. I believe that I will be able to spread my good nature through my children and that they will do the same. 

Yes, I am producing unjust suffering. But I believe that I am also preventing/counteracting this suffering in equal measure, if not in excess.

I believe that for each good person who decides not to have children the world becomes a worse place. But I do understand and respect people who make that choice.
Who‚Äôs the selfish one again?
That's a pretty dumb pov
Downvote all you want but that's just not true. The definition of selfless applies pretty much exactly to the priorities of good parents. So, just using the language in an accurate manner you could use the word selfless.

Then you say "I'm assuming that all childless people use those thousands of dollars on themselves?". Where did I assume that? Just quote what I said that supports that. I don't assume anything about people who choose not to have kids, I completely support them in their decision.

Look, you reduced kids to "problems" and then seemed to equate parenting with "money". I think you might be autistic. I don't even mean that as an insult.
BOOOOM ROASTED DUUUUUDE!
It is my job to make sure they view life as a blessing. I suppose south Asians are a bit different in that regard.
[removed]
"I hate capitalism! That's why I'm going to perform zero praxis against it beyond not having kids!"

You gotta hand it to the baizuo. Just when you think they can't come up with a lazier form of slacktivism, they turn out something like this. Doing great honey, socialist state by 2050 at this rate!
I'm going to remind you what page your on before commenting further.
...I've literally had comments deleted for mentioning potential trauma being a reason for AN beliefs. They're doing the same for N here. Rule 11 apparently applies to both AN/N..., but apparently not. MODs are hypocrites.
I was ironically listing a reason that having children can be non selfish. I've seen 3 ladies in that situation in my career. One was way to young to be expected to deal with that stuff. World's a messed up place.
Even Bach was nearly forgotten.  One of the greatest composers and had a ton of kids, although I think most of them ended up dying young.
War in Ukraine: Most likely outcome is that Russia will annex the portion that they currently control.

War in Israel: who could have ever predicted that the region of the world that's been at war for over 100 years continues to do so?

Imminent economic collapse and WWIII: these aren't real, they're just in your head.
Hahahaha. I've seen more dead, maimed, sexually abused, and fucked up people than most. Those rose colored glasses got lost a long time ago. But I also know the difference between pollution and genuine hell too. If you get of rid of the trash on this planet it wouldn't be a stagnant pool of suffering. It'd be a beautiful place thriving with life and splendor.
Very daft, thank you! I have 4 children, they will greatly outlive you and I. I will mean something to them which I am proud of, but more importantly I‚Äôm glad I gave them the gift of life like I was given. I cherish seeing every bit of growth they go through. however, eventually my memory will fade away after generations. You and I will be the same. In the end does that matter for you or I? No. But I enjoy a lot of life‚Äôs pleasures and am glad to pass that on. And yeah my Reddit profile is a shame and an escape from real life for a while but my wife knows that. It‚Äôs not my personality and id be pretty scared if I put my whole personality into an app. Rest easy, life‚Äôs hard and it‚Äôs not getting much better any time soon.
Y'know what, fair enough. Tho I'm sure you can acknowledge that this is the vast minority of how people go shopping. Even when people do buy cheaper stuff, it's usually so they can buy more stuff, not so other people can have the more expensive stuff.
You can just commit good old fashioned suicide...

That is kinda selfish though... coz someone kid is gonna have to clean you up.
Hello,

We've removed this content as a violation of Reddit's content policy.

Reddit's content policy regarding suicide is problematic. It officially misclasses suicide as "self-harm" and we are **required** to adopt this position by removing any content it considers to "incite", "encourage", "promote" or "call for" the so-called self-harm. Reddit are known to crack down on subreddits that allow suicide-related content much harder than those that violate other rules so we err on the side of caution when deciding whether to remove.

Thank you for your understanding,

u/exzact
Right, but the belief we are overpopulated and need to optimize is not the argument of the AN. If everyone was a firm antinatalist (right now), the world will be a burning hellscape right around 2060 or so when there are no people to do all the jobs. 

I‚Äôm just pointing out that if you plan to live into your 60s in a non-burning hellscape, you‚Äôre going to be relying on a new generation to run things, and to shirk the responsibility of raising that generation, well - it‚Äôs a form of freeloading. 

Btw, I don‚Äôt hold animosity against childless people, I‚Äôm just pointing out the facts.
Yeah yeah I understand you on all that don't worry I'm just saying that because we CAN doesn't mean that somebody will do it right now. I'm not even talking about natalism or anything related.
World Hunger won't solve itself automatically even with us having all the cards in hand is my point.
No, turning 30 doesnt cause deformities to jump significantly.

Edit: Downs Syndrome is one of the most common deformities. The really increases by the mid 40s.  https://images.app.goo.gl/MNeoobFWHHSrRKDdA
Your money will be worthless without the existence of the new generation. That‚Äôs just the facts.
Let's hear these selfless reasons to have children.
Under the U.S. Census Bureau definition, family households consist of two or more individuals who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption, although they also may include other unrelated people. Nonfamily households consist of people who live alone or who share their residence with unrelated individuals.
Your words mean nothing, you‚Äôre just a pathetic natalist that has to force kids into this world so you can feel whole, so you can feel like you achieved something ü§°
No one is upset you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbreeding‚Äù
No one is upset by that.
It‚Äôs called selflessness
No, if I were to act on my own feelings then I would breed. I instead choose to suffer not having children to avoid creating a life that will experience death, pain and suffering.

We cannot tell if a potential child wants to experience life or not, but it is safer to not birth a child that would‚Äôve wanted to live than to birth a child that didn‚Äôt want to live and is now left with self-unalivement as their only escape.
gonna take that as a joke because we've caused the extinction of many animals and continue to do so
It...absolutely is.  You took an action, the continuation of the species, contextualised it as something that everything does according to biology, and ascribed to it a positive character as an antithesis to antinatalism.  The imputation of a positive character to something that is in the nature of something, something which is 'natural', just because it *is* natural, is the very definition of an *argumentum ad naturam*.
You have higher chances of not doing that just because you decided to bring someone here against their consent and on top of that you are building assumptions and expectations for them to satisfy your vision of morally good by your own standards.
You‚Äôd be surprised to find out that most antinatalists were raised exactly by someone like you or even better than you
So, both antinatalists and natalists are selfish
Nope, I‚Äôm also part of the first group, I will end things when I become incapable of taking care of myself :)
How interesting that people who believe the world is such a wonderful place are also those that feel so comfortable calling others miserable and toxic.

Enjoy your blissful ignorance, and just remember that just because you see good in the world doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to raise humans that see it the same way as you do.

At the end of the day, every single antinatalist was born from someone like you that thought it was right to breed them.

The only way to not breed an antinatalist, or in your words, someone ‚Äúmiserable and toxic‚Äù like me, is to not breed at all. Even if your children will not be antinatalists, their own children or grandchildren might be.
Moral concepts doesn‚Äôt apply to animals, they are driven solely by instinct‚Ä¶.As human we have a consciousness that gives us a tremendous ability to self reflect and transcend at least some of our instincts‚Ä¶but if you want to compare your moral compass with a plant sprout, be my guest‚Ä¶
Are you comparing people to animals??
I absolutely love that this is the way you feel about life, I really do. And as someone that wants to prevent as much suffering as possible, I want you to keep living the way you are and experiencing as much happiness as you possibly can.

But you have to remember that every single antinatalist (or person that hates life) comes from being bred by someone that either thinks like you or someone that had an ancestor that thought like you.

Just because you see good in the world and believe that others have that same ability does not remove the fact that people don‚Äôt CHOOSE to be unhappy or to hate life.

The feeling of hatred towards life comes from all sorts of external factors that you cannot prevent or influence in any way, you have no control on what view of life your future generations will have.

If you love your non-existent child as much as you say you do, you will trust the experience of people that hate life and avoid risking creating another one of us.
Why?
There are higher chances that at least one person in your family tree after you die will end up being a bad person or creating suffering or suffering themselves.

Basically by just birthing 1 child you are creating thousands of human the the arc of a century, a lot of which will suffer, get cancer, die horribly, or be an antinatalist that hates life and resents you for starting it.

If you understand that you are a product of suffering you also understand that there is no way you can counter suffering by creating new life, because it will be completely out of your control what that life does.

You might also die before you even have the time to instruct that life on what to do, you might even birth someone with a disability that won‚Äôt be able to do good, all you know for a fact is that your child is going to contribute to the toxic waste we produce on Earth, eat animals that get slaughter by machines, increase pollution and fear death their entire lives.

There is no solution to solving suffering that involves creating life, the only way to 100% prevent all suffering is to use the acquired knowledge we gained from evolution to understand that the only way for us to end this cycle of death is to avoid breeding.
How is it selfish?
But a true one
Most of antinatalist‚Äôs parents had the same job and goal, and still failed.

It‚Äôs not about parenting style, one‚Äôs view on the world is shaped by outside perspectives, inner growth and personal life choices.

You just can‚Äôt control that. The safest option is to not have that child so that you don‚Äôt risk having someone that hates life.
They had to go through great suffering and pain just to get out of a ‚Äúgift‚Äù they did not want nor consented to.

If your favorite thing in the world is eating shit, and you force feed shit to me every day, that does not mean that I am throwing away a gift, it just means that I never wanted it and was forced to deal with it until I was old enough and mentally strong enough to make the decision to pick up and leave.
Yeah, y'all do that all the time "my echo chamber! Oh no!"
Oh dang. Yeah, see that's wild, I think self expression should be unlimited.
It would be. However, all that stuff isnt going away any time soon. Also, were you in the army?
Tldr
bla bla bla word salad bullshit dressing fact free pontification. Have a good one I don't care.
im "okay" with living in a hellscape when im old if thats what it ends up being. am i looking forward to it? no. will i be happy? fuck no! do i wish there was a better way? yes. but the thought of quadrillions of sentient life being spared from the meat grinder will greatly outweigh my in comparison miniscule suffering
Not true! If we held ALL the cards, we could solve world hunger very easily! Capitalism wastes upwards of 60% of ALL resources, including food and water. We live in artificial scarcity! We could feed everyone!
You will die regardless of whether young people surround you. Until then, you will have to serve yourself, cooperate with other people, adapt, exploit animals, invent and use robots, maybe. And then you die no matter what.
Lol sure whatever you say.
Pointing out misery and toxicity is not inherently toxic. Kinda like not tolerating intolerance does not make one inherently "intolerant".

But I can see you are at best incredibly naive and this conversation is going nowhere.

Continue to live in your fantasy where you "at least aren't adding to the suffering in the world". No, you can pat yourself on the back for "thinking about the bigger picture" without having to actually *do* anything.

Maybe one day though you will grow some of this will resonate with you and you will try to focus more on how you can make the world better instead of just trying to convince everyone that life sucks, people suck, everything sucks and we should just try to end humanity by "convincing everyone not to breed anymore" - which, btw, has to be about the dumbest plan I've ever heard of for ending humanity; practically speaking. Like the fact that this idea is even entertained as attainable illustrates that you can't be taken seriously; legitimately the worst plan I have ever heard to bring society to an end: convince people not to breed. I know I keep going on about this, but, truly, I'm dumbfounded as to what kind of fantasy you live in where you believe this is remotely attainable?
And how do you think humans survived long enough to evolve that rationality?

It was all on instinct until one day births could *only* be for selfish reasons? 

The prospect is just absurd.
Expecting someone else to provide children to maintain the systems you benefit from. Shaming said people while benefiting from them. Saying it‚Äôs no big deal if society collapses cause you‚Äôll be dead anyways so who cares. Like come on dude, at least pretend to be self aware
It's actually not. The wait list in my country for adoptive parents is more than kids to adopt. 

Next you'll suggest parents should have spent thousands adopting kids from other countries. 

Being anti other people having kids? Unbelievable the internet surely is full of weirdos.
Safest route is me finding a WFH job and getting all my essentials delivered because driving is risky. Or I don‚Äôt go to a top 20 university because the local university is easier. Yeah technically you could live a life dedicated to safety, but in our current world, safety is not the priority. You have to take risk, and manage it properly.

Being born into privilege has made me realize the only proper course of action is to continue to build that privilege and transfer it to my children. Skills, knowledge, assets‚Ä¶ I already hoard gold and silver that I never plan to sell, but to hand to my kids as they grow up. My parents put me on their businesses to establish income and get my name on good assets, and I will be doing the same. 

Life is amazing when you don‚Äôt have to worry about bills, college, healthcare, etc. It gives them the opportunity to grow and become their own person with skills they can leverage for income when you leave them behind and pass on.

I'm not an ANer but I don't know why or what people expect to accomplish coming onto an ANer forum and whining/being annoyed about seeing ANer content. Imagine going to McDonald's and getting mad everyone is eating 'disgusting fast food.' if you're a health nut then eat up subway.
Imagine being shocked that people's experiences shape them and their views. Child abuse and neglect from narcissists is still extremely common. I don't see you talking much on the topic of it. Believe it or not but most on this page who arnt here to troll actually care about children more than the ones making them.
Chill out. Nobody's making you spend time in this thread
Not the ARMY, I worked EMS in a pretty big city. Mad respect to the army guys though, they see a very different brand of nasty every single day.
We will all die. But some will die as freeloaders. And that‚Äôs okay.
You keep speaking of my character without knowing absolutely nothing about me.

With all the thousands of dollars I save not having children, I do a lot of good for the world. Such as adopting.

But thank you for assuming otherwise.
Umm‚Ä¶morality starts with the ability to reason. 

How is it absurd? Early humans didn‚Äôt have the intellectual capacity to understand that procreation begets more suffering. Now we do. Many people feel it is immoral to beget more suffering‚Ä¶crazy idea, I know.
Okay, but can you tell us some selfless reasons to have kids?
The concept of antinatalism is nothing new, you can find traces of it as far as Greek philosophers, in verses of the bible (as surprising as this might sound), cathars in Europe‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not a far stretch to imagine that many humans held this opinion even much earlier than that‚Ä¶

‚ÄúIt was all on instinct until one day births could only be for selfish reasons?‚Äù

When it‚Äôs driven by instinct, the concept of selfishness is absurd‚Ä¶it‚Äôs only when we can see past the veil of instinct that the selfish nature behind the desire of procreation can be clearly revealed.

this is the last question I‚Äôm answering, you are trying to ‚Äúdrown the fish‚Äù with questions you know are pointless, instead of producing an effort in argumentation.
1. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to provide children to maintain this system, I hate this system and WANT it to collapse. I said my money and resources that I save from not having children will create jobs and opportunities to others, but if we reach a point where society is crumbling, I will be long gone before that by my own hand.
2. I never shamed anyone, having children is selfish objectively.
3. It is no bit deal if society collapses because our time on Earth is already limited by the lifespan of the sun, or even sooner when it will be destroyed by deoxygenation or gamma-ray burst.
There are still plenty of kids around the world that cannot afford LEGOs that you could‚Äôve provided for with the money and resources that you have spent on creating a brand new human being that did not exist before.
Just because you‚Äôre ok with risking a horrible car accident or risking psychological distress by picking a hard university does not mean that everyone thinks the same way as you.

It‚Äôs like saying you‚Äôre into BDSM because the pain feels nice and is worth it so you start tying up a bunch of people off the street and expect them to like getting spanked too, and you keep doing it until they like it, then call it a privilege.

Also just because you are all set up in life and don‚Äôt need to work or do absolutely nothing, doesn‚Äôt mean your children will not suffer. Statistically, those that are the most financially privileged are also the ones struggling the most with depression and mental health.

Also, you could be adopting or helping so many people that currently exist with all your money and resources but instead you choose to raise a sperm into a brand new human just to give all of it to them instead.

It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre a firefighter in front of a burning house and instead of putting it out you decide to start another fire nearby and put that one out instead.
No, because unfortunately checking out of life will make everyone that has ever known me sad. It will cause incredible pain to all the people around me. It creates a sense of guilt that I cannot shake. Also, there is no legal and easy way to go out without feeling pain. Also, I might risk being reincarnated into something much worse.

In other words, not birthing creates 0 suffering.

While birthing someone that didn‚Äôt want to exist, like me and others in this sub, means that we now have to suffer or create suffering in order to leave.

Therefore, the best solution is to not birth anyone.
This comment is gold
What are they afraid of? That someone will present an idea that causes them to rethink their opinions?
If you're a health nut, you certainly wouldn't eat subway. Their breads are so high in sugar, they've been labelled as desserts in some places.

Also, public forum. Everyone is entitled to voice their opinion. Just like you. Just like me. Just like that guy.
I couldn't care less if they don't want children. It's the obvious projection that bothers me because that can lead to another form of abuse from the projectionist in the form of verbal and emotional abuse onto others because of their clouded views.
Your view seems very clear to me. Don't listen to the troll
You need to work on your projecting. It's only clouding your view
Rough. So after seeing all of that youd still be cool with bringing a new human into this world? Absurd.
It is not ok that you consider people who owe you nothing to be freeloaders. It is not okay that you think it is acceptable to force people who owe you nothing to solve your problems (this applies to both childless and children).  
Such a point of view is formed in people who are exploited by their parents and taught: you must do everything we command, and when you have your children, you will collect from them the debt that we took from you.
I‚Äôm not asking when people starting talking about anti Natalism, I‚Äôm asking when the switch from instinct to selfishness occurred. 

Because if it was only instinct and now it‚Äôs only selfishness, there has to be a line somewhere where the change happened. 

But the fact that you can‚Äôt show when, and that your ideology only allows for one reason for procreation at a time, it‚Äôs patently absurd and silly to anyone who hasn‚Äôt already drunk the cool aid here.
What a dangerous mindset to have. Good luck with that
What kind of trauma you must be carrying to land on this opinion. Wow, get therapy.
No the difference is those things like driving and academic challenges are GOOD, because they improve your life tangibly. And so it makes sense to take on that risk. That has nothing to do with BDSM.

And I don‚Äôt want you to have kids. I want to have them, and y‚Äôall being cut out means less competition for my own kids. :)

South Asians tend to be well off but we don‚Äôt all spoil our kids because we see what it does to them. We have a lot of safety nets but live well below our means. Financial security is not the same as consumerist materialism. 

And no I have no interest in helping random humans. Frankly, your karma is why you suffer, in this life or the past. Hinduism strongly believes in the importance of family, it is sacred to us. Blood matters. I‚Äôm not working to help the kids of others.

This subreddit is deeply hilarious to me because it‚Äôs just a bunch of adults whining about how hard life is and how it‚Äôs so unethical to create life. Shit has me rolling üòÇ

Well  to be honest
1) if you think you are able to change another person's opinion then you probably can't
2) I doubt they're afraid, more likely they're probably just annoyed, as you are.
3) they just don't search people out to annoy in this situation, they're on their forum doing their thing.
Then go ahead and name 1 non-selfish reason to have a kid.
1)I can proudly and confidently say that I am not well versed in the nutritional standards of subway. But I can definitely say with the same confidence that it is unequivocally more healthy than McDonald's by comparative value.

2) I didn't dispute his right to be or comment, I simply commented that I can't comprehend what would motivate a person(supposedly capable of higher level rationality and thought) to go into a place filled with people whom possess a proclivity for something that they don't enjoy; proceeding then to disparage another for their tastes. The same with which I would view another person(in this situation that's you)attempting make a point about another person's(that's me) comment, when in fact the subject matter of the original comment bared 0 relevance in any way shape or form to the comment rendered(presumably they should've read a little closer to ensure that what they thought occured, actually occurred.)
Let me know when you wanna try again.
Your entire personality is a projection of thoughts and experiences gathered over the course of your lifetime. That's how you form ideas, your brain weighs data to establish thought. There is 0 wrong with someone else doing the same. Wether it be for what to have for dinner, politics, or baby making.
What I'm hearing is you don't care about children's experiences
Your kids are 100% going to end up joining this sub someday.
Nah never said I'd be okay with bringing someone in to this world as is. BUT if we got we took the trash out and had some good old fashioned reform I'd probably be fine with it.
You gotta realise that you are just focusing on the bad stuff... 

Just coz bad stuff exists doesn't mean nothing is good.
You don‚Äôt have to get defensive, I wasn‚Äôt attacking you. You‚Äôre well within your right to make your own choices. 

I‚Äôm just expressing my opinion that not everyone will have contributed equally to the future world we might find ourselves in. And some people here will fight against the creation of a new generation, yet will be more than happy to eat the food they produce in 2065.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking when people starting talking about anti Natalism, I‚Äôm asking when the switch from instinct to selfishness occurred.‚Äù

Are you serious ? This was my answer precisely because it is 100% related. When people started talking about antinatalism, it meant they started to self reflect‚Ä¶and question the nature and the reason behind desires that once were purely driven by instinct.

Keep labelling ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù concepts you don‚Äôt really understand if you like, it doesn‚Äôt really matter, just as me not procreating doesn‚Äôt matter much in the grand scheme of things‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs perfectly fine.
How is it dangerous?
Actually I am and have been for years, so that still doesn‚Äôt change my opinion lol
They improve a life that didn‚Äôt need to be improved if it wasn‚Äôt alive.

You‚Äôre basically saying that you like being spanked because it makes you feel good, but if you weren‚Äôt forced into being alive then you also wouldn‚Äôt be forced to seek pain, suffering and challenges in order to improve a life you never chose to live.

Also I really don‚Äôt care for your religious beliefs-
I love life?
Okay, read your initial long winded reply, but with this, you just come off as pretentious. 

Made a simple statement, then you ran with it and went overboard. It wasn't that deep.
I don't project *my* experiences onto others because that isn't healthy. 

Stay sick if you want. I'm just pointing it out.
You need your hearing checked then.
Maybe but not because of my projections.
Yeah that would be the goal. Sadly Ive seen enough that I just dont think its possible.
So people weren‚Äôt rational and only acted on instinct until they started talking about anti natalism?

See this is why y‚Äôall are the best source for comedy on Reddit.
Do I really need to explain why apathy in that context is a dangerous mindset?
Good luck with it, keep going. I hope you get through it become mentally well and get to experience a positive family environment at least once in your life.
[removed]
You are welcome to interpret me as pretentious should you choose to. However, I ask that you not put words in my mouth, nor make the make the implications that through linguistic subterfuge, my words possess a deeper meaning than their assigned value. Because that would be asinine, given that chose them carefully to illustrate exactly and only the meaning by which they where designed.
if you went to a restaurant with your friends/fam and you all got sick and then i suggested that i wanted to go to said restaurant too, would you use your experience to discourage or suggest that going there might not be a good idea?
1)You want to reread my comment. I don't think you comprehend what I wrote correctly. 
2) I'm actually pretty healthy but thanks. Company paid healthcare is sweet.
The one common denominator I've seen in the messed up situations I've seen is man. In a sense. Usually through ignorance or complacency. But there are some real monsters who I've met that shouldn't be allowed to live with mankind. I can't go into too much detail, I've had comments removed for doing so before, but If you truly believe the world is unsalvageable I would argue it's only because we brought to that point. 

Example: If total atomic annihilation occurred tomorrow, it's likely that in 200-500 years you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference. The Earth recovers fast when nobody's actively destroying it. And it's a beautiful place wrought with our garbage and mankind's 'ideas'
No‚Ä¶until they started to have enough time to self reflect, probably in the Neolithic when they started to settle instead of being hunter gatherers, giving them more free time for abstract concepts‚Ä¶traces of antiNatalism throughout history is merely an example, and is just a way of observing this transition objectively on this specific subject.

you keep asking questions, but everyone is still waiting for your answer, what are the non selfish reasons of having children ? See, this stiring around the pot and asking questions instead of replying to one simple question, is the main source of comedy you are offering to everyone today.

That‚Äòs the problem with arguing with random people, you are never sure of their level of education and ability to grasp even trivial concepts and reasonings‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs just part of the game I guess.
It‚Äôs not apathy, it‚Äôs statistical evidence.
Legally, two people make a family. So I already experience that as well. Nice try tho
Honestly this level of naivety is what I expect from a breeder. If this is what you need to tell yourself to live a peaceful life, then keep it up.
This breaks my heart. Consequences of a pronatalist society.
As someone who was an unwanted kid, my mom always did the best she could to give me a great childhood and make me feel loved, despite her limited resources. This didn‚Äôt always work but I don‚Äôt blame her. She didn‚Äôt tell me back then, but I always kinda knew, deep down. I wonder who she could‚Äôve been.
my mom told me ‚Äúi wish you were never born and i didn‚Äôt want you‚Äù during a fight once when i was a teenager and i‚Äôve never forgotten that.
[deleted]
Those kids comments are heartbreaking. Hopefully they will at least think more about becoming a parent than their parents did...

I feel like religious indoctrination was much stronger back then as well. People were told to be fruitful and multiply and abortion meant going to hell.

Nowadays people are wising up and not subscribing to that type of thinking. There's still plenty of crazy evangelical Christians out there and family pressure, but I would say more people are thinking for themselves and making their own choices now than ever before.

Hearing your parent tell you that you're a mistake or feeling like your existence is a burden puts such a mental psychological toll on the child.

I remember feeling like a burden myself growing up. Like I felt sorry for simply existing. It's crazy when you think about it. Those feelings are hard to shake too which makes it even crazier.

All we can do is learn from our own and others mistakes and not repeat them.
This is also the consequence of gender stereotyping , that is women having more pressure to have children an  are expected to give everything up to care for them.
Men do not face such expectations to that extent.
my parents definitely would've been better off without having had kids, and I am personally bitter about being burdened with being stuck in a life I didn't want nor enjoy and now it's on me to find the courage and off myself one day. Because I sure as hell don't wanna grow just older and more miserable and someday die without having control over it and the pain/suffering. 

I wish not having children was celebrated, abortions even more accepted and accessible.

And prolly most unpopularly I wish we'd offer humane, stress- & painfree euthanization for people who'd opt to not live. Ending life doesn't have to be depressing if it would be done in the right setting. What's depressing is having people stuck here without their consent by deliberately denying them a nice way to go, so the only option is something that's traumatizing for everyone involved, or suffer on.
This is incredibly sad because it seems like the society that the women (and men for that matter) grew up in has made parenthood an inevitable matter. It's a matter of when they become parents instead of if. 

The choice of parenthood was not made clear, whether by intention or not. The worst part, is when parents learn this choice AFTER the child is born and blame the child.

I don‚Äôt feel sorry for my parents or give a shit about who they were before I was born. They chose this life together. 

I shouldn‚Äôt have to cry because ‚ÄúI ruined my parents life‚Äù when THEY chose to have me
[deleted]
My dad always said that having kids broke my mom. 

She was adventurous and wild before us. Mountain biking, rock climbing, spontaneous trips, etc...

Wasn't until I was around 18 I realized that no, having kids didn't break my mom. Essentially being a single mother while working 48hrs a week as a nurse and being the primary breadwinner while he struggled with his small business broke my mother. 

If he'd swallowed his pride and gone to work a regular job, or just learned to cook instead of expecting her to come off a 12 hr shift and feed us, she probably could've kept some adventure.
WTAF?!?  This is the most heartbreaking series of posts I‚Äôve read. I have a daughter who is the light of my life but I‚Äôve also had a full life outside of my daughter.  

This has me tearing up
Fuck people who make their kids feel like that
[deleted]
I always figured the "I can't wait until you have kids so you understand how awful this is" thing was ubiquitous.  I'm almost certain my mom didn't think I'd understand at the time, but I did.

And I'm the fourth of 6.
I‚Äôm 32. I sent my mom a ‚ÄúI wish you had never met dad‚Äù text last week. Shits brutal
It's so sad how a lot of these commenters have internalized that it's their fault. It's not their fault, not at all.
Sounds like men chaining women to motherhood is the real problem. If these men just didn't prioritize their selfish need for a "legacy and just let the women they supposedly love pursue their actual dreams, everyone would he better of.
All these fucking men in the comments trying to derail are sending me. If you genuinely think being forced to give up on your future and chance of independence to clean toddler shit for the rest of your life is on par with *having to have a job* to provide for the kid *you* wanted, you are beyond help. Your brain would probably explode of you found out women usually have to have job *on top of( maintaining employment.
How can this person seriously be blaming themselves for the fact that their mother chose to burden herself with the obligation of motherhood? Even if it was rape and the mother couldn't get abortion, I still can't understand how someone can hold themselves morally responsible for the unfortunate fact that they were born.
What is sad - kids feeling guilty for ruining someone's life but not the other logical way. The parents ruined their kids life by wanting one and it was their selfish decision.

What gets me furious - those parents that **openly** say to their kid that they were a mistake and what a burden they are to them.
These parents are a real POS, behaving very immature in their "reasoning": they blame children for their selfish choice; they want kids to be thankful for everything, even tho kids didn't choose this life and they are obligated to give some life standard to those kids without any " thank you".
My mom has never told me she didn't like me, but she has told me I am the reason she didn't leave my dad. They were married for 39 years (and he had brain cancer the last 2. It was a real experience for all of us). He was awful to her. He wasn't physically violent,  but he was verbally, psychologically, and financially abusive (he became physical when he got sick at the end). She didn't make much as a teacher, and leaving him meant we'd live in poverty and I wouldn't have a college savings. She was well aware he'd never pay any support.

On dad's side of it. Being the time (1970s), he couldn't advance in his career without a wife and at least 1 child. He got both. Mom says there was no intimacy in the relationship after she had me. And she is 99% sure he was having an affair with a male coworker. Basically, we think he was gay and resented having a wife and kid he didn't actually want and resented having to support us.
I suppose abortion was available for most of their mothers, also adoption. I think it's insanely cruel of the mothers to decide to have children and blame them for destroying their lives. 


It's insane their children live with this guilt, because their mothers decided to have them, and didn't liked how their life became. Terrible women.
I feel this. I have friends who have told me they hate their kids and it‚Äôs so hard looking at their kids and knowing deep down their parents hate them
My mom said she thought having kids would make her happy, but it didn‚Äôt. She made me feel guilty for such a long time, but I refuse to be blamed for it anymore - *I‚Äôm* not the one who had kids, actively hated motherhood, then said a decade later ‚Äúhey, let‚Äôs get the vasectomy reversed. Having *more* kids will definitely make me happy *this* time!‚Äù That‚Äôs her own damn fault.
I have no sympathy for my parents. They were old enough to make their own decisions. They knew each other for only two weeks before getting married.

They ruined their own lives, I didn't have to do anything. I'm the second son. The second child, enough time elapsed for them to know better.

I'm simply trying to survive. To play the hands I was dealt.
you can see how bad the manipulation is when the kids still care more about their mothers than themselves, regardless of how they were treated.
I didn‚Äôt ruin my parents life. THEY ruined me by having me at all. They had a choice. I did not. I would 100% unmake me.
It's very sad that there are individuals who feel responsible for the choices of their parents. We were born without our consent through the choices of our parents. Our lives and our choices are our only burdens to bear, not the choices of our parents.
The NASA one was the worst for me. Giving up a chance to actually change something in the world, and becoming just another link in the breeding chain.
God I felt this. My mom loves her kids and she showed it and still does, but I wish she could have had a life without my dad and being bogged down with kids. My dad thinks women are put here to be servants to men, does not support education unless it‚Äôs something that helps him (like secretarial bs or filling out forms for his healthcare, you know, shit adults should be doing for themselves). She stayed 25 years and was in effect a single mom. I was lucky to get divorced mom because she was way happier. We went to college at the same time and she finally got a degree in healthcare that she wanted. I‚Äôm extremely proud of her.
Too much of this sounds familiar. My parents divorced when I was six. It was nasty. Dad was a drunk. Mom became a single mother of two kids. She never actually said she regretted she had us. But it was often implied throughout the years, that her life would have been better without having gotten married and having kids.
To throw their luce away was only their choice. They have no right to take it out on their children.
My mother had had three children. Married and pregnant by 18. Once her kids were grown she divorced her husband and was getting her life back at age 40. My age now. 

Then she met my narcissistic/abusive father. She was pregnant with twins within a year. 

I like my life for the most part, but I too would go back in time and warn my mother and stop her from meeting my dad. Tell her to get vaccinated and that modern medicine isn‚Äôt all bad. She might still be alive today.
These are awful AWFUL things to say to your children. These people should not be idealised. You wouldn‚Äôt stay these things to people you don‚Äôt even like.
I don‚Äôt think I was unwanted, but I know my mom was extremely depressed while raising me and my sister. I don‚Äôt really remember ever seeing her happy. Just tired, and sometimes sad. I *never* want children; I don‚Äôt know how she did it.
My parents were fucking wonderful and I don‚Äôt want kids. I hate when people tell me it‚Äôs selfish‚Ä¶ but why would a kid want to feel unwanted? Sure I wouldn‚Äôt ever tell a kid they ruined my life, but they would see overtime the issues caused by my actions and turning my life upside down.
These comments are awful btw. It‚Äôs not the kids‚Äô fault.
I notice it's mostly girls that mothers reveal this to? Rarely hear a bitter mom expressing this to her son(s), why this pattern?
It‚Äôs sad to see kids blaming themselves for the decisions their parents made. No child should feel this way. Kids don‚Äôt inherently ruin lives, and people should be more careful with who and how they have intercourse if they don‚Äôt want kids.
My mum used to tell me she would always love, but sometimes she didn't like me. I mean, I've barely spoken to her in the last 11 years, so I doubt she loves me either.
Your parents didn't have to have you. But they did. 

You as their child, did not ruin anything because they didnt keep their legs closed. 

I'm sick of kids, no matter how old they are, feeling sorry for their POS parents because after they had kids they turned into shitty people with anger issues. 

You didn't ask to be born.
My mother ruined her own life, I was just a happy byproduct of that. She had access to abortion as well, so she‚Äôs really the only one to blame
How can anyone say that to children? I have empathy for the mothers in the situation, but my heart breaks for the children.
Who are these parents telling their children this shit. That is an awful thing to lay on a child. Fuck these parents.
My mom handled this differently. She always made me feel loved, but when I was 10 she packed up my stuff, dropped me at my dad‚Äôs and moved 1200 miles away to Alaska. Didn‚Äôt see her for years
I don‚Äôt feel bad for my mom. At all. I hate her. She didn‚Äôt have to marry my dad and keep me. Her older sister, who was married to a successful doctor and they had two sons, offered to adopt me. But, no. She kept me and hated me and made my life miserable like it was my fault or something. My kids and I have no contact with her.
These are so sad because for most of these comments the children are taking responsibility for their parent's choices. My mom chose to have 4 children but only ever made me feel like a burden because I was the oldest and she had me when she was 19 and she waited 5 years to have my next brother. I don't care if she was "cool" before she started having kids she chose to reproduce. If a child is born that "ruins a mother's life" the child didn't ruin it the mother ruined her own life. There are extraneous circumstances obviously that happen outside of a woman's control that I'm not referring to at all.
These are the consequences of parents who use their children to evade accountability. It is not their children's fault. They didn't choose to exist and didn't have the sex that "ruined" their career prospects. Not that I think it has. It is bit of silly narrative.
THIS is the reason I‚Äôm on this sub. Not some of the circle jerk content we‚Äôve been seeing lately, but this.
I understand that some of these women didn‚Äôt have a choice but if they did, it was irresponsible for all of them to have children
My life would have been amazing if my parents hadn‚Äôt been quiverfull and stopped at just a few kids instead of a kid farm. There‚Äôs maybe two that are their favorites and got all the resources, life education and support, the rest of us were free child labor that got the shaft. Never believe the propaganda about big families. People who do that are all egomaniacs.
My mother flat out told me every chance she got that she almost got an abortion because no one wanted me in the family, that she even prayed for a miscarriage. My mother started having kids at 16, and I am the second youngest of 4.

To say that she hated us would be an understatement. 

If we had to wait in the car while my dad ran to get something, she'd pull out this large, thick safety pin, telling us that if we made a single noise, (sniffling, coughing, sneezing, breathing too loud), that we'd be sorry. Within five minutes, I got stabbed twice, my brother once, my older sister once. 
The second stab was just before my dad got into the car. I didn't know what I did wrong. 

She left me locked in a hot room in the middle of summer when I had a bad cold, sweating and in pain with 103¬∞ fever. My dad was the one who unlocked the door and saved me. She made some half- heated excuse about me misbehaving and not having enough medicine. 

She neglected me so badly during a serious illness that she was forced to take me to a hospital. The doctor confirmed I had whooping cough. I remember him looking at my mother with confusion, saying, "This is pretty preventable. I haven't seen a case in a while. You've vaccinated them, right?"

She got quiet, then her and the doctor went out in the hall for a while. When my mom came back, she looked angry. Apparently, the antibiotics I'd need were expensive, I got her in trouble with the doctor, and she'd have to monitor me, which to her was "a waste of time."

It escalated as the years went on. Frighteningly so in my early teen years. (13-15).
She would "accidentally" leave me somewhere or forget where I was.
She "sincerely" thought that I would be happier with stranger X, Y, or Z that she happened to have met recently. 
She'd let me get sick to critical levels any chance she got. 
She waited until my father wasn't home to shove me out into the snow for hours in only my pajamas. I would hear her crack the front door open every now and again, watching me carefully. 

I have never in my life been so obsessively hated to the point of suspiciously murderous levels. According to my older sister, it was terrifying how close she came to ending my life by "accident." 

Safe to say I went full no-contact as an adult. 

I don't understand how someone who hated children so much would continue having children at all. But she did have this... creepy smile? I can't describe it properly. 
Think, like, those descriptions in books where someone is giving a 'mad smile of delight.'' That's the look she'd get when she hurt us enough to make us bleed. 

My father was abusive as well, but even he became afraid of my mother when he saw the aftermath of her beatings. She got so bad that my dad ceased his abuse altogether and even took us to work with him when he knew my mom would be alone with us. 

I never questioned why he didn't marry her. Even the devil knows not to compete with the monsters existing in the shadows. The devil waits for victims. My mother finds them and makes them. 
I don't know where she is today, but murmurings through the grapevine have revealed that one of my siblings just gave birth to a baby boy... and that my mother was on her way to see him, offering to watch him when my sibling went back to work in the future.
I don't believe in gods or the effectiveness of prayers. But hearing that news makes me wish I did, if only for the small hope of a miracle to save that child's life.
My father told me after I had my vasectomy that if he could go back in time he would've done the same.. I didnt take it in a bad way.. I know what he meant.. having kids is always a burden even if you love your kid and they are good kids
I recently had a really good,  honest chat with my Mom. I went no contact with my Dad and was talking to her about my childhood, and how he affected me and my life.

She said she was sorry for staying with him, she feels so bad about everything that happened. I told her I wished she had an abortion instead of marrying my Dad when she got pregnant with me. He was an angry, drunk who was out drinking and cheating on my mom while she was at home taking care of young children. She went through so much and she tried so hard to make sure we had a happy childhood. 

My mom loves us more than anything in the world and she is the strongest & kindest woman I know. I love her so much, I wish she could have lived the life she wanted in her 20s/30s instead of being stuck with my Dad. She deserved so much better & so did we. 
 
I wish more people would talk about this kind of thing. I am so glad I had that conversation with my mom, even though it was hard.
I'm sure my mom loves me. She loves kids and is amazing at taking care of young children (it's her job)

Thing is, she is a bit less good at taking care of older children... Especially if they turn out to have autism (and maybe also ADHD but we're not sure about that one)

The screaming and yelling I had to endure, the pain my mother felt because she couldn't get through to me. The bullying I tried to hide from her because I was sure she'd only want to talk to my mentor at school and that'd make it worse, even though I didn't know how it could get worse... The hopeless feeling we both had to endure during those 6 years I was in high school...

Multiple times I've felt as the unwanted child even though I know my mom always wanted Children. I'm just not so sure she wanted a child like me.

My mom loves me, I'm just not sure if we'd even like eachother if not for that family bond. I'm not sure she loves me as more then just her daughter.

She'd do everything for me. I'm just not sure if she'd have the choice to not have had me in the beginning if she'd have picked that. Or maybe only my sister? Or other kids?

We both have our mental problems, me and my sister. It was a difficult time for both my parents, but especially my mother, when they had us go though puberty.

Sometimes I wish I was never born just so my mom would have an easier life. So I wouldn't have made her so sick during pregnancy and the months after. So she wouldn't have ended up in the hospital multiple times with nutrition problems related to pregnancy. She wouldn't have to suffer....
My mom has been visiting this past week. She got on the plane last night and I almost cried in relief.  

She‚Äôs so angry and bitter about life. Never directly saying it‚Äôs cause of how her life turned out (and by all accounts I wouldn‚Äôt even say her life is BAD per se, just not HER own life) by having three kids etc 

She dumps her miseries on me, but I cannot talk about my childhood issues/adult realizations because it‚Äôs too much for her. 

She‚Äôs a social worker. But I know if she could go back, she would and she would walk right past my father. 

I feel guilty for being alive. But I also hate her for continuing my misery when it wasn‚Äôt my fault.
Same but with my dad. I love the man and the wasted potential of who he could've been breaks my heart. (He stayed and took care of me when mom fucked off when I was 2yo...)
While I empathize with women who had their choices taken from them in eras bygone, most women just breed for their own selfish reasons and later give their spawn hell for being more inconvenient than they expected. My baby-crazy abusive mother wanted 4 (only had me) because she wanted live dolls to dress up in little dresses when they were toddlers. After I got too old, she was extremely abusive and sexually harassed me for 13 years. She cursed her womb for giving her me. I feel for her because she was beautiful and free before ruining her life with marriage and pregnancy. 

And it‚Äôs not just her. The mothers of my current BF and my exes do nothing but complain about the sons they had and how much trouble they caused. And they blamed them for ruining their lives and careers.
This is so fucking bleak üòû
The "legacy" is generational trauma.
My mom admitted she only wanted one kid. My older brother. She also said, she hoped I would be a boy. If she HAD to have a second child, it better be a boy. Surprise, not a boy. I‚Äôm like a double disappointment lol. I believe she didn‚Äôt abort me because her mom is anti abortion. One day while my parents were separating, I called her out for treating me different than my brother. She admitted it. Since then, she has always denied ever saying that. I won‚Äôt ever forget that though. 

My dad told me before that she stopped smoking my older brother‚Äôs entire pregnancy. He also told me she smoked cigarettes her entire pregnancy with me. She again admitted she did this, but says it was fine and didn‚Äôt harm me anyway. The labels on the cigarettes apparently mean nothing to her when it comes to me, but she cares when it comes to the first born. Genuinely think she hoped something would ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù happen to me so she didn‚Äôt have to deal. I was born six weeks early, was small, but that‚Äôs it. Guess I was lucky. 

It‚Äôs such a weird feeling to know you were never wanted and have always been just an obligation/burden.
I was a mistake. My mom went around telling our family I was ‚Äúa little surprise from god‚Äù. She took me to her anti abortion protests. I was one of those kids with the ‚Äúmy mommy chose life‚Äù sandwich boards.
Nah fuck that. Nobody here chose to be born and if a parent says that shit to their kid that they chose to have then that is fuckin on them. Weird apologist shit for shitty people.
I ruined my mothers life she met my dad at 18 and she was abusive growing up. We‚Äôve sort of reconciled but she‚Äôs confined in me that she felt like the next step to life was having children and that she should have never been a mother and that she failed me. It‚Äôs horribly depressing. I would honestly love to have children but this world is too bitter and I‚Äôll always be too poor to provide.
idk i dont feel bad for my mother, its her fault that she birthed me, not mine lol
My mum had me on accident but she loved me and was happy with me because I was the only non abusive person in her life, even as a baby she said dealing with me was easier than dealing with her abusers. 

Jokes on her, she ended up neglecting me and so others traumatised me to the point I wish I was never born. I must forgive her though, she had no choice but to have me. Protection failed and abortion isn't a thing in my country. 

Not all people are miserable as parents, I think that's important to acknowledge. There is too much pressure to have kids and it's absolutely awful how many unwanted children there are. I have a few dad friends who love their babies and are happy as heck. One of them went to a big party this weekend. My professor is also a mother to an autistic child but she is the epitome of success in my view. I don't think having kids is moral, but she's certainly an amazing mother, teacher and researcher. She's the one who gives me most hope in my life, honestly.

I think in an AN view, even if you love being a parent, creating a new life is a gamble on a non consenting persons life. Tis why I'm choosing to adopt, even though I'm not AN at all. I do think AN makes valid points. Adopted kids will be hard, but I think helping an older child who might need help will be worth it.
I ruined my mom's life and she, mine. I wish she never had me and she could've had a happy ending.
My mom loves me but a lot of the time she doesn‚Äôt like me. I do have my own issues but the last 3 or 4 trips they all go on without me and only take my younger siblings. It does hurt.
Well luckily nowadays you have a choice.
Me being born broke up 2 families and 2 years ago my mum drank herself to death. My mum wanted a child. But I can't help but think I made her unhappy. Because her life was a struggle because if my existence. I was a product of an affair. I ruined a marriage and also destroyed another. My great grandma offered to pay for an abortion for my mother as I was a shameful thing. My mum obviously never took the offer. But if she had, she would have been happier.
My mom told me she wanted an abortion with me and a friend talked her out of it. She loved my brothers, who turned out to be half brothers. I was my dad's only child. She also raised me to believe my dad was bad. Took me years to understand
Thinking about my dad and mum before they had me‚Ä¶ they had dreams and they went through similar struggles I have. So sad
Why am I being attacked so early in the morning? /Jk. Knowing that my mother resented me from a young age has caused unrepairable trauma.
My mom would've been better off without me. She never said that or made me feel that way, but I know it. I cost her so much in medical bills. She had to work the shittiest jobs just to afford to live. Plus she missed seeing the rolling stones. I know, minor but that just represents how much life my mom missed out on. Now she has dimentia and lung cancer. She never got to be a person. She had her first kid at 19.
This makes me feel so bad. Because I don't think like that at all. I'm unwanted and the wrong gender, it isn't my fault she didn't abort me.
I was unwanted but I was also my mom's second kid and I don't have contact with her much but my dad says I made his life better albeit different
My mother got post partum depression with me. Even with therapy and meds, she‚Äôs never gotten better. It‚Äôs wild to me to see old videos of her laughing and being charismatic and the life of the party. I only know the solitary and ready-to-lash-out version of her. She hasn‚Äôt had a single friend since my birth, not that I can blame her old friends for leaving because she‚Äôs such a difficult person now. I just feel so sorry for her. She could have led an amazing life, and instead her life was over at 38. She can‚Äôt relate to people anymore, and doesn‚Äôt want to. She‚Äôs just holed up at home and will be until she dies.
My mom made her life infinitely more difficult when she had me lol. But from her i learned that being childfree was the ONLY path forward for my life. She would scream at me, hit me, go insane regularly, have nervous breakdowns. My life is depressing and stressful enough, I can‚Äôt imagine what perils id face having a kid.
Jesus Christ, I‚Äôm glad my mother always told me she was proud of me even when she had no reason to be.
Sounds like a little less of kids being a burden and more of men being entirely useless life destroyers üòü
i was a wanted baby, but i have caused my mom so much stress and heartbreak since the day i was born. i‚Äôve never seen the way i feel expressed in words before. i know she loves me, she is an amazing mom. but i hope somewhere in another universe she is living the life she deserves. her identity has been her kids for 30 years. she‚Äôs just now at 49 finding out what she does and doesn‚Äôt like/doing things for herself. i hope in another universe she is my very best friend
My mom used to tell me all the time we would leave my dad. Even had the car packed. They still are married and live together.
Thankfully my mother won't say things like in the post, but I trapped her w/my dad, and we ruined her. She's said she was in the best shape of her life before him. I know I made her feel she couldn't go, and also she wanted a loving family she didn't have. She just said she likely had PPD and didn't engage w/me when young besides caretaking, and that's why I've always been so quiet and also not felt like part of the family. She had no emotional support from my uncaring yet domineering bully of a dad, and her in-laws nearby disliked her. They'd babysit me. That could be an element, though I blame my dad's bullying and brainwashing more.

I am sad for her fate, as well as mine, and it's one big reason I won't have kids.
Brutal.
I‚Äôm gutted because my mom said these things to me. She died when I was 11. Fucking damn.
Wish I could go back and fight my old man
"She loves me but she doesn't like me"

I felt this so much, being the complete opposite of my mother has its issues.

In other universe, I wish she got to complete her education and not get ruined by my dad's family. I wish she learned to accept that therapy is good. I wish she got rid of her internalised misogyny. I wish she was happy
This is so sad that these people blame themselves for their parents choices. It just shows how shitty and how little accountability their parents took for their own actions. This saddens me deeply
Damn. You all wanna blame yourselves but the reality is your parents were just shitty people who likely didnt do anything to better their mental health. And they were likely just as shitty before they had you no matter how they say otherwise.
My mum was going to be a fashion designer. She was going to attend university and be a success story. Instead she had me, got stuck working at Walmart for their family benefits, and broke her back while working there leaving her permenantly disabled. My existence had led her only to agony and cope and there isn't anything I can do but try to ease some of the suffering my ripple effect caused.
People should just stop settling and do things to make them happy. You have no one to impress but yourself. If your family hates you because you‚Äôre not having a kid, fuck em. I‚Äôve seen so many family members have kids that should have NEVER had them. You don‚Äôt need a kid or a shitty partner to have a happy life.
What's sad is people think they shouldn't exist for someone else's benefit, rather than that they deserved better parents.
"I hope you have kids just like yourself one day so you know just what a little asshole you are!"
Nah fuck that shit. This girl shouldn‚Äôt be carrying the weight of thinking she ruined someone‚Äôs life.
my parents love me; but im not a physically healthy person. they dont show it but i constantly feel like an adult burden. my dad doesnt anymore; but when i was a child he would constantly  joke about how he never wanted kids. he had me, then my mom pressured him into giving me a sibling. he now has two kids he barely wanted in the first place. now my parents are pressuring to kick me out, but i could barely hold down a full time job; especially in this economy. every time they say something about getting me out; i cant help but wonder why they even had kids in the first place? if they wanted an "empty nest" so bad, why even *bother* with kids.
You didn't ruin her. She decided to have you. Most likely planned it. And decided to make you her entire identity which was psychologically damaging for you.
I only just started thinking about this with my partner, but I wonder what life would've been like if I hadn't been born into *this* particular family. My mom has a lot of health issues (ankylosing spondylitis, disc degeneration, fibromyalgia, EDS, a good few other things) and I have developed some of those chronic illnesses as well and have started feeling the pain. I also have bipolar disorder, ADHD and autism. So on top of the physical pain I'm feeling all the time now, I also have all these mental health issues running rampant. I just feel like maybe my mom shouldn't have had kids because of the fact that she has so many things happening in her medical history and now I'm being punished with it.
Oh dang... The comments.



I was also 11 when my Mum dropped me off at school and in response to me hopping out of the car and saying, "bye, I love you!", she paused and said, "I love you, but I don't like you." And then she reached over to close the door and drove off.



My parents also regularly "forgot" or delayed picking me up until 5-6 pm. So I would just be sitting outside my school in all kinds of weather... And I just figured it was because no one liked me, I'm very forgettable. I struggled with that well into adulthood.
I wanna hug all of them
Gosh, this is heartbreaking.
I‚Äôm pretty neutral on natalism myself personally, but holy FUCK this hit close to home.

At the age of 10 when my alcoholic (not to mention narcissisitic) mother was in another drunken bender, she admitted she regretted having ALL of us, and we‚Äôre talking 4 kids over the course of 10 years. To this day she still shit talks each of us individually behind our backs even when sober. The only difference is, and even my grandmother, her own mom noticed it too, was she brought all it on herself. She chose to have every single one of us and would brag about it even, never helped herself with anything. Always blamed shit on whoever, whenever and to this day throws hissy fits whenever she knows she‚Äôs in the wrong. I presume that when she started realizing that none of us turned out the way she wanted, this was when she turned on us. My father genuinely cares about me and my siblings, he‚Äôs just severely mentally ill (admitted he‚Äôs very likely autistic, and I can almost guarantee he has bipolar because his own mother had it, and I have it myself alongside the ‚Äòtism) and I think my mother took advantage of that, because a lot of times he goes with what my mother says. I mean, the sole purpose of why I‚Äôm even here was she simply wanted a mini-me. That‚Äôs it. The fact that my mother‚Äôs own mother was disappointed in her parenting, and was the one to break the news to me, just goes to show what kind of person she really is. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

For the longest time I wished I was never born, parroting shit my mother would say. Constantly blamed it on myself. But after finally getting diagnosed with my mental health conditions and going to therapy, nowadays I‚Äôm honestly glad I‚Äôm here. I wouldn‚Äôt have met the friends I have now, and I wouldn‚Äôt have met my amazing partner who saved my life from homelessness and helps me through my traumas. Plus, existing is also kind of my very own way of saying ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to a parent who straight up wished I was dead.

If I do go down the route of kiddos, adoption/fostering is my VERY first priority. But that‚Äôs after I go back to school and into the workforce again (pandemic put a dent in my education, plus my bipolar treatments as mine‚Äôs severe). I‚Äôm on birth control and it‚Äôs been working tremendously so far, but if I EVER happen to fall pregnant, BUT, I‚Äôm also in a good place in life, partner or none, I‚Äôll think about it. I do have a little experience from helping my sister raise her kiddos. Because simply not making the mistakes my parents made is already a HUGE step towards breaking the toxic family cycles. Not having kids would probably be an even bigger step, but you honestly never know.

Some people really just should not be parents, nor should they try to persuade or straight up force their partners into having children for their own selfish gains. The NASA one was fucking depressing to read :/

your mother doesn‚Äôt sound like a balanced person and would not have made a good doctor.  Stop trying to make up for her imaginary life and take care of yourself
"she loves me, but she doesn't like me"

god that hits like a fucking truck, I've said the same thing to myself more times than I can count
I know this will probably get buried, but I just wanted to reiterate something:

Thinking you are the reason for your parents problems is never the right answer and it is also not necessarily an antinatalist belief but rather a consequence of living in our pronatalist society. I don‚Äôt blame anyone for experiencing these kinds of thoughts and I have had them myself, but at the end of the day, it was not your choice to be born but their choice to have children and their responsibility to provide for you and make you feel loved and appreciated. Any parent who is not able to do this and makes you feel as if you are a burden should not be a parent, because it‚Äôs clear they weren‚Äôt ready or were never meant to be one. 

In my case, I often switched between resentment and pity for my mom, but the true answer probably lies in the middle. Still, I love her and consider her my best friend. She did the best she could in her circumstances, even if it was not enough to make me feel wanted. She put me here on this earth where I have been unhappy for as long as I can remember, but I also know that if it was up to me to raise a child I would have done a much worse job than her, which is why I‚Äôve made the choice to not repeat her mistake and stay childfree.

Some of your comments are so heartbreaking and I truly hope that if you haven‚Äôt yet, you can find peace and learn to live with your upbringing.
I despise my abusive mother and have no contact. I wish I hadn't been born due to the trauma both my parents inflicted - would have saved me so much pain. However, these comments rrassure me that continuing to live means I am further ruining my mother's life üòà That is karma.
As if it was the child's mistake, like nah, fuck the parents who had sex, it takes two to make a baby, ppl are not Holy Mary to get pregnant out of thin air.

I would say "fuck you", as i did when my mother called me a mistake
Listen I get not wanting to have kids. That doesn‚Äôt mean you get to be a shitty parent and put that kind of weight on a child‚Äôs shoulders
Forced birthers should be required to read threads like these.
I would give my life to make sure my mother would never meet my father. 

I wish she would have had the chance to fall in love and enjoy her life.
If it helps, I was a teacher for years and learned that, when a parent is like that with their child, it's always the parent at fault, not the kid. 

My mom has mental issues and told us how much of a burden we were though my brother and I were both intentional
My mom once told me that the only reason she kept me was to piss of my dad. It wasn‚Äôt even during an argument but she said that and I‚Äôve never forgotten it yet she says she would never say that.
This is one of the reasons I'm so staunchly pro-choice.

I was a broken condom oops baby that inspired my folks to get married. Neither of them has ever directly said they regret having me, but neither was emotionally present and both neglected and abused me throughout my childhood, to the refrain of telling me I should "appreciate everything they sacrificed for me."

I've been in EMDR for trauma for the past year, and for the first time in my life I don't wish that I had never been born all the time. I still feel that way sometimes, but not all the time.

Kids are absolutely destroyed by parents who aren't fully in it, no matter how well they pretend.
When I first started work in the pharmacy field my mother confided in me that shortly after I was born she seriously considered a complete career change to become a pharmacist because it fascinated her. However, with three young children and my Dad in the military she just couldn‚Äôt go back to college. I think a part of her is jealous of my career choice (and my freedom to choose it)
My mother once told me, to my face,  to never have kids because they're just a disappointment
yeah... i wrote a little story thing/idk about what it might like to talk to my mother before she became the narcissistic bitter woman she is now. it was right after she and i got into a bad physical altercation where she pulled my hair, hit at me, and blamed me for all her problems.

i figured writing about how talking to her before she became this way could help me, that maybe it could make me feel for her or understand. but really i just got a fictional apology from the ghost of her past self which didn't help as much as i thought it would. 

never having kids because i don't want to become like she is and have my daughter write the same things about me and feel the same things i feel.
All these mothers blaming their kids for their own choices, and all these kids blaming themselves for their parents' choices.

How more NPC can this get /facepalm
Finally someone post something that's on topic for this sub.
I don't give a shit about her ngl. It's their choice they became parents. I'm not whining about my existence when she had options to not have me.
This is so fucked up! The only one at fault is the mother. Can‚Äôt believe people  over here taking on guilt that doesn‚Äôt belong to them.
I‚Äôm recently AN and I also have my own children. My mom was a very young mom to multiples and she didn‚Äôt even get to live any life. My mom and I are similar in that we wouldn‚Äôt have done it if we knew how cruel life is. It‚Äôs bitter-feeling and it makes me feel grief. I try so hard to not let them see it. I
'Before you were mine' by Carol Ann Duffy comes to mind.
I‚Äôm a bit on the fence about antinatalism but holy shit those comments. I too wish my mum could have a life she wanted but thanks to patriarchy all she was ever meant to do is be a baby incubator. It fucking sucks so much
What these women did to their children is fucking tragic. These kids will struggle with self-worth their whole lives. These women weren't antinatalists, they were fucking narcissistic monsters.
My mom loves me with all her heart, but I know that the moment she fell pregnant with me, her life was flipped upside down. She would‚Äôve never had to marry my father if it weren‚Äôt for me
Bro you're the best thing your mom ever had
Damn, this is horrible. I feel bad now for having a mom that genuinely cares about me and wanted me. 

I honestly had no idea so many people had mothers this horrible
my mother has told me and my brother a couple times that she wanted two dogs instead of two kids. don‚Äôt blame her lmfao
My bio mother sold me to my mom for a $20 Walmart gift card only for my mom to tell me as an adult that her life went rapidly downhill when she turned 32. She was 32 when she adopted me.
OMG this hits home.

My dad died today. 

They got married because they got pregnant with me.

It was my fault.

Mine.
My father raped my mother. My mom was already a teenage mom to my sister but when she had me she dropped out of college. I regularly think about what she could have done with her life. She's currently one not great day away from homelessness.
100%. My mother ended up loving me *and* liking me, but both of those took a long time and even though we are now great friends, shes always told me never to have children. 

She had a job, an upcoming degree, and a family in her home country. Then she met my dad, who forced her to abandon all of it and move to Canada to have me, and it really left its mark on her. I dont wish that she had never had me, because unlinke these people it wasnt per se my birth that ruined things for her, but i really wonder what kind of person she would be if she had gptten to keep her life. I wish she had never met my father, i really do.
My birth giver told me I wasn't wanted by her. She was considering abortion. I was a genetic anomaly and was a disappointment for not being male. I was further informed by her that no one in my family wanted me.

My cousin Tracy was treated worse for being a woman. She ended up committing suicide. Tore up a picture of her mum next to her body. 

My point: DO NOT PRODUCE HUMANS. It's been nothing but heartache, loss, and division. Being estranged is the only way to feel safe.
My parents had a hell of a time raising my older sister, but she mostly targeted my mom when she was violent and upset. I can‚Äôt imagine giving birth, raising and loving someone, just for them to abuse you. One of my earliest memories is barricading my bedroom and cowering on my bed, holding my mom while she cried. My parents wanted us, but both my sister and I wound up being bigger disappointments than my parents would like to admit. I think they would both be better off if they had never met.
Lots of bitter mothers out there‚Ä¶. Let me just say that my children filled my heart with more love and joy than I could ever imagine and I never knew a person could feel this happy. I love my children and have so much fun being a mom. It can be tough and sacrifices have to be made but it‚Äôs never more challenging than it is beautiful. I am grateful every day and feel like I won the best lottery there is. The love my children bring to my life is by far the most valuable thing I have ever come across. Not every mom is bitter and full of regret.
Feels like this is just men ruining women's lives in general.
My existance being resented by both my mother and the men who dated her solidified my decision to get my tubes tied. If I could go back in time and stop my mom from meeting my father, I would. Her life was a mess before me and I just made things worse for 18 years
My mom told me drunk one night "I never loved you till your 2nd sister was born"... I'm the oldest of five. It's like thanks mom I can see that, you don't have to tell me. She'll literally tells me in private she regrets having all of us.. like okay who made you have 5 kids? Now you're shocked we're all mentally ill and "not normal"
As the daughter of a mom who told me she wished she had never had children and how much we complicated her life, I spent years feeling guilty for existing. And then I had kids, and realized how absolutely effed up it was that she ever told me that. So angry for sooooo long.
my mom loves me bcs i‚Äôm her child and she has to but as a person i know she‚Äôd hate me if i wasn‚Äôt her kid she tolerates me at best i‚Äôd give anything for her to have the daughter she wanted instead of me or to stop her from having me and have her live her life with just my older siblings
It breaks my heart that so many people here have this thought process of "I ruined my parent's life by being born". I know there are so many circumstances around that that we don't always know all the details for, but y'all, your existence is not something to regret, and it's not something that your parents get to throw at you because they're mad and bitter. That shit is on THEM. Their are parents who have gone through so much worse in their experiences as parents who would never DREAM of saying that to their kids. Just because your parents did that does not exonerate or excuse that. They chose to have you and raise you. You didn't ask to exist. Any pain they've caused by being bitter and resentful toward your existence is on THEM.

This is NOT a pro-natalist statement. Having children should absolutely be an opt-in, not opt-out choice. But the fact that so many people are internalizing the bitter words said by grown ass adults to children is a symptom of children being seen as something that everyone should have, not a cure for that. 

Wishing you all healing and happiness. Whatever led to you existing, you're here now, and I, for one, hope you get to use that to be the best versions of yourselves.
When my child intentionally tries to hurt my feelings when she doesn‚Äôt get her way I say this. ‚ÄúI love you, but right now, I don‚Äôt like the person you‚Äôre being to me. You‚Äôve hurt my feelings.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bit long winded but it‚Äôs way better than what I got. ‚ÄúI love you but I don‚Äôt like you.‚Äù That sticks with you.. it feels more permanent. It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt go to my family‚Äôs house without my kid.
My mom said she wishes she aborted me and my 2 siblings ü•¥. Then says she hates my dad because he ruined her life. THEN when I tell them I wish they got divorced she gets mad and says they love each other too much. I‚Äôm 37 and this shit is still happening
Reminds me of when my mom, drunk and high on opioids, told me the story about her finding out she was pregnant, my dad found her sobbing on the bathroom floor saying her life was over if she didn‚Äôt get an abortion, so he took the pregnancy test and went and told everyone that he was going to be a dad so she couldn‚Äôt get an abortion without everyone judging her or hating her. I was 12
My mother committed suicide at Christmas when I was 11. It‚Äôs perfectly understandable as a trauma response to regret ‚Äúcausing them pain‚Äù or being a burden. A lot of her mental health issues related to being a mom. But after years of therapy, I get that it‚Äôs not actually my fault and that people make choices. The best thing we can do for ourselves is 1) never blame our future children for our bullshit or 2) just don‚Äôt have kids lol.
Holy shit. 

Dude, I don't have any kids but I was parentified at age 9. It literally drove me insane. I have psychosis. 

Even so, I'd go crazy all over again for those kids. Even if it ruined me, THOSE ARE MY KIDS and I could never wish for a life without them. I honestly wish I could adopt my 9 year old sister as my own. The kids of these parents are breaking my heart. Honestly, yeah, DON'T have kids if you aren't 100% sure it's what you want. Don't do it. No child should feel unwanted or like a mistake. Hell...
YIKES
As a parent these kids had terrible parents
well she (the mother) did this to herself, not the child‚Äôs fault
Are the comments in OP being sarcastic?  Because those parents are atrocious for letting their children feel that they weren't loved, wanted or spoiled their parents lives.

In answer to their collective question, it's likely that their parents would be the same unadulterated fuck ups that they became as parents.  

NASA don't want shitheads who make others feel bad about themselves, more than any large organisation does.

They probably shouldn't have had children, but I certainly wouldn't want them on one of my teams either.
A lot of this kind of thinking doesn't seem very healthy to me.. I was an "unwanted" kid and changed the trajectory of my mom's life but she is responsible for her choices and for making the best of what she has like anyone is. I agree with a lot of anti-natalist concerns but some of you could really benefit from therapy and a different outlook as opposed to dwelling on these feelings to the point of being radicalized against procreation.
My parents had their first kid at 20 and as an adult, I learned that their relationship was on the rocks for years when my siblings and I were young because my mom wanted to be her own person but was shackled with the identity and role of ‚Äúmom.‚Äù

She‚Äôs incredible, and she loves us so much. She did everything for her kids and I had a blissful childhood. But I wish she never had us. She‚Äôs an amazingly creative and smart person who had to give up her aspirations to raise kids and make ends meet. My dad, too; he wanted to be a journalist. He gave that up for something soul-sucking but stable. They‚Äôre the best parents in the world and they ruined their lives for that purpose.
The mental gymnastics to redefine straight up abuse as victimhood of the abuser. Lmao. Ban me.
Moral of the story. Don‚Äôt have sex
My mom told me getting married and having kids was the biggest mistake of her life.
This has nothing to do with natalism. It's just bad parenting.
I don't recommend looking at the world this way. Yes, some people had terrible experiences when they got married and had kids. I understand that, but others had totally different experiences where kids have been the best thing that ever happened to them. The same thing applies to anti natalism. It may be the better choice for some people, others will regret it. You can't judge something based on one side without looking at the other. What i recommend is that each individual should consider what's the best path he should follow based on his beliefs.i want to clarify that you are free to have your opinion i just wanted to express mine, and i don't want to be hostile at all. I wish you a great day.
Every day I regret what I put my mother through. She would have had mountains less suffering without me.
My mother hates me, even though she pretends to everyone else that im the problem.

I regret having my kid...i love her but i hate being a parent. I will do my best to make sure she knows she is loved, but i have advised her not to have children of her own. I will not be looking after them! The world is too messed up and they take over your life. She knows that i was not in a good mental state when i had her and wished i had waited. I never want her to feel unloved but she does need to have an understanding of what being a mother does to your life so she doesn't make the same mistake.
I wish I could stop my mom too. Being a minister doesn‚Äôt stop the abuse and spousal (g)rape. It just gets justified with scripture.

But knowing now that we were a burden and stopped her from living her life, I wish I could stop her so she can grow up more.
Mf's wish they've been aborted üòÇ
What weird ass internet hole have I stepped in?
Alright I have head enough of people wanting to not exist. Life may be and enough that you don't want others to go through it but your already here so it's not worth your parents happiness ofr you to not exist. You have life, use it to create more good in the world.
Everyone Change
Am I the only one who thinks why are you telling me about meeting woman who gave birth to you when if she hadn‚Äôt you couldn‚Äôt meet her lol
[removed]
What a bunch of cucks. I‚Äôve been told similar shit by my parents, and I don‚Äôt give a solitary fuck. They made the decision to have kids; nobody forced them. All of these comments are by weak-minded idiots.
Some emo people in here, damn
Idk people been having kids literally forever. That‚Äôs why there are still people. Maybe a lot of these people‚Äôs moms are just losers.
Jesus Christ guys you need therapy. This is reading to me as a deep self-hatred. Life is life, people make decisions. No one can say whether it was the right decision, it‚Äôs just the way it happened to play out
The baggage antinatalists have is insane. Truly the worst corner of Reddit I have ever found.
This is the biggest load of bullshit post
This is so funny
This sub is too much some days

I'm the first born immigrant child to parents hailing from the third world, literally 0 dollars when we came over to America. (Stating this as I don't want to make it seem like I'm talking out of my ass)

They left behind everything they had to provide me a better life than they could ever dream. They went from having careers as respected professionals in their home country to having dogshit, backbreaking, minimum wage jobs where they were treated miserably. In every sense, they socioeconomically downgraded themselves for my sake. 

Even as a kid I knew this and felt deeply guilty, I couldn't imagine how much happier, safer, and healthier they would have been had they not come here.

But they did, had I not been born, they wouldn't have left.

By the time I started school, I felt even guiltier as now they were using what little money they scaped and bled for to help pay for it. I finally broke and told my mom how I've felt my entire life knowing they burned themselves on the pyre for my sake. (Disclaimer: I had my own difficulties too but theirs is on a different plane and magnitude)

She proceeded to call me a fucking moron. She berated me for 15 minutes and told me that for me to feel any guilt for her sacrifices was to spit on her work. She told me every tear and drop of sweat was to make sure I could smile, that she had done everything for the sake of even just the idea of giving a better life to another human that wasn't her. 

She didn't do all that for me to feel sorry, for me to miss out on even a moment of relishing the good life she bled to give me. None of our parents went through what they went through for us to not seize the opportunities and to be depressingly deluded by fantasies of the lives they could have lived. I started looking at things differently since then, now with more respect than guilt and it taught me a valuable lesson of what it is to be human.

Part of being human is to pick whatever nutrients we can from our predecessors with the goal of becoming strong enough to do the same for the next generation. She led the life she wanted and decided it was time for the next human in her place to enjoy life, I admire that and will do the same someday. 

Note, my mother's not all that religious, just incredibly fucking based.
some people not like they have children, so that mean child having bad
This is nothing to do with Natalie. It's just shitty parenting. Why are you so dead set on the extinction of humanity?
Why is this recommended to me. This shts stupidly depressing. Hope y‚Äôall have a better outlook on life in the future and think again abt not starting a family
What is this load of bullshit that‚Äôs popping up on my feed
This sub is fucking hilarious!
Lmao what a terrible sub. Yall need to get out more
What pray tell do you think the consequences are for an antinatalist society? If it‚Äôs anything short of ceasing to exist you haven‚Äôt thought this through.

My God,  what a horrible selfish woman!

Instead,   she makes a shit choice and blames the product of that choice as the fault.   Spends her existence tormenting her.  

Look,  I knew high IQ folks they are good at detecting patterns, they know their kids cries,   they are amazing parents.  If she was really as high IQ as she was she'd have been a great mom.  

She may have been accepted to Dartmouth and Nasa but it sounds like she'd have failed out.

That concept of living not liking really hits home.
And this is only 50% of the narrative.  Think about the dads that have to stay in a loveless marriage, work all the time to provide, have emotionally shut off from the world, have left single mothers to struggle so.  I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs parody in the slightest, but whole shit the progeny industry fucks all sorts up.
Screw my mother. She‚Äôs the worst. Literally brags about being pure evil. She‚Äôs a malignant narcissist and sadist with a taste for children. I don‚Äôt wish to go back in time and stop her from meeting my dad so that I could never be born. I want to go farther back and warn my maternal grandmother to run the other way when she meets my grandfather.
These people are a tiny minority, but that's not something that people on this sub want to hear
"if you'd have been first (born) I wouldn't have had another" - my mom
My parents were pretty ideal. They got divorced when I was 10 or so, but I don't feel like I ruined my mom. She wanted nothing more than to become a mom. She's not the brightest in terms of school, and didn't have many skills so she didn't have any other prospects. I don't mean that as an insult, but she just didn't have any ambition outside of being a mother. Anyway, I'm still an antinatalist for a few reasons and I don't even have to deal with that being one of them.
I feel this deeply. She loves being a mom but she had kids with the wrong person.
I‚Äôve always felt like a burden to my mom. Now that I‚Äôm older and no longer live with her, it seems like her life is much better now that she can choose the family she wants. It feels selfish of me to want to be a part of her life, because I don‚Äôt want to take away from her happiness.
I know my father loves me, but I also know he does not understand even the slightest of what I say and what I do, so he does not like me.
I don't know, he seems kinda basic-dumb: sports sports sports, work work work, women women women...

My mother... I'm sure she was very smart but life has killed the most of her, especially being stuck with an idiot that cheated on her with her sister because of me.

Before they divorced, they tried to have another baby to "fix" things, but there was nothing left to fix and when she cheated, HE wanted a divorce.

I will NEVER have children, and I love my nephew, but this horrible bloodline should have ended with me and my brother.
My mom loves her smoking more than she does me. That has always taken priority. Why I spent the first 5 years of my life inhaling. By yr 3 I was blacking out and by year 5 my begging for a doctor was answered by a coma. It was clear her smoking was hurting me and making me suffer, but she and her friends continued to do it in the dining room. 

At least she told people ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt smoke around me‚Äù and finally did when I didn‚Äôt give her a choice when I was 13-14. Going from 10 plus violent seizures a day down to 1-2 and slowly as I made her stick to the smoking outside and did my own research on seizures like she told people she had learned so much about. I was able to slowly reduce them in frequency and severity. 

I‚Äôd happily go back and stop them from deciding to have more kids after my sister died from half a heart and spine curves. Though not for mom‚Äôs well being. Rather for mine. So I wouldn‚Äôt spend the first 12 years of my life with constant doctor visits and surgeries.
Why would you care who she could have been?  Your mother is a horrible person who took her poor life choices out on an innocent child.
I will never stop saying my mother and father are two people, who should have NEVER had sex.
I‚Äôll never forget my mom telling me that she wished she had put me up for adoption. That was what she initially wanted, but her family and my sister convinced her to keep me. She was a single mother, of 5 (including me). 

My biological father already had 2 kids and a wife who was in a coma she would never wake up from.. so he wasn‚Äôt in the picture. 

It‚Äôs a bummer, but that‚Äôs life.
If my mother hadn‚Äôt had me she would never have stayed with my father. If I wasn‚Äôt alive right now she wouldn‚Äôt be forced to see him whenever he wants to see me or talk to her about me. It‚Äôs rare that he genuinely cares about me but I‚Äôm a way he can control her and still be in her life even in the littlest of ways.
my mom had birth complications while having me and i genuinely feel like i ruined her life forever (she ended up having a stroke because of me)
I feel this so much. My mom always keeps telling me how having kids was a mistake, and would only appreciate me when I could do something for her. She made it known that I am a burden and never made an effort to protect me from my abusive father. I am currently in bad circumstances due to them... even though I was what would be considered a perfect child. I made sure all my life to make their life easier for them. But it's never enough. You don't need validation of such soulless individuals. You weren't a mistake. You are here for a reason, and so many people are beyond happy you are here!
I wish my parents hadn‚Äôt met but it‚Äôs mostly because my mom is‚ú®verbally abusive‚ú®
This is very painful to work through. At my mom‚Äôs funeral I acknowledged her talents as an artist even though I was resentful of her as a mother and grandmother. I set the intention to put myself first when it‚Äôs appropriate so I won‚Äôt resent my own kiddo.
I‚Äôll never forget when I was a teenager and my dad said that he wished I wasn‚Äôt born and that my parents were better off and happier before I was born he can apologize all he wants I can‚Äôt forget it
I always wished I was adopted or even given into an arraigned marriage or something I just wanted to feel wanted and my cousin who I looked up to adopted kids and I told her I wished I was one of them and now she treats me like a weirdo because I overshared
What was the song?
I feel this post in my core
Pro naturalist societies have a high birth rate, America is 148th üòÜ. 

I don't think America is a pro natilist society at all.

Or perhaps my definition of pro natilist society is wrong.
I think y'all are neither for or against, south Korea has the lowest and obviously Niger has the highest as always, I'd definitely consider Niger a pro natilist society.
Even though I‚Äôm an antinatalist, I feel very fortunate knowing that my mother really, *really* wanted my brother and I. Neither of us were accidental and didn‚Äôt hold her back from having the life she wanted to have.
I‚Äôm on the other end. I definitely wish my dad hadn‚Äôt stayed with my mom, she ruins everyone‚Äôs life, including his & mine. I wish I could‚Äôve had a mom that wasn‚Äôt so horrible & manipulative & psychotic. All she does is chew people up & spit them out. Over & over again.
It's weird seeing a.t mainstream on Reddit front page ü§îü§®
So much self-loathing lmao
this whole post makes me so thankful for my parents. are you guys doing okay? cos damn.
My mom moved to nyc to go to drama school and become an actress but met my dad‚Ä¶..
I‚Äôm glad I decided to have kids. Can‚Äôt wait to meet you in April baby girl, I won‚Äôt let you down.
My mom has told me that too. She said ‚ÄúIf I knew you were going to turn out like this I wouldn‚Äòt have kept you.‚Äú 

You will probably never forget (I know I won‚Äôt) but I hope you can learn to live with it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your mother chose to get and raise You. She could at last give You to someone, who wanted a baby. She doesn't like her life? Well- too bad, she did it to herself and You have nothing to do with it.
when i was 7-8 my mom told me ‚Äúi should‚Äôve left you at the hospital‚Äù. i never forgot that either. there are lots of us out here who had to struggle with shit like that, know you arent aloneü´∂üèª
same. multiple times in different ways. first time she told me ‚Äúi wish I never had you‚Äù I was about 11 years old.
my mom's mom told her "youre the one i didnt want but youre also the one who doesnt cause me trouble" like it was a compliment. my mom still hasnt forgotten 60 years later :(
My mom said the same thing, albeit under different circumstances. She said she loved me to death, but if she could turn back time, she would definitely have aborted me. She didn't even say this out of anger in a fight. She just said it so casually, which is what hurt more. I can let go of things said in a moment of rage, but saying it so nonchalantly meant that she truly would have wanted that. 

Also, she weaponzied saying this against me by guilt tripping me about it, claiming I misunderstood her/demonizing her/etc. She never really apologized.
I still remember the look in my mother's eyes when during a fight she told me she wishes I would have been successful in the attempts on my life and that her life would be better off if I were to be dead, oh and how she wanted me to try again. I was in sixth grade at the time. 
I understand the weight of those sorts of comments. They stick in your ear throughout life I've found when trying to asses the value of my own life over the years, and it always hits like a blow to the gut.
User name checks out!!!
I'm so sorry. Sending you hugs if you want them.
I really hope you find a way to live and enjoy your life independent of your trauma. You deserve a life you want to live. Sending my love.
Me too.. People that don't come from hoarder homes don't understand that this is abuse. We have no childhood bc we have to be the parent to a mentally unstable person. People have said to me, well at least she didn't leave. But I wish she did.
Your adult life doesn‚Äôt have to be a mess, learn from it and don‚Äôt be your mother.

My partner's dad walked out on him when he was 8, off to start a new family, and his mom was upset and blamed it on him. She told him, at 8, that she wished she never had him. 

I mean he's 43 now and he has a relationship with his mom but it's not super close. He is definitely very co dependent and has a complete fear of abandonment, and had struggled with bad addiction up until he was around 35. 

Poor guy always blamed himself his entire life until I was like... no, your parents just suck ass and are terrible.
I ALWAYS tell people that the best thing you can do as a parent is to make your kids feel wanted. You can fuck up a lot of things but making sure your kids know that them being there is the greatest thing ever and loving by that. 

That means that you put them first before a relationship or your own personal shit. 

You can have no money and create a cheap ass football game like experience by wearing a white shirt and black pants and yelling hot dogs while carrying them on a tray in your living room while your kids are sitting on cheap plastic chairs with the game on a old school 24" TV  bc you can't afford tickets, and your kids will love and remember the effort. 

I grew up poor in a very rich town bc the taxes meant I went to a great public school. We didn't have a lot, but holy shit did all the rich kids come to my house bc my parents CARED and made them all feel welcome. We had a "miracle pitcher" of ice tea, which was our friends coming over drinking the ice tea and my mom coming down and remaking it from a a Costco large bin tub of ice tea mix. They never saw her remake it. They would just go back to the fridge, and it was "magically" refilled again. 

Make your kids feel wanted, they will appreciate the effort more than the money.
> I remember feeling like a burden myself growing up.

I felt the same way growing up, but I thought my parents were just stupid. I understood from a young age that parenthood was optional, and I thought they chose poorly. Like boo fucking hoo, you don't get to spend all of your money on things you want, because you CHOSE to have children instead. Well, at least I learned from their mistakes. They aren't getting grandkids from either of their children, and we're in our 50's now.
Kids?? They are adults!! 
On the other hand, you are right. Don't have kids.
I also couldn't help but notice almost everyone replying to the initial post was a woman too. It makes me wonder just how many of these daughters were told that by mothers who bowed down to the pressures of patriarchy and are salty af that they were the ones who had to destroy their bodies just so their husband's would MAYBE have a legacy a.k.a. a son and then had a daughter
Yeah very true a father can abandon the whole family and kids and mother and most people won‚Äôt bat an eye and I‚Äôll even see people defending it or saying ‚Äúgood for him looking out for himself living his best life‚Äù meanwhile most mothers won‚Äôt do that because the societal standards put upon them. If women did the same thing they would be judged so harshly and made out to be evil but if a man does it it‚Äôs fine. So I think all this also contributes to it.
There‚Äôs also the biological pressure. If a woman wants kids her biological prime is in her 20s, when most women in our society are studying and starting careers. Men don‚Äôt have as much of that biological clock that women do.
I respect where you're coming from, and I don't even disagree with it, but men are expected to provide. They aren't exactly "off the hook".
Lots of men have to give up their dream careers and settle for safe, boring jobs.
Nah

I wish not having children was celebrated, abortions even more accepted and accessible.

I can't agree with this enough
You literally explained how I feel about my life. I literally don‚Äôt enjoy living and I do not want to participate in it either. 

I‚Äôve had an awful, hard life growing up with CSA and it suck‚Äôs that *I* have to be the one to pick up the pieces and do this whole ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù bullshit. Why the fuck am I doing all the hard, dirty work?


I am a victim of my own existence.
Yours is a perfect description of me.  My parents chose to ignore my obvious distress when I was around eleven or twelve:  sudden overeating, bed wetting, stealing, self-mutilation, sexual abuse, etc.  They were the champions of denying anything that they didn't like and simply ignoring the it.  My therapy started in 1986 after a sexual assault by a guy I was seeing:  his reason was he suddenly didn't like my attitude; the therapy is ongoing.  Every day has thoughts of self-harm with no plan or active intent.  My heart goes out to you, and I understand your pain.  Please take very good care of yourself.  ü¶ú
i feel this and im sorry. our parents can really fuck us up. i hope you get some good people in your life. maybe consider fostering children if youre up for it. theyd appreciate someone that can understand.

I agree with many points of your comment and can relate. I sincerely hope you can find some joy or happiness in something, even something small that makes life worth it for a little while longer. I wish you well.
‚ÄúTo get the courage to off myself one day‚Äù. 

Dude thats seriously sad, the fact you see ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù as the absolute state of your life, that cant ever be changed WILL be the reason it actually is. Stop convincing yourself that suffering is the only thing youll ever experience. If you dont you are subscribing to an equally sickening thought pattern as people getting pressured into having kids  

Antinatalism should not be an excuse to stay comfortable in a pit of self wallow.

Edit: i realise this may read quite aggressively, so apologies for that. But it is sad to see so many people upvoting a comment like that. Because while I do agree with some parts of your comment. It is very apparent that you emotion is rooted in not properly dealing with trauma.
Still hurts when they don‚Äôt love u
Sounds like this subreddit is just filled with people that have been hurt :( it‚Äôs so awful to read
Sounds like the dad blaming you so he doesn‚Äôt have to feel guilty for not carrying his own weight. I‚Äôm sorry.
you sound like one of the good mommas ‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôve done more since my daughter was born than I did in the 12 years preceding her birth. Life does not end with a kid. Sure it gets more difficult to do some things, but I chose this.
It's sickening. They regret their own poor decisions and place the burden on someone who in no way, shape or form had any choice in being born. This is psychological abuse and the kids are willingly taking the blame. I feel so sorry for them because they will never ever forget that and will never lose the guilt. I just hope they won't continue the cycle of abuse and repeat their parents mistake.

Right? If your parents made poor choices, that's not your fault. Maybe they played stupid games and won stupid prizes, but that's on them, not you.

The woman who was filing for divorce was trapped purposely for sure
Those men can‚Äôt have women roaming around being free like that, they would feel lonely without women chained beside them.
do you think women have no free will or accountability?
We don't chain women to motherhood. Take some accountability FFS. You know if you don't want kids you could like, you know not open your legs.
Your toddler should grow up and learn to wipe, so it's not the rest of your life.
It's sickening. They regret their own poor decisions and place the burden on someone who in no way, shape or form had any choice in being born.

This 100% wtf is this self effacing ‚ÄúI wish I was never born so my mother could have lived a more full life‚Äù ? What makes this girl‚Äôs mother‚Äôs life more worth ‚Äòliving‚Äô than her own ? What a toxic mentality to have towards oneself, and if her mother is reinforcing that, it‚Äôs extremely selfish on her part, considering she was likely an adult and made the decision to have children in the first place.
Abortion is expensive and sometimes illegal and many people will do anything in their power to force breeding.

Adoption is a maybe, depending on region/circumstances. It disgusts me that in the US after touting the ability to legally drop off unwanted babies safely, authorities still attempt to hunt down the mothers. Like, motherfucker, thats exactly what would make other desperate kids kill the babies.
Yeah, all this empathy for the mothers is just not right. Choices were made, you know? I'm a mother, and my mother told me she wished she let me die as a child (I was dying at one point). I don't feel bad for *her!* Who the hell cares what mistakes and choices she made. I don't regret my life, and I certainly don't wish I never existed. My great grandmother was my grandfather's 14 year old sister. I'm sure there were bigger regrets there but I'm here with my baby boy enjoying life. Everyone before me had their choices. My hands are clean and I'm happy with my own life choices.
On Reddit? What makes you think that,?
Trauma bonding.
I think its biological. We seek parents if we don't have them.

People talk about a mother's love, and some people ARE great, but it also comes from a hormone designed to mind control them into not eating their children.
Same. So much talent wasted because of ...what? A woman cannot be married and have a career at the same time, duh!

It reminded me of the movie Mona Lisa Smile, where a woman breaks ground and is accepted to university in a repressive era, works so hard for it, is so talented, gets everyone rallying for her Because she is so talented....and then dumps it all because of a duuuude and gender expectations. Becomes a stay at home mom. She is very young and the movie does not touch on if she regretted it later, but man was I frustrated.


My grandma was denied the opportunity to study. Her teachers even visited her home to beg for great grandpa to let her go do further studies, but the man turned them down, verbatim: "she doesn't need to read books to milk cows." Not any better, and equally infuriating.
I'm extremely proud of your mom, too.
[deleted]
ugh your poor mom getting trapped again :(
Yes- this was the case with me. Many of them were victims of and have internalized misogyny   that‚Äôs why. It was also common/ still is common for women to marry men that make a lot more then them so they are the ones that quit their careers to stay at home with the kids.
Kick her ass üòÅ
she sounds like an abusive demon. and people call us evil for saying you should need a license to have kids. what a nasty sadistic bitch
my bitch of a mother probably smoked with me because i cant imagine that chain smoking addict could stop for 9 days let alone 9 months. my eyesight is terrible and i always thought it was due to her selfishness and unhealthy lifestyle. no other health issues luckily but my fucking god she belongs in prison. the audacity of pregnant women to be massive pieces of shit without repurcussion and make their kid pay the price. wish i could sue her for damages.
This is true. At some point you have to start accepting your parents for who they are and the limitations on what they can give you (and I don‚Äôt mean financially). One you do this and stop expecting them to be more then they can be, you will be able to deal with it better. I‚Äôm sorry that your parents are being like that, they should support you as their child.
My loon mother said I was the biggest disappointment of her life not being a boy. If I would have been, she wouldn't have had my sister next and  then my brother.  We ruined her life and her body.

My brother was never the doctor/lawyer son she wanted, so fvck him too! ü§£ 

 It's basically a long, slow, disappointmening grind until death. Kids ruin everything 

Thanks for the memory, mom!
And not just spewing bigotry in all directions.
Except not everyone who has a kid wanted to have a kid, so maybe learn some empathy
Yea, she always tells me that. Still always knew deep down that I wasn‚Äôt wanted by her or anyone and didn‚Äôt enjoy my childhood much as a result.
Big yikes.  I understand a lot of the anti-natalism arguments and even support some of them, but this post is just straight up untreated depression/mental illness.
If you're a parent, why are you even here?....
The mother doesn‚Äôt always have a choice, especially back then when women had zero rights, they had to depend on their husbands and I imagine saying no to having children wouldn‚Äôt have ended well for them. But of course it‚Äôs never, ever the child‚Äôs fault.
It is never the child‚Äôs fault, but I think there are cases where it‚Äôs more complex than ‚Äúthe mother did it to herself‚Äù. My mom was not ready for children but was coerced by my father to get pregnant anyways. I‚Äôm not saying she had no choice at all in this situation, but a big part of her autonomy was still taken away due to my parents both growing up in two different pronatalist countries.
While I personally relate to some of the comments, I agree with your sentiment. This outlook that says you can ruin your parents lives just by being born is not an antinatalist belief to me. The reason I posted it is because I think these thoughts are a sad consequence of pronatalism and society‚Äòs coercion to have children that isn‚Äòt talked about enough.
> Don‚Äôt have ~~sex~~ children
Bringing a child into the world that you aren‚Äôt 1000% sure you want is an act of cruelty.

Personally, I believe shoving a soul into a meat sack simply because ‚ÄúI want onnnnneeee‚Äù is also an act of cruelty‚Äîespecially with the world as it is now‚Äîas at best that child will die someday, and at worst that child will die young or have a miserable long life.
Idk, I have no idea why this was recommended to me. Everyone here seems to have such a depressing outlook on life.
Kids who are still developing mentally and seeing this shit on social media are being influenced by it and internalizing it. It‚Äôs victimhood fetishization and social media is spreading it.
So because someone has been happening forever that means it‚Äôs good? Lmao yikes
[deleted]
Self hatred? I posted this not because I necessarily agree with the comments but to show the consequences of pronatalism, where children end up being unwanted, feeling responsible for their parents problems and hating themselves because of it. This moral outlook / self hatred is not antinatalism but rather a consequence of the PROnatalist society we live in.
Why?
How so
Even if you're a natalist, I couldn't imagine viewing this post and the image replies and thinking anything about any of that is funny. That's just heartless.
How so?
posted this while I was outside. Lol
You realize ‚Äúbut humanity will go extinct‚Äù isn‚Äôt a counter argument right? Nothing of value will be lost when our species dies out. I say let it happen.
IQ is a terrible way to measure intelligence. It's not just one number determining how smart you are. You know people can be really smart in some areas and really stupid in other areas, right? I know people who are brilliant in areas like academics or art, but when it comes to emotional intelligence, they're as dumb as rocks.

Also, kids are not easy. Any book on the psychological development of kids will prove that. There are *so* many ways to traumatize a kid in a way that will affect their personality for the rest of their lives. Even something as simple as ignoring your kid after a long day of work when they're in need of emotional support can have lasting consequences.
Holy shit. Def should not have had kids.
That is TERRIBLE. My parents are both verbally and mentally abusive but I can't imagine them going there. That's a whole nother level of low. We were pretty awful as teenagers and brought our parents a lot of misery but that was largely their fault for not raising us right and I've always blamed them more than us.
Have you ever considered that your mom is just a shitty person that already had shitty tendencies. Obviously for her it‚Äôs easier to blame someone else. Find that pattern in her more and you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôve been the easy scapegoat. She had a choice. And instead of being meek and self loathing, seek therapy to break the cycle‚Ä¶.
>My mom has told me that too. She said ‚ÄúIf I knew you were going to turn out like this I wouldn‚Äòt have kept you.‚Äú 


My mother has said the very same thing during a fight to me. It's something I learned to accept, def hurt a lot when I heard it but you eventually learn to cope with the facts. Although to be fair I'm sure she didn't fully mean it when she's stated this because she has some serious anger management issues so she's bound to say things compulsively and explosively.
This so sounds  like something a Korean or Chinese parent would say.
my grandparents pretty much ended up raising me. my mom was emotionally unavailable and my dad isn‚Äôt in the picture. (‚Äò:
You don‚Äôt know their circumstances, so that‚Äôs a pretty horrible thing to say.
seriously? on this of all comments? yea i get it funny haha username joke but read the room.
What an absolutely braindead comment to make, you fucking loser.

Exactly. This post was heartbreaking, to say the least. These kids had no choice to be born and yet have internalized so much blame and shame, they put it on themselves why their parents didn't love them properly. 

Even if abortion wasn't an option, adoption was. I know this is also easier said than done in certain families, especially pressure put on the woman, but I am just so sad for any child whose parents made it abundantly clear that they ruined their parents lives. No. No child every in the history of children has plotted family ruin from the womb. 

Be mad at your dad for baby trapping and mad at your mom for misplacing the blame onto the child.
Love this. Should definitely be the goal of any parent. Even of you didn't want your kids, there is no reason to tell them that. My mom has also told me my whole life she wouldn't have wanted me.
I'm another one.  My father was unrelenting in his pursuit of someone to "carry on the family name" and my mother gave in.  He got me, instead of a son.  He doted on me all my life and was always in my corner.  Then he was diagnosed inoperable liver cancer.  He began to encourage me to settle down & produce a grandchild when I was in my mid-twenties.  Now this was a man who heard me talk all my life about how glad I was to be an only child & how intolerable I find children.  As he finally realized I would never willingly become pregnant, he became increasingly distant.  I was at his side in hospital when he passed away and took care of everything.  He couldn't speak or move at that time, so I can only assume he still considered me outside his circle of trusted people for not fulfilling his wish for a grandson.  I know he loved me, but he did withdraw from me & that's the only reason I can come up with.  All I know is I turned out to be a disappointment to him, and haven't forgiven him, my mother, or myself.

After my parents divorced I lived with my mother who tied her tubes after me & threw herself into building public water access & toilet facilities in Cambodian villages on the Methodist Ministry's dime.  Saw my father every weekend, which felt liberating.  Pretty obvious Mom didn't really want to be a parent.  Can't say I blame her --  I feel the same!  I can't begin to express the sadness I feel, knowing I took her life away from her for 15 years.  At the same time, I couldn't bear to let her know I'm anything but happy & well.  I wonder often what she would've been if she hadn't given in to the pressure from my father.  She travels all around the world now, places like Tikal, Malta, Angkor Watt, Ireland, Peru.  All on the church's funding.
My mother's mother was verbally abusive and always let my mom know she preferred a boy, not a girl.
I think many...

But there is also no chance to continue the career later, because women are expected to give literally everything up for the child. Men are not expected to care for the child at all. They are expected to have children, but they are not even expected to remain with the mother. Look at Andrew Tate. He is braging to have 12 children and the mothers are not even known, nobody talks about that specifically when talking about Tate. Or even Elon Musks children. There are situations/ countries, where men are expected to provide for their families, but not everywhere.
I‚Äôm not saying women aren‚Äôt abusive or that every woman is mom material I‚Äôm just saying that there‚Äôs more pressures on women in regards to having kids. I‚Äôm sorry you went through that. Every child should be loved and cared for. She shouldn‚Äôt have had kids.
They didn't say men were "off the hook", they literally just said that women face more pressure to give up everything to care for their children, which is true, and that specific expectation isn't usually put on men. It's not always a competition.
[deleted]
Totes. Men are expected to not only support themselves, but to support an entire family. And in some cases, are considered a deadbeat or plain lazy irregardless of how hard they‚Äôre working.
Men will have to ‚Äúprovide‚Äù whether married or single, with children or without. I know in other cultures it‚Äôs more common for men to live with parents until marriage. In this country, especially with boomers and before, many men were out the door at 18, and on to work in a factory, farm or boot camp. They had to support themselves regardless.
So do women
Mainstream media could make that happen, but likely won't. Seems most people are incapable of critical thinking and go along with whatever they're influenced to do and right now the push is for women to keep popping them out.
Telling a suicidal person to have kids is fucking insane
> Antinatalism should not be an excuse to stay comfortable in a pit of self wallow

The two are not mutually exclusive.

Some are irreparably depressed. I think you're being condescending for the sake of your own self righteousness.
I genuinely think he's so thick that he doesn't realize that.

He grew up in a generation and a lifestyle where women did the work around the house and raise the children, and the men went off to work.

I don't think he ever adapted to the new reality that his wife was the one making stable money and most of the work he was doing was his own little side projects around the house and farm
I'm sure you're the best mother in the cosmos.
I don‚Äôt willingly take the blame. I doubt anyone consciously willingly does. I‚Äôve been through the whole therapy thing though. Taking the blame lets me have control over the situation. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my mother, certainly if I were a better child or better person then she wouldn‚Äôt feel this way about me‚Äù. That‚Äôs the only way we can understand or rationalize how we were ever SO hated by the one person in the world who was supposed to love us the most. It‚Äôs a horrible thing to live with. 

For me, it‚Äôs made me want to be the best mom I can be. Specifically to never let my future kids ever feel this way. I guess I have a special motivation to not ever be the source of my future kid‚Äôs pain. I would never let my future kid feel like a burden, mistake, unwanted, etc.
[deleted]
Right but to make it even worse, it‚Äôs the child that truly suffers from their parents poor choices. The consequences often fall on the children rather than the parents and it‚Äôs so unfair, especially when we don‚Äôt deserve to suffer for their mistakes at all.
fuck off tell that to my husband who changed his mind about kids after 12 years. im sick too. i cant have kids. hes the one who wants them cause of LeGaCy crap. not me. I know how much it would suck
Pressuring someone to get pregnant or stay pregnant is an abusive tactic‚Ä¶
bro doesn‚Äôt think rape or coercion or begging or demanding or throwing a tantrum about having sex and having children exists
Seeing as that men can force those legs apart, it's just better if men are castrated hell even have their dicks removed from them. I would say...just keep it in your pants but that's like asking men to turn the ocean into melted gold.
Spoken like a true MAGA forced birther. Edit‚ÄîBritish I see. Ok then Boris Johnson supporting forced birther.
That statement was not only reductive‚Äîit‚Äôs gross as *fuck*.
Don‚Äôt get mad when you have to pay child support for 18 years! Keep your legs closed too incel!

Oddly enough, my therapist called her evil as well. I think they're supposed to be impartial, neutral observers when it comes to therapy. (I think. I'm not really sure).

But she had this look of horrified disgust and said, "It isn't often I use the word, but your mother has evil in her heart."
I agree. I mean; I clean our house daily, do my own laundry, buy my own food, do my own dishes, etc. I dont even let my mom cook for me. I barely even speak to them. Im not sure what else I can do
My mom should learn empathy first LMAO cause she sure didn't have any for me.
That, and they've internalized abuse received from their parents.
You‚Äôd be depressed too if you were forced into having a child you didn‚Äôt want
I like the nonsense, it reminds me of how miserable I‚Äôm not. I mean come on you gotta be pretty miserable to hate people for having children or being mad that you were born. There‚Äôs orgasms and weed life is awesome
Yes, my grandmother was also pressured into having kids and ended up being an abusive mother ( beat my mom at age 4 to the point where my mom vomitted, forcefully hospitilized my mom into a psychiatric Unit in the Soviet Union ( closed one ) aged 13 or so, where my mom got heavy meds for no reason....).
I agree with you
So because you get pregnant you‚Äôre gonna give up your dream/the amazing opportunity to work for fucking nasa????? Lmfao yikes
Because there‚Äôs really no way to know. The past is the past, what happened happened. We can‚Äôt change it. So there‚Äôs no use in reflecting on would‚Äôves shouldves, especially when the conclusion you arrive at is your existence being nothing but a burden to others. It‚Äôs a trap.
‚ÄúI ruined a woman who once had a life outside of her children‚Äù. I mean YEEEEESH BRO GODDAMN. This conclusion is not only needlessly negative and downright troubling, it‚Äôs also just wrong. People make decisions, and that‚Äôs life. Our measures of success in life are really quite arbitrary, if someone‚Äôs made the decisions they wanted to, that‚Äôs good enough. There‚Äôs no need to reflect on the past and other routes, because they don‚Äôt exist. There‚Äôs no way to know what that would have looked like.

My point is these feelings are unwarranted, and need to be addressed in therapy. I dont know if they‚Äôre necessarily a reflection of pro-natalism. They read to me as young kids who hate themselves finding justification to despise their own existence
Literally thought this shit couldn‚Äôt get better and you hit me with ‚Äúeven if you‚Äôre a NATALIST‚Äù. Holy fucking shit üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Nothing of value will be lost"

How fucking pathetic your life must be to think that omegalul
Right? My mom was emotionally abusive and there was definitely some emotional neglect as well, she's not the worst, but she is a narcissist. EVEN SO, she said some awful things to me but I gotta give credit where credit is due. 

She never told me I was a burden, unwanted, or unloved. I sometimes felt that way, but she never confirmed it and I don't think she feels that way now that I'm out of the house. I mean, I know that bar is low, but if she'd told me that, I'd be devastated, even with our issues.
Can‚Äôt get a therapy appointment haha

She kind of had a choice, abortion isn‚Äôt illegal in my country but who knows what my dad would have done. It‚Äôs not like she willingly got pregnant in the first place. I don‚Äôt blame her for saying the things she did to me, that was a long time ago and there‚Äôs no use in bringing it up again. I don‚Äôt hate myself, I get these thoughts sometimes but I know that it is not my fault for being here. This world just sucks sometimes and I am breaking the cycle by not bringing kids into it. :)

Deranged frl
Damn wtf did they say
I‚Äôm confused why you say ‚Äúbetter yourself‚Äù, the original commenter says they hate life, they could be the one bettering themselves.
Seems like her life turned out just fine honestly
I wouldn't have to put up with anything if I knew how my life turned out. I'd give everything to make her stop from her having me
Exactly. I agree. Women give up everything men give up jack shit‚Ä¶maybe child support. There are a lot more social and biological pressures for women than men. Women also have a shorter time span to have kids if they want them and have to choose between motherhood and independence/career. None of this is conducive to a healthy family environment.
You don't very often hear people talk about what makes a good father. It's generally something vague about "providing," which means ... what, having a job? Which is a basic adulting thing? Does this mean men who earn more are better fathers?
Yes, I also said " to that extent", ( in Russia men are expected to marry and have Kids as well and are told that )   they are also  expected to be successful careerwise and to have sex with women, sometimes with many women, but they are not expected to give up their whole personality just to have kids. 
I also only sporadically encountered the expectation to be providers. Having an income yes, god forbid if they are unemployed, then they are losers, but providers, in my family my grandma was told to make do with what my granddad has or have a job.
Where men have it worse is when they experience sexual or domestic violence or when they have mental health problems, but that has nothing to do with that post. All comments also felt guilt towards their mothers NOT towards their fathers, which is remarkable.
I never said it was. I used quotations to donate the saying "off the hook". My intention wasn't to imply that, I'm aware they didn't say it. 

Im not trying to make anyone's struggles feel less than. In fact, I made mention that I wasn't trying to say men have it worse, and also sympathized with their point. Because yes, I do feel like women have some unfair pressures in life. I just wanted to add a comment to their statement that, at least in my opinion, seemed to suggest men aren't pressured as much.
I would be interested to here where you've read or heard that. I'd love to give it a read if possible. üôè
I do not fully disagree, but I am from Russia originally and there we had sayings like "if he beats you, he loves you" and "all men cheat, if a woman does not tolerate this, she is bad and will end up alone". So women are expected to tolerate a lot for that provision. 
Also while men who live of womens income are frowned upon, they are not ostrazised for not being able to Provide, women are told directly to their face by strangers that they are bad for not having kids. Even Single moms have more value than childfree women.
Yeah a lot of my family have been talking behind my back because I'm not dating someone, I'm not trying to start a family, and I don't have a stable job yet, even though I just graduated this year. 

I'm not saying men have it worse, but there's certainly an expectation. I cant tell you how many times people have told me to "man up" whenever misfortune makes it my way.
Men are expected to have careers though, and to be successful in them. Woman do not have that expectation.
It is really difficult to realize that society, media, religion, your parents and everybody else were wrong all along. It took me nearly 30 yrs to realize how brainwashed and conditioned I have been. And the realization is because I'm educated, curious about everything and have access to internet.

Shut up and make babies the men have things handled sweet heart
Well you are a human being with individuality (or maybe you're not) and thoughts if your own. If you are too weak willed to say no then sorry sweaty that's a you problem.
Yeah because women are all so stupid and easily manipulated.
Can people stop using rape as the fallback? Y‚Äôall act as if every pregnancy was the result of rape. Obviously rape is a special case. When people say that women should take equal responsibility they are referring to every other case.
Honestly, I'm all for that lmao but ohhh what if it opens the door for "good men" to get into trouble and castrated too?? Ohh no, the consequences are too high. Not like women's rights or anything.
Milkshake gold that's not a bad idea.
Lol, I don't live anywhere near America. But the whole illegalisation of abortion is actually hilarious to me. Oh boo hoo some slag that couldn't keep her legs together has to suffer the consequences of her actions. Poor wee dears. 

In this day and age it boggles my mind how anyone can even end up with an unwanted pregnancy with the massive amount of contraceptives available today.
Again you don't know what Incel means you utter nong. Me and my girlfriend use contraceptives, so no unwanted babies here sweaty.

Some women are forced to do this by their husbands, yes. Gaslighting is a powerful thing. 

Weird to pretend this doesn‚Äôt happen lmaoooooo yikes

Again‚Ä¶ thinking you are the cause for your mother‚Äòs life being ruined has nothing to do with antinatalism. Holding this belief is the consequence of a culture that coerces women into having children. As in, the opposite of antinatalism.

And about the decisions / what if thing, it‚Äôs true, there‚Äòs no reason why things turn out the way they do, everyone has different interpretations of everything, whatever, I don‚Äôt care. If someone is smart they will usually at least study those around them and those who came before them to not repeat their mistakes.

(Edit to address your other point)
I can‚Äòt speak for the people in the Tiktok comment section obviously, but in my case, feeling unwanted by my parents was not a symptom of my depression but rather the only reason I started suffering from it, and that‚Äòs the case for most people I know that are suffering from it and didn‚Äòt have some sort of big life-changing traumatic event kickstart their depression.
I mean have you looked at what humanity has done to the planet? Do I really need to explain it?
That's a surprise.

As for what you said, words cannot express how sorry and how appalling these words are, and just like that, no language and no lexicon can do justice to the sympathy I would like to extend to you right now, therefore I will try to do it using English and my own language.

Cuando leo historias como √©sta, enseguida pienso que soy una persona privilegiada, es decir que ahora no doy por sentado tener padres buenos. No te conozco pero te ofrezco mi amistad o conversaci√≥n amistosa.

It is when I read stories like this that I realize I am a privileged person, meaning I do not take for granted having loving caring parents. I don't know you but I offer friendship and friendly conversation.
No, not at all. I was forced to give birth and keep my rapists child at 15 years old. I never had ‚Äúa choice‚Äù about it. 

You don‚Äôt know the circumstances, so don‚Äôt judge them.
Your life isn‚Äôt over.  I‚Äôd wager a guess that you aren‚Äôt even half way.
I wouldn't generalize that much. My mom got caught lying in court, trying to imprison my pops during the custody battle. The result? They gave her primary custody, and she abused the shit of out me for having the audacity to look like my dad. My pops wanted me, and my mom wouldn't have had to pay anything, but she wanted to hurt him. And when he was gone, she hurt me instead. Haven't talked to her in like 10 years.
>You don't very often hear people talk about what makes a good father

Yes, that is what I mean. Men are not primarily thought of as fathers at all. Children are not seen as something life changing for them. They are supposed to have children for sure, but there is no talk about *** a father must do this or that or else*** that is there in society. I mean there is research of father figures and how they changed and books aimed at fathers  and since the 1970s it is considered a good thing if fathers participate in upbringing and fathers are praised for doing so, but there is no outrage if fathers do not do that.  


>... what, having a job? Which is a basic adulting thing? Does this mean men who earn more are better fathers?

To be fair if a man is unemployed, disabled, wants to be a Stay at Home dad, depressed etc. He is considered a loser, not worthy of a family. But that only goes for men, who are in a bad situation. A man who has a stabile job is considered solid. 
Yes, as men sometimes are promoted to have more boring, stabile jobs, but women are asked to give up EVERYTHING to be a mother.
For the last question man are judged by their income, higher income better person, better partner etc. but not better father.
You didn't engage with their point. You deflected to make it about a different struggle that men face.
https://capsulenz.com/thrive/female-breadwinner/
I‚Äôm not saying men have it worse, but I‚Äôm just pointing out that there‚Äôs also another side to it. For the most part, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre spot on. And on the flip side, men are told by strangers to their face that their not worth recognition until After they prove their worth.
Men being denied the right to have emotions is an other can of worms, which is incredibly damaging to men though.
Yeah. Exactly. One of the biggest problems I personally have as a man in this society, is that the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying men have it worse‚Äù is even necessary. I won‚Äôt say it and talk about the issues I have as a male, then a female will say that women have it worse; like that makes my experience invalid.

I talk about not wanting or ever having kids, and my family just looks at me like I haven‚Äôt woken up yet and say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll change your mind when you find the right girl‚Äù. I won‚Äôt even bring up if I‚Äôm dating someone unless it gets serious, cause soon after, they‚Äôll ask when I‚Äôm having kids, especially my mother.
I‚Äôd rather have a boring job than completely quit my job to be a maid and a nanny.
Women are discouraged to have careers though. I am afab, non binary, and my mom said I do not need a grammar school, because women birth children. I fought for going and ended up going. 
When I tell my dad about career woman he says it is too much  for a woman. My Cousin is a head of operations, she is
never praised for that, she is praised for having birthed three boys. And the fact that they are boys is always stressed as a big achievement. 
Also my mom used to say that a woman is always a C*NT no matter what she does, so she has to be married to obtain value through her husband as married a woman will become what her husband is. 
I would say those roles are equally damaging on everyone who cannot fit them.
Men are expected to have careers only because women are expected to be mothers. Wether or not a woman wants to have a succesful career is not even a question in most places where the nuclear family is still the default.
Women are absolutely expected to be successful in their careers and be a mom. What a weird misconception
What do you mean?
[deleted]
[deleted]
Ignoring the fact that there is massive societal pressure for woman to be mothers and homemakers, even nowadays, is very naive.
Most people are stupid and easily manipulated, and women are people. Men, women, enbies, it doesn‚Äôt matter. If you‚Äôre human, there‚Äôs a much higher chance of being stupid and easily manipulated than not. Gender means nothing to this, it comes with the humanity.
wtf is wrong with you broüíÄ if your an incel then just say that
humans* are generally easily manipulated by someone they love

*ftfy
Do you know how common SA is? Do you know how frequently marital r@pe happens? That is not a special case. That is a fairly common case. Especially in conservative countries which outnumber the liberal ones(though they're not great either). The men in my country opposed criminalizing marital r@pe and the parliament voted against the bill to criminalize it in overwhelming numbers. Because all of these men know they would be behind the bars if the bill passes through.
did u read the rest of my comment
U know contaceptives fail right? Castrating men should do the trick tho. U first
Incel is a mindset buddy
Contraception fails regularly "sweaty"
Men are at fault too. Tell them to close their legs as well and ‚Äúoh I get laid I have a girlfriend!‚Äù You‚Äôre not helping yourself.
[deleted]
Maybe, but it‚Äôs a slippery slope. In truth we really can‚Äôt know. You have to internalize the wisdom from the past without obsessing over it. Something that‚Äôs hard to do when you go into it with immaturity or strong emotions.
Made it a hospitable place to live where a vast majority of us don‚Äôt worry about starving to death, being eaten by predators or freezing to death?
Are you blaming the kid for it??? That kid didn't have a choice either.
That too happens, but that is the other side of the " women are primarily mothers" stereotype. The court assumes the woman inherently wants the child because it is supposedly in her nature and that women inherently know better how to upbring children.
I agreed and then inserted my own thought on the issue. Is that not discussion?

Edit: pardon if that sounded rude. It wasn't my intention. I am genuinely curious, since I assumed that was good discussion.
That was quite the interesting read! I'd love to see where they found their sources. Regardless, interesting, thank you.
In Russia I never heard that, in other countries maybe....
It also depends on the country...
Mhm, I understand. People's issues in general feels like a can of worms. üòî
You literally pulled a "YES BUT I ALSO HAVE IT BAD" on someone who said nothing about men and was talking about an experience that primarily affects women. Like, sometimes just acknowledge other people have it hard without making yourself king victim.
What‚Äôs the difference between having a boring, wage slave job that you hate vs being a nanny?
Women often are discouraged or forbidden from having a career...look at Afghanistan
Women having careers is a modern thing. In almost every culture throughout history women have not been expected to be the breadwinners of the family. You‚Äôre saying that‚Äôs not accurate?
Yeah babyyyy üí™üí™
Wait‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm.. I‚Äôm stupid??!1!1!1 FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
Men are biologically more evolved than women, from y chromosomes, to height, to bones, to muscle mass.

Stay mad
I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs being facetious, meaning that if a woman is pressured into giving up her career for a pregnancy she doesn‚Äôt want, it‚Äôs partially her fault.
Lol, you don't even know what Incel means. Sorry sweaty but as hard as try Incel will never be a by word for disagreeing with a woman.

I've been with my girl 6 years come March and I'm certainly not INvoluntary CELibate.
i think misogynists are incapable of seeing rape defined as anything other force from a stranger because to them coercion and assault/rape by someone you agreed to marry/date is ‚Äúwhat they‚Äôre entitled to‚Äù
I did, but I think the other guy did a good job at answering that one. As if women didn‚Äôt have the free will to say ‚Äúmy body, my choice‚Äù.
[deleted]
He doesn‚Äôt know because he doesn‚Äôt have any sex lol
Eh, you're calling me Incel which is literally impossible if one has an active sex life. Need to get better insults sweaty because the ones you currently use make no sense.
[deleted]
You mean exterminated countless species, horrific events such as Chernobyl, enslaved/murdered other populations of humans, and continued destruction of the planet to the point where it‚Äôs probably beyond salvation anyway? Yes.
NNOOOOO BUT LE BAD 

WE SHOULD GO EXTINCTE 

YOU SHOULD ONLY SEE THE BAD SIDE OF THINGS

NOOOOOO

its quite funny how these guys say this things unironically
I think you may be responding to the wrong person, I never said anything about blaming the kid.
Very true. My state, especially at that time, gave more parental rights to the grandmother than the father. There are definitely a lot of dead beat dads, but mine fought an ugly custody battle where he almost got falsely imprisoned just to see us once a year. Some people are just not cut out for parenthood
Women are expected from birth to nurture, put others first, serve as therapists for their parents, etc etc even before we are even biologically able to have children. We‚Äôre talking about the socialization of men vs women. Men are encouraged to focus on the self and their career but successful women will still be asked ‚Äúso when are you having kids?‚Äù The expectation placed on men to provide typically comes into play after you already get someone pregnant, but it‚Äôs not your destiny and expectation since you were a little boy. Not trying to downplay men‚Äôs struggles at all but this is just how it is for us girls and we‚Äôre tired of not being able to put ourselves first without the backlash. We‚Äôre often called selfish if we don‚Äôt have kids.
Yeah, what I was referring to is that there are areas where men have it worse than women: when they experience domestic or sexual violence is one, mental health is an other.
Well, I actually replied to a comment already talking about the men side of the issue in a show of understanding and community.

Edit: typo.
So you would prefer to be an unpaid nanny? Go do it.
By nanny and maid I meant being a SHM, and these women are dependent on a husband. If he dies, she‚Äôs left with nothing, no career to live off of. If he‚Äôs abusive, she can‚Äôt possibly divorce him (not only because it was illegal) but she‚Äôd also be left with nothing. Oh and even when they did have a career, women are always expected to do all the house work and child rearing.
"expected" üòÇ women were not allowed, as we were essentially slaves. Now, women are expected to work & we are focused on the now, not history.
None of those things make men more evolved than women, if that were the case then gorillas and lions and pretty much every other animal would be more evolved than humans lol.
Lol, Y chromosomes are getting smaller and smaller til y'all vanish. Being taller has its disadvantages depending on where you live, being taller also shortens your lifespan. You'll also die sooner even if you're short as a man. Stay mad.
Your ‚Äúgirl‚Äù could most likely do a lot better than you.
Yeah according to these people Andrew Tate is an incel somehow. When people abuse words they lose all meaning.
Seriously it's such a small percentage of actual births.. but this argument is used so much like it actually means something to Antinatalism üòÖ
i wouldn‚Äôt expect a man to be able to empathize with how difficult it is for a woman to be taken seriously and her saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to be actually respected but if trying to flip it around and act like im the misogynist makes you feel better go ahead
You know you've lost the argument when you have to resort to childish antics like "haha u no get sex" lol
We have to take you at your word about your girlfriend unfortunately you're acting more like an incel than a person any woman would want.
üíÄ okay let‚Äôs take claim to that

I say you‚Äôre being an incel and you immediately go ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be I had sex!!‚Äù While also saying woman are easy to control and weak. 

If you don‚Äôt like being called an incel how about a ‚Äúmisogynistic pig‚Äù I‚Äôd ask if your totally real girlfriend knows about your views but let‚Äôs be real. She doesn‚Äôt or she doesn‚Äôt exist

The extinction of species has existed long before humankind and may actually be stopped and even reversed by humanity at some point. Chernobyl was a misstep but on the path to the clean renewable energy we have made and will make in the future using nuclear fission surely it‚Äôs a net positive. As to the destruction of the planet we are most likely in the next hundred years going to be able to deflect world killing asteroids. Name one of your precious animals that can accomplish that. As to war and genocide I‚Äôm surprised a death cultist such as yourself to see that as a negative.
My bad. I interpreted your message wrong.
I understand. Maybe I'm not the "normal" but from day one my dad has taught me to put my mom before my own needs and protect her. I've been taught to provide and be strong for my "future family". 

Personally I feel like I've been born into this world with the expectation that any family or wife I have will be protected and provided for by me. I also feel like any encouragement to search for a career is just so that I earn a specific dollar amount. Again, maybe this isn't the normal, but I cannot count how many times people have asked "so, what's your salary like?".
All of this! Especially if we are talking about conservative countries, that is everything that is not USA or Western Europe.
So women fought for he right to have careers and now you‚Äôre complaining about being expected to be successful in those careers? Even though conservatives are basically fighting to preserve traditional gender roles and have women be stay-at-home moms again. Nobody *expects* women to have successful careers.
Doesn't matter. Spank her ass, anal, pump n dump, boom
Incels are famously raging misogynists. That's the reference. Tate is a raging misogynist. So is that commenter.
[deleted]
It sounds to me more like you simply don‚Äôt understand sarcasm when you see it.
[deleted]
I don‚Äôt actively pursue killing anyone that‚Äôs currently alive. I also don‚Äôt think we should pursue bringing new life in to the world either. Stop reproducing and let the species die out.
No, I reckon you interpreted it right and they are panicking realising their own hypocrisy. Like the original comment they took offense to stated: at least adopt out your kid if it was forced upon you. I in no way blame her for being impregnated by her rapidt and being unable to have an abortion - that is tragic. But, giving it up for adoption is still preferable to raising and resenting the kid.
I'm not complaining about anything, you dolt. I'm stating facts. Women are expected to be successful in their careers & raise children. This is a fact. You can deny it all you want, but you're just denying reality.
Depending on demographics and where you are. Women have always worked it's just that the reward for the work is what women really fought for. Remember, as women, everything they worked for could be taken by the men in their lives. No being able to own property and have say in where the money you earned is a huge deal.
Demographics matter because that 50s ideal the conservatives masterbate over came at the expense of black people and other pocs. As a black woman, all of the women in my family worked. Where did the money go to? My grandad. Literally the employer would send the money the women in the family made to the male relatives.
Incels are all raging mysoginists, nut not all raging mysoginists are incels.
the problem is the men who don‚Äôt take them seriously or listen not that the women aren‚Äôt saying no? women DO say no and have agency but no one respects it because society sees us as subhuman! might be helpful to start there
Okay incel
Just because you said that something is a fact does not make it a fact.
That may be true in the original definition, but the meaning of words changes over time. 

Incel and raging misogynist are now used interchangeably fairly often.
You heard Constable, don't fuck your cat.
I‚Äôm the world‚Äôs first feminist incel.
My Vasectomy is paying off now
I'm a people-pleaser, and my family is afraid of losing me and the advantage of my help in almost every aspect of their lives, including raising their kids. I got a vasectomy a year ago and recently got married. My family has been trying to sabotage our marriage, hoping to see my wife pregnant so we face the responsibilities of raising a child.

They have no idea I had a vasectomy. When I say I don't want kids, they laugh and claim it's my wife's choice. I can't mention my vasectomy, so I let them wait for a child that will never come. It's both amusing and satisfying to see them anticipate a baby that will never arrive.

In my society, vasectomies are not only unacceptable but also largely unknown. This procedure has been my secret weapon, revealing the true nature of my family members over time. They don‚Äôt understand why my wife and I are not having children, and their confusion is a constant source of quiet amusement for me.

Through all this, my wife has been incredibly supportive and understanding about my decision. We are enjoying our marriage without the pressure of children, much to the frustration of my family.
Brilliant!!! They soon will be feeling sorry for you and might send you away to Hawaii, all expenses paid, to help you relax and get down to business!!!  Good luck
Well played!
Them considering it your wife‚Äôs choice is the strangest part of this.
Make sure you check up with your doctor occasionally. Things can grow together again.
Hoping for a husband like this!
You could make it awkward for them. "I'm surprised we haven't gotten pregnant either with how much we try"
This is one of the best things I've ever read on this platform. 

Bravo sir!!
Ohhhhh, I like it! I will probably do the same, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get a relationship anyway.
Love this for you. Let them wait forever and laugh the whole time!!
"When are we getting a grandchild?"

"That's the neat thing, you don't!"
And you are sure your family won‚Äôt come after your wife and blame her for not having a baby? In some cultures this is very common ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I had a vasectomy 4 years ago and now I kinda wish I had kept it to myself. Only sharing it with girlfriends.
Its hard to explain to someone the feeling of this but I know it exactly because I did the same! Maybe the words for it are "poetic justice"? I dont know it just feels great to know it won't happen as other people try to pretend like they know you better than yourself . No I won't change my mind!
While I haven‚Äôt had a vasectomy (I‚Äôm a woman üòÇ) I laughed at the ‚Äúletting them wait for a child that will never come‚Äù. My family is also delusional and refuses to accept that I don‚Äôt want kids so I just sit back and let them talk about their soon to come grandkids. I used to be upset that no one would listen to me but I think now it will be funny to see their world crash down when I‚Äôm 40+ and there are still no kids. Good for you!
You sir, are brilliant!
Haha, honestly well played. I hope your familly will end up getting tired when you both are over 40 and "over the reproducong age".
Hipe you will be able to access your money at some point, can't you keep a little bit of it for you and have a secret account?
Good luck for the time being
I got a lot of joy reading this thank you. ‚ÄúSo I let them wait for a child that will never come‚Äù was my favorite part. HAS to be a sht eating grin on your face everytime they bring it up, I love it.
Damn dude you the real O.G. !
I thought I wanted kids, and then I was a year into my relationship with my ex and I realized that I wanted to spend this lifetime loving my partner only. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be as available, as I see myself wanting to be with my partner, if we had kids to care for as well.
yo wtf, how were they sabotaging you?
Basically they know that wife will be burdened by having kids,and they don't  support your wife's choice even
This post made my day! Well done, sir!
let them rage.
This is honestly hilarious. Good for you OP!
So much respect for you, sir. Well done!!
I remember when I was trying to get one back where I'm from I had to explain doctors what it is and what it's for, and they still were calling it castration, then they referred me to a surgeon that can do it, he said that's the most weird request he heard in his practice and he's only done it twice as a necessity as a part of a different surgery, also that would cost me around $400, even though it's "such a simple procedure, a student could do it". I chickened out, I'm not paying 400 bucks to later find out they thought I want them to cut off my balls or something similar. I chose to get it done after we'd move to Europe, where they know what it is and can do it with a special laser. So I wonder if it was similar for you where you are or better.
[deleted]
Lmao, this post made my day
Love this! Why is it a societal expectation that you‚Äôre going to have kids? It‚Äôs like they think that‚Äôs the only way they‚Äôve arrived in life.
Top lad. Congratulations
Sweet.
W husband and wife !
Freaking hilarious! üò≠
This is absolutely amazing. The fact that they think its all the wife's decision is WILD. 

Have they hounded her about it since they think it's all her?
> They don‚Äôt understand why my wife and I are not having children

ü§®

It's not like they can see what happens inside your bedroom
I can relate. I never wanted kids. But, I didn‚Äôt come right out and say that to my parents. I just let time run out until it was evident that I wasn‚Äôt having any.
With all due respect, your family sounds insufferable. You‚Äôre married now, have your own life/family, (also I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre not living with your parents either), and they still won‚Äôt leave you alone. I‚Äôd just drop off the grid lmao
I love this for you. it‚Äôs very very amusing me for as well lol
Pretty genius plan bro good show
Ok but I hope you also defend your wife against them
Plot twist, "honey I am pregnant."  /joking
Blimey, that's a rollercoaster! Kudos for standing firm on your decision and having a supportive partner by your side. It‚Äôs brilliant you're prioritizing your happiness together. Cheers to enjoying life on your own terms!
Keep a pack of condoms on your bedroom. 

Leak check them and replace them every couple of weeks.
I'm glad you're happy, but I'm confused, they don't want to lose you, or your help, so they're trying to burden you with a child so you'd never have the time to see you or get your help?
This IS the weirdest flex I have ever seen on the internet and I respect it ngl
Is your whole persona your vasectomy lmao, seems like all you post about
please make sure to get consist check ins about it babe! i was a vasectomy baby, and luckily my parents were over the moon, but things do definitely reverse themselves (especially if you‚Äôre young) so just keep up with it :) i‚Äôm happy for you guys, this sounds like yall have a beautiful relationship and i‚Äôm so glad to hear that your shitty family didn‚Äôt stifle your healthy one. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
In the USA, they calculate the average cost of a kid from 0 to 18yo at $233,000.

Your vasectomy is paying off big time!
Satisfying tbh
I do not have a Vasectomy, but i'm assexual and in general aromantic. My mom is always asking when i'm gonna make her a grandmother and every time i say she is not going to be one she is like "oh, you will grow out of this". She does not know about my sexuality since i don't thing she would recive that okay, but it is funny seeing the scene
[removed]
relationship goals
Good move, and absolutely brilliant. Enjoy living your best life, sir!
You can always be like yeah we are trying so much to have this child, but she is just still not pregnant. It‚Äôs good you and your wife agree on the decision regarding the vasectomy. Eventually you can just tell your family that if your wife is pregnant, they will be the first to know.
I did pretty much the same thing. I got a vasectomy though because I used to be promiscuous and I didn‚Äôt want any accidents.  When I got married my wife had a daughter already and didn‚Äôt want any more kids. I never want kids at all. My parents who are extremely old school are waiting for kids that‚Äôll never come. They‚Äôll never know.
I‚Äôm excited for you by this OP. The sweetest revenge.
One day just tell them your wife is pregnant, than wait a month and tell them she lost a baby coz she felt and the trauma from losing a child is too much for you to handle.
the fact they think it's your wife's choice and expect you to basically force her to have a child is disturbing
It will be fine until they start subtly blaming your wife and try to come between you because she can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt give you kids. You should be clear up front that you are in agreement and child-free by choice, don‚Äôt let your wife bear the brunt of the pressure.
Sabotage your marriage?


Are they giving you condoms with holes poked in them? How exactly are they trying to get you to have kids besides being really annoying?
Sadly, your value as a male is the value of you being a provider‚Ä¶. So the more kids you have, the more of your income is available whether you agree to it or not, it could be just being a regular Dad provider or a divorced child support provider‚Ä¶ either way, if that‚Äôs how your family sees you, it‚Äôs a trap..
That is hilarious.¬† Please keep us posted.
But you told your wife‚Ä¶right ?
My GF at the time knew I had a vasectomy when we first started dating...We married after three years and were happy for at least the next ten years until her family and biological clock started creeping into her thoughts...We too had agreed that neither of us wanted kids.  
Fast forward 10 years and she had an affair with her boss with the intention of getting pregnant.. She was successful.  
Marriage ended.   
I hope you dont suffer the same fate
I got a vasectomy after our second child. Don‚Äôt regret it one bit. Love my kids but two was enough.
"It's both amusing and satisfying to see them anticipate a baby that will never arrive" ...I can tell you harbor a lot of resentment toward them for being a people-pleaser.¬† Why not end the cycle of passive-aggressive behavior now and just tell them you're not having a kid because you're choosing not to?¬† Too bad for them, it's your life and it's too short to spend it pissed at your family for them "making" you be a people-pleaser.¬† Take back your power.¬†¬†
Very good!
There's a lot missing here. How are they trying to sabotage you? Why would they do that?
I hope you were honest with your wife and let her know before marriage that the two of you will never have children.
Although i understand your point, i have to point out one important thing.


If decision is yours, and yours only (in the meaning that you really don't want kids), then it is fine. As long as you informed your wife before marriage, and she is on the same page as you are.


However, if this decision is product of relationship with your family, you have a problem. You are degrading your life from hatred towards your family, and this is really bad. Seems you are very affected by your family's oppinions, which means they are affecting your quality of life as well - you are making decisions (small and bigger ones) not thinking of your interest first, but theirs. Fuck that! You can spend 50 years trying to hurt them, but at the end you will get the one who is fucked. 


If this is the case, fuck that family, move away. Family should improve your life, make it better, not turning it to misery.


PS. I don't know your age, but keep in mind things change, and your wife could turn her mind about kids (trust me, it CAN happen very likely). Also, as i heard, some procedures are reversible, so that could be your plan B.
Long-term deception of family members is so dope dude!¬† Antinatalists totally mentally healthy!
I am sorry you will never know the joy of being a parent.
ESH.

there will be 2 things happening:

You will be accused of being gay

Your wife being accused of being sterile

both are not good

You wife eventually spill your secret, so she won't have to face scrutiny
Serious question, I assume your wife knows of the vasectomy? If so, have you considered the chances of this secret being exposed by her? Why not just keep the procedure to yourself?
What a depressing situation on both sides. Passive aggression and resentment are extremely unhealthy and toxic.
Wifey could end up with the baby rabies and bail.
Just fyi. If they‚Äôre the type that truly expects grandkids from you. They may start blaming your wife in the yrs to come.
Imagine this guy thinking he's winning while cheating himself out of the gene pool. He's even raising other people's kids.
Why don‚Äôt you just tell them instead of playing games like a little kid?
Sucker.
It is her decision. You are not needed.
She will find another dick, when the clock tick.
ALL HUMANS SUCKS.
MERELY HUMANS
Why is it malicious of them to want you to have kids?
[removed]
Idiocracy in action
Finally a comment I don‚Äôt relate to . Finally someone else is being brought up .
Dishonesty and sick amusement from their hopes and dreams going unfulfilled? You're a real peach huh
some say not having children is a wasted life. Just having 1 child won‚Äôt increase the population‚Ä¶just saying.
They will be questioning alot of things ü§£
Hmmm, my SO and I are in the same boat. I never thought to milk the secret like this. I'll try for our honeymoon next year XD
Hihihiiii thanks üòà
Yeah cause they don‚Äôt even know what a vasectomy is and they will never be able to think about the idea that I sterilized myself
That‚Äôs the best advice actually, cause yeah you‚Äôll never know what can go wrong , i‚Äôm very careful by default , i do check ups many times per year (2-3 times) , thanks alot
They can?? I had no idea
[removed]
üòÇ
Then say,  it goes in the lower hole right?
I was saying that for 25 years , and now i‚Äôm in a one üòÖ, get one in case .. you‚Äôll never know
They won‚Äôt, they can only be talking to me about that , maybe her family would do that to her , but no mine
That's when you cut them off
Well thanks alot üòå
My dad is literally holding most of my money now just to keep me under his control , that‚Äôs just one thing actually
Exactly üòà
Thanks UuuuuuU ü§ç
It‚Äôs a Muslim thing sooo ‚Ä¶. They think that having a choice to have kids or not is not a thing in the first place, you have to have kids whether you like it or not
They don‚Äôt say a word about that subject to my wife , they know that it will end up very bad from my side , sooo they are just wishing and sometimes giving me bombshells about that subject
I‚Äôm literally living 400 miles away from them and yet they are not giving up , but that won‚Äôt last for long cause all their power comes from my father, and he is dying soon sooo everything will change
I‚Äôll be dead üòÇü§£
They don‚Äôt get to my bedroom , my family are scared of getting caught, i‚Äôm a nerd that have alot of security stuff going on inside my house üòÇ
Naaah , i post about vasectomy with only one account, sooo it just looks like that from the perspective of that one account üòÖüòÇ, and if you are wondering, i have plenty of accounts here , i don‚Äôt why ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Omg thank you sooo much ü§ç, i am checking consistently and i love when i get reminded about it , it‚Äôs sooo much important and most people just ignore it, again thank you so much and i will be checking constantly (many times a year)
And let‚Äôs face it , people are talking only about money , personally i can handle that easily , but money is just a small aspect of raising a child, it‚Äôs actually all about your time and your mental wellbeing, time is the most valuable resource and its worth is sooo much more than money ,AGAIN it‚Äôs all about time and mental wellbeing
Hihihiii yeah i feel like i have a super power by having that procedure done, it‚Äôs a life changing experience
And don‚Äôt ever think about telling her either, avoid that ay any costs, i hate when our parents expect us to suffer like they did just so they can enjoy feeding their egos that they can be somehow gods in this world

Nah dude if they live in a country where they already think like OP described this will result in them blaming the wife and treating her terribly. Not a good idea in context. Also a terrible thing to do to any person who considers life starting from conception even if you disagree with that
Hope you reported them both to their HR department. Nothing like starting a new family while also having to find two new careers!
Yeesss it was the first thing we spoke about that before even being a couple , now I‚Äôm literally an open book for her , and we are in a very healthy relationship üôèüèª
Sooo i‚Äôll make things clear for you , but thank you first , soooo i decided to be childfree from a young age and i always feel like i can‚Äôt accept the idea of me bringing someone to this life , i knew what antinatalism means and it was life a huge discovery for me , i panic when i see people give birth to those innocent babies, i am very gentle with babies and kids by the way and i like making them happy , but i hate the idea of having them in the first place , sooo my family didn‚Äôt made me choose not to have kids just to prove something, i already don‚Äôt want to but the don‚Äôt really know that about me , my wife does know everything about me , i‚Äôm an open book for her , the first thing i mentioned when i knew her was ( i won‚Äôt ever have kids and i already have a vasectomy, and in case you decided to have kids in the future then we will simply get a divorce) she said yes deal , we have a very healthy relationship by the way and she is like my copycat
Unfortunately they don‚Äôt even know what antinatalism means .
I raised 3 kids already, and when i said i raised, i know every aspect about that (being a parent) thing , trust me it‚Äôs not my choice in life at all
Why wrong sub
I beg to differ. Op is smart. He and his wife sound like a loyal unit. In my opinion, after his father dies, he will be able to access the money his father is withholding from him. If the rest of his family behaves as you suggest, I think Op and his wife will move away. It might be unlikely that they would react that way because they heavily depend on him.
They can just say that they're facing reproductive challenges.
Being gay or sterile are both not bad.
If Op told her, it means he trusts her. After all it's important in a relationship
People tell their spouses when they do surgery to not have babies. It's quite a prerequisite to both be on board about having kids or not.
Welcome to East Asian/Asian/ Muslim family.
I wish i was the kid here , they are the ones that are acting like psychopaths, my father is that type of person who will point his gun at you to solve problems and i mean it , and the problem is that he can cover himself even legally because of corruption here , what would you do in this situation ü•≤

Imagine getting this upset that someone isn't producing kids against their will for their abusive parents. You're a real peach huh? If you hate them this much why would you even want them to be parents at all? Why do their parents' oh so important "hopes and dreams" hinge on having grandkids, why aren't they satisfied with the children THEY created?
Some say that people should live life as they see fit.
Some say that i‚Äôm a selfish bustard üòÇ and i like that ‚Ä¶.. just saying‚Ä¶.
That‚Äôs your opinion dude. Shocking I realize that not all of us want children to you.
Just because people say something doesn't mean it is even remotely close to true. For example, you just said having a child won't increase the population. *Yeah, adding +1 to the population is an increase.*
Not trying to out you, but I'm guessing India? Also welcome to the snipped club. I'm a 9 year member. My mother was absolutely furious when she found out, and my family is American with Irish grandparents.
Eventually you can, sadly, tell them you're sterile so they somehow blame themselves for that happening.
That is even stranger.
The‚Äôll eventually assume it‚Äôs God‚Äôs will. üòÇ
Saying that it is your wife's call such a shitty threat. Imagine thinking a healthy relationship looks like one partner deciding for the other to have children.
Does your wife know?
You're welcome.

Stay strong. And please never tell anyone.

Things can turn sour real fast.

I'm happy that you are that smart. I know so many guys that got ruined by it. 

They wanted maybe 1 kid. Their wife wanted more. At that point you either have to end the relationship because your partner is going to resent you for the rest of your life or give in an raise multiple kids and be a working slave forever.
Yes, they usualy don't take too much in case the patient wants to reverse it.
Imagine the surprise of people that got their spouse pregnant, after thinking they are in the clear.
I‚Äôm still single at 32, don‚Äôt look promising
You need better families. Idk why Reddit recommended me this subreddit as I have kids,  but I was with my wife for 8 years before having kids and no one in my family pressured us to have kids before we were at the place were we wanted them.
thats so fucked, how old are you? is there anything you can do legally?
YOUR MONEY‚ÅâÔ∏è
Could y'all take a pregnancy for the money or would they keep the money until the kid is born lol¬†
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt realize that. That‚Äôs absolutely horrible‚Ä¶women are not baby making machines that only made it in life if they pop out kids.
Tbh, it be like that sometimes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Good luck!!
you‚Äôre so welcome!! i‚Äôm so proud of you my fellow internet stranger! congrats on everything ü•πü§ç
That's true. Here's more from my own perspective...

Personally, I'm very glad for mine. I had one son and I got the snip. I'm not a man who loves spending hours and hours raising kids, and I feel indirectly blessed for my divorce, because I saw my son every other Fri to Sun and loved my freedom otherwise. 

I'll never have another. You couldn't pay me enough to do so. In 3 years, he'll be out of high school and I'll be totally free once again. I plan to move to a less densely populated place in a better climate.
Sadly there is no HR Dept. He is the property owner and she is the property manager.   
Joke is on them .....They never married, She took him to the cleaners on child support and she and her baby contracted hiv from him.   
She got nothing from our divorce
In that case, do what you feel is good for you, take care of your wife, and enjoy life :) Not that it matters, but i completely respect your decision, and support it!
[removed]
Exactly, in my case it‚Äôs a Muslim country and from north Africa ü•≤
Unless he‚Äôs very good with that gun he can‚Äôt shoot your vasectomy away.
I‚Äôm literally cracking up at how dumb this guy is üòÇ he thinks a human vasectomy is the same as when a dog gets it‚Äôs balls chopped off Omg LMAO

Do as you please lol, only time will tell if that decision you made was right.
Over time it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a decrease because you die.¬†
Those cursed cows in the Dowry are the culprit!
And it isn't even a lie too.
That‚Äôs what I wondered. They will begin to blame and resent her, which would be messed up.
Yes
She will when she finds out she's pregnant
Having kids is (should be) a ‚Äútwo yes one no‚Äù situation. If one of you wants one and the other wants more, you have one. It ridiculous people having kids knowing they aren‚Äôt actually wanted by one parent. It‚Äôs so sad.
What do you define "too much," out of curiosity? I'd say the doctor took about a 15-20mm section out of each side on me, and cauterized them. I struggle to imagine them just naturally growing back together on their own.

No issues in three years, but due to steroids my sperm count was already undetectable with home tests before the surgery anyway, so that kind of makes it more difficult to know whether the surgery is holding up.
The most important thing is being happy and fulfilled, i don‚Äôt see marriage as something important at all , in fact i still support single people, cause being single in a form of strength nowadays.
Still young.
Same.  My wife and I were married 12 years (together 17) before our first kid. 

Both my family and my wife's immediate family were always chill about it, pretty much just never got discussed after right around the wedding - we got married pretty young for my generation and I think they were all just relieved that any plan for the kids was 'much later, if we can afford it' and not something we planned to do in the near future at 25.

Some of my wife's more distant relatives, however, were utter shits about it.  Literally had one of her mom's cousins tell us that we weren't really married because we weren't trying for kids.   Luckily not people we had to see every year or anything like that.
I can do nothing but waiting for my father to die , he is way passed his life expectancy now and he already started to experience some nasty symptoms of a heart attack or cardiac arrest, sooo I don‚Äôt have to wait that long ( and yes my father is sooo abusive to the point where i sound like a psycho when i talk about his death)
He‚Äôs just keeping the money for unknown reasons, he is rich as hell and this money is nothing compared to what he has, it‚Äôs around 300k dollars and i can‚Äôt fight to get it under my control now , all i can do is wishing that he will die soon
Wondering this too lmao. Go all out OP! If he‚Äôs that abusive, fuck him
You made my day ü´∞üèº
I feel you , when i said i don‚Äôt wanna have kids they always say :it‚Äôs impossible, cause i love making kids feel happy and joyful, especially my nieces and nephews, but i don‚Äôt encourage people to have kids cause all people nowadays seems careless about their kids especially the ones who are brainwashed with those creepy YouTube videos. I don‚Äôt wanna bring a child into this mess and if i do by mistake or something i‚Äôll be taking care cause it‚Äôs my responsibility unfortunately. 
I‚Äôm sooo happy for you , this feeling of the freedom that you are experiencing is worthless and amazing ü§ç, it‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ peace üå¥

Hilarious....but do you know how many men fucking think that!?
I‚Äôd like to assume she‚Äôs on board with the plan
Yes, she‚Äôs in on it.
Nahhh
Im sorry, im confused. 

A two yes one no?
You're really cool. Don't let your family bring you down. You can stop trying to be a people pleaser small - set little boundaries like you can't be called at x day because you're busy and leave your phone on silent.
Nah you aren't psycho some people are just that brutal they drive you to thinking that way

He said she is.
If one person says no it‚Äôs a no. You need both people to say yes for it to be a yes.
I really must work on myself , i messed up alot about being tooo much available throughout my life, but i‚Äôll get things right eventually and i love the process of doing that , i feel free now being (‚Äúbusy ‚Äú)
There it is! Haha
Yep I I really Schruted this one
That makes sense, and also, agreed. 

I think Patient-Cow and I got confused because we thought you were referring to a three-party situation where two of the three‚Äôs consent was needed to make sure it‚Äôs okay (we filled it in as two yes **and** one no), as opposed to deciding based on unanimous consent or the lack thereof (two yes **or** one no).

My wife made me a Twin Peaks cake for my birthday 
This is‚Ä¶.excuse me, a damn fine birthday cake 
She‚Äôs dead, wrapped in fondant
A little dead Laura Palmer wrapped in clingfilm! How adorable!
Shamelessly stealing this to make for my wife as a ‚Äúthank you for taking care of the family while my body sucks‚Äù isolation return gift.
So cute!
Omg it's so awesome xD
Is Laura's dead body edible?
A damn fine wife!
What an amazing wife!!!
You should marry her for the 2nd time
It's so great! What are the tree trunks made of?
True love üòç what kind of cake?
![gif](giphy|3ohfFwrEEf4kobba6c|downsized)
Nice! By those proportions, Laura is gigantic, but I love it.
Twin Peaks fans have the best girlfriends!
https://i.redd.it/1ujsmw4ii5td1.gif
She really likes you
LAURAAAA
Do not ever take this woman for granted!
Nailed it
This is so cute!
Your wife really loves you.
Hope you‚Äôre a wife guy for the rest of your lives. This is magnificent and so thoughtful of her
Marry that woman!!!! Oh, wait‚Ä¶
Omg, the plastic üòÇ
The lonesome foghorn blows
Awwww she even got the little Laura Palmer wrapped in plastic?! That‚Äôs friggin‚Äô awesome! üòÇü•πü•≤üî•
Well I know what I'm doing next year
Awesome!  CAKE WALK WITH ME!!
Haha lol. I was about to ask what that thing that looks like plastic was supposed to be‚Ä¶
No shade but this looks like one of those sand zen gardens for a desk with the little rakes except a stoner has used it as an ashtray
I cackled
She‚Äôs actually a toothpick wrapped in paper towel and plastic! I‚Äôm keeping her as a memento
Cinnamon sticks!!
Chocolate chip! I‚Äôm a huge cookie guy so my wife delivered the goods for sure!
Yum sounds delicious
Hahaha nice!
Amazing.  I love it.
i'm gonna eat her anyway. I dont care.
Happy birthday btw‚ò∫Ô∏è
My cinnamon stick does not judge.
You two seem disgustingly cute.
Aww you guys are goals üòç
That's just a little too far. This just feels like coercion.
I'm not an antinatalist myself, but I respect your choices. You shouldn't be punished economically for your decision to not have kids. 
The fuck. Breeders already get tax breaks for their kids and he wants to punish people for not having kids on top of that?
But childless people do pay more taxes because they don‚Äôt have dependents to claim.
The breeders already get child tax credits, so child-free people are already paying more.
I got an idea. People that fuck couches should pay higher taxes.
The childfree already pay more in taxes. By way of the child tax credit.
So they're mad at people who have kids they can't afford, but they're also mad that people stopped having kids they can't afford, so they're going to make people who already can't afford kids poorer???
I don't understand how anyone could be in favor of right-wing politics. They're completely insane!
Uhhh, we fucking do pay higher taxes because we have no deductions‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt deduct my dog‚Äôs daycare/food expenses ü´†
That's right-wing politics for you, they believe the "natural order" of things to be so inevitable it has to be enforced by state law, at the detriment of literally everyone
I can't comprehend this stupidity.
He‚Äôs really obsessed with kids to an unhealthy degree. Someone should take a look at his hard drive.

EDIT: Plus he‚Äôs gay, so maybe he thinks all the kids he‚Äôs swallowed should count as votes.
And said people who don‚Äôt have kids shouldn‚Äôt be able to vote.
I mean how would they achieve this?

Men can practically produce sperm until their 50s?

Women reach menopause in their 40s?

So, how will they know will stay childfree and who will reproduce? Or will they just start taxing anyone above 30 without kids? Boy, will they get obliterated if they do that.
Or, will they increase taxes on senior citizens without kids? That will just be sad.
Childless and single people already pay higher taxes than families. An elected official ought to know that.
So my taxes are paying for public schools I‚Äôll never use / burden but I need to pay more still?
We already are punished for not having children by having higher taxes. Not getting the same tax credits people with children get is equivalent to paying more in taxes.
So we would get less votes and more taxes? Sounds like a civil unrest would brew from that. Especially since there should be "NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION"
What happens if childless people refuse to work and be taxed? No doubt they would use the immigrants to prop the economy up. At some point even immigrants would leave and bring the money elsewhere..
Uhm most of us single individuals are already paying more than families
Ew, that‚Äôs disgusting. What a slap in the face to those that want kids, but can‚Äôt have them too.
Well of course he said that. Conservatives are in their "comically evil" arc here in the US. And globally tbh.
His obsession with childfree people, especially childfree women is just weird. 

Like who the fuck hurt this guy? He's OBSESSED. It's WEIRD.
Don‚Äôt we already have this when we claim our dependents on our taxes for child credit?
In regards to a tax on childlessness, the infamous tyrant Nicolae Ceausescu actually did this when he was in charge of Romania. Much to no one's surprise, this caused an explosion in unwanted children and orphanages became overcrowded all throughout the country very quickly.
Why do childless women bother this man SO MUCH? 

From the looks of his hillbilly horseshit, it would‚Äôve been beneficial in his family if some of the women didn‚Äôt have kids.
So were gonna tax people who are medically unable to havr kids?

Taxes based upon medical descrimination is a odd flex. But ok. See how much taxes you get.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_on_childlessness


Just tell them it is communism and they'll change their minds /s
Thats so ridiculous, choosing to not have children is equally as valid as choosing to have children. "Encouraging" people to procreate via increased taxes on thos who are child free, like you said OP, sounds more like coercing people into procreating.
That‚Äôs what it is. Coercion.
Eewwww, I‚Äôm a republican who thinks no one should have kids
Out of all the crazies,  Trump had to pick him?!
If anyone should pay more it's those with children, those kids are getting benefits tax-free and are putting a burden on the system.

They won't be made to pay taxes until 18 years later IF they even start working at 18, meanwhile they're gonna be a drain on the system for at minimum 18 years...
Proj. 2025 talks about punishing single mothers. He‚Äôs also made statements that under women should stay in abusive relationships for the kids.
This is just one more way for the ruling class to steal from the people they've already deeply wronged. 

Eat the rich.
It‚Äôs just weird that he feels being childless is a punishable behavior.
you will pay for breeders creatures and be happy
Ummm, I already carry a larger tax burden than those with children, and more than half of my property taxes supports a school district that I do not and never will have children in.  Oh I also pay more because of being single.  How dare I not marry and reproduce.  Maybe I‚Äôll stop working altogether, game the system somehow to survive and they can go on without ANY of my tax dollars.  Fucking unbelievable.
If this somehow becomes reality, I know how we can counter this. Change pets status to become dependents. Tax breaks for every cat mom and dad.
Or, we could make it more "equal." If someone has say, more than three children - single births, by choice - they get to pay higher taxes. I think it makes more sense to tax people higher amounts if they choose to have children or "too many" {6, 7, 8 + kids) of them.

*They're* the ones increasing the carbon footprint, putting more kids in poverty (because *somebody's* children will not be middle or upper middle class, be born in war zones, not have access to birth control, be in poverty; be abused to death or severe disability before they are 5; *someone* always gets the particularly short stick in life).

*They're* the ones bringing in new wage slaves, the "matrix" (depending on one's beliefs) to a planet that's glaciers are melting, where jobs to secure basic needs are hard to find, where college is no longer about knowledge or getting a career.

Tax all the Vances.

*I'm* the one doing people, the planet, and my future non-existent children a big favor by being Childfree and an Anti-Natalist.
Ppl that don‚Äôt have kids are already fucking taxed more! They get tax breaks and shit.
You need endless (population) growth in order for capitalism to work.

Take housing, if there are fewer people (who need places to live) then the inventory piles up and the prices will drop.

And RTO efforts are to justify commercial real estate valuations beyond in-person micromanagement.

Lots of concepts exist and continue simply because most of us agree on them.

"Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcomes."
Nothing new. They (natalists) are expected to behave in this way of course.


The thing is that we can see that procreation has ever been the goal of many kingdoms throughout history and with such a goal in mind, they will do anything to achieve that unfortunately. One of the methods they used back then was the church publishing "gods word" to "be fruitful and multiply", because this benefitted the greedy kings of those times.


We see the same here, but instead of kings we got politicians and other elites in higher places who benefit from procreating slaves.


The peasants and other poor people of those times were probably antinatalistic because they had suffered and/or had no food to spare for their children. These antinatalists of that time were a problem for the vain and meaningless growth of a kingdom because they did not contribute to the growth of the cancer tumor called kingdom. They even accused these people who did not want to breed mindlessly of heresy towards god and told them if they did not procreate as god wanted, they would face divine punishment. üôÉ


And I do not really need to tell you what sickening methods they used for "heretics" who opposed god by not being fruitful and multiplying.
What about infertile people who can't have kids? Or gay people. Or trans people. Shit is so fucked up.
tf, this guy should be behind bars.

imagine all the child abusers getting less tax than actual decent human beings that happen to not have children, how can he argue that lol?

edit: in a way he is indirectly advocating for child abuse.
Vance is a fascist piece of shit who has no business being anywhere near government.
‚ÄúOh, these forward thinking problem solvers think not having infinite dependents will lessen the burden on our over populated production based economy that can ‚Äúbarely handle‚Äù the population we have currently, instead blaming and upcharging the consumer for having the same lunch hour as most of the general public? Well screw them, if they don‚Äôt burden themselves with extra humans to feed, house and give time to, then they should have to be at a disadvantage too!‚Äù -the worst kind of people.
Hope Trump keeps this arrogant little shit on the ticket. Dumb stuff like this could make the difference.
They're all, "hey, let's make sure everyone suffers, except very wealthy people."
What about people who are disabled or unable to have kids? They will tax them harder too?
Why do people hate childfree people so much? It just shows they aren't actually pro life but anti choice.
Why would i wanna bring kids into a world where JD Vance exists?
Because they view us as slaves we are literally in an open range pen! They need more workers to continue being in power.
Funny, I thought the Republicans were all about lowering taxes for people (I know they're lying, shut up), then they pull shit like this and their constituents couldn't be happier. 

Truly, the Party of Hypocrites.
This is NUTS considering that people with kids already get tax breaks. I legit got 4K for my daughter last year. People who don‚Äôt have children shouldn‚Äôt be punished like this, it‚Äôs fucking evil.
This is some Hitler shit
This implies that he believes that the high expense of having children in the US is correct. Like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre already punishing them so you deserve it too‚Äù. üôÑ
Ah yes, because people already can't afford to raise kids, we should punish those who don't have kids so when people are trying to, it's even harder to prepare to have them ahead of time.

The logic is astonishing.
Childfree people like us are ALREADY paying more taxes than people with screechers because they can claim dependents and get tax breaks and all these ridiculous privileges. No thank you.
Welp. Time to vote blue.
What? It should be the exact opposite. Having Kids almost always means you are making more use of what public taxes pay for.
Coercion? More like Nazism
Just because my "pursuit of happiness" doesn't involve children doesn't mean I and those like me deserve to be punished.
Eugh. Fuck off. These people view people with uteruses as incubators and nothing else.
Force them to have kids or pay higher taxes. Sounds about on par for republicans
Lmao, and the people who incapable of having children? What is the cutoff age? Younger than 18 and older than 45?? How about taxing the rich and including trust funds in the taxing? Crypto is taxable now, why not trust funds?

Or how about increasing the funds for childcare? No? Too logical? Well i tried

I dont think anyone is ever gonna have children at this rate...
Wait if a fertilized egg is a baby and I have 1,000 of them frozen, my earned income credit is gonna be fucking STELLAR!
I suggest a much higher tax rate on inbred hillbillies.
Someone tell him that immigrants have more kids than native population. I bet he will change his mind immediately
Yeahhhh theres a long standing tradition of religious zealots wanting to flood the country with as many bodies as possible to out number and out power any other group. Same with pseudo-intellectuals with the stupidest glasses you've ever seen. Furthermore the economy relies on a hefty underclass and a population of disposable soldiers and you can't have that without incentivizing the poors to have children they cannot afford nor even want.
1. People with children already get tax deductions that are not available to people without children.

2. If they want to avoid lawsuits for discrimination based on medical conditions (i.e. infertility), they‚Äôll have to figure out how to implement a way to individually evaluate who is childfree by choice and who does not have a choice. This would be next to impossible to do. Many people don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre infertile until they start trying in their 30‚Äôs. So every year there would be people filing for a change in infertility status. The cost of administering such a law would be more than the increased tax revenue. Also, if someone has been sterilized prior to the law, does it still apply to them?  It‚Äôs not like they had any information about this law prior to making the choice to be sterilized. What about those who are childless/childfree and past menopause?  Should they be subject to this law?  Does this apply to biological children only?  And how can any of this be accomplished without violating HIPAA? 

4. If your children are no longer dependents, you will need to prove that they exist. Again, a costly administrative process. 

3. What a cruel joke to people who really want kids and can‚Äôt have them.
What the fuck with this guy?!?
We already pay more in taxes. Breeders get to write off their children, and much more. I think I lose approximately 32% on taxes‚Ä¶ never get shit back.
Well yeah. If poor people don't breed, who will produce the profits for the rich? Gotta keep the men working nonstop until they die and keep the women barefoot and pregnant
If the peasants don't have kids who will be peasants for MY kids üò¢
I physically cant have kids, fuck this whacko forced birther couch humper.
This couch fucker doesn't have a hope. We are not going back.
If anything is going to motivate me to vote for the Democrats as an anarchist who swore off voting, it‚Äôs *this* fucker.
So we're taxing everyone except the rich?
We already get taxed higher.
Vance seems like the type of guy who probably created Gilead in The Handmaid's Tale.
Wtf we already pay more taxes than ppl with kids? I know a woman who has 4 kids, has never had a job in her life and got a 12k tax return?!?! Tell me how that makes sense.
This is some white nationalist, Nazi shit.
Imagine you‚Äôre infertile and you read this shit
We already pay more taxes.  Child tax credit is 2k per kid per year
I‚Äôll just continue not having kids.

There‚Äôs no way he could legally tax us anywhere close to the yearly cost of having a kid.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you pay 3,000 extra dollars a year in hopes you‚Äôll agree to paying upwards of $50,000 more a year by adding a dependent‚Äù 

How does that make sense?
Capitalists are threatened by a global population declining over thr coming decades.

Capitalism is a pyramid scheme, but endless growth is impossible.
Conservatives are obsessed with children and the female reproductive system. It‚Äôs just creepy.
Forcing the younger generation to have kids is just a all time low. Even if some may be the cause for a decrease in birth rate in America. They should always have a choice. Especially if they contribute a lot to society. Forcing somebody to take care of something they don't want to take care of could have negative effects
it is coersion. japan and korea had (idk if they still have this so im using past tense) and a lot of womens rights organizations protested these laws. the government did this to encourage the birthrate to increase since their birthrate is so low and they needed worker.

i truly believe this is why they banned abortion in US. they want more women having children to increase amount of workers and makeup for low birthrates. i suspect the religious reasonings is just a coverup, bcus most politicians are unethical as fuck and use religion only when it suits them.
Yeah, because what the world really needs is more encouragement for people to have unwanted children.
This is the strangest take I‚Äôve ever seen. He‚Äôs a fucking idiot
Small government, eh?
The impact of a rapidly declining birth rate is starting to worry many capitalists. Lower populations increases competition for Labour rising wages, but also results in fewer consumers. 

The benefits for the environment - however - are monumental.
VOTE
That is insane! They‚Äôre not even trying to hide their agenda anymore. They want this in addition to taking away women‚Äôs health care choices? Why dont they just say they want the American people to be desperate, poor, and to feed their capitalistic dream? 

If they really loved children so much, they would provide better childcare and health care for children and parents - maybe  that would encourage people to have children. 

And obvi, leave childfree people out of all of that.
Also, if someone has a child with someone, then divorces and marries someone else, does only the current couple "have a child"? Do only the biological parents count as having a child? Do all 3 "have a child"? 
Do people who adopt not count? Do people who cant procreate not count? Do people who are in a relationship with someone who cant procreate not count?

If you have a frozen fertilized embryo somewhere, does that count? If you have a child that was taken by the state because you were an unfit parent, does it still count?
We're **already** paying taxes for stuff we don't use like schools and parks (we don't personally use all 10k+ throughout the country). If anything *we're* subsidizing all the *BioHoarders*.
Nah, the funny, bald, upside down man did that in Italy too.   
We know how he ended up tho
Fuck me for being gay I guess
Well, isn't that already the case? I mean, children can be used to take a tax deduction as a dependent.
The Tax thing is punishment. The getting extra voting percentages? That's the coercion!!
People who have children already get tax breaks. Kamala Harris is literally running on giving them even more benefits (which I agree with, even though I don‚Äôt plan on having children). We virtually eliminated child poverty during Covid, and it cost virtually nothing in the grand scheme of things, but of course the Republicans said, ‚Äúnah, fuck that.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt actually give a shit about children, or want to make it easier for people to raise children. He literally wants to punish people (i.e. RAISE taxes) on people who choose to not reproduce.

The levels of irony we‚Äôve gotten to are through the roof at this point, and JD Vance might be one of the most disgusting VP candidates we‚Äôve seen in our lifetimes. If your father rapes you when you‚Äôre 12 and you get pregnant, he wants to have a special task force to make sure you can‚Äôt travel out of state to get an abortion. Then, once you have the kid, he wants to put the entire burden on the mother. And don‚Äôt even think of giving the child up for adoption; he‚Äôs been going after Kamala for not having children, despite the fact that she is the stepmother of two (former) children, so apparently that doesn‚Äôt count for him.

Personally, I think people should be taxed MORE for every child they have past the first two.
I'm surprised he wasn't supporting forced pregnancy of all women who can.
some of us are out here not having kids because we can‚Äôt afford them and they want to punish us by making us even more less able to afford them. okay.
I‚Äôm not even antinatalist but this is such a horrendously tone deaf statement that it should genuinely scare EVERYONE away from having kids
People with no children already get taxed at a higher rate - people with children get a child tax credit, ie. taxed at a lower rate.
It is coercive as a point. He‚Äôs saying what capitalists want out loud- more humans in the work force and inevitably more poverty-induced crime to fill prisons for that workforce.  If you‚Äôre not contributing to the most important resource to capital (humans) then you aren‚Äôt doing ‚Äúyour part‚Äù as far as they‚Äôre concerned.
We already do pay higher taxes. We get zero child tax refunds. So the refunds parents get I pay for that with my taxes. What a dumb idiot.
Aside from the obvious, what about infertile couples?
Do they really aim for every childfree or childless person to flee the country? Cos it truly seems like their endgame.
Fucking breeders, man. Insufferable.
Uhh we already are paying higher taxes. Does he just not know anything about how our tax system works?
Get out and vote!
Trump is gonna choke the life out of Vance if he doesn‚Äôt shut the fuck up soon. I know that really turns Vance on but he needs to pull it back he shooting their stupid little campaign in the foot at a really bad time.
How to make someone antinatalist 101, what the fuck?
Child free people are funding schools and programs they don‚Äôt use and he wants them to pay an extra tax on top of that? Completely fucked. I hope everyone on here is voting Kamala.
lol yeah all those people with disabilities and infertility, as well as asexual people, should have even more financial hardship.
My son is 35, does that still count?
Aaannnndddd now its time to talk about revolution again...
There's already tax credits for people with kids ü§î
I‚Äôm child free but god this would be such a slap in the face to people who actually do want kids and can‚Äôt have ghem
Imagine getting punished for living a stress-free lifestyle
Hey man just cause you hate your kids doesn‚Äôt mean you should impose that on everyone else.
Ahaha he is real christian jihadist
But what‚Äôs to get rid of ivf. Ok
This is why Republicans gotta go‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the Civil War and these eff are evil fascists‚Äî-if they can impose their insane religion on us, we can impose our antenatalism on them
How bout the fact that me and my wife couldn‚Äôt have kids if we wanted to, she has terminal cancer, should we be punished for something that is out of the range of choice all together for us? (Not saying we want kids just saying that‚Äôs some of the consequences to a choice like this that they might try to implement)
It's the least surprising thing ever. Voting Republican is a vote to make America into Gilead
They are already punished with higher tax rates. They are paying into schools and social programs for parents and kids even though they don't have any.
Bruh I‚Äôm poor I can‚Äôt afford kids don‚Äôt make me even more poor with extra taxes üíÄ
I already pay a higher tax rate.  I don't have child deductions.
Because the government needs those future tax payers.
This is ridiculous. So, is the 25 year old who isn‚Äôt ready to have kids yet gonna be penalized? Is the couple who are facing fertility issues are aren‚Äôt able to have kids going to be penalized? Are the poor people who aren‚Äôt financially able to afford kids, whether they want them or don‚Äôt, going to be penalized? Are the mentally unwell people who aren‚Äôt mentally able to raise children because of their disease going to be penalized? And are the millions of Americans who made a personal decision to not have kids for whatever reason gonna be penalized for this? It‚Äôs already unfair that childless people have to pay school taxes.
And this, children, is why professional politicians vet their vice presidential candidates.
They also argue people with kids should get a vote for every kid they have until that kid turns 18.

These people hate democracy and want a dictatorship. 

Trump wasn't memeing,  he was telling you how it is. They cheered as he said he'll destroy our democracy.
His mom shouldn't have had him.

The GOP wants to ban contraception. Make sure you are registered to vote and SHOW UP ON NOVEMBER 5TH OR BEFORE. Don‚Äôt get complacent just because current polls seem to be looking up. We need to show up and show that we reject an authoritarian regime that wants to force women into pregnancy and motherhood. https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/
Doesn‚Äôt having children give you a tax break? Adults without children are already paying more.
This is stupid, technically we should pay LESS because we don't have children enrolled in any school public or private, and all the things that come with childcare. NOT saying i wouldnt fund school systems at all, but im saying if i dont have a kid in those systems then why would i be paying more than someone with several kids needing books, tech, sports?
We already pay property taxes out the ass for the schools we'll never use. Never complained because education is important and benefits everybody.

Once got into an argument with some asshat online, who was opposed to child-free marriage. Said it was wrong for couples to get tax breaks without having kids ü§®Well what's wrong with incentivizing marriage? We were able to invest in a house, which generates property taxes, and combines our incomes so we can boost the economy.
We "childless folk" are already carrying a heavier tax burden than those with children. Folks who have zero kids and are not married have higher taxable income than even childless married couples. 

One would think that **JD RUXPIN** would check his sources! We know he couldn't have done it without his "authorial godmother," Amy Chua, his CONTRACT LAW professor. And I'm sure she highly encouraged him to do his due diligence. Or...

Maybe it's all a lie. JD RUXPIN üíô's BS.
Vance ‚Äî who also said many nasty things about his king chump ‚Äî is part of Project 2025.
It‚Äôs the platform that the maggots will try to bring to life IF chump were to win in November.
Vance et al wants a theocracy ‚Äî with chump at the helm ‚Äî they want to create a society where only white, maggot-christians survive & where everyone else is broken down & stripped of everything they have.
If U are not a white, uber rich, twisted whackado ‚Äúchristian‚Äù ‚Äî where women‚Äôs rights don‚Äôt matter ‚Äî then U will be tossed into the pile of unimportant, unseen dead.  Their vision is reminiscent of the Hunger Games.
READ Project 2025!
It is their platform.  
We must STOP them.
We can & we will stop them.
We already pay a crazy high amount. Pretty soon they‚Äôre gonna tax us so much we will owe our employers.
People with no children are already "punished" by paying taxes which pay for schools for people who do have children.
One of the few areas I agree with the perennially annoying antinatalist crowd (I consider myself natalism-ambivalent): Those without children already subsidize those with children MASSIVELY and in many ways, including ones that do NOT get reflected on the country's balance sheet. Enough is enough, they need to pay for their own choices.
wait but people with no kids have to pay taxes for school and other things to support people who have kids. and the people who have kids get tax breaks already????
It‚Äôs worse. Vance thinks children should have the right to vote from birth, but their parents get to cast their vote by proxy until they turn 18.  So those Quiverfull nutcases with 20 kids get to cast 22 votes until their kids are old enough to vote on their own.
As if we‚Äôre all not already poor enough.
So basically screw us if we want to choose what life we want. Can‚Äôt get abortions, okay cool won‚Äôt have sex, can‚Äôt not have children? Mfer what do you want??????????
The dumbest thing of all? If you have kids, you get a tax deduction.
The fuck ?? Breeders should be taxed more
Yeah, JD Vance is‚Ä¶interesting, to say the least
I'm not necessarily an antinatalist (though I support y'all), but now I'm punished for having no rizz :(

Lmao wtf
This is pure lies and fabrication.
They be like: if we are suffering then they should suffer too. Really pathetic.
Maybe spend some more time working on the carrots before you bring out the sticks...
The birthrate is so low the economy IS going to eventually crash. Which is probably the only thing that will pop the ridiculous housing bubble.
Dude must have a preggo fetish
Also, if someone has a child with someone, then divorces and marries someone else, does only the current couple "have a child"? Do only the biological parents count as having a child? Do all 3 "have a child"?

Baffling why this would be the issue he champions.

I really wanna beat the shit outta that guy
As a parent, it's one of the dumbest things I've heard all week, and I've heard a lot of dumb shit this week.
Umm don‚Äôt they know a huge reason folks aren‚Äôt having kids is because of lack of funds??? This will make it worse tf
We already do.  They get tax credits for dependents. Irc there are other child tax credits.
Fuuuuuccckkkklkk yyyyyooooooooouuuuuuu
Fuck a couch, vonce
To cover the cost of all the kids we aren't sending to public school?
That‚Äôs so stupid. Children are important to a society, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should force people to have kids in order to keep their money! If every American adult had at least one child we would be absolutely fucked.
If we're childfree, can we stop paying taxes that benefit schools.  USA.
I don‚Äôt understand how this helps them either. This doesn‚Äôt disincentivize childlessness as having children is still just as difficult, this makes it harder for young people building their lives to get stable enough to have children. The only explanation is that these people are so detached from the reality of young working Americans that they think this is a good idea
What's with Republicans and unhinged VP picks?
What is his problem with people who choose or don't choose to have kids? Does he not realize there are some people who desperately want kids, but have yet to have any?
the stupid people only understand not being able to do something

its been a driving force of progress for a while

we keep doing this basically so we can halfass die in peace

the irony
Such policies make sense for states with low birthrates (like Japan), too not have their GDP collapse, but are in my view still morally wrong.
We already are because we can't claim the child deductions.  JCOAPS!  J.D. Vance is a fucktwit.
Either he doesn‚Äôt understand taxes or he doesn‚Äôt care.
Yeah no, that alone Is worth not voting for.
this makes no sense‚Ä¶what if your children are adults, and too old to be dependent upon you? you can only claim children on your taxes for so long‚Ä¶what if they have died? 

the fuck is this about???
We already get punished for not being married‚Ä¶
Even by non-antinatalist, maybe even outright natalist, standards, that's simply absurd policy.

That'd incentivize procreation by "bad parent" types of people, all so they can get a few bucks back from the IRS. How *that* promotes real, respectable family values is beyond me.  Shady Vance acts like he's never heard the saying "quality over quantity". 

Speaking of quality of childhood, it's less bad to have a world of 0.8 billion people who have a realistically humane physical quality of life with a health environment than to have our current situation (not saying this is my actual core true-to-me viewpoint. I'm just addressing this from our critics p.o.v.).
what the absolute fuck?
[removed]
JD Vance is Sarah Palin with a beard.
Raising children is hard and society has an interest in helping parents do it.  Normal people think that that's a reason for government financial (WIC, free-school lunch, etc...) and logistical supports (after-school programs, summer programs, etc...) for parents and children.  Right-wingers are so opposed to government support for people though that the only way they can think of "helping parents" is punishing childless people.  Truly deranged.
Semi-serious, I wouldn't be as upset if it heavily promoted adoption and community child raising. But this is obviously a religious dog whistle to rile the drones.
What happens when your kids turn 18?
Surely taking away people‚Äôs rights and raising their taxes will cause them ti have more kids and not leave the country
They are.
Under His Eye
Childless Americans don‚Äôt have dependent children that suck up tax dollar resources. How is this remotely fair that they should pay MORE taxes than those people with children?
I think it should be the opposite, lower taxes / give benefits to people who have kids.
Yikes. Don't like that. I'm childless not by choice, but because I'm infertile. It seems harsh to punish people like that. üò¨
And these people think they are the champions of freedom and personal liberty.
Are all tax laws based on things like this? Child tax credits, Exemptions and marital status? This nothing new to our tax code. Next you will be surprised that income can affect your tax rate.
They kind of already have one‚Ä¶I‚Äôm confused why they would pay more considering they use less.
I'm just saying that using taxes to get people to behave the way you want them to is a radically not conservative position. 

It's coercion.
But I‚Äôm gay. Wtf dude
these goddamn people
[removed]
It is too far! It was harder to survive before I had my kids. Higher taxes, no one to share bills with. Single people must pay 100% of everything and don't qualify for any breaks. JDs mentality is just bullcrap.
We.....already get taxed for that......whose do yall think is paying for the breeders tax breaksüòÇ
thats just how it goes the guy im not voting for literally just told me not vote for him again lol.

its funny that the republicans big focus is 'WE WILL TAKE VENGEANCE!'
How about no taxes after you have two children?  Seems like a better idea then punishing people.
The people in this subreddit are hilarious.
A lot of us already don't have kids because we know we couldn't afford them. Having a family is now a privilege in the US. This would essentially be an extra tax on a lot of people who are already struggling financially.
But what about all the microplastics and other pollution causing infertility? Will the state be paying for IVF?
LOL, are they trying to loose?
could anyone explain the reasoning behind this?
Hell yeah what a beast. Anti natalists live in the land of make believe
[removed]
Don‚Äôt single people use less resources though? I‚Äôm not trying to wish more taxes on myself as parent but expecting childless people to pay more is nonsensical. They already take 30% of all our checks, sheesh.
Fuck that guy!
You know who else has the same rhetoric and will have it soon as law? Ruzzzia. That's word for word putin's propaganda.
Because not getting laid isn't punishment enough
I fucking hate birthers
WTF! I've got kids, we already get tax credits.
Fuck that couch fuckerüòÇ
 What‚Äôs up with this guy and kids? üòÇ
Anything to keep us busy and exhausted huh?
Fuck people that can‚Äôt procreate I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I‚Äôm tired of that couch ‚Ä¶. Fker
They do have way more disposable income‚Ä¶.especially those DINKs
Nope, if the government and society runs and benefit for people to have children, then tax incentives for this are just as coercive as cigarettes and alcohol. 

Regardless of how you feel about both childbirth and cigarettes. Coercive is the same definitionally as positive incentives but they have two different connotations, one of which does not belong in that claim
I really wish he'd picked another VP. I don't trust that guy AT ALL. Isn't it logical and responsible for someone to be financially prepared BEFORE they kids? Wouldn't burdening people without kids impede that process, even possibly impacting the decision altogether. Man what a shitty fucking election...
All countries (that I know) have higher tax rates if you are not married/have children. For some countries like Germany and some blue states in USA, the difference is very significant.

However, it is NOWHERE close to how expensive a real child is.
that makes no sense cuz kids will still be more expensive than higher taxes‚Ä¶
At what age would he like this take effect? 18?  Better get your high school sweetheart pregnant
Or else!
I could see incentives for having children if the nation needs it, this has been done in many Asian countries. Definitely shouldn‚Äôt be punished for not having children though
[removed]
I think this is his idea of trying to get people to have more kids, but it‚Äôs definitely not going to work. our current low birth rates are a result of a system built towards consumerism and materialism. why would people want to have kids if they‚Äôre struggling to find worth through a system designed and built by narcissists for the sole goal of perpetuating material prosperity by any means necessary? historically, the highest birth rates occur when the population is happy and well fed, and i‚Äôll be damned if we don‚Äôt have enough food.
Don't we already have that with the child tax credit?
They already are taxed more, or families with children are taxed less, I mean duh.
That‚Äôs funny considering kamala went her whole life purposely never having children. I‚Äôd be pissed that I would have to pay even more taxes but the birth rate has dropped to catastrophic levels, although the biggest reason for this is infertility opposed to the choice against having children.
Some of us who are childless are also cancer survivors! Fu JD Vance!
well...thats one way to try and tackle depopulation lol
would people who adopt children or foster parents be considered childless? what about sterilized people who had medical issues or empty nesters? honestly so confused on their stance or people who have in vitro like elon musk or surrogates or open adoption?
hurry pen faulty weary poor coordinated observation whole toy many

Like all republicans, he believes that he should get special treatment because children aren't special, or God's gift, they're tax incentives.
It's not a bad idea honestly. Just put the tax taken into social security.
Lol. What about people who physically are incapable of having children? Punishing folks for being infertile? Yikes upon yikes.
"a child not born is a taxpayer lost." - the government
I‚Äôm already not trying to settle down and have kids BECAUSE I‚Äôm broke! What am I supposed to do if you take MORE of my money?!
Well that the wrong reason to have kids. ‚ÄúHey little timmy tax break, heres some more trauma cause we only love ourselves.‚Äù
I'd rather adopt a child tbh, I'd rather give someone else that's had a bad hand dealt and give them a better life than bringing in a small little shit, like I would adopt a kid but I'd never raise a baby, giving birth only adds to an already fucked population and you'd save much more not having to worry about diapers
I mean, they kind of already are taxed higher because of the child tax credit. This dude is just fucked up
[removed]
This is a fun hill to watch him die on.
That‚Äôs fucked up.  One of the biggest reasons I chose not to have kids was because I can‚Äôt afford them.  College was also unaffordable for me, so it definitely feels like they are punching down with that idea.
What an absolute wierdo
So first Republicans tell us, "Don't buy what you can't afford" or "Don't have kids if you can't afford them." And now, they want to punish people without kids. Where does that make sense?
Don‚Äôt forget that he said a woman shouldn‚Äôt be president because she‚Äôs not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù mother to her step kids.
Maybe we should stop watching the news and get some primary sources, instead of second or tertiary from news outlets. Regardless of what this guy believes in, they are ALL writing to scare the public.

The government already gives out tax breaks for children because they are considered future taxpayers. They are already doing this.
Breeder here, is that not how it kinda already works what with tax breaks for child related stuff?

This Vance guy is a couch fucking fuckhead
How about people that have kids left and right, barely take care of them, literally have their kids eat one meal a day, free lunch at school because parents do not cook at night and spend money on getting nails done and crazy eye lashes and Cheetos. This is asinine! Poor adults without kids and poor children if they have irresponsible parents.
An awful sub hating an awful VP candidate. Gotta love a man obsessed with kids arguing with people obsessed about proving how awful kids are. Two peas in a pod of weird child obsessions. One masquerading in hate and one in love.
Is he ok?
Don‚Äôt believe everything you read
Who cares
Don't we kind of already have that due to the dependent deductions and child tax credit?
Meanwhile he‚Äôs been planting his own seed in sectional couches‚Ä¶
Maybe instead of raising taxes on everyone who *doesn't* have children we could give a tax credit to those who do? 
We could even give it a cool IRS sounding name like the "Child Tax Credit" and for those who have more than one kid we could give an "Additional Child Tax Credit".
I wonder why no one has thought of this??/s
What the hell is this?
Because we have no vested interest in the future of America. /s üôÑ

The media hates Vance because he is married to a minority and it goes against their propagandized image of the republican party
[removed]
He's going at it wrong, but the idea seems to be that he wants to break the idea that it's too expensive to have children or that it's just cheaper and easier not to have children.
We already have higher taxes.  Geez
He has a really unhealthy obsession with the "childless."
Lmao so I can‚Äôt afford to have kids, so now I really can‚Äôt afford to have kids? Okay?
Yeah‚Ä¶not a fan of this guy at all
Why do they care whether we have kids or not. 
They already being in enough immigrants to replace us
The agenda of the religious right is so similar to the dystopia in The Handmaid's Tale, they could sue the writer for plagiarism.
Dumb dumb is going to lose them youths, that's for sure. Also, not sure if he means it. That sort only wants a certain demo breeding (e.g. the one the KKK prefers). We need to enforce tax penalties on those who have more than two kids (globally) if we're ever going to turn the anthropocene around =(
What if I want to have a decent quality of life???
You'd think the "anti taxes" party would simply be in favor of tax breaks for parents but no, it's more important to punish the people you don't like than it is to help the people you *do* like
Barefoot and pregnant
Children are future soldiers and wage slaves for the ruling class!
Seriously, as a childfree by choice woman, Vance literally makes steam come out of my ears.
If I‚Äôm not correct, project 2025 actually wants to cut the child tax credit too. Soooo‚Ä¶ they just hate everyone. *shrug*
Right? They always want tax breaks and free shit and now want us to be taxed higher all because we didn‚Äôt pop out little shits??
They want to penalise non-breeders in every possible way
That's what I was going to ask - I presume the US gives tax credits or breaks for having children right? The world is so bizarre right now.¬†
I mean the dude comes from an inbreeding coal miner community. It‚Äôs no wonder this is his stance.
We already pay more in taxes than breeders‚Ä¶.
We are going to need detailed definitions for what it means to not be childless. 

Do they have to live with you?

What happens when they get emancipated?

When is having a child defined to start?

How long after they pass will your credit be taken away?
No tax for buying couch
For real. I have no kids and my taxes pay for the school district I'll never put kids into. Sounds like *I* should get the tax break and people who decide to procreate should have to pay extra for their crotch goblins to get educated. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah, I‚Äôm really hoping this isn‚Äôt legitimate but I don‚Äôt want to go check and end up pissed off
And rightly so
He was defending this.  And yes.
Let's be real. Sure this will very much impact childless men. But think about who this is targeting the most. Women still make less than men, there is still a gender wage gap. Taxing the childless is a targeted attack specifically aimed at punishing women who do not wish to have children.
He all so wants to ban abortion nationwide. He's all so on a pod cast saying freedom and democracy don't mix.
Lol
Breeders lol
Maybe we should also tax people who didn‚Äôt go to college at higher rates so that we can give people who did go to college tax credits. Higher education is necessary for the essential industries that keep our society together (doctors, lawyers/judges, engineers, teachers, architects, etc etc).
If you watch the clip it seems like he was unaware of the child tax credit. What a maroon.
[removed]
Well, if we breeders have to pay higher "Inflation" taxes and more regular taxes and higher prices on most everything to cover the cost of the VOTES bought for Biden by the NON TAX PAYING breeders coming over the border that you voted to let pour in and support with our earnings, it seems only fair doesn't it since you helped cause it by voting Democrat? "After all WE ALL NEED TO PAY OUR FAIR SHARE!" If you aren't spending the extra money to raise kids hand it over, you don't need all of that! Either that or stop voting for the "free for all givers" and vote to put a Republican in office. The free loaders will be sent back home to the prison they were let out of and you'll instantly see your pocket book expand with the money that you earned for yourself. Or join in the breeding experience and pocket another 4k each for your trouble each year at tax time. Lol Hello!
He thinks we are nothing but walking incubators.
Imagine an actual charge and expense then
Right, no, so those are tax breaks if you have kids. This will be additional taxes placed on you on account you don‚Äôt have children
He also wants to take the dependent tax credit away, so it would raise taxes for everyone who has children and everyone who doesn't.
Exactly like huh?? But you know he won‚Äôt support an expansion of the child tax credits. He‚Äôs in support of limiting Medicare/medicaid and welfare programs
it's insane that by NOT adding another person to burden the resources of society, we end up paying MORE for people who do... why..?
No this will be added taxes to you if you don‚Äôt have children on account you don‚Äôt have children. Right now the gov simply incentivizes having kids. This will be disincentivizing and basically punishing you financially for not having children.
‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
I feel like there's a joke here, but I'm not getting it.  Am I missing something?  Is Vance a couchsexual?
Yes and now he wants to add basically a punishment added tax if you don‚Äôt have kids. Not just reduce your taxes if you do as we have it now
Exactly. Vance also proposed making childbirth free for the parents, but then when he was asked if he supported subsidizing child care he was like fuck no!
Yes. ¬†Because then you are even more dependent on the corporate job and have more to lose...making you a more subservient employee.
I don‚Äôt understand how ppl beleieve a 700 year old man built a cruise ship and gathered every species of animal on earth onto it‚Ä¶yet here we are
Right?! Like, yes, let me vote for this party that wants to strip away all my rights!
They never care until it directly affects them. Their ability to feel empathy is non existent.
So hypocritical, nefarious and on long run self-defeating‚Äî-total deplorable debauchery‚Äî-
And i really dont get why we can. Much like most of these families, who chose to have kids, WE chose to have pets. We already have to pay rent for the pets in most instances these days, so why cant we get a deduction for that?
People keep saying this. Yes we know. Now they want to add more to that to punish you for not having kids instead of only incentivizing you to be reducing your taxes when you di
Status quo is not the natural order of things. Homelessness in cities is the current status quo but it is not natural for these many people to live like this in the richest country in the world.
Spot on.
If it's so "natural" and orderly, why does it require so much enforcement and is still being questioned? These people created the "land of the free" then get mad when we use our rights
Wait he's gay and wants to punish people for not having biological children???
Not only that, but people who do have children should get an extra vote for each child. Technically, it would be the child's vote, but the parents get to cast it for whomever they choose.
Ah, there it is. There‚Äôs the ‚Äútaxation without representation‚Äù part, foreshadowed in his proposal to lower parents‚Äô taxes while raising them even more for the childfree. I remember reading about that concept in a dusty unbanned history book.
Many young families don't start having kids until they are in their mid to late 20s. I guess everyone just gets screwed on taxes until they procreate? This fucks over absolutely everyone. 

But it's probably the point. Tie young people into marriages as teens and get pregnant immediately. Keeps the girls out of higher education and the workforce and forces the boys into the rat race to support dependents. It makes everyone more exploitable.
OR they just do like they did in "The Handmaid's Tale" and have 14 year olds marry gross old men as soon as they start menstruating.  Can't have childfree women in their twenties if they're all knocked up by the time they're 16.
They won't wait until age 30. They'll start applying pressure right away, as soon as children hit puberty. They need to pressure women to start pumping out babies as early as possible.
They do know that. They are wanting to not just lower taxes for people with kids (as it is now) but they want to make an additional increase on people who don‚Äôt have kids
Yes
Yes they know. They want you to pay even more for being childless
Literally omfg
Wild policy positions like this are Vance's way of acting out his lingering resentment for his Mother, who was an addict and substance abuser who frequently neglected him during her struggles with addiction.
That‚Äôs a tax credit for having children. This will be tax penalty for not having them.
Yeah and lots of children were abused by the parents that didn't really want them, and ran away and lived in train stations and became addicted to paint fumes. Swell. These 'politicians' are god damn clueless!
Because he's a fat, fatherless

queen with mommy issues.
Yes that‚Äôs what they want. I mean we have tax credits for having kids. The US and and country wants people to procreate as they need future contributors to the economy and future tax payers. People saying it‚Äôs about ‚Äúnatural order‚Äù that‚Äôs just a cover. It‚Äôs about MONEY
Yes, J.D. Vance believes women should stay in abusive marriages for the sake of the children, as if being exposed to domestic violence in the home is going to help the children in some way. I'd hate to think what J.D. Vance thinks to himself, in his own head, if he is willing to say these things out loud to the voting public.
I fully support this policy!! Have pets? Yes, how many 20! Great here is your discount.
Infertile - not based 

Transformers - based
Too late. He's already on the ticket. That's why he's in the news lately. I posted an article about Vance 3 years ago, when he said the childless shouldn't have the right to vote (or at best, their votes should count for less than people who procreated).  This is a new low even for the Dump.
He has to legally carry Vance to term now it‚Äôs too late lol
ü§£
Please vote. We need to show up and reject these fascists who want to ban contraception and rewind women‚Äôs rights by a century.
It's coming. It takes time for the population to become malleable enough to accept the more and more radical things they plan on doing.
Nah, Vance should keep yapping. It‚Äôs good for the country‚Äôs future for him to not hide what he wants for us ü§£
Ha ha ha! Many will not be able to procreate due to the microplastics, and he wants people to have more kids and remove IVF?! He does not understand science.
Btw this is in no way to say or I many others would stop having sex but I don‚Äôt doubt people would be scared given ‚Äúprotection‚Äù itself has its possible flaws and in a country like this, doesn‚Äôt matter the chances for many as fear drives them down
I agree.

Vance has one of those absolutely fascinating psychological pathologies that we often seen in adults who grew up as neglected children.

I see him acting out his love/hate relationship with his alcoholic/drug addict mother, whom he has never forgiven for her substance abuse.  Instead of actually forgiving her, he forces her to appear at his speeches so that she can atone for her past mistakes by appearing to support his wild conjecturing at this stage of his development.

Shit like this would even include parents whose children have died. It‚Äôs just asinine.
As someone with kids he also makes steam come out my ears.

Fuck that couch fucker.

He wants nationwide abortion bans
Use the steam to power your car to drive you to the nearest voting center in November . Don‚Äôt ask me for the specifics on your human steam powered car I believe in you that you‚Äôll figure it out by then. Or take a normal car whatever works best I was just trying to help with the steam issue

*Gooood,* Let the hatred flow.
"By Choice" is what he wants removed
But would you be okay with paying into a tax fund for everyone's unlimited government funded abortions out of your increased taxes? Children have to be paid for whether you have them or not. Hello!
Well somebody has to pay their fair share now for the millions of illegal migrants that EVERYONE in our country is now having to support that are being let over our border daily. You voted for these jerks, now their YOUR kids. Trust me you are already paying more, we all are, parents or not. Are you rich or haven't you noticed the higher prices on EVERYTHING! By the way, that's why Social Security is gonna run out! Not because of Republicans like the Dems are lying about. Democrats have always lied about what they spend our money on. It's like a tradition for them. Never goes where they say it does. They gotta pay for those votes! Eyes wide shut? Hello! Wake up!
As someone who is struggling with fertility and looking at how much it costs to get fertility help, Vance is also making steam come out of my ears.
And yet they say they‚Äôre the party of lowering taxes.
And yet,they also complain about people who need food stamps and Medicaid because "they're just lazy".
They, meaning the Biden/Harris administration has about penalized the entire taxpaying population with overall inflation to the point where I don't know how much more damage to our wallets anyone else could or ever has done in our history. Our government is using a form of legal thievery on its own people. It's just sick. Does everyone not know this? $7.99 for a box of cereal was $4.25. Taco Bell meal is $12, was $6.99. Dollar Tree $1, now is $1.25+ after 40 years! Gas is twice what it was most of the time as opposed to last administration. Give me orange and loud instead of feeble or crazy lady because if it brings financial relief I'm in!
Yes it does and has for a long time now. In the ABC news article a Vance spokesperson responded to criticism over these comments he made by saying what he is proposing is effectively the same as the existing "Child Tax Credit"... Okay so then he's not actually proposing anything new and is just trying to rile people up with rhetoric.
I think this what happens as civillisations fall. The Romans became very good at not having children so the politicians tried to make the people have more kids just before their civillisation fell.
Rednecks gonna redneck.
Damn man don‚Äôt insult coal miners like that. Lots of coal miners are liberal and union supporting and are good people. Many in the past fought for your workers rights.
So you took his DNA duuuude? See, that's the thing about Republicans, they look out for everybody, even those who don't vote for them. They know implementing policies that lift up all people helps the whole country. Democrats in government only look out for themselves and don't give a rats rear end about anybody doing better because they like to keep the people needy and begging for help and usually as proof of this nobody is better off after they're done with their term, you know, LIKE NOW! This whole country is in a dumpster fire and If Kamala Harris becomes our president next, it'll quickly degress to the shitter. She is a foolish and stupid woman who keeps getting handed everything, learns nothing and does nothing. But why would she, she doesn't need to. All she had as a prerequisite is being dark skinned. She has a great laugh and the ability to lie and let others lie for her. She has no dignity left, no integrity and hasn't as far back as what I know about her. If she did she would have told them where to stick it.
I don‚Äôt know his he gets off saying that because his family income was $175k in today‚Äôs dollars.
Why do you need details? Just VOTE NO against these fuckers. Is this tax scam your final breaking point? Perhaps the layered nuances in this tax plan will convince you to vote for it? Are you aware, trump, vance et al are implementing the end of our Constitutional Law? This tax scheme is only one tiny part of what these fascist fuckers want to do to us. Vote Kamala Harris!
Plus, what if you are infertile?
Do any child a favor and don't have any. Too bad your parents didn't do the same.
>Sounds like I should get the tax break and people who decide to procreate should have to pay extra for their crotch goblins to get educated.

Funding education is good for everyone in a society. It brings down crime rates, increases property values, results in fewer children born into poverty and therefore reduces the amount of people on welfare. Anyone who doesn't want to help pay for education is ignorant and selfish.

Pets don‚Äôt become future taxpayers.
Because pets don‚Äôt work. They can‚Äôt contribute to the economy one day and pay taxes. I mean to be honest that‚Äôs why. That‚Äôs also why parents get a tax credit for having kids to begin with. It‚Äôs not some natural order bs it‚Äôs about MONEY
Kids are a net good for the country though especially if they're on rate to maintain population level. If suddenly half as many people had kids it would cause big issues over the next 20-40 years.
Parents are raising the next generation of taxpayers, you could think of it as an investment of sorts to incentivize people to have children so that there will be no shortage of workers 20 years from now. Pets are a luxury and with the exception of working dogs, they aren‚Äôt necessary to society.
Because pets do not create future economic value, children do. That's the basic logic. An inverted age-pyramid has pretty uniformly negative economic consequences.
He‚Äôs a closeted gay man. He‚Äôs talked about he used to think he was gay but then decided he was straight. So even if he‚Äôs not gay, he‚Äôs queer at the least, and deeply ashamed of it.

I can actually identify with him a little, because I also grew up in a poor, rural, conservative area, and even though I didn‚Äôt fit in and left because of it, I also have moments where I wish I could be someone they‚Äôd approve of. He‚Äôs basically overcompensating and trying to impress the people he grew up with (or I should say, lied about growing up with, because his ghostwritten book is full of lies about his childhood).
Yes the second part is true. He didn‚Äôt say people who don‚Äôt have kids shouldn‚Äôt be able to vote at all. I could be wrong but that‚Äôs what I heard in his speech. He‚Äôs a nutjob
>This fucks over absolutely everyone.

Not only that---aren't far-right folks the ones who criticize those in poverty the most? A move like this will just encourage low-income families to procreate even more, won't it?

Make this make sense lol
Younger than 14 if it‚Äôs based on having a period. I was 9 when I got my first period.
also that's so ironic. Because a lot of people choose not to have kids BECAUSE they're self-aware and responsible enough to realize they'd be a terrible parent, and those potential children will end up exactly like Vance.
Welp shit. Not my mom, not my problem. Just like how it's not your body, not your choice.

There is no bottom for degenerate liars like Trump.

Lowering taxes for corporations and people who stand  to inherit millions-billions.
Yeah but they wanna pop out kids endlessly while living in a 2 bedroom trailer and have the government fund it all
It's the same people who claim to be pro life, but actively fight against sex education, state funded healthcare, free contraceptives, making adoption more adorable... All the things that have been proven to reduce the number of abortions. Hypocrisy is their MO.

sure, i guess raising one party‚Äôs taxes instead of lowering the other‚Äôs is technically ‚Äúeffectively the same‚Äù.. except it isnt, because instead if assistance, it‚Äôs punishment
Sure in the past lol
I would presume adoption within a traditional Christian perhaps Jewish household would suffice üòÇ
I didn't say "I shouldn't pay ANY taxes". What I'm saying is if me with no kids and my neighbor with 3 kids have houses with similar values and thus similar property tax rates, *I* should get a tax break for not utilizing the school district and he should not, since his kids are using it.

J.D. Vance may not have gone so far as to say voting rights should be denied to childless people, but Elon Musk has definitely said that. So the idea is being floated amongst the rich and powerful.
They criticize the poor because some of their taxes pay for their social safety nets. They want to remove welfare, not poor people. They absolutely want as many people in poverty so that they have an endless supply of easily exploited cheap labourers.
"Smol weewee energy"

Yes, Mr. Vance is a textbook victim of childhood emotional abuse.

As we have seen with roe v wade, they don‚Äôt have a line.
I mean he‚Äôs called VP Harris ‚Äúchildless‚Äù even though she‚Äôs a step mother‚Ä¶ but honestly I don‚Äôt think they actually put any thought into it and just assumed everyone would be filling separately?
You wouldn‚Äôt benefit. He‚Äôs already explicitly come for Kamala on this very point and she is a stepmother.
Joint taxes, so 3 dependents..
I think at that point it depends whether you have a cat or not.
Well, in all fairness, I can respect the smallest part of our population for being rich and living a good life because those people are the ones providing the jobs for everyone else and at the same time probably putting the money back into a business to manufacture a product we use or need, maybe furniture, food, lawn tools, tools, appliances, cars, etc. When their taxes are lowered they can afford to pay people more pay in their checks,  vacations, 401K's, etc. Rich people and companies don't have a big giant pile of money sitting around somewhere. It's working out in the economy. It's what keeps our economy going instead of having a recession. We always hear love makes the world go round. But it's really money. You can't be mad at people having a lot of legitimately made money. They worked for it made it grow and thus makes the economy grow which helps all people live, work, eat and play.
Take the rich down a few notches  and everyone else falls. It's a house of cards and it's a sham. Our government hates the middle class with their small businesses.
As someone who was raised by a single mom who worked full time while trying to get her bachelor's, I disagree.

Compared to now we had much more financial relief before 2020. They will spin the story and many fall for it. These people knew it was good and made sure to get in there and used both the pandemic and climate change to scare the weak into handing over all the money everyone had made and saved (no amount of money taken out of our hides will fix that) All they've done is take it from us and send it over (supposely) to Ukraine and Hamas and put border crossing cheap opportunists up in nice hotels and provide them with healthcare and help with rent. You/we/everyone here who is out there working are buying votes for them to the tune of about 10k a year for each of us working folks. Our lives are slowly but surely being diminished to help ingrates coming here for a free ride. If they are doing such a great job and made everything better then why isn't anyone doing better. Happy?

Very true. I'm just wondering how they plan to implement this nonsense.

Wow good for you?? I was raised by a single mom and it was fucking terrible. I also was friends with a 15 yr old single mother with a 2 yr old baby. She stayed on gov assistance, spent her child support on things for herself, and basically let her parents raise her daughter. The daughter also called every new boyfriend (which was a lot) ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù.

There's no telling what could happen with the Supreme Court we've got now. There are all kinds of strings being pulled behind the scenes that we have no clue about. Religious conservatives are constantly working in roundabout ways to achieve a long-term change. They are playing the long game. So nothing would surprise me any more.
With abortion bans, mostly, which have already begun, and I wouldn't be surprised if they started trying to come for our contraceptives, too.
This is so BS
‚ÄùThe National Assessment of Educational Progress, known as the ‚ÄúNation‚Äôs Report Card,‚Äù should release student performance data based on ‚Äúfamily structure‚Äù ‚Äî in addition to existing categories such as race and socioeconomic status.‚Äù

‚ÄùFamily structure, the document says, is ‚Äúone of the most important ‚Äî if not the most important ‚Äî factor influencing student educational achievement and attainment.‚Äù The document goes on to endorse ‚Äúnatural family structure‚Äù of a heterosexual, two-parent household, ‚Äúbecause all children have a right to be raised by the men and women who conceived them.‚Äù ‚Äî Sarah Butrymowicz‚Äù

‚ÄùIn addition, Project 2025 calls on Congress to look into creating a federal scholarship tax credit to ‚Äúincentivize donors to contribute‚Äù to nonprofit groups that grant scholarships for private school tuition or education materials. ‚Äî Ariel Gilreath and Neal Morton‚Äù

Incentivizing donors to fund private, religious schools, where only children from traditional nuclear families are eligible. The part about ‚Äúeveryone has the right to be raised by the man and woman who conceived them.‚Äù These school boards will be funded by tax deductible donations and after the Dept of Education is gutted there won‚Äôt be any regulations saying that schools can not discriminate who they allow in and who they reject. 

Same sex marriages, non traditional marriages of any kind don‚Äôt even have to be made illegal if they can be openly discriminated against by the institutions they need for survival. With those laws in place, there‚Äôs nothing stopping them from openly segregating schools based on family status or socioeconomic status, allowing them to target minorities and women easily just because a school is only accepting children from households that meet specific requirements.
?
Yeah, and they‚Äôre success at it so far has been staggering and terrifying
A lot of places in the south already had abortion "prevention" and a lot of the bans were for the places that were doing that, so if we see childfree "prevention" measures like this then it IS a slippery slope for us imo.
They refused to pass a resolution protecting contraceptives.

I wouldn't trust any Tremond but don't blame you if you back for the tour someday. üòÖBut seriously, if there's any place I see as the mecca in my life, this is it. Congrats on the experience.
The 3 guys with the sign‚Ä¶I‚Äôm wondering if that was Dave who does twin peaks tours.  I took his tour and it was awesome. It‚Äôs his full time job and he said he‚Äôs literally booked every day. He brings his own sign so I figured it might be him.
That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm from Perth Western Australia and my partner and I have been discussing a trip to the Pacific Northwest, including a pilgrimage to all the Twin Peaks locations. Great to see you‚Äôve blazed a trail on behalf of our great state of ‚ÄúWA‚Äù.
hey I hope you had a great time here (I live in western Washington)...
Are you in the black lodge?
Excuse me, Sir, but this is a damn fine bunch of pictures.
Very cool! I will visit those places next year ;-)
From WA to WA!
Should of took a ferry to see the log and the hotel inside area
I‚Äôm in Australia and this is my dream!
Glad you could make it there, OP! 
It's funny--even though these posts with pics of people's visits to TP filming locations pop up frequently and cover the same subject matter, I never tire of seeing them :-)
good pics
Welcome! I'm glad you enjoyed your time out here, it's a beautiful time of year for hikes and being in North Bend
Wonderful pics!
Beautiful pictures, thanks for sharing. Hope you had a mint time mate!
Stunning landscapes.
Awesome photos!
Amazing pics dude! Visiting is on my bucket list, so I'm pretty jealous lol. Hope you had a great time
You're the first person I've heard say that Twede's cherry pie is good!
I‚Äôve been thinking about doing this exact trip a few times now and never pull the trigger. Did it live up to your expectations?
Fellow Aussie here (Melbourne based), how much did the entire trip cost?

Definitely a 'bucket list' contender for sure!
Great photos, the RR Cafe with the moody sky is beautiful!
Hahha it‚Äôs my dream to do it from Adelaide, Australia
Is this real? Gotta visit WA soon
Great post, I need to go next year
I love that there's a random rally car company that casually does its business in the authentic twin peaks sheriff station
Leo and Shelly Johnsons was filmed at my parents house. It was a fun time meeting everyone
I reckon so. He was dressed as an FBI agent. I had finished taking photos at the spot and started driving away when I saw someone getting out of their car with an FBI badge and I figured something interesting was about to happen and turned back to talk to them and then I saw him getting the sign out of the car!

I found his tour website, thanks for your comment, I‚Äôll edit my post to give him credit.

Edit: okay I can‚Äôt edit the post so here‚Äôs the link to the Twin Peaks tours: [https://www.twinpeakstour.com/book-the-tour-1](https://www.twinpeakstour.com/book-the-tour-1).
Cool! If you want to tour the Palmer house I recommend getting in touch with the owner ([https://visitpalmerhouse.com](https://visitpalmerhouse.com)) in advance. I didn‚Äôt learn about this until I was Googling to find the address on the day I went there and by then it was too late, but by the looks of it she does an amazing tour.
I did thanks! You‚Äôre very lucky to live there, it very quickly went right to the top of the most beautiful places I‚Äôve seen.
Right now I‚Äôm flying back home over the Pacific and it feels a bit like I‚Äôve been stuck in this plane for 25 years‚Ä¶
Damn fine comment!
Enjoy! The Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle is really good too for movie props and music memorabilia if you‚Äôre into that kinda stuff.
Yep! It was strange seeing websites on the hiking info signs ending in ‚Äúwa.gov‚Äù rather than ‚Äúwa.gov.au‚Äù haha.
Poulsbo! The Kiana Lodge üëç
It was originally on my to-do list but on the day I could‚Äôve done it I decided to go back out to Snoqualmie/North Bend instead and that was the day it was beautiful and foggy at Snoqualmie falls and I ended up hiking Mount Si so I don‚Äôt regret missing out on Kiana this time.
Thanks!
Thanks! I hope you get there too some time.
Haha well it‚Äôs not particularly common in my part of the world so I‚Äôm by no means a connoisseur! I liked it enough to order it on occasions, but there‚Äôs no denying the endorphins coming from the experience of ordering cherry pie and coffee at the RR must have made it taste even better.
It well exceeded them! Seeing the TP locations themselves was wondering and ordering a slice of cherry pie at the RR was so cool! But Snoqualmie and North Bend are beautiful locations in their own right and the whole trip would have been worth it just for the time spent in the wilderness out there.
I probably spent $1500-$2000 (AUD) for hotel in Seattle, car hire, eating out etc. Luckily I was already in the US for work so all I spent on flights was $200 or something to cover the excess cost of flying home via Seattle rather than LAX as I would have otherwise.
Well you‚Äôve got a somewhat shorter distance to travel haha. Hope you make it there!
Very real, and very beautiful there.
Oh yes that‚Äôs for sure him.  He always wears his fbi uniform.  He had to research to make sure he wasn‚Äôt breaking any laws haha.  Yeah I definitely recommend his tour to anyone reading this.  He‚Äôs been doing it for 8 years if I remember correctly.  He grew up near Seattle and when the show first aired he and his friends made it their mission to find the filming locations (this was pre internet). So as you can imagine he knows his stuff
Excellent, thanks for the tip. It would be equally eerie and fascinating to see the house in person.
I'm so glad!! Cheers!  Someday I hope to get to Western Australia so I too can check both "WA"s off my list!
The gum you like will come back in style.
Oh definitely! Thanks for the tip! I will make a long vacation next year and will visit the USA for the first time. My trip starts in the New England area including Connecticut and Martha‚Äôs Vineyard (where Jaws was filmed for the most part), St. Louis and the west coast starting up high in Vancouver working my way down to San Francisco/Monterey
Nice!
Seconding the tour recommendation!  He took us a lot of places we never would have found on our own.
What an amazing experience that must have been!
That‚Äôs so cool.
Cat tree red room
Had an "aha" moment when I realised I had some leftover red velvety material from another silly project. Bit of canvas material, brown paint, too much free time, and there you have it. Thought some people here might appreciate it as much as I do.
woeM
That tuna you like is going to come back in style
I feel like I know her, but sometimes my claws retract.
This is the greatest thing since creamed corn
Are you sure it‚Äôs still your cat? Kinda looks like a doppelg√§nger.
I‚Äôll see you in nine lives. Meanwhile üê±ü´¥‚úã
One day, my litter box will have something to say about this.
Your cat dances when you aren't at home, and eats the cherry pie from the fridge
What‚Äôs 25 years in cat years?
I love this

I have to make this for my cat Cooper!

This is, excuse me, a *damn fine* bowl of kibble.
Don‚Äôt let that milk cool on ya. I‚Äôve heard about you!
LOVE IT!!
I would give all my garmonbozia for that. I will tell you three things that are true the first is I love that cat tree...
Sometimes my arms bend back (when I‚Äôm licking my butt).

That fish in the percolator was for the cat's coffee!
Love this! Cat‚Äôs name?
Oh fuck all the way off, that's way too cool now I have to do it too damn you

Awesome! Also such a beautiful kitty!

Yes omg yes I need it
That‚Äôs the last thing a cat needs - to be more creepy and weird.
This is the best thing I have seen today! üòÜ
I‚Äôll cat-ch you with my death bag

I visualized what this would look like. Now I want to see it.
Let us hope it is not this day!
Cats have a brain-pan the size of a walnut. They can barely track naptime, which appropriately enough is 25 minutes.
Most unique gif I've ever scene!

Edit: *written* (w0uw, r3dd!#, W0w!)
Great to hear! Please post if you make something.
OMG I would just Gordon Cole my cat all day long if his name was Cooper.

COOP, WHEN YOU KNOCK OVER MY SHIT YOU REMIND ME OF A SMALL MEXICAN CHI-WOW-WOW.
My cat is also Cooper! I love the idea of a bunch of us nerds doing this for our very confused and ungrateful kitties.
Thanks! Her name is Queenie, not Twin Peaks related unfortunately sorry.
Thanks! It's just some plain canvas material that I traced a chevron pattern into and then painted. It's a bit wonky up close, but does the job for now.
Well, as long as you don‚Äôt tell her any coordinates you should be fine.
Same , I think it‚Äôs a blooper
I have a cat named Cooper also, but his full name is Special Agent Dale Cooper Dougie Richard Mr. C. He absolutely has the traits of them all at different times (I love his Dougie moments).
She took over Blackie‚Äôs job.
Are you also an AHS fan?
Gotta keep those carpets clean.
Mine is Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Bartholo-mew Cooper. He mainly has regular Cooper traits. Highly food motivated, afraid of birds, deeply moved by the plight of the Tibetan people.
I didn't like the human dougie, but I would move heaven and hell for cat dougie.
I haven't watched it yet sorry! Is it a reference I'm missing out on?
My cats are Cooper, Olivia (Dunham), and Jack (Bauer) - ¬†I like a theme üòÜ
Queenie is the name of a witch in season 3 (it's called Coven).

She's played by Gabourey Sidibe, the actress who played the main character in Precious.
Ok cool! I really should start watching it soon, I hear that the summer camp season is also a lot of fun.
Remembering Frank Silva on his 74th birthday
I‚Äôd like to take a moment to remember Frank Silva today on what would‚Äôve been his 74th birthday. Most Twin Peaks fans know the story of Frank working as a set dresser on the pilot episode, being in the right place at the right time and inspiring David Lynch to write him in as the character of Bob - the embodiment of evil. But we don‚Äôt hear as much about him as a person. Frank A. Silva Jr. grew up in Gustine, CA, where he got his first taste of acting in grade school productions of Snow White and Pinocchio. Despite a rough upbringing and leaving home at an early age, he continued to pursue acting through high school and eventually embraced behind the scenes work, obtaining a degree in lighting design at San Francisco State University. Frank was always a performer, though, and he also enjoyed flamenco dancing and singing in a rock band. His mother, Alice Costa, supported his passions and was an avid viewer of Twin Peaks. In a 1991 Modesto Bee article, she said ‚ÄúI feel so proud that he really made it. He used to say ‚ÄòMom, one day you‚Äôre going to see me on TV.‚Äô‚Äù Sadly, Frank passed away in Seattle a few years after his time in Twin Peaks due to complications from AIDS. His name can be found on the AIDS memorial quilt adorned with musical notes and a depiction of the Space Needle. He and his mother are buried at Hills Ferry Cemetery in Newman, CA. My partner and I visited recently and found the photos on their gravestones clouded with mineral build up, so we returned this past weekend with cleaning supplies and flowers. Happy birthday, Frank.
Nice touch with the blue roses.
Thank you for taking it upon yourself to touch up and clean the memorials . ‚ù§Ô∏è
Happy Birthday, Frank üíô‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§

Everyone‚Äôs favorite goofball.
RIP frank silvaüôèüèª can never forget how many beautiful lives were ripped away during the AIDS crisis. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Gone too soon
Such a cool-looking guy, and it sounds like a good guy too.
Lovely tribute
He had the fury of his own momentum. God rest his soul.
RIP and happy birthday icon
RIP
Rest in Peace. The story of how he got the part is magnificent.
Omg, it's so so sweet that you did this! Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Good job, dude. RIP
I love how passionate he was about the world, he really seemed to know Twin Peaks inside and out.
Until this post I didn‚Äôt know he died young and didn‚Äôt know it was from hiv. Poor fellow. The show would be so different without him
R.i.p. frank
o7
WHEEE ARE ALL THE AWARDS PEOPLE
I didn‚Äôt even know he was sick.
Catch you with my death-bag.
It felt fitting without being irreverent. We left some for his mother, too.
I think any of us would do the same if we were near a cast/crew member‚Äôs resting place. I‚Äôm glad this is only about an hour from me.
Love that orb of pure evil
What about his mother‚Äôs sisters girl
Wow youre just so funny I can‚Äôt
I have no respect for people who can‚Äôt afford children but have them anyway
I have no respect for parents in general. But I have even less respect for people who intentionally have a child born into poverty. Why. I don‚Äôt understand these people. They do have a choice. Why do people act like they don‚Äôt. I have a choice. And I choose not to have children. I‚Äôm poor, and I‚Äôll be decent enough to remain childless for life. I‚Äôd love to drive but I can‚Äôt afford a car so I use public transport. Same with children. Can‚Äôt afford them. Then don‚Äôt have them. Go childless. 
Same. I have someone from my hometown on my FB friends list who has four kids, is mad that she can‚Äôt have a fifth, and is dirt poor. Her kids show up to school dirty and smelly because she doesn‚Äôt wash their clothes or make them shower. She then has the audacity to post that people need to stop ‚Äústarting rumors that aren‚Äôt true‚Äù about her kids. 

Then she complains that she can‚Äôt get a job because she has them and she breaks up with her ‚Äúhusband‚Äù every two weeks.

It‚Äôs a big yikes. 

I grew up with a single mom in poverty, it is never something I would have wanted to be born into.

I agree with this 110%. Nobody is entitled to kids. Kids are expensive. Before having kids, you should ensure you have the funds, housing, and support.
üëè üëè üëè EXACTLY!  Why sentence a poor kid to hell on earth?
When I was in school, one of my clinicals was at the county health women‚Äôs clinic.  To qualify to be a patient at the clinic you had to be extremely poor, on food stamps, etc. 80% of the patients were pregnant women. If it was a new patient/new pregnancy my instructor would ask them if they were trying to become pregnant and a surprisingly high number of them said that they were. I always had mixed feelings about it.  One one hand it seems elitist or even racist to say something like ‚Äúpoor people shouldn‚Äôt have kids,‚Äù but on the other hand these kids are being brought into a household that can‚Äôt even pay for food.  I technically could afford a child but I prefer to spend my money on myself and my dog
because they see them as tools that will work and bring income to the household when they grow up
There‚Äôs some right wing talking head that was giving a spiel at a turning point USA event or some other right wing fascist convention and he said something like if you want to be an alpha male ‚Äúget married and have more kids than you can afford‚Äù

wtf?
Society was created this way on purpose. First pretend there is a sky daddy in a sky, write a book full of senseless rules of pretend someone ‚Äúfound it‚Äù, and it‚Äôs from this magical being. Now brainwash the poor and uneducated into thinking their job is to spread their seeds and repopulate the Earth no matter what because it‚Äôs ‚Äúgod‚Äôs will‚Äù. Rinse and repeat for thousands of years keeping the same type of people in power controlling their sheep who are unable to question or to say no to anything.
I have seen too many women, alone, with two or three toddlers, and a stroller, that shit makes me sad.
There shouldn't be tax breaks for having kids. There was a time when that was a good thing, and that time passed 40 years ago.
What amazes me is the number of people who defend this as if it‚Äôs ok to bring a new life into a state of unmet need. Adopting a dog has more requirements ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Pure sadists.
My best friends sister and her boyfriend have 3 kids and raise them off the government.
Exactly. Honestly my parents were these people. I feel a little sad about it--I don't think either of them was educated enough to realize that having a kid costs a LOT OF MONEY. Especially when that kid has special needs and medical problems. But it isn't an excuse--they needed to use like three percent more of their brains before making the choice to have me.   
HOWEVER, I also have a deep contempt for rich people who have kids.
Honestly hard agree. I have 6 siblings and we grew up poor. It was rough. We shared 2 bedrooms and regularly had to miss out on things like properly fitting clothes and doing things friends got to do. Then, it becomes embarrassing when your friends parents notice you‚Äôre poor and do stuff for you like buy clothes or pay your way when you can‚Äôt afford to do things.
I agree. If you can‚Äôt support an entire life plus yours on your one salary, then you‚Äôre setting up the kid for failure or a life of corporate servitude.
They find ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù through kids because they‚Äôre not smart enough to find it elsewhere imo
>I have no respect for people who have children   

There ftfy
There‚Äôs a lot of brainwashing involved. I grew up in the church (I‚Äôm agnostic now), and it was drilled into us that if you got pregnant, it‚Äôs because God wanted you to be pregnant, so ending the pregnancy was taboo. So many people really do feel like they don‚Äôt have a choice, even when they‚Äôre living in awful circumstances.
I don't have respect for either of those people with money or not
Ignorant and uneducated degenerates that haven't evolved. I saw an 18 year old girl asking for food on the free meal subreddit. She was pregnant and homeless. It's so gross. 
This is exactly why we are going to see the movie Idiocracy become a documentary before our eyes. 
Disgusting.

Also, why aren't people who are on government assistance forced to take birth control? You shouldn't be allowed to have kids when you can't take care of them.
it also depends on the culture. in many cultures girls are given  to get married really young in exchange of a wedding dowry. sons can be used for manual labor. also in some countries governments give natality allowances to motivate people to breed. reality is complex, not black and white. that said, i'm poor and I'm not having any kids. I barely manage to get by and being poor puts a huge strain in one's mental health. (I live in europe though, I have a western mindset: me first. and my poverty means I have food to eat and clothes to wear, a computer, a phone, internet, and a place to sleep, just not much more than that)
Coming from someone who's parents were 2 dumb teenagers, I couldn't agree more. I wish they'd had mercy on me and aborted me.
Add to this, I absolutely despise people who have a fuckton of kids without ever having had the plan to discipline them, and thus they have a bunch of sh!tty, bratty kids, that run amok during weddings, birthdays, and so forth. My BIL's stepdaughter is amongst the WORST. Jesus christ it drives me insane. She cries for absolutely EVERYTHING. It's made me swear off of having kids. Shes 8 now, and has the mentality of a 4 year old. No shes not disabled or anything in any way, just enabled asf by her parents. Every. Single. Time. She comes over, shes in tears. Because omg, she wants water. Omg she wants a banana. Omg she wants her mom's phone. Omg she needs to use the bathroom. Dont even get me started on the first christmas we tried to enjoy together, there was a flash of lightning outside, and she SCREAMED the most bloodcurdling scream. No thunder, just a single flash of lightning. She dissolved into a hysteric, screaming, crying mess.

She legit just cries for everything and I cant even handle it. Ive taken to hiding in our room and pretending I'm not there to avoid all of them lmao. Girl needs a time out, a slap, ANYTHING.
I was born into a poor family. I agree with you. I live in a small town with nothing and life is dull. There's other reasons but that's a big one.
It‚Äôs a pretty well-known fact that less-educated people have more children
I have had an abortion because I would have felt way too shameful for being poor and a parent. My sister had 4 abortions...She stopped getting abortions not because she scored a salaried governemnt job at the court house which pulled her out of poverty but because apparently, the abortion clinic dissuaded her and told her she wasn't allowed anymore. It was probably bs. So she kept my niece, and drank. My niece has undiagnosed FASD/FAE, but is diagnosed with ADHD, autism and BPD. I'll never forgive my sister.
And we're all supposed to feel bad for them. They post on local FB group all the time, mooching and begging for baby stuff, with no details or anything. Just hand it over. Or groups that "Help single moms" basically asking for EVERYTHING, just as the kid's head pops out. You have 7 months to plan for this. I have no patience anymore. I just post links to job banks and employment programs.
Well‚Ä¶ social conditioning dies hard. Most people can‚Äôt think for themselves unfortunately.
That's my parents. A lifetime of starvation and misery so two idiots can get their rocks off. I hate breeders.
[deleted]
I literally think this everytime im on a bus with a screaming crotch goblin, can't afford a car? Can't afford a kid.
Why ruin everyone's commute with your insufferible decisions.
Not only that but they keep on lecturing their kids for demanding stuff that they can't afford and twist the story for convenience, so that it's somehow the child's fault for being spoiled and inconsiderate and demanding too much.
Imbeciles.
A good amount I know had kids for the money and benefits, some people I think do generally lack the intelligence to understand what sex is and I believe there is a large amount that are religious and don't abort.

100% agree it's a choice, Its only the money grubbers I don't respect though.
Not just poverty but also parents that decide to bring kids into a toxic situation also lose my respect. An old friend of mine was ACTIVELY trying to conceive with someone she not only wasn‚Äôt even married to but they had no relationship, he would just text her randomly at night after he‚Äôs done drinking at the bar for sex and she would let him. He makes $400 a week as an overnight security guard. Drives a 2001 honda, has no education and roommates with at least 4 people in a run down apartment in the worst neighborhood. He gets drunk every single weekend and they‚Äôre always fighting, threatening each other with cops especially whenever she finds out about other women. Oh! He also already has a baby with some lady he hooked up with once. My friend is also poor but she at least has a decent car and her own apartment in a nice part of town but she can barely afford food outside of her bills. I genuinely asked her, does she think having a baby with that person who will most likely not help her emotionally or financially is a good idea? Being in her situation? She said she didn‚Äôt care she wants a baby and it‚Äôs not fair that he gave the other woman a baby and not her when she‚Äôs been dealing with him for years. I honestly felt really bad that her self worth was so low and I really tried to convince her that she should wait to have a baby with someone who loves her and is in the position to raise a child with her. I don‚Äôt talk to her anymore but I do know her situation did not get any better since her baby was born üò¨ She does uber eats with her baby to get by.
Convince people to make bebe in bad condition << bebe due to poverty circumstances has to wageslave on 2 jobs their entire life in order to survive << Brainwash them to accept that wageslaving is normal and to have more bebe  (because bebe = happy!!) <<  more bebe born more wageslaving << me happy ugga bugga.
If everyone was smart the whole world would collapse like it or not the sheeple are the most important part of a society.
My ex husband and I had this argument (I completely agree with you). He told me that I didn't get to have an opinion because I don't have kids therefore I can't understand how badly someone could want them. My counter argument was that I am the one putting the needs of a child before the wants of an adult, but I'm the one who's out of touch??
Poor people shouldn't buy Porsches, which are cheaper than decently raised kids
I feel the same way. Having kids when you're in poverty is not only irresponsible, it's downright idiotic. 

The world doesn't need any more losers.
Same

The only people I do have sympathy for are those in red states who literally don‚Äôt have the means to travel out of state for abortions. 

If they can figure out a way to get an abortion but choose not to, then I have no respect for them. But for those who want abortions and can‚Äôt afford to get treatment, I have the utmost sympathy
Sigh; you‚Äôre talking about my daughter‚Ä¶ (And I half agree with you).
Part of the problem is that it is a cultural thing.  Sadly, especially in groups who are more likely than others to be near or below the poverty line.  It is considered a right of passage, a sign of growing up, a signal that you are a woman or a man.  Money never comes into it.  Your mother had you when she was 16, her mother at 15, her mother at 17, and so on.  So to prove yourself you get knocked up at 15 as well and all of a sudden you're a "woman".  Or you go out and "spread your seed" and have sex with whoever will spread their legs for you and now you're a "man".  And anyone who tries to tell you about the problems is now trying to insult you, your family, and your culture.
Accountability and shame are not concepts that our society is interested in anymore. Don't you dare mention that poor people shouldn't have kids, that's hate speech! Whatever, I'm resigned to the fact that this rollercoaster ride is almost over. The seams of society, as we know it, are coming apart. I just hope I'm dead before it gets really interesting.
On my local sub a pregnant lady was posting about where to get food because she couldn‚Äôt get anything else from the food bank. Not a single person said anything about how fucking stupid it is to get pregnant when you can‚Äôt even feed yourself. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and took the downvotes for it. Seriously wtf Is wrong with people, you need so much help that the foodbank can‚Äôt even help you anymore and you decide you should have a child???
I have no respect for people who ~~can‚Äôt afford~~ have children ~~but have them anyway~~.

Fixed it for you!
Yeah I grew up poor and hated my parents for having me and my younger siblings. My bf grew up even poorer and feels it‚Äôs disgusting that people judge the poor for having kids. To each their own you know.
[deleted]
As the youngest of four, who will forever be struggling to deal with the fallout of being born to a single mother in poverty, I have nothing but rage. On the other hand, having children cannot be allowed to be a privilege reserved for the class of people who unnecessarily make everyone poor because they are selfish pricks.
I have a friend from high school who recently had a baby and this was after their spouse announced to the world on social media how they both have mental health issues and can‚Äôt afford their apartment and are constantly begging people for money to pay their rent, like why would you bring a child into that mix? Poor thing. It‚Äôs going to have a really hard life.
Look, I generally agree with you, but you should probably direct your anger moreso toward the people that made life unaffordable in the first place.
I'm just going to point out the current situation in the United States as a prime example of how this post totally misses the point. Sexual education in schools is essentially non-existent. Clinics that COULD make up that educational deficit and provide free birth control and condoms are being shuttered left and right. Abortion is illegal in much of the country. Across all cultures in the US there's still A LOT of pressure on women to keep unwanted pregnancies, regardless of whether the mother can afford it - family and community members tend to emphasize the positives and how 'everything will be ok', (not to mention guilt about even considering abortion) and then after the baby is born that professed help vanishes faster than the father, leaving a poor single mother who needs government support.

Sure, there are certainly those idiot adults who WANT kids even though they can't afford them. But so many of the examples brought up in this thread can be attributed to societal conditions - many of those women would NEVER have had that baby if they had the education, financial means, and emotional support to make the decision that's right for them.
This is why we must not make abortion illegal. Getting pregnant should be a privilege. I apologize if that may seem harsh, but I see parents raising little monsters and I can only imagine that they will grow up to terrorize society.
But when you have them, you get all these fun govt benefits and free money, and you can keep more of what you earn in your paycheck !!!
I have no respect for parents that have children for daycare to raise. If you only parent on evenings and weekends that is a part time job! Daycares are holding pens for children.
It is less so about money and more about being able to create a home of family and love for myself.. which can scarcely be done in modern society with nor without money
Those Are The Worst, Hope Can't Be Eaten.
I also refuse to have kids unless I am wealthy

Down the rabbit hole of stupid those people are at the very bottom
Agreed
Fighting the urge to fuck requires effort. Many succumb.
Not everyone has reproductive freedom.
Agreed.
I have no respect for people who fight against employee protections and wage increases so people can afford to have children
Exactly! The only one's I feel bad for are those who get raped into having kids and abortion wasn't accessable and they weren't able to put it up for adoption.
I just seen on tick tic ,, a young mother and baby with no arms or legs ,, the mother choose to have this baby even though she was told the situation before birth :: I just couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing omg that mother choose to see a person suffer it‚Äôs hole life  WHY WHY as far as I‚Äôm concerned I think that‚Äôs a form of chid abuse
My cousin who lives off the government in Florida just had her 5th child. She tells me the only reason people think motherhood is difficult is because people expect perfection or too much of themselves. Needless to say, she‚Äôs a neglectful mother who has her oldest daughter doing much of the childcare of the younger siblings.
Yup. Completely agree. Have this former coworker who is a perfect example. She switches jobs every 6 months on average, is already on job number 5 since I met her, always something wrong with her current job, but this next one is soooo much better, until it's not. She complains CONSTANTLY on social media how poor she is, how she lives paycheck to paycheck, how she can't afford anything, how everything is so expensive (because of Biden) and so on... And she just pumped out her 4th kid. She is in her 20s.
And it's about mental health too, not just money. Most people are not mentally healthy enough to be good parents. If you're seriously unwell don't have kids. We are describing about 99% of the population that satisfy the criteria of either not having enough money or not mentally well enough. Disgusting those people are. Disgusting, disgraceful, and very selfish
as you should ... unfortunately the poorer they are the dumber they are. Sad for the world
I don‚Äôt respect me either but that‚Äôs unrelated
Remember when kids would throw a tantrum saying they want a toy but the parent couldn‚Äôt afford it? Then the kid would put the toy in the cart, the parent would take it out, kid has a meltdown. This is the adult version.¬†
"All that matters is that they're loved!' and the child is literally starving
It's a hustle to get welfare money or help housing security. I don't approve of it either but I can understand why someone in survival mode would want to pop out kids to get a chance for a housing unit.

Overall, I disagree. Housing is a basic need yet we need income and credit check in the states. Why can't we require the same for someone to bring their newborn home? People complain about CPS getting reported for parents with lunch debt. They're not feeding tbeir fucking kid, even if it's just because they're too poor. That's child abuse! 

I was neglected and starved for the first 18 months of my life. I was born for welfare although it was un a country w a low birth rate so people got paid just to breed, even if they drank/did drugs during pregnancy like with me. I was abused through that before I was even fucking born and my birth mom likely got the money and left me for adoption at birth. Why the hell did she get paid? 

I don't agree with poor people having kids. My country doesn't gave room so I don't understand why we encourage the poor to breed. If anything, why can't I get a credit every year that I don't have a kid? I'm poor. 

My best guess is more poor kids = more poor workers wbo will accept shitty pay and working conditions. I'm in the US and realize some of these concepts can vary widely across countries/cultures. People breed in the 3rd world and they have even less money than Americans (who are already poor for the most part.)
Its kinda selfish to have children honestly
Same I hate reading the story's under other forums ...like what can I do another baby on the way I'm the sole earner about to lose the house

Like why would you make another if you're falling behind  on your payments ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èyou ca t afford the ones you currently have!
I MADE A POST LIKE THIS ON A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT A YEAR AGO AND RECEIVED SHIT FROM ALL OF YOU. Some of you were saying ‚Äúeveryone suffers‚Äù as if they are all equal

I agree but in this economy any class other than rich isn‚Äôt enough to ensure a great quality of life. My mother makes six figures a year yet I‚Äôm still broke and miserable. Nowadays only rich people can afford a great quality of life like fresh fruit and vegetables regularly, a big house, the ability to start a successful business etc so even middle class people are setting their kids up to struggle
Blame rethuglicans then,   They‚Äôre ruining the country that way.
In poor nations people may not have family planning knowledge or resources, or right to refuse as a woman. Also economically kids may be necessary in third world country, 10 kids vs no kids can be the difference between harvested crops and starvation.
I‚Äôm antinatalist but I think this issue is much more nuanced than you‚Äôre making it out to be. While I think it‚Äôs wrong to have children in any situation, many people living in poverty don‚Äôt have access to sexual education and/or birth control. The birth rate is highest in developing countries because in those areas children work since they‚Äôre very young helping their parents on the farm and making them extra income. In the end, I think this particular argument is pretty classist and we can‚Äôt judge those people until we change the economic system.

My grandparents had 10 children they couldn‚Äôt afford because their version of Jesus said so. Also they grew up in a place where they were a discriminated against minority, so having lots of children meant someday they might become the majority. Anyone who tried to talk to them about not having lots of children were simply The Other Side, trying to prevent them from multiplying their numbers.

They were northern Irish Catholics. But I‚Äôve heard same reasoning from African Americans, white evangelical North Americans, Africans on the continent of Africa, Hindus, Muslims, Mormons‚Ä¶you name it. In each case trying to explain the economics of ‚Äúhow not to make your children nutritionally deficient and undereducated through your rampant procreation‚Äù is translated as, ‚ÄúYou hate us! You want to suppress our numbers! Fuck you! I‚Äòm going to have as many children as possible!‚Äù

more people who can‚Äôt afford kids have kids than people who can afford them
And then they complain about how expensive life is
Exactly this. A friend of mine recently knocked his gf up. He's never lived outside his parents house, his relationship is a dumpster fire, he struggles with depression as it is because of his job, which isn't well paying. I lost a lot of respect for him for not only being so irresponsible but also making the terrible decision to keep it. Children deserve better and many are doomed from the start.
Some of them don‚Äôt think anything of it because they grew up the same way. To them, it‚Äôs just their normal. Living paycheck to paycheck, meal to meal, unemployed. It‚Äôs generational.
Believe this or not, i know of women that have become pregnant for a Subutex prescription.
What if you can and want to raise amazing human beings but can't afford to?
You know you don't have to be poor, right?

Depending on your current situation, sure it might take a while and require work.. but you can gain skills and generate more revenue.
The evolutionary process has honed our perception of reality in favor of procreating, whether that reality aligns with logic or rational decision making is irrelevant. Fitness beats truth.
To put it into perspective. I think it's safe to say that up until lasy century, most (over 90%) of humanity lived in what we would call poverty or even below "poverty line"
And they managed and they survived and they were fucked but did make it anyway some more successfull than others. 

On one hand - life is the biggest gift someone can give you - on second hand theres a growing disparity that makes your life hell - like many storries posted here. 

What is fundamentally broken is that the chances for "good life" do not "even out". When you are born poor,  the odds are stacked against you - especially in US - there are some countries however,  that pride themselves of giving everyone "equal" start and same access level to higher education and medical care
Oh bait post. Popcorn time.
Tell this to the millions of people living in the slums of india
Some have 3-4 children üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Many people who aren‚Äôt AN feel the same way.
I agree with this, especially in the UK where contraception is freely available.
Most people think their reason for being here is to have children. Poor people seem to have more children for some reason. 

My parents had me at a very young age and so we grew up poor. Yes it was something I resented as a child but it did teach me things going into adulthood that others lack. I'm also not poor as an adult now and could probably afford a child, but simply don't want any.
I assume it's probably a holdover from when the majority of people were farmers and needed guaranteed bodies to keep the farm alive when they grow old. In some cultures like my own, starting a family is still seen by the older generation as a natural step in life, on the same level as finishing education and finding a job. 

My parents are more lenient than most, but even they express genuine concern at me not wanting to get married and "settle down". I can sort of empathise with someone getting pressured into starting a family before they're ready just to make their parents proud, even if I obviously don't agree with it.

Even outside of cultural norms though, I think a lot of people in the world still just aren't that well-informed about how much financial and mental strain and sacrifice is required to raise a child.
In fairly developed and gender equal countries people have a choice. But in poor countries they often don‚Äôt, as in girls are often married off very young, not having access to reproductive education or contraceptions, so then they are forced by their usually older husbands and boom suddenly they are pregnant again and again. In poorer countries they also don‚Äôt have pension systems so their kids function as it.

But why poor people in developed countries that have had both access to education and whatnot really are stupid for having kids I agree.
As a child that comes from this kind of environment it's good to know youd rather want me dead. I get your take but it does make me super uncomfortable
this sub always makes me feel sane again. totally agree and it should be common sense but you know what they say‚Ä¶
Used to work as an EMT for a company that handled several Medicaid contracts, and it was kind of crazy how many patients we had where the parents were low income with high risk pregnancies. Often they would be flat out told by physicians to not have children, because of the risks to both them and the possible fetus, but they‚Äôd still go and do it anyways. We had a number of patients who were born with minimal cognitive functions, that were fully ventilator dependent and total intravenous nutrition. 

It was really sad to see them be subjected to invasive and often painful care, ultimately extending their lives while not really having any *quality* of life. 

Their care needs were intense enough that the state had to basically fund everything for the families (as it should IMO, I‚Äôd rather my tax money go to that than pork projects).
children need food, shelter, and clothing, and most of all love. there are people that have so much love in their heart. They want to share it and if they can provide the necessities to sustain life, then everyone has the right to pursue happiness and share their love with a child they so desire.

If you choose not to have a child because you feel that you don‚Äôt have enough money to afford your child that‚Äôs your choice. 

I was born in poverty, but I am so glad I was born because after I grew up, I rose above my circumstances today I am not in poverty, and I live a happy life .
as someone who grew up poor i agree. i hate that i feel that way because those feelings are often rooted in eurocentrism & white supremacy & i don't stand by those ideals. but i will never understand why people have children without saving and making themselves financially stable & literate first. this is obviously discluding situations where pregnancies were not planned.

Stress, my friend. Stress. You see this in all species of animals. The animals under heavy stress reproduce the most. It makes sense from a biological perspective. If you're stressed, the chances of your offspring surviving are much lower, so it makes sense to reproduce as often as possible to increase survivability through sheer numbers. Rabbits are a perfect example. While human beings are capable of ignoring base instincts, someone under heavy stress likely has a lower level of consciousness and is therefore less likely to be able to ignore these impulses. You'd only understand if it you were to end up in their shoes.
Due to Natural selection people like you will be eliminated and those who goes to have children no matter what will pass on their genes.
I do think it's worth distinguishing between people having 1 or 2 kids when trying their absolute best vs people having a ton of kids or expecting handouts their whole lives. The first is understandable the second is just selfish. 

I know someone who has had a ton of opportunity (including multiple post secondary degrees paid for by mom and dad) yet still choose to live in a super expensive city, not develop a career, milk their parent's network for handouts, try to be an (not very good) "multi-disciplinary" artist, and yet complain that they can't afford a house or kids. They have entirely themselves to blame and deserve no sympathy.
"who intentionally have a child born into poverty"

They are irresponsible.   They don't intentionally do anything.
Sometimes people don‚Äôt choose to have then but shit happens
You have no respect for parents‚Ä¶.?
I absolutely could not afford the four kids I had in as many years. I adopted two out. All but the youngest is on a full ride scholarship to the college of their choice in the nation. The two with poverty trauma have such character and independence. They're far more suited for the world than their two siblings who lived easier lives. 
I dunno. It's just...sad to think poor people shouldn't be born. Gen Z would be missing out on a vet, a falconer, a civil rights attorney, and a guitarist.
‚Äúno respect for parents in general‚Äù lmao this is why nobody can take this sub seriously. y‚Äôall are weird.
"People who intentionally have a child". Most ppl dont
What would you say to someone who fell pregnant in a state where it is illegal and could be pursued legally if they crossed state lines to get an abortion?
I don't understand it or respect it either. It's so selfish and terrible for the child that will probably grow up with lifelong issues tied to being neglected in some way. But do parents care about that? Most just want to be able to say they passed their genes along.
But then who will fit in the society? Who will continue their bloodline :'(
You‚Äôre an actual clown dude
Ignorance is suffering, not bliss
Wish I knew better when I got pregnant at 18ü•≤
yeah. every time I ser those documentaries about African kids where "mum and dad have 13 children and they are soo poor they all have to work 18 hours a day, please donate 1‚Ç¨ to save them" I just laught. Like bro it ain't that hard to pull out
Yeah. So what? Got your Pronatalistic Feels in a bunch?,
and if it‚Äôs any consolation, some of them can‚Äôt even spell respect
You owe no one respect and no one owes you respect. Surely someone can point a shut finger at you fir something too though.  If your life is what you say it is, then clearly your own parents couldn't afford to set you up better, so you have no respect for them either.

I have sympathy for their kids though
Can you imagine how great it would be if women were allowed to have access to birth control, have bodily autonomy, and hold men accountable to the same level as we hold women?
In Canada we have family allowance. So theoretically anyone can afford kids? I know it‚Äôs not a lot of money but it‚Äôs doable
Any Canadians with kids here?

 I don‚Äôt and probably won‚Äôt be having any
We are the same.
Band aid
You missed paying property taxes to find their education if you do that also. 

And no, **most** of these kids aren‚Äôt going to grow up to be our doctors as we age. They think they‚Äôll be YouTube famous or they‚Äôll be flipping burgers waiting for AI to render them redundant or floundering with a liberal arts degree that gets them nowhere. 

But we pay for it. And the lunch their parents couldn‚Äôt pack.
It‚Äôs sad. I know a 21 year old girl who‚Äôs pregnant with 3 and she‚Äôs already bragging about how much government assistance she‚Äôll be able to receive as if it‚Äôs a flex with a man she just started dating. (And I‚Äôm here thinking about the quality of life of those babies)
This sub was recommended to me for some psychotic reason? 

This sub is just a circle jerk for nihilists with no stake in the future.
Biggest reason is often accidents, but sometimes people DO have children on purpose when they can't afford it. On top of that, no one truly understands how expensive children are until it's too late and you're supporting one of your own. lol

When I became a father, I worked as a pest technician. I now have 2 little girls, and I regret nothing. They were both planned. Could I afford it? At the time, hell no!! But, the moment my (now) wife came to me and told me she was pregnant, I knew nothing was going to be (or could be) the same in life. I couldn't afford to keep my life the way it was nor the way it was going to be in less than a year.

I can't speak for all parents who can't afford it, but I immediately enrolled in a coding bootcamp and became a software engineer. I now make 6 figures and still struggle to afford it. Lmfao rip.
Same for pets. 

If you can't afford to feed them well and give them appropriate exercise, don't get them.
Ok. I‚Äôm curious. So I have,to ask. I understand the lack,of respect,for the people who have kids despite not being able to afford them. I don‚Äôt necessarily agree. But I get it. It‚Äôs poor planning,at best so again I get it but why no respect,for parents ‚Äú in general ‚Äú? Some people do have the resources,to properly raise a child. Or even multiple children. And that‚Äôs probably what we‚Äôre lacking,in this country. Maybe, in the world . Property raised children. Which become functional well adjusted adults. Contributing to our society. That‚Äôs where the doctors and engineers, etc. come from. So I say,if you‚Äôre gonna raise a child,to be the next neurologist. Or the next heart surgeon. Go right on ahead. I had a bad stroke I could use another really good neurologist. So yeah. Why no respect,for ‚Äú parents in general ‚Äú?
Same. This is why i wont have kids. I am too selfish. I want to spend the little money i earn on me
Omg YES! Its so unbelievably cruel and selfish!
Nobody can afford kids at first but kids also push you to do your best if you really care for them . Parents that can‚Äôt provide could be because some unfortunate event or because they are not willing to take action
Are we talking abject no shoes, eating rock soup, not a pot to piss in poor or like. Small house share a room with your Brother and the car is 10 years old type poor?  Cause they are worlds apart.
As a (now former) child who grew up in extreme poverty, I couldn't agree more. My mom was a 16-year-old drug addict who dropped out of high school and was working PT at Jack in the Box when she had me. She was fed so much shit about how my life would still be so great because "love is better than money" and all that upper middle class jazz. I grew up thinking that having a water dispenser in your fridge was something only millionares had, same with multi-level homes, and dining out more than 1-2 times per year.

My childhood was fucking awful, and my mom chose to have 6 more kids (we live in one of the 1st states to have legalized abortion, it was a choice) to put in this situation which made it a thousand times worse. We never had money for anything. My mom has substance issues, so we were either broke from buying or she was dating her new (usually abusive) drug dealer of the month to get her fix. When we did have money, she would go shopping for Victoria's Secret lounge wear, that one fills me with insane amounts of rage to this day. She would let almost anyone watch us, including people who were actively using in front of us. She should have had us all taken away.

Having children is not a human right, which is why CPS exists. If you can not provide for all of your child's needs on top of your own and then some, you can not and should not have kids. Children are not accessories. They can't survive off their existence alone like a bracelet. We'll never be able to stop people from having kids, but it should be a mandatory process to make every expecting parent take classes on parenting and have their finances assessed.
My brother and his girlfriend just keep raw dogging because she assumed the child they have is a fluke.  They still live at home and have no prospects. Then she complains to me that my brother won‚Äôt let them have a boy. they keep the kid locked in her room most of the day.  Their families are neurodivergent so this is akin to torture.  The kid was screaming she wanted to go outside. Then when I suggested they let the kid go outside my brother threatened to beat me.  
And she wonders why the kid doesn‚Äôt like her.
B-b-but you DON'T UNDERSTAND! SEX FEELS GOOD SO I HAVE TO DO IT! I HAVE TO GET THE DOPAMINE!
Because some people are animals they cant control their genitals
Sometimes, you set out with the best of intentions, then circumstances change: job loss, health challenges, etc. can result in not having the ability to afford children.  

My ex-husband decided that he did not want the hassle of children only after their arrival and a few years into their childhood. Very inconvenient  for me and the children.  

However, I absolutely agree with your point that when you are struggling, it is not the time to bring kids into difficulties.
This train of thought has been around since Adam was a cowboy. If it wasn‚Äôt for the smooth brained prolific breeders‚Ä¶ crickets.

While i largely agree with this viewpoint, i don‚Äôt find it very insightful. What does a child need to be happy? These things mean very different things in different parts of the world, therefore it‚Äôs not obvious how much one needs to raise a child. My parents were not rich, but i never thought about how much we had growing up.

The US and western societies obviously have a different experience to people‚Äôs of for example, sub saharan africa, but are the wealthiest people in the US that much happier those on lesser means in poker parts if the world.

The comment feels more like an indictment on people who earn less, and to punish them for having kids, making them out to be less moral. 

Obviously there are bad parents, but just because parents will sometimes struggle to find the means it does not make them bad people.
This PoV vexes and perplexes me. We NEED children, or else our entire world will collapse. I don‚Äôt know what educated sophisticated well-off westerners are thinking will happen when they want to retire and there just aren‚Äôt enough young people to take the strain of supporting them. Western Anti-Natalism is basically a desire for a world where there js no future and no retirement. Without children you either rely on AI and automation which is miles away to the extent you will need, or you bring in immigrants who will soon outnumber your society and see little need to support you when they have the reigns of power. You can scorn and sneer at the pro-creative all you like, they are the only ones creating a future for our civilisation. If you consider the opening montage to the film idiocracy, the selfishness, indecision and over caution of the elites cut them out of the gene pool (I know it‚Äôs fiction, but it applies to social values as well as genetics). If an educated person chooses anti-Natalism they are vicariously encouraging this dysgenic/A-social trajectory.
I get the sentiment. But I also don't think the joy of childbearing should be gate kept to those fortunate enough to afford it. And I'm sure loads of children and adults who grew up poor would prefer to have been born compared to not being born. 

Maybe the problem isn't so much that poor people should not have kids, but we should fix the inherent systemic issues that caused so many to be poor without the opportunity to escape that fate. 

My parents were poor. Their parents were poor. We lost our house, moved every 2 years to whatever we could afford. Always one check away from losing it all.
In certain parts of the world, poor women do not have access to birth control , many leave in deeply conservative spaces that continuously demonize family planning and this leads to them having several children. Their poverty strips them of autonomy and makes them baby making machines for babies they really don‚Äôt have the capacity to care for
Your first line says all we need to know.
PC here telling you need to get a life.
No you don‚Äôt understand, sometimes having children is the best way for people to get housing and healthcare

In the state that I live in before the ACA you could only get health insurance through your job, and if you were not healthy enough to work, no health insurance for you. Unless you got pregnant then you could get Medicaid and I think they used to let you keep it for as long as your child was little if you were the only custodial parent.

In high school a couple girls I knew with chronic illnesses had to get pregnant before they turned 18 because they had no idea how they would continue to get medical care otherwise.

I follow this lady on social media who was on a weird reality show. She has serious mental illness and she made her self homeless because of her delusions. Because she‚Äôs bodied and can‚Äôt admit that she‚Äôs mentally ill she couldn‚Äôt really get help. But then she got pregnant by homeless person, as soon as her baby was born even though CPS took it she finally got a shelter hotel room. ¬† She made it pretty clear she was pregnant just for the benefits, she‚Äôs really mad she‚Äôs not getting that 500 a month in TANF now that her kid is in foster care, but she did get $700 in food stamps at least.

It‚Äôs a meal ticket sometimes. ¬†She claims she‚Äôs going to get the fast track to a section 8 voucher even though the waiting list is 5 to 10 years long she claims that by having a newborn taken by CPS she will get to jump the line. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true or not, but if it‚Äôs true, she was smart to have a baby because she wasn‚Äôt going to get Housing anytime soon otherwise.¬†

I‚Äôm not advocating for this baby was born addicted to drugs and had to be in the NICU which is why CPS has him, but still. This was the only way for her to get housing & that‚Äôs a social failure.
The rich create the conditions for poverty to exist.

You are suggesting the poor should pay for the crimes of the rich.

Be antinatalist if you want, but singling out the poor is essentially eugenics.
1. Sex education in this country is piss poor. Young women not realizing what gets you pregnant is far too prevalent. The number of young women who don‚Äôt know they do not urinate out of their vaginal canal is astounding. So accidents happen and often. 

2. When you‚Äôre raised poor, you don‚Äôt even consider the fact that there is a minimum limit to raising a child. Poverty is their normal. Why would they consider a world where they wouldn‚Äôt have children simply because they were poor? It isn‚Äôt even a consideration. 

3. We probably shouldn‚Äôt gate keep children to the elite. We should make it difficult for rich people as well. All humans suck,
I won‚Äôt have children, but I am anti capitalist, so it is a conflicting opinion where on one hand I don‚Äôt think people should have children but on the other I don‚Äôt think being rich or poor should dictate who does and does not. Because 

4. Poor people are typically POC. It was written into laws to keep POC in poor, over policed, drug riddled, poorly kept, low income, low home ownership communities. So making it a finance issue is inherently racist as racism is what our society‚Äôs pyramid is built on top of. 

5. Abortion is illegal in several states. Birth control is heavily controlled. Health care is expensive.

6. We live during a time where our taxes subsidize billionaires who pay their employees so little that they require financial assistance to keep afloat. Not only are they stuck in this cycle of poverty, sometimes the only way to get the resources to keep yourself afloat is to have a child. Many government programs aren‚Äôt even offered to people without children. Have a child and they‚Äôre all available. It‚Äôs a feature and not a bug. It‚Äôs disgusting and maintains a constant supply of wage slaves to create the value that billionaires own. 

Long story short - fight for a minimum income, free healthcare, comprehensive sex education, affirmative action and eating the rich.
I caped for this take for so long until I learned why this language is super insensitive to the Native American population. This rhetoric was implemented in real life, and it led to children being abducted by the US goverment, the forced sterilization of Native women and *many* more atrocities. We have to be careful when we say things like "people shouldn't have children". I do agree that you should be prepared for bringing children into the world, but I also belive that the goverment, who has a vested interest in a growing population, should provide support. Especially because child birth and child rearing disproportionately affects women. Men can literally walk away from a pregnancy, women cannot. And with states restricting or out right BANNING abortion it's not like we can't just opt out.
Not beating the fascist allegations antinatalists
You make good points. It sounds depressing if everyone operated this way. Anything could always happen at any point. You could be at the peak of success and be like I can afford a child now and have them but lose you leg and end up in poor state. Like I think there is some standing on the fact of society impact on kids and family. I can imagine ppl who could afford a child but not really great insurance. Then child grows up and parents are living within their means. Sacrificing a few things here and there but overall happy. Then child goes to school and sees potentially other kids with more and nicer things. Then from that prospective the child and his family is poor. Kids probably start to think their way of living is not good and someone elses way of living is better. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that simple. Bc my living with in my means could be different than yours and you could consider our lifestyle ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. 

Im in no way saying people who can‚Äôt afford children should have anyways. I am saying sometimes you can be at a point in your life where you are making money and all seems well& have kids but then you aren‚Äôt at all well and the people who see you in this portion of your lifespan see you poor and just assume you have always been poor and had kids anyways.


I should add when I worked and could afford insurance I paid 9,000 out of pocket for my first baby. My second I paid 0 bc of not being able to work while pregnant and temporarily on government assistance. First child I was at peak of my career manager of several departments. Made good money. Bc of health reasons I had to not work with second baby and went ahead and asked for pregnancy related assistance for just my second pregnancy. It. Was. All. Free. My doctor who saw me wouldn‚Äôt have know I made lots of money and assumes I‚Äôve always been poor and on to baby #2‚Ä¶.

I would say maybe this is why some chose to stay in poverty bc they get more help than when they worked. It‚Äôs life you know you gotta pay what you gotta pay. But if people see this or similar. That I paid 9,000 out of pocket with insurance I paid for vs nothing for government related pregnancy insurance. I think you would continue to see ppl in poverty having kids. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I am 100% in favor of shutting down welfare. At the very least, lessen the amount the bums get for every child. They are rewarded for having kids by being given welfare. It needs to stop. They'll keep their legs closed in a hurry if no one will bail them out. Guaranteed.
The drive to procreate is strong.
I think decent parents deserve respect but I agree there are so many who just have 0 business making kids.  I assume many of them get pregnant accidentally and for some reason just decide to have the kid.  Or they have a kid when they're in a decent place and then things go wrong like divorce/ break up or job loss... 

it is weird that the governments of most countries will generously bail out irresponsible parents.  but i suppose they dont want starving babies on their heads.

But yah its certainly bad for a number of reasons.
‚ÄúPoor people don‚Äôt deserve to participate in life‚Äù
I have sympathy for them because I feel like a deeply immoral part of the way the US practices capitalism is that children are a luxury of the rich. 

Some people deeply want a family, because they‚Äôre humans and that‚Äôs a natural human feeling. It‚Äôs not a need I feel, but I get it. 

We need social structures in place to support children instead of penalizing them, and we need better access to healthcare and sex education for all citizens.
No respect for parents in general.  Got it.
You do realize people's situations change right?
Your respect isn‚Äôt valuable
yes but many ANs care more about veganism/vegetarianism than this
You're spending too much time thinking about other people's choices. You don't have enough information to draw that conclusion because what is right for you is not going to be appropriate across the board.
A lot of people hope to improve their lives, and have an optimistic view of the future. And they especially hope their children will have a better life than them, and it motivates them to have children.

You shouldn't have such disdain for people who are optimistic just because you are pessimistic. 

You come from a line of 100s of generation of people who wouldn't be able to "afford" kids, NONE of your ancestor had the conditions you deem necessary for having children, yet you exist in this world.
I have no respect for people who have children NO MATTER WHAT THEIR SITUATION IS. this is anti natalism, your view is classist and conceivably racist xenophobic drivel. 

I fucking hate takes like this. When I first came to ANTI-NATALISM 2, it seemed like a much better space than the other anti natilist sub, but posts like this are becoming much more prevalent as time goes by.
Mods they're doing the eugenics thing again and you know I'm gonna point it out and get shouted at again.
I had a child when I was younger. Everything was going great then her father decided he didn't want a family and I was made homeless. I went from being piss poor to living very comfortably. I would say I only have all that I have because of my daughter. Before she was born I didn't have the motivation or drive to achieve the lifestyle we have, and the fact we were poor makes us appreciate all we have even more.
You will be happy when you start collecting social security and medicare because it is those children whose taxes will be paying for your benefits.¬†

‚ÄúI have no respect for parents in general‚Äù, I understand what you mean by that, people making poor decisions depending on money, world issues, etc, but you sound like a puffed up douchey teen trying to sound cool.
‚Äú I have no respect for parents in general‚Äù lol wtf
I've no respect to those that whine to other whiners on the internet instead of being the change they want to see.

If you can't handle things out of your control and cope in a healthy manner, go to a fucking therapist. Or better yet, go to an online counsellor who's cheap if you're poor.
While I agree with you entirely, it's also worth having compassion for both parents and their children, if only exclusively for the sake of the children.

I generally dislike children, and so will never have one of my own intention most likely, but after having a child, a parent plays a role in that child's development and we just generally want that to be as good as possible for the child, considering their future impact on society.

I don't necessarily express a negative view on someone having child unless they start to overstep my own boundaries that I've set with them, using the child as an excuse. That's where I draw the line typically. Expressing this before that line is crossed is unhelpful for the parent or child and might start aggression prematurely.

I would caution against having "no respect for parents" and find a way to assess the person regardless of their status. Do they make choices that impact you? If yes to, and they impact you negatively, then find a more nuanced way to express your disinterest in that specific person, and I'd tend to agree more with you. I don't generally have more respect for parents than any other person I meet simply because they are parents, until they've done something to earn the respect. But I still respect each of them at an equivalent amount before really meeting them. It's not a specific lack of respect for a person I don't know based on their qualities.
A lot more women are taken advantage of than what's being reported, most don't have a choice globally. No one should judge if they want to have a baby or go childless.
If rather be poor than dead
Children for some people are a reason to live. Economics isnt the only consideration.

If you want to go down the route of only the wealthy can have kids, then we have a bigger issue
I'll bite...I had kids on purpose despite being poor because F rich people. They already steal our lives and now they want to suck away our future too. Family is not a luxury reserved for the wealthy
Life doesn't always go according to plan lol and you don't know everyone's situation,so why would you judge so harshly?
How dare people procreate, which we have been doing since existence, suddenly now that it is "unaffordable", a phenomenon that only exists due to our capitalistic society, which has really only been around for a couple hundred years. 

Pricing out people from having children is going to be the downfall of western society.
"I have no respect for parents in general. But I have even less respect for people who"

I don't think anyone cares if they have your respect or not.
I have no respect for people who convince themselves not having kids is the answer to their financial problems. Quit being lazy if money is the only thing standing in your way. If you don't have kids and no money whatever you are doing ain't it.
The parents don‚Äôt care about your opinion or you either.
They might grow up in poverty and face hardships, but you will remain a pessimistic failure regardless of their outcome.
So just because someone is living in poverty they shouldn‚Äôt get the joy of having kids?
lmao this is the most fascist shit I've read in a while...

you just don't like poor people - you're saying poor people should die out, so you're also saying those racial demographics of people such as people of colour and refugees who make up large populations in poor neighbourhoods should stop having kids and just stop existing because "EW POOR PEOPLE".

jfc this is a tragic take
Wow, imagine if all the poor people of the world would just stop having children. I lived in India and saw the poorest of poor. Kids happy as can be. Don't have kids, then. The rest of the world will have them anyway.
>I have no respect for‚Ä¶
>I have even less respect for‚Ä¶

Pretty much embodies the intelligence of antinatalism right there
Good parents and siblings to play with are more important than money.
Because that's how life works.
I don't think we should gatekeep having children if you don't have alot of money.

Exactly dude, I wish I could undo my existence¬†
I grew up with a single mom in poverty too, and my poor mom she would try to go to work. But one of us was always sick, my brother was a type one diabetic, and there was one year where I got strep throat every single month from my friends little sister because their mom didn‚Äôt believe in antibiotics so she was treating them with oil of oregano or whatever.¬†

Anyway back in the 70s it was probably slightly difficult for a divorced woman with two kids to even get hired, but that poor woman every job she would get she would only last a little while before one of us would get sick and she would have to stay home and then then she would get let go.

When we were teenagers she started a job and her first day on the job my brother got hit by a car on his bicycle. I wasn‚Äôt old enough to drive yet so she had to bring him to his regular physical therapy appointments three times a week in the middle of the workday. She obviously couldn‚Äôt keep that job.¬†

And that was pretty much what would happen to her every time she would work. One time she got a job and a week into it I crashed her car so she no longer had transportation. Stuff like that. Our whole childhood.

"there are children starving in Africa" There are children in Africa whose parents use you as an excuse to keep their kids from complaining, lmao. I hate it when parents invalidate their kids by comparing their lives to that of an imaginary even poorer victim. You deserve better and you deserve to be heard.
I‚Äôm sorry dude :( just work hard to get good grades and go to community college after graduation to figure out what ur good at and what u wanna study. If u keep ur grades up u should def qualify for grants so u don‚Äôt have to pay for college! Just stay strong. High school sucks for everyone so just know that these lame times will end soon enough.

If you want out of that life, learn a trade. Electricians and plumbers are paid very well and are in demand. I'm sure your dad loves you very much, and that's something you can be thankful for. It is going to get better, but only if you put in the effort.
Could you try getting a job where you are? You could buy your own clothes and use it to shower at Y centres, laundromats and shit you want.

>Nobody is entitled to have kids

Unfortunately the majority of people don‚Äôt see it that way, and expressing this idea leans too closely towards eugenics for most people to feel comfortable with 

I completely agree though
Yeah I mean my parents were married when they started having kids, they were financially OK and they both had ultra wealthy parents.

But stuff happens that you can‚Äôt plan for. They got divorced, then my mom got a chronic illness, and my dad‚Äôs wealthy parents decided that it was OK for everyone to starve because he chose not to go into the military. My mom‚Äôs mom is the only reason I made it to adulthood. She was a doctor so luckily she could afford her household and my moms.

From what I understand they got divorced because he was financially abusive. And I‚Äôm sure she didn‚Äôt expect that considering his parents were being financially abusive who would have thought that he would do that to his own wife.

And because they financial arguments were centered around his Man of the house type pride I‚Äôm sure she never expected him to under employee himself to avoid paying child support because that‚Äôs not really a man of the house type of thing to do.

But, when you get married in your 20s You both are going to be different people in your 30s and sometimes it‚Äôs not a good thing
Kids are expensive.
I mean I don‚Äôt disagree but that could change with the weather. You could be ready and very financially stable until you‚Äôre not and then you‚Äôre seen as unworthy?. People say it about cats and dogs too but situations can change, are you willing to work your butt off when shit gets tough? If we‚Äôre judging parents then point the finger at the parents that aren‚Äôt willing to do everything in their power to provide
why would it be racist?? poor ppl of literally every single race on earth choose to breed irresponsibly
>I technically could afford a child

Sure, right now perhaps, but what happens when there's unexpected inflation/financial crash? People always operate on a perfect world scenario delusion that simply does not exist or correlate with reality. Or say you lose your job etc...  
  
(I'm not saying you haven't thought about these things personally just commenting in general)
Got into a stupid argument with someone online about this. They said saying poor people shouldn‚Äôt have kids is a ‚Äúslippery slope ‚Äú to eugenics and I responded ok then by your logic, poor communities shouldn‚Äôt be given any assistance accessing things like birth control or abortion. He was like WAIT NO THATS DIFFERENT
I feel like a lot of these people in these situations have the kid only because they'll get more government support. 

I choose to go childless, and when I tell people one of the reason is that it cause it costs too much, the reasoning I heard the most was "you'll find the money sonewhere" "you get more back in taxes" etc. It doesn't make sense.
It's not elitist and it's not racist.  These people are bringing children into a horrible environment with every DISadvantage and they're doing it on purpose.  Who knows why.  I have some very unpopular opinions on this topic that I will keep to myself right now.
>‚Äúpoor people shouldn‚Äôt have kids,‚Äù

Then just MAYBE take a look at why it sucks for poor people to have kids instead of lashing out at the people who point out that being born into poverty sucks.
Here's a bit of philosophical take that is not classist but st Ives to have children's well being in mind and produce well adjusted, healthy adults. I don't think poor people OR rich people should have kids - not rich in the sense if they are going to raise the kids with a lavish lifestyle - huge house, brand name, designer everything, limo rides all the time, first class flights, luxury world travel, etc. it robs people of the joy and appreciation of these things later. I have met lots of people like this and it is almost always the case. It is best to raise kids with a solid middle class to upper middle class lifestyle (even if you are wealthy in the bank). The middle path is best - not for parents to have economic anxiety, have all the essentials covered with a bit of cushion, but not raise joyless, spoiled monsters either. Moderation and appreciation is key! üëçüèª
It definitely is racist to say poor people shouldn't have kids. The situational anti natalists views do not add up, they are anti humanist verging on fascist. It's wild to me how people don't comprehend this.
[removed]
I feel like it‚Äôs more racist to assume that poor people are mostly of a certain race, like that iconic Biden gaff
Also many business now allow children to work part time
The MAGA folks want to make it impossible, illegal, to have an abortion. But they also do not want to raise taxes on the well to do to take care of all those poor kids being born. Sick and cruel if you ask me.
Yup. They need poor stupid people to work in their factories and buy their cheap poorly made goods. Fuck corporate greed it‚Äôs destroyed our planet.
It's how they kept slaves in check, poor people, etc etc. And it's still happening now. I'm just surprised the majority of people don't realize it.
Yep and don‚Äôt forget the more babies you can convince them to have for sky daddy the less resources the babies will have growing up, the more desperate they will be to work for the mega corporations as little cogs in the factory. ¬†Some states will let you to put them to work at 10 years old now.
How original. üôÑ
Sexual reproduction had been going on for millennia prior to the creation of the Bible. It‚Äôs not some master plan created by others to brainwash people.

I thought this sub was about philosophy, not crackpot theories of power.
As a Christian I must just add here that even religious people can filter out what is relevandt and not in biblical texts.
The bible was written so long ago by people living in an entirely different time from ours, and stuff like ¬´be fruitful and multiply¬ª is a choice we can make now, it‚Äôs not just ¬´something you must do¬ª. Women have more freedom, for a change.
The people that read the bible literally and ignore the perspective of it being a historical text are, frankly, just stupid and uneducated.
I went most of my school years in such christian communities, and I had to escape it once I entered college because these people were so closed off from the rest of society that it begun looking like a cult.¬†
Ah yes, let's ignore millennia of evolutionary drive to reproduce and blame it all on sky daddy.  We'd be extinct if reproduction didn't overpower common sense.
How do you extract money from poor people though as a church?
The corporations want their wage slaves. That's why these tax credits exist.¬†
Sure but we need to up the tax rate for the mega rich too. I think we should get rid of poverty all together. And then having kids would still be amoral lol, but a bit better nonetheless. I hate how people put poor people down before advocating for a better system in pursuit of anti natalism, feels antithetical if the goal of anti natalism is to reduce suffering.
My old neighbours had 7 kids in a 3 bed council flat, there was 3 girls in a home made triple bunk bed with their younger sister in a crib across the room, the parents room with the youngest baby, the only boy got his own room, and the oldest girl lived IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM. 

Neither of the parents worked and they lived on benefits and had like 10 random pets at any given time. 

My old best friend from schools family was also almost identical to that except both her parents were disabled and immobile due to being morbidly obese so expected their kids to take care of them and each other. Like 3 of their kids now have kids too, so there‚Äôs now like 12 of them living in a 3 bed council house.

People who intentionally do this to children are vile.
Meaning they are raising their kids completely on OUR taxes! And they aren't married, don't even have a planned "nest" for their kids. Birds have more sense, they pair up, build a nest, and then lay eggs! We should give little birdies more credit!
There are tens of millions of these people in America. I talk to them every day (state Medicaid office)
Trust fund babies are the worst.
So many women I grew up with that have this mentality. One particular group of friends, all of them have at least 3. One has 7. First time each one got pregnant they said, "this gives my life purpose" oh girl. No. I don't talk to any of them anymore not because of the hoard of children, but because it's painful to watch them growing up poor and dirty and with parents that pay no attention to them.
Gross...
Sounds like she‚Äôs being a child‚Ä¶ I know you say she‚Äôs not disabled but this honestly sounds a lot like me as a child and I‚Äôm autistic‚Ä¶

Your contempt should be aimed more at the parents than the kid. The kid can‚Äôt help her emotions and sensitivities without calm guidance from stable healthy parents, which she clearly doesn‚Äôt have. 

I have sensory issues myself being autistic, so I agree kids can be very overstimulating and overwhelming. But I don‚Äôt blame them bc they literally don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs their parents‚Äô responsibility to teach and help them learn to regulate.
Why didn't your sister use birth control and/or make her partners wear condoms?

Why not use Plan B?

I just don't understand how someone can get pregnant so many times that the abortion clinic turns them away?
Try to stop blaming ur sister and putting more blame on the abortion clinic that turned her away. That‚Äôs fucked up :(
Exactly!!
U should make a sub! I‚Äôll join!!

This is how bullies speak.
Exactly
Wait maybe the parent is taking public transportation becuse it‚Äôs cheaper?  Better for the environment?  Maybe the car is in the shop etc
It does feel like having a child is different than a Porsche like it might be a basic human right, like clean air and water, but we live in a capitalist hellscape, so, no, it is definitely not a right.
You think poor people are losers?
Shows how absolutely stupid people are
Just say you wanna see Antinatalists getting knocked up and be done.
How about first we just start by actually teaching comprehensive sexEd, giving out free contraceptives, and ensuring abortion is a viable option for everyone everywhere first? In the US not everyone even has access to an abortion if they *wanted* it.
But then people will get pregnant just so they can get an abortion for the incentive.

Or‚Ä¶ both parents work during the day?? And can‚Äôt take their kid to work? That‚Äôs common sense I fear‚Ä¶
This. OP is the the first to wonder what they wondered, and science has also looked at it.  The reasons vary, but some include:
- in some communities, the only way to have status/feel like a member of the community is to have a kid/be a parent (not that different than well-off folks).  
- what you see as poor, these people may see as normal. So to them they‚Äôre not having a kid in poverty so much as this is just how life is. Humans can get used to anything. We may say that a falling apart house is a bad place to raise a child, but to them it‚Äôs home. 
- loneliness. Similar to teen girls wanting a baby so someone will love them, folks may want a family so they‚Äôre not alone. They may not have much hope of getting out of poverty so they‚Äôre like, I guess I might as well.
But no amount of money in the world can repair the horrific vicissitudes and vagaries of nature in a cruel and different capitalist wageslave surveillance, plantation, police state, consumer-driven, indoctrinated, conformist hyperreligious deluded cog-cannon fodder, sustain the rich at all costs capitalist pighorror no escape, no exit hellscape; it‚Äôs all about the hegemony of the plutocrats and aristocrats and landed gentry and intergenerational Nob baby .00000001% being sustained in style‚Ä¶ Let them eat cake!!!
>deeply philosophical

Lol. Breeding is one of the simplest and dumbest mechanisms all animals adhere to. They breed coz they want to, they just don't give a shit about their child suffering.

>They don't do it being egoistic 

That's what being egoistic is. Parents got some goals in mind for the child, they don't need to directly benefit from it. There's no such thing as non-egoistical breeding.
Is it really that deep though? My assumption has always been that people in horrific life circumstances devolve into survival mode which doesn't involve higher brain functions. They take any form of pleasure/relief they can get = babies.
Yes. Catastrophic events cause birth rates and usually death rates to rise. That's not at all what this is about.
Blues the one sitting in the chair soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's not republican vs democrat, its us vs them. Don't talk about politics if you haven't realized that yet.
Last time I checked, how kids are made hasn‚Äôt change in about 400 million years, pleading ignorance to the process isn‚Äôt an option. Everyone knows ‚Äúraw pp in vagina make baby‚Äù.

This is such a patriarchal and classist take. Revolting.
Respect for what? Solving problems they created? Sentencing someone to death and 60+ years of wageslaving? I highly doubt you pat on the head slaveowners and rapists, you just have no idea on the topic you're talking about.
No respect for Pronatalists who wanna Natalsplain.

This planet cannot sustain all of us. We are pricing ourselves out of a habitable planet.
uh oh someone locked themselves in a vault before 2020 and had no idea what happened to the economy and the situation with even graduates not being able to find a decent job for long stretches of time despite hundreds of applications, currently being read by AI not humans because those companies get too many applications to go through otherwise

but no, people are just "lazy". that's why they apply to so many jobs, or even work multiple jobs. cuz they're "lazy".
You‚Äôre one of those people who tells poor people to just ‚Äústop being poor‚Äù. This group is stupid, but poverty isn‚Äôt an easy thing to get out of
what is so hard for you to understand?
But we have to pay for that decision. I know it sounds cold but it‚Äôs unfair to the responsible people
It today's age finances play a much bigger role in whether someone will be able to live a decent life. OP is saying if you can't afford to live, why have children? I have a friend who has 3 children and realistically can't afford any of them. What life do you think these kids are going to grow up into? None of them will own a house, maybe not even a car. No money for holidays, nice clothes, good food... Unless of course they end up wealthy somehow. The world is fucked and bringing a child into it without a decent plan is absolute stupidity and greed.
My mother was born into poverty and you want me to think she deserved that. No. Kids deserve more than anyone could ever provide, including those who are well off - but they're far less likely to thrive or be happy if they're born into poverty. This isn't about hating poor people, this is about hating how people decide the best thing to do in a bad situation is make other people suffer through the same thing.... while also making their current situation even worse by having expensive kids. If it doesn't benefit the parent and it doesn't benefit the child why defend it so viciously? Why do you want people to suffer more, and for more people to suffer?

THANK YOU. At a base level, with literally no thinking about the nuance, it sounds like a reasonable idea. But in reality, it isn't at all. They don't even realize how complicated this subject actually is. They are literally just slamming on poor people, who often times don't have access to appropriate healthcare or were brainwashed to believe certain things since birth (like abortion being wrong even though it isn't). These things disproportionately affect minority groups too. They are basically saying "poor people and minorities shouldn't be able to have the same rights as people born into better positions in life".

People in this sub need to look up and research what "intersectionality" is and how it plays a role in the everyday lives of the very people they are talking about without realizing it.
Raising children in abject poverty is still abuse. I recently learned that in the U.S. most children in the foster system are there because they were taken away from their parents due to neglect (which often is a euphemism for abject poverty conditions) rather than abuse, as I would have thought. Ideally, a child will have a loving home with a decent, comfortable standard of life.
Not really. I would've much preferred food in the pantry than a damn sibling.

For the sake of the children you absolutely should. Why give a child a shitty life because you want to be a parent?
Even with all these people talking about the shit they went through growing up poor, you're still advocating for it geez. Don't have kids unless you have money. Money= means of support.

Thank you for posting in the Subreddit. However, we are removing this post based on the fact that it does not promote discussion or debate surrounding Antinatalism (as per rule 5). Posts are required to have some legitimate ties to philosophy and/or make a valid point regarding antinatalism.

We invite you to resubmit your post with a question or discussion point relating to Antinatalism.
Yeah, I've noticed, but I really don't care, lol
I could see that but I think everyone here thinks everyone should not be entitled to kids including rich( just seems worse when you can't afford them and expect everyone else to pitch in...I say this also fully feeling bad and willing to help those children who are already here) it's more annoyance at parents 

It's kind of ridiculous how as humans we just pretend we have infinite resources on earth 

It would be helpful to all fellow humans to not create one more resource waster
My mom and dad too, it was good until it wasn‚Äôt. They were older though and mid divorce my mom went to law school while pregnant with me, with a 1 year old and a 6 year old autistic child. 22 years later she makes enough to fully pay for my college!!


A lot of people are going to fight as hard as they have to for their children, and work their ass off to provide a decent life. 


 I‚Äôm forever grateful for my mothers sacrifices and I‚Äôm grateful for my life/existence

it‚Äôs not racist- it‚Äôs classist and that‚Äôs prob what they mean :)
Ya my ex grew up in a single parent household and his mom planned on sending all four of her kids to private school (they grew up in a poor neighborhood and their chances of pursuing higher education were limited unless they went to private school)

His mom lost her job after sending her first son to private school during the financial crash of 2008, leaving my ex and his other siblings in the dust. He talks about it a lot and I can tell he has a lot of resentment over losing opportunities based on his mom‚Äôs finances taking a crash.
This is always what I talk about when I see a stay at home mom or a housewife. What do you do if your spouse can‚Äôt work because they get a permanent injury or for some other reason? What do you do if your spouse dies? It‚Äôs only a perfect world scenario for these people.
Thank you for saying it...I've been bringing this very same delusion up...it applies to so much and causes so many issues..and I mean across the board. What happened to just being careful...logical..practical..or just listening to that little voice that says this may not be a good idea no matter how much you think you want it right now.
Oh yes and I know that 2020 rocked people, they never ever thought that the free babysitter wouldn‚Äôt be available and when it suddenly wasn‚Äôt for months a whole bunch of people realized that if the free babysitter wasn‚Äôt available and they couldn‚Äôt find one and pay one they would lose their job and end up homeless and society would blame them for their own problems.

The birth rate has already been declining since 2008, but when they shut down the free babysitter and there was no help for people who had to stay home to take care of their kids, that pretty much put the nail in the birth rate coffin
No I totally get it, and you are totally right!
That's why I support Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Universal Healthcare. UBI would provide a "floor" that is stronger than a safety net (which has holes and some people slip through) and which people can build and save on. But yes, my point was philosophical and I am very aware that unfortunately the world doesn't operate that way - at least not yet!
I think you are vastly overestimating how deluded people can be when it comes to the quality of the world. Aside from that, there's really no point letting hypothetical situations that could happen to anyone or not happen at all affect decision making too much without some sort of evidence for it.

Hell, with inflation as an example, it might be better to have kids sooner so you can afford to care for them for a longer period before the inflation hits. Same could be said for employment too.
When I was 19 years old and on birth control I got pregnant because I didn‚Äôt realize if I had the flu and I threw up for a couple days the pill might not work. I know that was dumb but I was 19 and nobody told me.

Anyway I was living with my boyfriend and his parents basement. He was abusive and we had a drug problem.

He and his whole family tried to bully me into keeping the baby. I was like neither one of us work what are you even talking about, they said the state will pay for it. For the rest of my life? That‚Äôs not really how it works. Furthermore I‚Äôm not having a crack baby. This man thought that the pregnancy would make us get sober. Sure it would make me get sober, but what if I couldn‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôm the one who has to live with that. absolutely not.¬†

I had the termination, shortly after that I was able to escape the abusive situation and I got sober.

He ended up having a kid with someone and never paying more than maybe $50 in child support that whole child‚Äôs childhood. He was in and out of prison for decades. I believe he‚Äôs sober now but we are in our 50s and it took him his whole entire adult life.

If I had that I would have been tied to that abuser for 20 years. Or maybe not, I assume I would not have become sober and the state would have taken the kid. But still nothing good would come from that.
FACTS
The *why* is always important. But not important enough to excuse it.
Do you remember the young man in Texas who killed his friends in a DUI accident and he didn‚Äôt get in trouble because he had ‚Äúaffluenza‚Äù?¬†

The judge claimed that because he had never had negative consequences for anything in his entire life that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to properly assess the DUI situation he got himself into therefore he was not guilty. Something about not knowing Rite from wrong because his parents had just spoiled him rotten. Literally

Oh shut up.
I live in New Hampshire and 14 and 15-year-olds can work 36 hours a week now and I think they even eliminated the night hour restrictions.

Right after they changed the laws NHPR did an article about how Their bosses don‚Äôt respect their school hours and they blow up their phones all the time trying to get them to pick up shifts during the school day.

And I can tell you right now if that had been me my mom would‚Äôve been totally fine with me skipping school to go to work. And I would have been too, Until I got old enough to realize what happened and then I would‚Äôve been very very angry.
FAR more people are becoming liberal than conservative with age, so they got to make up for those they lost during COVID and due to old age. Otherwise, they'll continue to be outnumbered. The easiest way for them to gain numbers is not by appealing to those who are already living but by breeding and indoctrination.
Technically it‚Äôs corporations but it‚Äôs really just humans doing what humans do‚Ä¶ exploit each other ruthlessly
Those kids will be paying your social security and medicare.¬†
Your church that supports politicians who only care about their money and taking women‚Äôs rights away is the same one responsible for keeping people poor, uneducated and dumb BTW.
If we went extinct you wouldn‚Äôt be here, none of us would. So what exactly is the problem again? You wouldn‚Äôt be suffering cause you wouldn‚Äôt exist, and‚Ä¶?
God what a nightmare.
I would call child services on them
I would literally go insane living like that. Sets a bad example to the kids too
Yep he is perfectly capable of working too and has a skill in some type of labour. I can understand if one of them doesn‚Äôt work to be with 3 little ones but one of them should be working.
There is a lot in the U.K. too. Way too many.
EXACTLY. They grow up into evil, pretentious, oblivious bullies. Not to trauma dump here, but I grew up extremely poor in a part of town that was quickly getting gentrified. People never think THEIR kid will be a bully or abuse other kids, but my GOD those trust fund kids fucking tormented and tortured me for the better part of 18 years. Constant laughing and jokes and pointed questions. I don't hate children, but I do hate trust fund kids. Never met a rich kid who didn't have a streak for sadism.
I am a trust fund baby and I still fucking hate this planet lmao
Yeah, I have a cousin like this. It‚Äôs sad for me too so I am pretty disconnected from her.
Indeed. We call her the "Devil child".
Oh yeah no I definitely get angry at the parents too. But she's not autistic, doesnt have add or adhd, or anything of the sort. Yes she's been tested and whatnot. Shes just an enabled, spoiled, bratty kid that cries to get what she wants, because her parents showed her all this time that thats the way to go. She also tends to throw herself on the floor, and crawl like a 1 year old. Idk, perhaps its just me, and I know all kids are different, but this one legit bothers the heck out of me; I've seen many kids her age, as I had to help with an afterschool program back in Highschool. None of them EVER acted like this child. She again, acts like a 3-5 year old, at 8years old, which is super super disturbing. She legitimately still goes and says "Goo goo ga ga". At 8!!!! Idk, yeah dont worry, I definitely am at odds with the parents....and even our parent inlaws say she's not very welcome at our house anymore, especially for the holidays. Does that stop them from coming over? Of course not!! üòÖüò≠
yeah, being familiar with clinics i highly highly doubt it - like GP said it was likely a bs excuse. and now the kiddo pays the price for life. how fucking depressing
She was careless, irresponsible and lived in the moment is my guess.
Instead of turning her away they should have pressured her into long term birth control- implant, iud, etc. 5 abortions is ridiculous. 
Like we‚Äôll give you this one but girl wtf you gotta change something.
[deleted]
If you care about the environment you definitely shouldn't have kids
Not at all. 

People that intentionally follow through on decisions they know are stupid are losers.
No. Some of you Pronatalistic "Winners" wanna call non-parents "Losers", too?
So let the daycare raise them. That's what I'm saying. You do you boo.

Such an unintelligent response.   Do you do anything but troll?  The entire abortion issue, pushed by the Cristo-fascist in the GOP, is driving people the have kids they shouldn‚Äôt.  There is actual fucking science and statistics backing that up, so shut the fuck up.
A lot of people in the Philippines living in the slums have children. Rape easily happens in that environment, and abortion is illegal there. Plus, these people are too religious to even get an abortion.
You tried. You shouldn't
Getting Nutted for benefits is also revolting.
the topic of parents worthy of respect?  and kids born into poverty?  i have penty of experience and knowledge in both topics.  ive seen bad parents good parents and great ones.  Parents who deserve to raise kids and those who don't and those who improved greatly from sheer will to provide a better life for their kids.  

Bringing someone into the world is not solely a curse.  Being alive is a blessing and a curse all at the same time.  Of course its not good to raise a kid if you can't afford to, i already agree with that.

I have no idea why you're bring slaveowners and rapists into this.  If you mean parents who sexually assault their children then of course i find that reprehensible and disgusting.  Ive known girls who thats happened to and it messed them up horribly.  And even if i hadnt seen the results, you can certainly infer the results.

Last thing I want to refute is your claim that a child will become a wage slave for 60 years.  Thats just not true.  There are many who remain in poverty but many who break out as well and become financially more stable.  But that's almost more of a critique of capitalism and existing power structures, etc.  There's many factors that contribute to poverty and staying poor or losing money after making it.  Many of those things include bad habits and sort of a closed loop.  If you're exposed to methods of how to become more financially independant thats probably the most helppful along with self esteem boosting that you are able to and deserve to be happy especially with money.  Learning a variety of skills is probably the best in my opinion so that you aren't tied to one job.  But there are also learned behaviours like socially accpted alcoholism, smoking and gambling that are coping mechanisms that also keep one poor.  Ive had my own experiences with all those vices.

Don't go around and throw out damning buzzwords like slaveowners and rapists, wageslaves and death sentence and then also claim i have no idea what im talking about.  I promise you I'm not the enemy here.  There are enemies out there worth fighting.
Wageslave is such a disrespectful term to people that have endured actual slavery. Do you know what percent of workers earn minimum wage in the U.S.? It‚Äôs 1%. Working full time isn‚Äôt the death sentence this sub would have you think it is.
That's not why they are created but what I wrote is what will happen.¬†
This planet can easily sustain us all. The problem I'd that's not."profitable" the estimated cost to end world hunger is about 40 billion a year. So as an example the US could direct 1% of their military budget to provide food for *The Entire World*
I don't have money to buy a house, a car or go on holidays but still afford to eat good food and have nice clothes.

A lot of people who aren't considered poor still can't afford a house or a car - its called inflation and late-stage capitalism. So if not being able to afford a house is your argument for why people should not reproduce then you should be arguing that nobody except the rich should have kids.

I grew up poor and I know a lot of people who grew up poor and lots of those people are indigenous people, actually... its disgustingly fascist to claim poor people shouldn't reproduce. Making the absurd comment that indigenous people who have been genocided into the margins of society on their own land are greedy or selfish for reproducing is a vile sentiment.

You could argue for communism and UBI if you're concerned about people being poor but suggesting poor people should stop reproducing is fascism.

Do you know what percentage of Americans live in abject poverty? .25%‚Äîand the number of kids in foster care is .3%
A child isn't necessarily going to have a tough life if they don't have a ton of money. They just won't have all the toys of their peers. Besides, if people only had kids if they could afford it then america would collapse in a generation.

Cysec can be a very lucrative industry! Great choice
you‚Äôre about the age for dual enrollment. look into it and your first two years of college can be free and done during high school.
It‚Äôs a bit lmao, no reading the room. It was correct.
Exactly. And it feels like a fair and more true/useful understanding of the world if our goal is to improve conditions for everyone.
But wouldn‚Äôt that be like saying that the opinion ‚Äúembezzling funds from your company is wrong‚Äù is racist against white people because it‚Äôs disproportionately white people who do the thing that is being judged?
It's classist and therefore also racist. Something doesn't have to be racist to be classist, in this case it is. Class reductionism leads to means of addressing inequality/oppression/exploitation that still maintain disparity between groups. I think there are valid critiques of intersectionality in some ways, but to completely reject it in class analysis is a glaring error.
Yes and I‚Äôm sure he blames his mother rather than the man who abandoned his family and the children he made. They always blame the parent who stays it‚Äôs gross
This. They never imagine anything going wrong.

I think of this a lot when I read horror stories about family annihilators. People think it's about men being EVIL or having an affair, but it's money. There was one recently where a woman shot herself after killing her whole family. Their house was about to be repossessed. I think a lot of people don't plan for the future. They buy houses they can't afford, have kids they can't afford and it's all supposed to be WORTH it for the American Dream. Then they wake up one day and are tens of thousands in debt, or the kid has special needs and needs expensive care, they have huge medical bills etc.

Don't underestimate what Debt can do to you.
Something similar happened to a friend of mine recently. No one liked her bf but she got pregnant by him after 3 months of dating with no job, home, or car. She thought he would take care of her (I warned her abt that) and then the abuse started and now he is a felon and she is scrambling.
Stay at home mom here, my partner is a senior level network engineer. He makes a rather sizable income. We've already discussed potential scenarios that include death. When we had our first child he set up a life insurance policy naming me as the beneficiary. He also has me as the beneficiary of his bank accounts upon death. As far as his company and real estate assets, those are to be sold and the proceeds put into a trust for our kids. If I chose to not work for as long as possible, the money in his accounts and life insurance would carry the three of us for a few years, and that's factoring in my love of spending money. 

Children need more than just money. They need to grow up in a home filled with love. Rich kids don't always have it better, and I understand it's easy to think that they do- but they don't. I didn't grow up rich but I did have a ton of rich friends and I can tell you the majority of them struggled with addiction and they lacked true personalities and characters because they never had to develop them.
Hopefully those men have life insurance. In that scenario, the family will be financially safe.
My.mother in law says that her niece is lucky to be pretty as she hasn't worked really and has two kids. She also says that she is good mom and that is what she is good at. I guess I'm a troll as I work and don't plan to have kids. It's like thanks.

To be fair my hsuabds cousin is a great baker and could earn some money from that but nobody pushes her.
Good‚Ä¶
No way. Not my job to pay for other people. You‚Äôre only entitled to what you earn.
Texas is a hellscape of ridiculous judges and excuses for evil behavior. They allowed the gay panic defense a few years back and not long ago a man shot and killed his wife *on video* and got away with it because *emotions*. Texas‚Äô legal system is just sick.
OMG that is awful - right up there with the Twinkie Defense!
I don‚Äôt know what you mean by technically it‚Äôs corporations. Human beings run those corporations and make those decisions
Social security will cease to exist the second trump becomes dictator.
I don‚Äôt go to church. What do you mean ¬´my church¬ª? Did you properly read though my comment? And churches in my country are different from that weirdass stuff that‚Äôs in the US.
If I felt like that then I'd just go ahead and skip to the end.  Be the solution you want to see in the world.  Personally, I'm not suffering.  But you do you.

Seriously, if you hate humanity to that point why are you still here?
Ya I grew up middle class in a rich area and everyone at my schools growing up were hideous .. we moved to the rich neighborhood when I was around 8 and I barely made any friends til I graduated and went to college and realized that there are people in the world who care about animals and nature and who aren‚Äôt obsessed with designer brands and fancy cars. It was like heaven to find that there was a whole world out there where normal people who don‚Äôt care about consumerism can find friends 

I have a friend from growing up whose family made hundreds of millions creating food brands and selling them to Monsanto corporations and he has since become a trumper .. Everything he says sounds like it‚Äôs ad lib word for word taken from Tucker Carlson‚Äôs mouth. His brother is still cool, even tho he‚Äôs kinda crazy, but he‚Äôs not evil like my former friend turned trumper. Both have no career goals and have difficulties in the social aspect of life and I think if they were used to taking real planes rather than private jets and to having to work rather than trying to work as something to do, that they would have far less psychological and social issues. Being trust fund babies is prob what has messed them up so much.
If I may ask, why? (this is a genuine question)   
For me a lot of the reasons I advocate for AN so heavily is because of the way I grew up and the things I saw as a child. Now that I've "bootstrapped" my way into a slightly less poverty-stricken station in society (lower-middle class) I know that I will never be able to stop working. A lot of it is based on my feelings about capitalism and consumerism. Without that framework I am not sure I would've properly arrived to the philosophy I have now.
What's worse is that lost of the children do not have their fathers in their lives..... Most of these me I have met/known more than just in passing, as in sated my friend for a long enough time to see who they are. They all suck they're awful irresponsible children that no one would want to have to rely on for anything. What.. What?
But that many times, it just sounds like something else is going on with her.

Like something mentally wrong to treat herself that way and maybe people taking advantage of her.
I'm sorry for your condition, must be hard to deal with it on a daily basis.
Still, I don't think being angry at everybody (breeders per se)  is the solution.

People can have a peaceful and joyful life, I'm sorry it's not your case, but  blaming others for it will not help anyone.

It's sad that AN are all hurt by life one way or another, and I understand why you are all against procreation. Life was unfair to you, and I am truly sorry for that.

Yup.
i saw someone recently defend their having a child in an environmental discussion by saying they would "raise them to care about the environment"

doubling or more your own environmental damage in the hopes that your child will take on these values and somehow, idk, effect massive legislative change 50 years or whatever in the future, when it's \*already\* too late to fix things??

completely preposterous. these people are thinking with their gonads & gonads only
No I don‚Äôt
Agree to disagree.
Stop talking if you dk what you're talking aboutüòÇ come back when you realize that they didn't abolish slavery they just redesigned it.
It kinda is.
STOP asking Antinatalists to get nutted and waiting for up to TEN MONTHS.
"This planet can easily sustain us all"

Many species presently going extinct, because of us humans, would disagree with "easily sustain us all". Profitability is not the problem. It's sheer numbers of humans striving to live large at the expense of the environment and at the expense of other humans and other species.
Stop thinking between your legs.
If you cannot provide basic necessities for yourself, let alone a child, no you should not have one.

I was born into poverty and would not force an innocent soul to have to endure the hardships I have. I also don‚Äôt have the means to properly support a human life, therefore I will not create one and ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù, which can also not happen and then I‚Äôve dragged someone here to suffer in poverty with me. 

Poor people are not gross, but they can be by forcing an innocent person into their already shitty situation. Love isn‚Äôt enough, love cannot feed your kids, pay your bills, keep a roof over their head and certainly isn‚Äôt enough to survive in this world in general. 

**If you cannot even afford the basics for yourself, you should NOT have children** 

It has nothing to do with who they are as people either, but it‚Äôs not fair to a child who cannot control their environment, to not be properly cared for if you *literally* cannot afford to.
If I can't afford something, I don't do it. That goes for going on a trip, eating out, and yes, even having a child. People are poor for a variety of different reasons and I have met people rich and poor who are wonderful people abd rich and poor who are awful people. I still think it's wrong to have a child if you can't take care of them properly. It isn't fascist at all to recommend people wait until their finances are in order before having a child. Societies shouldn't have to pay for bad decisions.
Pushing (no pun intended) people who don't wanna have kids to have them anyway so your Pronatalistic Feels don't get hurt is not just advanced Fascism, this is straight up Natalistic Fascism, Natalfascism for short.
But hear me out. They don‚Äôt actually care about suffering in any meaningful way. That would require actually doing something. Their accomplishments boil down to patting each other on the back for not having a kid, because that‚Äôs important. Not making difference in the world to actually work towards eliminating the suffering they abhor so much.
You might be fine with raising kids in poverty, but I don‚Äôt agree with it. And this is an anti-natalism subreddit. If you‚Äôre cool with breeding more people into this world, especially into poverty, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing here.
Oh well then, collapse then.
As someone whose mother grew up poor: They are probably going to have a tough life. Say goodbye to childhood, kids who have both parents at work all day get to spend their youth doing the work a housewife used to. Going to shittier schools. Having to put up with lower quality meals. In my country's case, way too many kids are growing up in mould-ridden crappy crowded apartments they're likely to fall ill in.
Oh well then, collapse then.
Oh well then, collapse then.
Oh well, collapse then.
Oh well, collapse then.
Oh well, collapse then.
Oh well, collapse then.
Bot, i noticed that after but its still a terrible way to respond to a child sharing his struggles.
there are poor white people.
[deleted]
Actually he loves his mom and has only said positive stuff about her. He hated his dad cause he was abusive. He‚Äôs super close with his mom and sister. I was actually the one who thought critically of his mom not planning better for the future or possibly setting up four separate savings accounts to split evenly between her kids. He hates when I say anything critical about her choices tho so I keep my opinions to myself. I can tell he feels cheated by not having the same opportunities his oldest brother got but he would never say a bad thing about his mom
I think their whole lives people tell them it will just work out and they see people doing it so they figure it really does just work out. They don‚Äôt realize that these people are paying $700 car payments and going to food pantries because of it. People don‚Äôt talk about their struggles they put on this front like everything‚Äòs fine.

But the main problem is that able-bodied people don‚Äôt realize that everyone is only temporarily abled. If you live long enough you will be disabled in your lifetime. Think about how someday you may get sick enough that you can‚Äôt go to work but you might not die. And you don‚Äôt get free $.

But if I‚Äôm being totally honest the only time in my life I regretted remaining Childfree was when I suddenly became disabled in an accident and I realized that I was going to end up on the sidewalk because there‚Äôs no social safety net for people who don‚Äôt have kids spent their life working instead of breeding. ¬†Sure I eventually got disability but it took three years. If I had kids I wouldn‚Äôt have ended up homeless because I would‚Äôve been able to get welfare.

But also I was so injured I would not be able to pick up a child, so if I had a kid when I became disabled I would‚Äôve had to give it away
To be fair that‚Äôs probably debt mixed with narcissism or psychopathy.
Exactly!
What did she think would happen?! That's some piss poor planning
Im absolutely love when parents are able to stay home with their kids and think it‚Äôs great! What I don‚Äôt think is great is when there is no plan in place when something happens, that‚Äôs specifically what I‚Äôm referring to. The people that don‚Äôt have life insurance‚Ä¶ which is probably rare. The parents who have no plan set in place in case they both die. That‚Äôs great they you both have a plan in place! Also, shocked your in the antinatalism subreddit lol. I never said anything about being ‚Äúrich‚Äù so i don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about there‚Ä¶
Does life insurance pay for everything though? I swear I‚Äôve heard stories of people only getting like 10,000. And life insurance claims can be denied. The comment you made is exactly like the perfect scenarios these people think of and never the worst case scenarios. But I really don‚Äôt know a whole lot about how life insurance works.
I hope you‚Äôre against people receiving any kind of inheritance then, ha! Anyway no one is born into this world with their conscious consent, so I think we deserve to have some kind of income floor and a social safety net. Not to mention that the data shows UBI ends up being a net positive for society in many ways, and saves on other costs later on.
Twinkie?
Nope on both counts. Social security is the most popular government program and no president will cancel it. Also Trump wasn't a dictator.¬†
Oh, so your answer to people who disagree with your point of view is encouraging them to give up on everything and take their own lives? How graceful. And on the same note one of the main reasons why I couldn‚Äôt give AF if our whole race got extinct by tomorrow. Planet Earth was doing just fine without shallow people who have an ego bigger than the sun. The universe doesn‚Äôt need us, we‚Äôre not special. Now what I do? What is within my reach. I go out of my way to help others, I volunteer and I try to be a bit better every day than I was the day before, and learn new things and focus on my own. Not that that is anyone‚Äôs issue to begin with.
I hate it because I am just waiting for my dad to die so I can be free from labor. A little fucked up to have those thoughts but I‚Äôm forced into a system where his money is my only chance of freedom.

In other words, wealth corrupts people too. I agree with OP that poor people procreating is bad but I am rich and still suffer from some extreme existential suffering. It‚Äôs more than just money. It‚Äôs this nagging emptiness of like ‚Äúthis is life?‚Äù
no one wants your sympathy especially when it‚Äôs sympathy for weird assumptions that have nothing to do with the conversation you were having (but I get it, can‚Äôt win an argument, just change the subject entirely)
But maybe it's worth passing off the parents' genes so the child has a chance to make a difference?! /s
The prison system and sharecropping were certainly designed to reform slavery following its abolition, but the minimum wage was in fact a big win for workers rights. Granted, I think the minimum wage should be raised, but again, only 1% of Americans currently earn minimum wage.
?
Right exactly trying to live large, we as a species could collective organize into a sustainable method, it would take time but it is doable. We could irrigate lands and plant food and nurture other species to prosper (so we can eat them too. Sustainably) we already do these things, but if we increase the effectiveness of it it lowers profitably. 

Think of how much food you an individual could create if a building of 500 pencil pushers worked a farm instead, herded animals instead.  Think of how much water you would save from not washing your car every week.  The entire world population of humans could physically fit in just the city of Los Angeles so it's not a space//land issue. (We van physically fit 500 trillion people on the planet) 

Obviously nobody wants to live shoulder to shoulder, and not all land is inhabitale for humans, but we probably create a system that fit us all comfortably,  if we wanted.
lots of poor people can still afford to feed and clothe their children... as I said, I grew up poor and had clothing, didn't starve and even had video games to play and access to the internet.

SoCiEtiEs ShOuLdNt HaVe To PAy FoR bAd DeCiSioNS... okay, fascist.
What a horseshit baseless claim about a large group of people you've never met. You don't understand the sub, that's fine, just move on rather than publicly humiliating yourself.
of course they don't care... the more replies I get to my comment the more its evident antinatalists have an extremely limited world view.
Repeating your comment won‚Äôt make it true
Listen, this is very important: in America, there are disproportionately more poor people of color than poor white people. You know this don't you? So if 80% of white people are poor, 97% of black and brown people would be poor. 

The same thing is true GLOBALLY. Globally, white westerners own 90% of all wealth. And if you know this, you know how your statement "there are poor white people" comes across? It comes across as " systemic racism doesn't exist"

Even across Latin America people are discriminated against for their complexion. 

So, do you agree that white people have more wealth and power unfairly? Or have you really been living under a rock? 

Or do you think the wealth disparity is not a result of racism? 

Do you truly not comprehend why this matters? Or you just don't care?
People of color have less wealth overall compared to white people. This is a fact. The question is then "why?". If I was racist I would say "because black people are inferior". If I was ANTI RACIST, I would say "black people have less wealth because of systemic racism and white supremacy". 

You have an essentially functionless and destructive understanding of racism if what I said doesn't make sense to you. 

It is not racist to acknowledge that black people face discrimination and that whiteness grants privilege, it is racist to ignore that fact, to do nothing about it and pretend like it isn't real or doesn't matter. 

Same goes for patriarchy: women are oppressed, thus acknowledge and take action. 

Same for homophobia: acknowledge, take action. 

And so on. 

I hope you realize how braindead your take is.
I think you're right....it's like they think the universe will just reward them for breeding and send them money. They also think life is going to be like a TV show where everything works out, like This is Us or One Tree Hill. Well THEY had a kid, why can't I?  Then they have kids kids kids before they can afford it and figure money will just fall from the sky.

I'm in the same situation though, when you don't have kids and you're single, no one really has your back. Everyone rushes to help their friends with kids, or their kids' friends. Helping them out, connecting them to jobs, etc, visiting when sick. No one gives a fuck about you unless you pop out kids.
I honestly don't believe that for all cases. Some of them for sure, but not everyone who kills is a narcissist or psychopath. Being in debt with no way out...it's a prison. They used to have debtor's prisons, but debt is a prison in itself. Imagine being trapped, no way out, debt mounting every day, losing your job or not having a decent salary, kids you can't afford. Some people just kill themselves, some kill their entire families. I think it's more likely depression, anger and hopelessness.
Exactly but if I said anything she got mad at me. Now it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you say anything‚Äù??
I was curious and went down a rabbit hole, lol. Honestly I think most people are under the assumption "it'll never happen to me" and a lack of planning seems to be more rooted in that mindset. I'm pretty sure too that if you die and have minor children, they'll receive social security checks until they turn 18. I don't think it should be relied upon and the responsible thing is to of course have a plan set for serious injury and/or death of one- if not both- parents... but, knowing our fellow man, I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for everyone to get their shit together. üôÉ

I know YOU didn't say anything about being rich, but I've noticed a theme with some redditors on this sub. A lot seem to think people who don't have "x" amount of money shouldn't have kids and some even resent that their parents had them and that they grew up "poor". I've just seen firsthand that money doesn't necessarily mean "better"
It depends on your life insurance and how early on you get it. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúbest‚Äù or ‚Äúworst‚Äù case scenario in life insurance, it‚Äôs all written in the contract. There‚Äôs no gamble, if someone was surprised it‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt pay enough attention before signing the contract. 

My dad got life insurance when he was in his 20s and he got cancer at 60. He didn‚Äôt even die, or lose his job, it‚Äôs been 3 years and he‚Äôs doing fine so far and he still got around 70k. Btw we live in Greece so that‚Äôs like 4 yearly salaries.

What I am trying to say is, you obviously don‚Äôt know if those couples have life insurance or even a good one. But you shouldn‚Äôt be assuming they are irresponsible just because there is stay at home parent within the couple. You don‚Äôt know their financial situation, maybe the stay at home spouse has property that you are not aware of.
He wasn‚Äôt yet. He tried to be but didn‚Äôt have a plan last time. This time, heritage foundation and other conservative organizations led by billionaires have drafted a 920-page plan for him to undermine federal organizations and administrations (FDA, EPA, dept of health and education etc) by replacing anyone in federal organizations who doesn‚Äôt blindly follow trump with trumpers who will undermine our institutions. He will succeed even if republicans don‚Äôt control a majority of house or senate. U can read the plan on their website if u don‚Äôt believe me. Also, trump and conservatives in his administration plan to overturn social security. It will be one of the first institutions they plan on taking down.
U can read the full 920 page project 2025 plan for trumps admin here https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf
That's an interesting take on what I said.  If that's your takeaway from it, again, you do you.

Seriously, why does someone who hates humans stick around?  You still haven't answered my question.  Why don't they be the change they want to see in the world?

Sounds like false morality.  Someone so full of hate and lies you try to make yourself exempt from the standards you set for everyone else.  You say you're better than the rest of humanity?  *You're* the special one?  You say we're not special but in the same breath you set yourself apart as special by saying you do better.  That change is within *your* reach but somehow not everyone's?

If we'd be better off extinct I'll recall to your mind this famous quote.  "They had better do it, and decrease the surplus population."

But you don't really believe that or you would.  You're just lying and styling yourself as superior to everyone else who you think is unworthy of existence.

The issue isn't how you live your life.  It's that you think no one else's is of value.  "Oh, not everyone's, just humanity on the whole!" you decry?  Sorry, bub, that's everyone.  Humanity is everyone.  Everyone is humanity.  How noble in reason.  How infinite in faculty.  In form and moving how express and admirable.  In action how like an angel.  In apprehension how like a god.  And to you the quintessence of dust.

You can't say the universe would be better off without humans and say you live every day doing your best to justify your existence.  Pick a lane.

And you've also still not addressed my original premise.  Why blame sky daddy?  Sounds like you've got a chip a mile wide on your shoulder.
That's what you think, just look at the profile of people posting here. I'm not talking about anyone particularly but there is always a sad story, a condition, a sickness or a bad experience with their parents. You just have to check their post history.

People here are sad and resentful, I get that, and they decided to point that bitterness toward all the parents. So yeah you have to dig a little to understand why people have extremists stances on certain subjects and when you notice a pattern, it helps you understand them better.

You can make the bold assumption that in this sub, people have/had an unfair/hard life and they decided that sentient life should not exist anymore. Ergo all parents are irresponsible sadists.
There's no "?".
Lol. I'm definitely not a facist. Please look up the definition of the word.
Oh no, I‚Äôve seen it every day it gets suggested here. I‚Äôve had conversations with people here on the AN. None of them give two shits about doing anything to lesson suffering. Because they‚Äôll still die and suffer herdeherher. A useless lot.
If an indigenous people die off, their history erased, because they were poor on the rez, and listened to this nonsense. They‚Äôd celebrate. They‚Äôre not racist but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Showing your Pronatalism on an Antinatal Subreddit isn't gonna make it true, either.
[deleted]
Yes this exactly! They think it won‚Äôt happen to them. I know a girl whose husband died unfortunately and her son did receive social security checks and will continue to revive them until he‚Äôs 18.  And oh okay, I see what you‚Äôre saying about the rich thing now. I‚Äôm so paranoid about finances, I think it‚Äôs always good to have a plan B and even a Plan C.
It just seems most parents I talk to go with flow and kind of cross their fingers and hope everything works out. I think not having a backup plan is irresponsible.
Is it change social security or eliminate it? You've said both. Regardless of who is president, two things will happen with social security. The first is that the retirement age will continue to increase and the second is that ss tax rates will likely rise.¬†
you are
Sure, Jan.
Poverty leads to crime. Is your solution really to just pretend like inequality isn't a thing? Use your brain. Simply acknowledging the reality of inequality is not racist, it's totally ridiculous that when someone says "white people have more than other groups, that probably isn't fair" you call them racist, it's literally the exact opposite. THINK.
The stats do not show that people of color have lower IQ, that came from a book called the bell curve which has been thoroughly debunked. Some prominent figures still pedal the nonsense but that book is not credible. 

What is true however, is that majority black schools receive significantly less funding and have more overcrowded classrooms. 

Again, if your plan is to just completely ignore these things, I don't see how you can combat racism in any capacity.
Eliminate it. That‚Äôs the plan.
Nope. I am not. No matter how many times you say or claim that I am, I still am not. You seem to be unable to have rational discussions without resorting to ad hominem attacks.
Okay Susan, you‚Äôre people put it on display every day. The only way to stop suffering is not give birth. Point out one post where the topic is actually pro active on fixing the wrongs? Show me one charity run by this group circle jerking here?

Know what you can find? Boohoo life sucks! And I hate people who have kids! They suffer!  


No one wants to fix anything. Why would they? Then they‚Äôd have less to complain about.
[deleted]
Ugh. Are you really stupid enough to think that the contents of a single, topic-specific Reddit post are an outlay of someone's entire life? How the fuck do you know what any of these people get up to in their real lives or what they do for their communities?

This group is absolutely full of teachers, of healthcare workers, of devoted aunts and uncles and older siblings, of people who do charity work. But that doesn't fit your little narrative.

This is an absolute nonsense with no backing whatsoever, it just suits your ridiculous agenda of being desperate to discredit their point of view in any way possible. At least try and make some sort of argument, rather than just "Hurr durr I've decided you, some strangers I know almost nothing about, contribute nothing to society." Why are you even here?

Aside from any of this, the point still stands. Nobody who isn't born can suffer. People can focus on multiple issues at once, or at least those of us with the regular number of brain cells can.
I assume you are a troll. In any case you need to pull your head out from your ass.
It‚Äôs full of crybabies. Period. Move along Susan.
I‚Äôve never felt more confident in not having kids
Wow America. Y‚Äôall really hate us women. Like are we even ok breathing the same air? I‚Äôve never felt more confident or more sure of myself in this moment, I know if I had kids (especially a daughter) my heart would just leave my body. It‚Äôs confirmed I am sub human, and therefore an extension of me shouldn‚Äôt exist in this world either. 
Hello! I now officially am antinatalist now along with my original stance of childfree as of today. Very proud.
Same, if there is one thing I can be happy about today, it's that I have no kids.
I want to get sterilized so bad ü•≤
You said my feels. Why are women so fucking hated? Like, sorry for existing please don't vote my rights away.
Yep, feeling very affirmed in my choice. And I‚Äôm going celibate by choice today. single forever!!!
Unfortunately a lot of women will try to counteract our work by birthing like crazy. The brainwashing is wild
Seriously? Having kids in a world where the majority believe that rain rain dances and gods are real. No way! üòÖ
Do any women have any advice on financial independence and leaving a trump supporter?
Once Trump gets to enforce his nationwide abortion ban, women could get raped or have an unwanted pregnancy at any time and any age and be forced to go through the pregnancy. Absolutely disgusting‚Äîhow could anyone support this?
South Dakota doesn't even have exceptions for imminent death. Bunch of murderers, just like their demonic sky daddy.
We dont all hate you. Im a 27 M and an antinatalist + childfree. Im sorry half the country voted against yall. Please be safe.
Been snipped for a year and half, have NOT looked back since!  Also according to the votes a lot of women hate women.  White women specifically showed out for trump.  Something to think about...  
[K.Barbie ·õü on X: "Total White women & men victory https://t.co/S2U32VukbZ" / X](https://x.com/basedloverA/status/1854043920079929694)
In Trump‚Äôs America, the men will take what they want and then force you to have the baby.

If you are serious, get your tubes tied
The first step of achieving Moksha is to be detached from this material world and all it's trappings. Sadly the natalists do not realize that they will be trapped here by their own actions for a very long time.
Same here. I was thinking about it because I found someone that I love and care about a lot. But, after this- knowing that my life is based on being an incubation chamber... Hell... No
Look on the bright side, at least we're not being genocided.... yet
One of the first things I said to my spouse when I saw the results: I'm so glad we don't have kids.
I love that my reproductive organs are literally ashes, incinerated as medical waste.
Exactly how I feel. In fact, my only comforting thought today is, "At least I don't have any children."
Exactly my thoughts! I kept checking the news and once it became clear that Trump won again, I immediately thought - thank god that I am, was and will always be child free.
I have decided today to finally make plans to get my tubes removed. I‚Äôm going to be proactive about it and try to do this as soon as possible. 
I refuse to birth a child . You will not fucking make me .
Stop having sex with men. They don't even know how to please us anyway. Stay away from them and protect yourself.
Glass half full: how freaking good does it feel knowing that whatever happens next will only happen to us as we don't have to worry about our kids' futures? Obviously, it is going to be a complete shit show for the entire country and planet, but you take the balm where you find it!
Yet we‚Äôre the heartless ones.
I was leaning towards not having kids. Now I am advocating every not to have kids.
Working on getting a permanent solution hopefully it‚Äôd very soon and done with too
I will never forget an ex-friend of mine BEFORE she was ever pregnant saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be so scared for my daughter‚Äôs future.‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt know what to say because literally, just don‚Äôt do it then? And then when she got pregnant after telling me ‚Äúhow hard they were trying‚Äù (ew PLEASE why do breeders do this), she found out she was having a girl. Said the same thing. That time, I said ‚Äúyeah. Oh well.‚Äù And she got kind of annoyed with me. Like‚Ä¶we know your concern is performative because if you‚Äôre aware of how bad things are and you didn‚Äôt care enough to NOT subject another person to this shit show, then you don‚Äôt really care. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself if I brought life into this world under these conditions. I‚Äôm so thankful I got my tubal a year ago üòÖ
Honestly!!! it really shows that they really don‚Äôt care. I really wanna get birth control badly tbh
Unpopular opinion here but it's not Trump the one who's at fault for such communist views; he's just a politician trying to grab the most votes, so he'll shift his retorics as the wind blows, like every politician addressing his electorate.It's the *general population* that supports this.I've seen this trend in Romania ‚Äîa country who's faced Ceau»ôescu's ban on contraception. There's still a huge chunk of the populace, both old and young, who feverishly support abortion-bans because "God says it's murder!"

Trump will enforce no such law unless its massively supported by people. And it surely *is*. I've been following the news all day and, when interviewed, a young woman stated that she is anti-abortion because of her ethnicitiy's moral values.

Trump isn't the real enemy; it's his *voters* who back this up.
I want to get sterilized so bad but I also don‚Äôt have any money, I just hope I‚Äôll be able to by the time I can afford it
Likewise!!!!
>Like are we even ok breathing the same air?

"It's fixable" - replies the incel death squad while tying a noose to the crane arm. /s
I respected America , however abortion ban was the stupidest decision they ever made.
I cannot begin to tell you how many of my friends who are mothers have reached out to me in the last 24 hours in an absolute panic. My heart breaks for them, and I am so thankful that I did not become one of them.
Samesies
Preach. Preach. Preach.
yeah. same.
Today was a sad day for America but hasn't changed the fact I do not need AN as a justification for the reason I do not have or want kids.

But what has happened today is a good reason
I'm really feeling like a genius right now
They both sucked but, he just sucked more.
You go sis! Get those tubes tied!
Damn, that last sentence really drives the point home
You mean the age old pay gap didn't give you a hint to how unvalued we are?

My friend had to threaten abortion to get her procedure
they don‚Äôt just hate women, they hate every gender, we‚Äôre designed to be miserable unless we‚Äôre lucky or overwork to the point of permanent systemic fatigue
For all the women reading this thread, please get your eggs frozen. Reproducing on itself is immoral act. By doing this, you are contributing to the better world üëç. Men should do their vasectomies done too.
Sure it was misogyny and not, y'know, **fucking genocide being a deal breaker?**

Pro-genocide voters prefer Trump and there was no (major) anti-genocide candidate in the election where the big issue was genocide. Y'know. Israel's 70+ year genocide of the Palestinian people. *One of our big talking points as to why a lot of us are antinatalist be it the massive amounts of suffering being inflicted and/or how it displays humanity is a failed and cruel species that deserves to go extinct.*
[removed]
These days everything I read on Reddit just makes me ever more grateful I stuck to my guns and didn‚Äôt have kids.
You would be shocked to know a lot of states yesterday have voted to keep abortion legal.
Same lmao
Problem is, we won‚Äôt have any choice pretty soon. They will force us to get pregnant. They will end no fault divorce. They will get rid of birth control and prophylactics.
I suppose it‚Äôs good that this election showed how little internet opinions reflect on the general population.
Wish I got sterilized long time ago 1980
American hates men waaaay more than women ü§°
There‚Äôs a reason ‚Äúimpregnable‚Äù is a synonym for invulnerable. Being sterilized feels like the only thing left that prevents subjugation. If you take your own fertility away, men can still hurt you, but they cannot take away your financial freedom. 

I‚Äòve never been prouder to help flush the American birth rate down the toilet.
~50% of women voted for trump?..
Having kids is selfish
I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll say child free people can‚Äôt vote because we don‚Äôt care about the future.
I really can't fault the logic.¬† Cripes.¬† I was astonished that it happened and...and yeah.¬† America has shown it's values.


As a dude, for what it's worth...I'm sorry.
Gee.. forgot about this sub. We should rename it "cave dwellers."
I realized I was subhuman early on because I was raised in a Muslim household. So I left my family, rejected the religion, explored my sexuality, rejected the concept of motherhood (especially for the infinite medical complications), decentered males, and found lots of female friends that supported me along the way and helped me build my career. 

I am the most successful person in my family now. Any financial success will go towards building up other women (and none will go to my male relatives).
Nothing to do with AN
Thank you all. You're doing the future a great service.
More conservative families will have more children increasing to percentage of conservative to progressive population.

Society becomes more socially conservative.

Mission accomplished.
How do you think us men feel? Men aren't human beings we are human doings. As soon as we can't provide we are "subhuman" and don't deserve any rights like normal humans do
Same!!!! I have friends who actively want children and if this has not changed that for them then personally they‚Äôre far more selfish than I even thought.
Nobody cares catlady.
The majority of women voted for Trump lol I think most women don‚Äôt consider it as huge of an issue because roe vs wade was decided to be overturned by the supreme courts. It is now up to your state. Voting for Kamala wouldn‚Äôt have changed that. There are also a ton of organizations that will help women get abortions if they are in a place that doesn‚Äôt allow it apparently. People spend money on stuff they need pretty much daily‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt get abortions everyday. The average woman knows that there are multiple methods of birth control that can be combined to give us a damn near 0 percent risk of pregnancy. Fun fact: more abortions actually happened after roe vs wade was overturned‚Ä¶ women are still getting plenty of abortions. If you think the average woman just ‚Äúhates‚Äù herself and feels that that is why they voted then I would suggest you try to look for other reasons why people wouldn‚Äôt have voted for Kamala and/or would have voted for Trump. Hint: polices that aren‚Äôt abortion
What rights got tooken away from YOU as of right now???? Please tell me
Your genetic code will end with you. That's when you really die. They say you die twice, once when your heart stops, and once when your name is uttered for the last time. No kids, no one to remember, no proof of existence, zero point to life. Good luck.
53% of white women agreed with Trump and voted for him.  You no longer get to dictate women's views and political leaning.  They voted against you.  

Next time, maybe don't act like women's wants are the only things that matter in the political side of life, people want more than you.  You being a woman is not paramount in the lives of everybody, and the people banded together to tell you that. 

Good.  Don't have kids.  We will.
On behalf of all conservatives, I commend your decision. What an awesome thing for the world.
[deleted]
You arent hated, you are respected and loved. ¬† The elitist propoganda machine , the epstein machine, the diddy machine, is trying to pit you against what is real. ¬† See reality take the red pill . ¬† ( Notice how almost all of kamalas supporters were involved with epstein and diddy )
This is insane. And I love women. 

Sincerely,
A woman
If u think america hates women that badly then think again. U haven't seen the middle east and Muslim societies. Not saying this is ok but yk. I also support u not having kids.
Good for you, but can we not use "you hate women" every time something doesn't happen as you want it?
Close your legs. Have meaningful relationships. Choose your partner carefully. A win-win situation for everyone!
Oh cool. Maybe more Liberals will join the movement now. Cause before I only ever had Liberals disliking me being against having children. Maybe Trump is a blessing in disguise
Women, when they can't slore around with impunity: I'm a sub humaaaannn üò≠
It's the United STATES of America.  The STATES still have all the power to decide.  The federal government should have extremely limited power (as spelled out in the Constitution).  Local and state governments are easier for people to influence.

What about all the 500,000 daughters which are being aborted yearly?
We don't hate women, we just really hate far leftists.
All the moderates are on board with us üòÇ

It is a selfless stance given the state of affairs. You should be proud of yourself üíï
Welcome haha
Welcome to the cool club üòé
Go to the childfree subs and find out which doctors can do that for you.
Schedule it asap. It took me about 6-8 weeks for the consult & then surgery. Maybe about $350 with insurance in network. I‚Äôve had laparoscopic surgery before and this one was a piece of cake compared to my first one for my gallbladder. The scars are barely visible now too.  I would do it while you can if you are absolutely certain that‚Äôs the right choice for you.
That's a good idea ü´°
Got sterilized back in June because project 2025 scared the shit out of me and I had always wanted to get it done. It was the right thing to do for me. I‚Äôve heard doctors‚Äô offices have been ringing off the hook with men and women calling to get sterilized.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Djia_WkrVO3S4jKn6odNwQk7pOcpcL4x00FMNekrb7Q/htmlview?usp=sharing#
Right, good for you. At least you‚Äôll have some control.
4b - good for you
Not sure the latter tracks. You can still find love.
The cope is pretty strong with this one
I wish we were still in a world where that's what people believed. It would be a major upgrade.
Believing in a higher power is literally a normal part of human civilizations.

  
Reddit atheists are midwits.
I‚Äôm not an expert but my advice would be make sure to have your own separate bank account. Start putting in funds when you can there. Create a plan, and don‚Äôt tell your husband until you‚Äôve spoken to a lawyer. I am sorry you are going through this and wish you the best in the future.
Christian males. They see women as below them, their only purpose in life is to produce children. It doesn't matter to them what age that woman is, or how that child is made. The only thing that matters to them is that women continue to produce children.
Women have found ways to abort since forever. They‚Äôre unsafe, sadly, but abortion is never going to be fully banned.
Excessive amounts of vitamin c can supposedly jump start your period. Might be a natural abortion method.
It‚Äôs already happening in many states
I know it‚Äôs so disgusting and my heart breaks for those affected there. I vacationed in SD last year right after I scheduled my surgery for my bisalp and I literally had a thought that my birth control could have failed before that week and I‚Äôd be forced to bleed out in the badlands üòÖ
Mid 30s straight male from Canada. Already snipped. I am also on their side. Shits messed up...
Thank you, friend. ‚ô•Ô∏è
There will definitely be a rise in that and vasectomies. It‚Äôs going to be a combination of the handmaids tale and idiocracy.
Cool spiritual concept but there‚Äôs no such thing
Sometimes I wonder that if there is reincarnation it  happens partly through having children or if it‚Äôs some other way
Encourage your partner to get sterilized.  Vasectomies are faster and easier to recover from.
Gender based discrimination is the first step in genocide against a person of a different sex, limiting their rights, eliminating their rights..
Trans people will be first for genocide, then other minorities. Meanwhile women will be murders via forced pregnancy and birth.
That‚Äôs hot
That's what I've been saying, too. The best thing I ever did for my kids was not have them. I've felt better and better about that decision with each passing year.
Go to planned parenthood and stock up or get a IUD. Who knows if BC will be legal for long. It's on the list not just because of forced birth agenda, but also to control trans and menopausal health care. Mostly the exact same hormones, so to get rid on one, all would be affected.

Same as how the abortion procedure for miscarriages is just as illegal as elective abortions.
Every single one of those people are so deeply stupid and brainwashed I seriously hope they reap the consequences of their actions. There is not logical argument against abortion and I‚Äôll never respect anyone who thinks there is.
This seems to be true, especially since Trump used to be pro-choice. The religious fruitcakes are back at it again, ruining America for everyone, just because they believe that their magical sky daddy told them to. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yes. Trump is a symptom of a problem. We know what he represents‚Äîthe deep rooted racism and sexism‚ÄîIf you replace Trump with anyone, our response remains the same.
This was calculated, though. Not just in the short term. I almost view trump as a puppet at this point, it‚Äôs those operating in the background, not center stage, that have the real power. This man is not cognitively intact enough to be the brains behind any operation at this point. The rhetoric toward women and controlling reproductive care sends women backward and plays on the unconscious (and conscious in many cases) misogyny. They need us to be compliant and conservative to retain our power. Women are becoming more enlightened and more liberal. This is a way to secure power and limit our influence. Yes his followers are also to blame too.
Most people do NOT support restricting abortion, including, incredibly, many who were dumb enough to vote for him.  Antiabortion ideas have always been fringe.
Both are the enemy.
No need for an s, crane hanging will be reality
American here, I lost respect for what this country is a long time ago. I respect the idea of America that never was and never will be real.
Antinatalism is not an attempt to justify not having children. That does not need to be justified.

The perpetrator has the "legal" (metaphorical here, as procreation is legal in the same way slavery was) burden of proof (in other words, the ones who procreate are the ones who have to try and explain why).   The only burden of proof an antinatalist has is epistemic, and it's trivial to demonstrate, and does not require opinions.
Yeah you sure showed em
Both sides support Israel. America wants to maintain a strategic, geographic hold on the region and cannot leave Israel to be destroyed. America will never not support Israel.

You people don't have any critical thinking skills, I swear.

They can take away our financial freedom.  They can deny us credit without a male signature.  Women couldn‚Äôt even get a business loan without a male signature until 1988.
Dumb people always breed more. No winning.

It doesn't work that way.  Kids are not extensions of parents, and many of them will reject their parents' political views.
Wrong.
Don't threaten me with a good time üòè
When humanity starts an all-out nuclear war and destroys the world, or when the sun explodes, none of this legacy nonsense will matter. You know what will have mattered? The lessening of suffering in the world.
Damn did you die? You didn't finish your comment.
Show me one picture with Kamala Harris and Epstein together. On the other hand I could find 10 pictures of Trump and Epstein/ Diddy together. But yes other people are the ones that need to wake up lol.
The IQs of Trump supporters are lower than the deepest ocean trenches.
I completely understand the Middle East is a terrible place for women. That has nothing to do with the fact that our own country is becoming worse and worse for women here.
What are you even talking about? Are you okay?
Could you be any more unintelligent? I‚Äôm married and have been with my husband for 9 years. Apparently I have a good point when the low iq incels start to come around.
What about the thousands of women who will die from forced childbirth?
Elon Musk supports Trump, I‚Äôd hardly call that moderate.
This. I found my doc there, and it was the best decision I've made in my adult life.
Currently looking on that sub for a doctor who can provide a bisalp in NYC, will report back if I find success in that üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è
I also found my doctor there. Got my tubes removed 8 years ago. Couldn‚Äôt be happier about my choice.
Yes do it before they make it illegal I‚Äôve been scrambling just in case this happened
Maybe but most people are looking for love also want sex. Sex can lead to babies. Unless you can find in asexual or sex repulsed person, i wish them luck. But i‚Äôve been volcel for a looonngg time now.
Let us cut off our noses to spite our face!
Facts. What happened to people that were religious that had morals? Why are people that are religious now the meanest and most hateful?
Yeah, I think that was their point. Do you lack reading comprehension or something
Believing in a fictional character is normal. Okay.
U haven't seen Muslim men if u think Christian males r bad. Religious men in general
people gonna be stockpiling that abortion drug and selling it on the black market, or bringing it over from canada or mexico.

As long as it's early in the pregnancy, like before the placenta forms.
But also get sterilized yourself. Rape is about to become fully legal.
Those religious nutters are not destroying just America. They're everywhere and more vocal than ever.
Agree with everything you said, except there‚Äôs absolutely Nothing Communist about Trump. Communism isn‚Äôt fascism. A lot of fascists have usurped the name of Communism, and American Conservatives have very successfully slandered the names of Communism, Socialism, and Anarchism, but that‚Äôs not what Communism is.
Yeah but I do like Trump , excet for the abortion shit he supposedly pulled via judges
Then explain to me why people do use it as a justification then please
So what you're saying is Latin, Muslim, and Latter Day Saints people are culturally more stupid?  

Pretty bigoted of you.
Some will. 

Most don't - because the more they understand the world around them, the more they understand that their parents are wiser than they may have initially given them credit for. 

Especially when it comes time to become parents themselves.

When I was 17 I thought my father was an idiot. When I turned 21 I realized he was one of the smartest men I have ever known.  It was truly amazing how much the old man had learned in just 4 short years.

Oh one of those.. nothing matters cause maybe the world ends? Lol again, when your 80 and realize the world still turns and there is a tomorrow.. you will wish you had a family. Go ahead and bank of nuclear war though lol
they accidentally logged into their alt in a non-private browser and it kicked them out. nothing like a markov-chain-named account made this year to tell you they've never been banned before/don't have multiple accounts.
Their sheer amount of intelligence that Trumpets lack is unfathomable.
Alright, let me clarify with a touch of reality here. This isn't about empty slogans or "just closing your legs." It‚Äôs about understanding what‚Äôs really at stake. Society is facing some severe challenges, and guess what? Bringing the next generation into it means we must be more intentional than ever. Yeah, I‚Äôm talking about choosing partners wisely, building solid foundations, and, above all, creating authentic, powerful connections. That's not about limitation‚Äîit's about empowerment and responsibility.

When people make conscious, informed choices about relationships, they shape the next generation to face the world‚Äôs challenges head-on. This is about breaking cycles, rejecting what doesn‚Äôt work, and forging something more substantial. Want to take a stand against what you think is wrong in society? It starts there. No one‚Äôs demanding compliance‚Äîthis is about claiming control over your choices in a way that demands respect.
Ah, so you're just attention whoring, then. Got it.
Will you be okay with just abortions availability within 6 weeks of rape then?
Elon is a moderate leftists and Trump has always been a centrist, he used to be a Democrat until they shifted far left.

You're just brainwashed is all.

I‚Äôm a lesbian so that‚Äôs another possibility
My husband and I were just talking about this today. Good people don't go to church anymore.
Saw this recently:  there is no hate like Christian love.
My aunt is a nun and voted for Kamala. It really comes down to hating women. That‚Äôs it.
Yeah comparing belief in God to a "fictional character" shows you don't even understand religion. It's based in the rational idea that there is order in the universe.
Oh, I'm sure Muslim men are bad. But, considering we're talking about America here, Christian males are the worst since they take up a good portion of the population here, sadly...

So a vitamin c regiment everyday after sex or rape. I can only hope it works for most or all.
Sounds like some fear mongering, but I've been snipped for a whole year and a half.
No one uses antinatalism as a justification. It does not need to be justified.

Some use it as (honest) prestige signaling. I think that's what you're detecting, and (as you've mentioned you have autism?)  you probably see that.

It is probably a result of "peer pressure" (which can be relentless).  Pronatalism is the norm, the "default" - and there are massive social and economic penalties for not procreating in most cases. It's possible to work one's way out of some of the economic ones by cohabitating and sharing costs, but the social stigma and resultant abuse (especially in employment) can make one *feel* like they have to justify their abstinence.

Understand, anyone reading:  you do NOT have to justify refusing to inflict the fundamental harm of procreation. Don't let anyone bully you into thinking otherwise.
The dumb people in those groups will breed more in proportion to however positively reproducing is viewed in those communities.
Actually no. Your prediction is entirely wrong. Not every human desires children. I never have. I am beyond happy being alone.
Says the person that follows women around on subs he doesn‚Äôt agree with to try to pick fights. Has it been that long since you‚Äôve talked to a woman in real life that this is what you do with your time? I feel really bad for you.
Obviously not.¬†
Whatever you say dude ü§£.
So I can just choose to become sexually attracted to women? I just want to make sure that‚Äôs not what you are insinuating.
How? I mean, I guess if they are lesbian or bisexual want to have sex that would definitely not create the babies, unless you wanted to adopt. But still, we digress, we‚Äôre just talking about having sex in general so heterosexual, gay lesbian relationship generally all involve  sex, which we are not putting in this equation.  Unless you‚Äôre looking for love, but don‚Äôt want sex. Then yes (in this specific case) edited for clarity.
I'll consider believing when I see some sort of evidence. Right now none is available.
And considering America has the biggest impact culturally in the world.. 

There's a reason why the places we colonized believe the same shit Americans do in different languages.
Excessive amounts of vitamin c can lead to kidney failure so be careful.
Open your eyes
Intelligence has nothing to do with it. Earning power is the variable.

With few exceptions, women with higher earning power have fewer children.

Today - higher earners will often have that 3rd or 4th child as a kind of flex for their success both financially and having a good marriage - Not only did we make it, we made it at a young enough age to have additional children.
Yeah you probably shouldn't have kids
That's what I thought.  Other than those who were raped, I can't think of any other reason why a woman would be forced into being pregnant.  Don't deal with consequences by murdering innocent human beings.
There are always transmen.
I thought the point was to not get pregnant. How would a gay couple not having sex help anything but the oppressors?
Nobody gives a shit if you believe or not.
Said the religious fundamentalist when arguing everything that exists must be evidence their silly gods exist

(edit)  Aren't you conflating an explanation for a justification? It is not immoral, nor a character flaw of any kind to abstain from procreation.
>Earning power is the variable.

Earning power is correlated (not directly related) with education level and intelligence.
That's the plan. You realize what sub you're in right?
Babe, accidents happen. A woman should not be forced to possibly lose her life, or be injured for the rest of it, bringing an unwanted child to the planet, a "human being" that will die if it's outside of the woman for longer than a couple minutes.
What does a transMAN have to do with lesbian stuff lol
The comment I responded to is clearly a straight woman.
No. I‚Äôm talking about those that don‚Äôt want sex.  But I also validated your point and agreeing. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èedit prior point. I‚Äôm not fighting someone on Reddit when there‚Äôs absolutely nothing to fight about.
You definitely need to open your eyes if you think I'm religious lmao
Historically that's true.

Recently that's shrank because there now so many "educated" people is pseudo-scholarship and activism areas of study, they leave university NOT educated but indoctrinated. The effect has forced companies like apple and google to remove the prerequisite for a college degree and instead focus on a history of technical ability when hiring.

This also correlates to the necessity for the taxpayer to foot the bill to so many student loans. Because there's so many graduates that can't actually do anything despite their degrees and are relegated back to minimum wage and very low skill employment.
**A woman should not be forced to possibly lose her life**

The millions aborted each year are also human lives lost.

**a "human being" that will die if it's outside of the woman for longer than a couple minutes.**

It's now possible for that human being to survive outside the woman at only 22 weeks old.  This wasn't possible a generation ago.  You are okay with killing a million human beings each year because of technology limitations.  We know this is just an excuse because there's a good chance you support abortions up to the moment of birth.
I'm not saying you are religious. The statement I made is a comparison to the logical fallacies the religious use.  It's a question-begging fallacy.

Explaining how procreation is unjustifiable is not an attempt to justify antinatalism.
No, I **don't** support abortions up to the moment of birth and most of us sane people don't. Third trimester abortions are **incredibly rare** and usually reserved in cases where the mother's life is in danger or the baby has horrid abnormalities that will inevitably lead to its slow painful death. Most abortion supporters want it to be available for the first trimester, which is more than an adequate amount of time for women to realize they're pregnant and to get them done.

>The millions aborted each year are also human lives lost.

Again, "lives" that cannot survive outside of the uterus until at least 22 weeks, the tail end of the second trimester. The vast majority of abortions are done in the first trimester.

Prioritize living, breathing women's lives > beings that will die within minutes of being outside of a uterus. Always.
What's your actual point?

It's true that a lot of people here use AN to justify why they don't want kids, they wouldn't post about it otherwise
10,000 3rd trimester abortions yearly. ¬†What‚Äôs your definition of incredibly rare?

AN always talk about how dangerous birthing is for the mother, yet maternal fatality rate is 10 times more rare.
The point is that an explanation (of the harm of procreation) is not a justification. 

No one here EVER *uses* antinatalism as a justification, the concept is incoherent. No harm is done, there is nothing to justify. 

I'm not sure how else to get it through to you.  Communication barrier wall so far.  It happens, I'm not going to worry about it further.

(edits)
10,000 abortions is less than 1% of all abortions yearly.

Now provide me with statistics on why those abortions were conducted.

Maternal fatality rate always remains a risk factor. What is **not** rare is that 1/3 of women will come out of pregnancy and childbirth with lasting injuries and health effects.
Guys I'm bored

Humans like to think of themselves as a highly advanced and intelligent species, but they‚Äôre nothing more than a bunch of mindless drones who willingly run round on a hamster wheel, chasing false hope and slowly waiting out the inevitable. This world truly is an accursed place, and I‚Äôm convinced that all the light in it vanished long ago
I went for a walk alone, feeling better. Sunlight makes me happy idk why
Yeah crapitalism is very boring
Kids supposedly fill your life with meaning. If you can‚Äôt find meaning yourself, force your meaning onto someone else!
Nothing like preparing tax returns and listening to that joe rogan and Kat williams one that came out a couple days ago. Wish I could smoke weed and talk shit for a living.
There is no point, we're just here. Eventually we'll all be dead, and nothing we did will matter. Even Einstein will eventually be forgotten, even if that takes until the death of our Sun. Literally everything anyone has done will eventually be superfluous, because humans *will*, at some point, go extinct. 

We're just animals that got extra smart (having thumbs also helped). We're not particularly special. There is no more point to our lives than the life of an ant, or an angler fish, or a flying squirrel.
I honestly think this is largely why people have kids. They don‚Äôt have to think about what else to do. Ready made companions beholden to you for a good few years.
What about the stress of bills, retirement, mortgage/rent , rising cost of living, a hellscape political nightmare?  That‚Äôs the entertainment that should keep you busy.. no reason to be bored:)
Yes, that is your purpose. We are the slaves that keep the cash flowing in so the politicians can ride our country until the wheels fall off. The cash that only supplies their lavish lifestyle, and shows us little to no representation. 

You are a cog and you will be a happy cog living off of the pittance that your corporate overlords allow you to have. You will lick the boot and kiss the sandal until it tastes *good*

Capitalism isn‚Äôt the problem, it‚Äôs the apathetic and selfish nature in which we conduct ourselves that kills critical thinking. I‚Äôd say the United States in principle was a good thing. It separated the people from the fucking parliament. We finally MADE IT OUT MOTHERFUCKER WOOOOO! But now we‚Äôre right back in it and we have nobody to blame but ourselves. 

People will never do that again‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre done with revolutions and are condemned to indentured servitude.
There isn‚Äôt a point unless you make one.  I fully wish I wasn‚Äôt born.  However, I have people in my life I care about and things I do that both relate and don‚Äôt relate to the work I do.  If not for those things I‚Äôd hang myself.  That‚Äôs just life.  If you‚Äôre bored that means you need to find something that you enjoy doing and that may mean having to learn a new skill but that‚Äôs the cost of doing business in life.
It usually comes down to interest but if you keep learning new things everyday you're interested in you ain't gonna get bored. I'm not even 25 yet so i don't know if you'll consider me competent enough to advice lol but I've seen my dad doing something new every week and he always, like ALWAYS. looks fulfilled.
You're not bored. You're a slave.
The nomad in my DNA weeps every day.

I know that this post is meant to be a little tongue-in-cheek, but I'd like to think that this possible outcome is not nearly so bad as others.

I can't speak to the quality of work, nor can I speak to the quality of the coffee, and certainly I can't speak to the quality of said podcasts. But this to me seems a relatively better life environment than war, terror, disease. Boredom has its upsides.

Each one of these touchpoints could be profoundly worse.
When you stop learning, you start dying. Learn something new that challenges you or interests you. Life is too short to be bored.
Go join a war there's many out there Good luck!
This just showed on my feed. Not everyone lives like this. When I spent a year in America I realized that for most people life is meaningless because all they do is work and consume. This is the result of how American society revolves around making money and ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. If you guys really despise you life go visit a rural community in a different country. It will switch your pov
What is the scam called life?
You wouldn't believe someone if they told you, but the thing that you're missing is the same thing that makes you so vehemently against the idea of having children.
Mid white woman
...a funny commentary on modern life...my first suggestion would be - you are not required to do exactly as the dominant culture requires. Go do something you enjoy. Otherwise, find a way to enjoy being bored...
I think the ultimate goal of progression of society is to get to the point where we can spend all of our time doing unimportant things in video games that feel important
Find a hobby
When you get to this point, seek enlightenment.
Love my baby cats, play video games, read, manga, watch anime, do whatever i want without bothering others, there's plenty to do, it's up to you.
This comment section is depressing bro. Y'all need to find some hobbies besides bingeing podcasts and netflix lol
This is not what antinatalism is about. Stop downplaying this philosophy. Posts like these are why it's not taken seriously.
Gotta find your own meaning in the world my man.

Your views on whether or not you wanna be here aside, you are here. Might as well make the most of it.
Positive nihilism! The point is what you decide it is!
There's always... the forbidden entertainment (I'm referring to the guillotine, get your mind out of the gutter)
Are you a man or a woman ?
Yeah I mean IDK about y‚Äôall but I enjoy‚Ä¶ having friends.
Yup me too !!! No point in life just work and pay the bills .üòè
interests are a wonderful thing, stop conforming and find things you genuinely like :D it works wonders
You could do acid and go to a rave
If you think you were created here, downvote me, free will.
No actually, you‚Äôre supposed to get out and do stuff and be active and live. You shouldn‚Äôt be surprised to be depressed and bored when you don‚Äôt do or accomplish anything
I wish I was a crustacean instead. gimme The Lobster universe and I will happily become one
Hope you're in a better headspace now dude.

Personally, I don't mind struggling through life a little bit. It's rough, and definitely not made for my neurochemistry, but. On the other hand, all my friends are here :)
Happiness can only come from one place and that is within your own mind. If you're looking for it anywhere else you'll never find it. You can be happy anywhere, anytime and in any circumstances but it takes practice.
Even when your kids are born your happiness is not coming from them it's coming from your love for them which is an internal experience.
You have nearly infinite options available to you instead of those things. It's entirely on you, your individual, personal freedom, to use your (however limited) free time.

Books, movies, wikipedia, music, sports, nerd-shit of any colour, there's a trillion options. Go out and do things and meet people. Fun times won't just magically come knocking on your door while you lounge on the sofa.
Have you tried RuneScape?
Boring people are bored

I mean having kids is one option

Have you tried drugs?
I don't if this is the good sub for this, but do you wanna talk ? As for the twitter post, maybe find another job or way of living because work, coffee and podcasts doesn't sound THAT fun to me
Hobbies are nice. You can even try new things regularly to see if you enjoy them. I believe that looking for hobbies is a legitimate hobby.
If you are bored all the time you might just be dumb.
Probably find a hobby D:
Go outside?-  
I went outside yesterday rock hunting and found a small fossil and some seashell impressions, got to walk along my creak and enjoy the warm weather before it started raining.
no no no! Its also suggested to have existential crisis and regret all the bad decisions youve made with no sight of self forgiveness in view and to be indoctrinated about going to hell for moral failings!
All the things you mention happen inside. Get out!
I'd like to introduce some of y'all to absurdism. Stoicism might be of interest. 

You can come up with your own meaning, or don't. Doesn't really matter. The only point to anything is the point you make up for yourself. If you can't make your own meaning, store-bought is fine (creeds, religion).
Well get out there while you still have time. Reach for the fucking stars and make your dreams come true.
May you live in interesting times
Yes
Go up to Canada they'll kill you no problem ü§ôü§ô
The boredom stops around middle age. Then the existential crisis and deeply misanthropic feelings hit. That's when the real fun begins. If you're lucky, you'll have a nervous breakdown.

Coffee, Alcohol, Sex, Drugs, PaSsIoN FiNdInG, until we kick the bucket üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Fucking pointless shit
Sex, drugs and music help. You know... mutual activities.
I'm bored and I'm suffering while the death clock ticks down.
If some people want to live their whole life in this way they definitely can. Some people want to create something during their life that stays there after them or do something significant or reach a certain level or experience some things. This is usually called life goals and while I would recommend having some, don't overdo it because it tends to make life look short and put stress on you that you might not be able to do all the things you wanted in time. Funny thing is that younger generations usually have more life goals than the generation above them which makes me wander how is there still people that never imagined doing anything else than their basic everyday life.
I like coffee but my life is meaningless especially when you don‚Äôt go outside and have no friends or family :|
Get a hobby!
I'm not bored. I enjoy my job and enjoy my hobbies. I look forward to seeing what the world looks like in 20/40/60 years because it's changed a hell of a lot in the last 20/40/60 years.

I also have a 2.5 year old with a vivid imagination who loves to explore the world and seeing the world through her eyes is a lot of fun. 

Maybe we have different definitions of what boredom is?
Have you tried travelling? Having interesting hobbies YOU absolutely love? Can't have those things? Well, then your goal number one is to find a way of being able to afford yourself those things.
I would give anything to be bored. Being constantly inundated with worry is much worse.
Have you tried sex? I hear that‚Äôs supposed to be pretty good.
Listen, it sucks but you really gotta squeeze joy out of the time you do have. I see so many people who rightfully hate their jobs, but then sit around watching streaming TV reruns and declining all social invites. This world is pretty terrible, but there is joy to be had.
Only boring people get bored
Your suppose to enjoy the journey of self improvement(educating yourself, fitness, ect) in your off time from work until you find your purpose and replace your job with living in your purpose. Enjoy what it is you do and you‚Äôll never have to work again.
suggest some podcasts
You are here for a reason don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise, getting bored with the hamster wheel is a step in the right direction.
[removed]
If those are your choices in your mind/logic - wow. Just wow.


Don't you have any things you enjoy doing? A hobby, sports, seeing friends, travelling, volunteering, working out, etc. I feel like I don't have enough time to do the stuff I love, and here you are thinking podcasts and work are LIFE??¬†


Wow. Get off your butt and enjoy life.
Yes, that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre supposed to do
Wait until Jennifer Down is broke, homeless, and all of a sudden have a purpose to live and now she's sad.
I feel this way a lot. I feel like my life is just utilitarian. Yawn.
In our hyper-connected, always-on world, it's no wonder many of us have a crippling fear of the dreaded "B" word - boredom. Our culture has become so obsessed with productivity, achievement, and constant stimulation that we've practically banished boredom from our lives.

It's as if we've all been brainwashed by the "Hustle Harder" mantra, endlessly scrolling, tapping, and clicking our way through each day. We've become adrenaline junkies, constantly chasing that next hit of excitement. 

But here's the thing - embracing a little boredom every now and then can actually be incredibly beneficial. It's like giving your overstimulated brain a much-needed vacation. When we allow ourselves to experience the sweet, sweet silence of nothingness, it creates space for deeper reflection, creativity, and inner exploration.

That's where The Bored Room comes in - a safe haven for the chronically overcommitted, a respite for the relentlessly restless, and a playground for the perpetually preoccupied. It's a sanctuary for the tired, the stressed, and the overstimulated - a place where we can finally unplug, unwind, and unleash our inner couch potatoes. 

Come join us in aThe Bored Room, where we simply exist. We sit. We stare. We revel in the sheer, unadulterated glory of uninterrupted, unproductive peace. Subreddit- TheBoredRoomOG
Why does antinatalism have to equate with nihilism? Can't you still enjoy life while not thinking everyone has to have kids? Has there been some shift in the core philosophy lately ?
If you look at this this way, you can make *anything* feel awful. You have to find things that make you happy, especially small things, and center your time around pursuing those. I think a lot of people have kids in order to fill this need for purpose, but it's false.
If y‚Äôall are bored it‚Äôs honestly y‚Äôall fault. I know we didn‚Äôt consent to being here but damn. Make the best of it? Taking the picture into account if that‚Äôs what y‚Äôall actually do then y‚Äôall wasting life. 

I know there‚Äôs things like chronic illnesses, disabilities and whatnot but fuck man these ‚Äúwelcome to the machine‚Äù ‚Äúwork, live, die‚Äù ‚Äúlife is work‚Äù posts are getting old. It‚Äôs fucking obvious, and if your life sums up to all that then you‚Äôre fucking worthless and need to find a hobby or go do something worthwhile. Get your own piece of the pie while you can or don‚Äôt, fuck it, back to Halo.
That sounds like a you problem tbh

There are plenty of things to do, friends to be made, and places to visit

Hurr Hurr yeah its totally a boring life because you don't do jack shit to enjoy it. Drinking coffee and listening to podcasts? Is that it?
Ohhhh imagine if you then had kids and you'd never be bored again? Radical I know
If you‚Äôre bored you should find a work to pass time and earn extra. Like you can teach your native language online, help/guide tourists in your area, test games, etc.
no you're supposed to start a family and protect them
You know most people keep themselves entertained through starting a family
Almost every post from you guys that hits the front page is garbage. This one doesn‚Äôt even make sense.
There are countless books to read, movies and tv shows to watch, restaurants and food carts to eat at, and places to visit. People carve tiny figures on the tops of pencils or dress up as space fairies. There‚Äôs beekeeping and sewing and gardening and keeping lizards and water color. Idk man, life isn‚Äôt boring, there‚Äôs a lot of shit to do.¬†

Have a kid, then.
I hear church is a nice place to go when you have nothing better to do.
Well only if youre extremely uninventive, lack any imagination or interest in anything. If thats all you do with your time its an "you" issue.

It is to know your creator and to make Him Known.
You're here for a reason - I like to think of these as your life tasks. 

First you have to imagine that you chose your life before you got here. Then ask yourself, what life tasks were you selecting to learn to accomplish when to have been born at this particular time in history, with this particular set of life's problems?
sentience is hell. i so desperately wish to have been born any other animal instead of human that i became a furryüòÇ there are at least some creative coping mechanisms we can come up with due to higher intelligence, but truly if i could‚Äôve been born a bear and just wandered forests lookin for food and chilling in rivers, unable to comprehend the scale of the world- pure bliss bro
they? U mean we right?
Boredom is the root of all evil.
Silly. Almost all people have some free time, and there's almost countless options available. You have the freedom to choose to better yourself in something, or grow more knowledgeable, or a super expert nerd, or whatever the fuck you want. It's not easy for everyone, but almost everyone have nearly infinite choices in what to do with their lives. 

Once, a frighteningly short amount of time ago, you had almost no choice, because all your time was spent scrabbling in the dirt.

Edit: I'm speaking about western nations, if you're in many other nations "most people" are fucked.

Agreed.
It‚Äôs the systems humans have set up brotha go fall in love it‚Äôs still good it‚Äôs just this hellscape the elites have set up
it didn't vanish, we dismantled it, destroyed it, exploited it, pillaged it, enslaved it, raped it, stole it, poisoned it...we chose this, we did not honor the gift we were given.
Wow‚Ä¶do something about it then.
Well this is just emo and false.


Compared to every other species we are the most advanced and intelligent.


Most people don‚Äôt see their sites on something unreachable or have any false hope.

Jeez, lighten up. There is plenty of beauty in the world if you just stop to take it in. Something as simple as feeding some ducks bread in the park can be really fulfilling. Having an evening tapas meal with your partner or friends. Reading a book you just cannot put down. Fucking drinking a warm drink whilst standing in the snow or seeing a human be kind to another human.
Go watch the sunrise on a clear summers day and tell me how accursed it is.

Most people choose to be miserable and only see the bad in the world. If that's your choice, at least stop complaining and adding to the negativity.
What an awful mindset.
Why pretend like humanity is itself somehow to blame for the way the world is structured, rather than... say, blaming the *way* the world is structured fundamentally? It's due to the way the world is structured, by the way, which actually creates the incentives to turn the world into a dominance based hellscape that masks itself with the illusion of progress(the place we all live, right now). 

Since... you know... that's what the DNA and the physics and the game theory forcefully extracts? It's why the CEOs and Politicians and Military Industrial compelx people and universities and religious cults and everything else in that ballpark, all collude consciously and unconsciously to instantiate dystopia.

That's the actual reason why the person in the tweet is bored(despite being probably pretty well off, I would guess-- her problems seem to involve picking between a Venti and a Grande at Starbucks), if you just follow the breadcrumbs. It's not "x political system" it's not "x race/culture" or "x continent" or "x gender" or "x species" or "that one fish that grew legs and crawled onto land" or any other narrow explanation. It's easy to miss the forest for the trees.

Ok look. I think it‚Äôs morally incorrect to have kids if they‚Äôre going to have a life which has more unhappiness than happiness. But what I don‚Äôt understand is, if you really feel that way, why haven‚Äôt you killed yourself yet? I know I would, if I ever felt that way.

I know this maybe sounds like a troll, but I‚Äôm really not trolling, just curious about how you can feel that way and haven‚Äôt done anything about it yet 

Is it that it might be painful? I can think of many painless ways, especially if you‚Äôre in the US 

FWIW I think it‚Äôs morally correct to euthanise someone under certain conditions, and this level of unhappiness would count
It's probably the vitamin D. Many people are low in it nowadays due to staying inside, and the season of Winter doesn't help. That's almost over, though; Spring is finally coming.
Turns out the world is actually amazing once you leave the maze of boxes. The sunlight making you happy is the first clue.
I live in a perpetually sunlit country with no winter year round and I feel fucked up everyday. Yea, I would be dead in another kind of place with hardly any sunlight.
I think the reason for that are THE ALIENS
i hate that the majority of peoples neurochemistry makes them go brr from systems..functioning. Rather than going brr from things that actually have meaning to them.

It makes it so the majority of people are boring and pointless as fuck to people like us and because the world works this way it makes it nigh imposible for us to have the time or ability to assign meaning to it and do things with the resources we have
Boring dystopia indeed
wish more people knew about bernays and about the plan to embolden democracy through extreme egocentric consumerism. the theory was if you were an egomaniac with a hightened sense of self importance, then you would contribute more to democracy, as well as to the economy. so for the past century we‚Äôve been engineering people to be this way and there doesnt seem to be any sign of slowing down.
The key is to force your child into fulfilling all your failed dreams. That always works. Surely your child will be a carbon copy of you with the exact same hopes, dreams, beliefs, and opinions.

Incorrect: my life had meaning before I had my daughter. Yes, she adds to it, but the cup was full before she existed.
It‚Äôs ironic when you think about it like that lol‚Ä¶. Bringing a meaningless existence into the world to fulfill your meaningless existence
You hit the nail on the damn head. Everyone wants to blame the "ism' and insist this other "ism" is better than capitalism. When in fact, the issue is that we have ALLOWED ourselves to get fucked by big corporate dick bags who have blatantly infiltrated our political system with their CORRUPTION.

We could fuck these assholes back at their own game if we really wanted to. Via capitalism, it's actually our best chance. But you're right, we choose to be condemned to indentured servitude
Yeah its crazy, I dont care about celebrities but there are people say oh this Album of xxx suxx And buy it..¬†¬†
Some people are really remind me on J.Carpenters: 'they live'¬†
¬†If people would buy or borrow old books from a library(good rare books) then there would be more old books, but today there is sooo much crap to buy, it only can make people dumber.. I'm from europe and our country is gettin worse too.. we are try to copy the american way of life and it's gettin us nowere
Weird, that almost sounds close to how i see the world, but I'd pinpoint our obsession with harm minimization as the root of all problems. The closest "ism" is safetyism, but it's deeper, it's like: Nothing is meaningful, so just minimize your pain. Suffering through a book or a career or starting a family; not worth it. Of course there's hedonism too, that can make it look fun and cool from the outside. Or video games and porn at least. But hedonism always leads nowhere, your brain adjusts and leaves back in a harm minimization cycle. Then you're looking for SSRIs, posting how upset the latest news event makes you, hating yourself for not exercising or getting enough sun, or whatever the safetyist authority figures tell you.

It ain't that bleak though, you just need find ways to make the suffering meaningful. This takes creativity, and time, and work, and therefore well, suffering. But w/e, you're gonna suffer anyways. 

And weirdly, its selflessness that kind of makes this so hard. You will make others suffer, not just by existing but even by finding meaning and happiness. Nothing is worse than being in pain and having someone go, "it ain't that bad. Anyways bye, I'm gonna go look at something beautiful." Most people can't do this, they are selfless (conformists) and jump into the hole with them. 

That moral impulse is false utilitarianim, the drive to minimize harm in the moment always leads to more harm in the end.

(Sorry for making you read this, I'm sure it sounds trite or something. You'll live, though, and it made me feel good, so thank you.)
This is the way to go for real. I'm 30 and I picked up new hobbies at 25 and 28, plus im still doing what i enjoyed in my teens. I enjoy the learning process and there's always something for me to do.
I'm 34 and this feels like enough, honestly.
There you hear it lol, but yeah theres always interest enough in life for most people i guess
do you feel it has been good or bad for you to have gone through that? i‚Äôve always assumed that as much as people who get fame/money as a child may act like its a positive thing on the outside they always long for the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. its pretty much the basis for Bo Burnhams works, like- you get exposed to absolutely everything as an actual child and it can be so overwhelming, but over the years the world can become so grey and dull because you‚Äôve seen it all first hand already.

like as a kid/teen all your brain can realistically handle caring about is you, your own wellbeing, and maybe your family (but that doesnt even apply to mostüòÇ). but instead you were just shoved out into the spotlight, with the worlds eyes on you
Have a kid? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Why is life boring after 30? You can meet new people, try new things, travel your own way, and create. I‚Äôm way past 30 and I‚Äôm having a lot of fun in a new role/job, took a year-long sabbatical to travel, read, learn ice skating. etc.

You're damn right. Antinatalism has nothing to do with what I want in my life. It has to do with sparing my children from a sentient existence.
Mental health is real. It‚Äôs not that easy to feel fulfilled for some people. There is no ‚Äúbe not bored‚Äù button that I can press to make things enjoyable. Well, there is, but psychedelics are illegal.
You are just easily entertained obviously
Except the only way to do that is to become a slave to the 1%.

I don't find this modern version of "human" desirable at all. Feels like an evil alien faction must've caused almost everybody to devolve.
You would also be struggling with disease, other bears, bugs, hunger, thrist. üòî
This is the most pathetic assessment. I wish you would‚Äôve been born not a human as well, you don‚Äôt seem to want to use what you‚Äôve got for anything useful or creative. A bear is a bear, a dove a dove, a person a person. Some of them just don‚Äôt get it. You‚Äôre one that doesn‚Äôt get it.

Most people are just cogs in the machine. It truely sucks to be an outsider watching it all from a different viewpoint, helpless to do anything because the communal mind is set in its ways. It‚Äôs especially frustrating when people talk about resources and overpopulation like it‚Äôs a problem to solve. They never think about life outside of humans, and what our population means for the planet itself. It‚Äôs just this hurtling machine going in one direction with disregard for anything in its path. That‚Äôs why natalists and us butt heads. We may as well be different species our minds are so different.¬†
For many people, it‚Äôs children who are what truly have meaning. They are chaotic, unpredictable, and very rarely in stasis early in development. 

They are about as far away as a clean, functioning system as you can get.

some mothers actually think like this unfortunately.
Who blames it on their kidüíÄ
Don‚Äôt pretend there aren‚Äôt parents who think like this just because your experience is different, though
heard this one economist describe being in an environment of infinite products and variety as a ‚Äúschizophrenic existence‚Äù
I think that moral impulses are the only reason the human race has made it this far. Collaboration is the only reason we have the luxury to live in a depressing distopian hellscape. That is why we conquered and bred out the Neanderthals. They were isolationists, and we were not. 

Also, anyone who would argue that making people miserable or stepping on people is ‚Äúpart of the process‚Äù to self betterment or wealth or whatever is selling you this false idea. The idea that is you can be self centered enough then you can be one of the beautiful people is a convenient lie told to keep the common rabble squabbling over scraps. 

While our failure to organize leads us deeper into this pit of hostile legislation. While at the same time the entire White House is full of liars and thieves lining their pockets with the blood of our children.
I picked a liking to physics two years ago, and even though I'm going to take electronics as my university course I always am fascinated by how much there is to explore in a certain subject. Hopefully I can continue exploring physics and stay connected because it's a never ending loop of discoveries and information.

Give me assisted suicide and I'm gone tomorrow bro. I'm not kidding. Killing thyself is hard as fuck and mostly painful. I tried many times.

 I'm against jumping in front of a train. I wanted to do it at peace alone and it's too damn hard.

Gimmie a suicide booth and I won't hesitate for more than 3 minutes
because of said goofy coping mechanisms lol. if the world cracked down on drug production, went back to making being anything other than cis/het illegal, and truly made being a furry illegal like they threatened to do in some US states, i would probablyüòÇ 

right now i have a good relationship though, and i enjoy gaming and exploring the headspaces of different substances. I would also love to travel the world, simply for the selfish urge to see everything this world has to offer.

also for a similarily selfish reason, im obsessed with theoretical physics. i would love to truly understand the inner machinations of the universe before i take myself out.
Because for a lot of antinatalists (and most people for that matter) dying is still terrifying. Especially if you don‚Äôt believe in a specific religion. Additionally, a lot of people who feel the way antinatalists do, have committed suicide. But for those of us who are still scared of dying, that‚Äôs just another reason we feel as strongly as we do about our philosophy. Because we were forced into life with a consciousness and thought to where we now have to worry not just about living but dying and the fear of it all. Because we were born we are now forced to worry about illnesses, accidents, and therefore, death. And just because we are antinatalist, does not mean we don‚Äôt care about people or our family and friends. We might care a little too much, because a lot of us also end up feeling guilt about not enjoying being born when we still love our parents and family members. Yes, we fault our parents for bringing us into this world but we also can love them deeply. We aren‚Äôt antinatlist just because of physical aspects of life as in being born with/having to deal with or spreading ‚Äî diseases, disabilities, accidents, abuse, etc. but also due to the mental aspects of guilt, pain, anxiety, loneliness, loss, etc. that are felt on a near daily basis simply due to the fact that we are sentient human beings.
Loser mentality.
Lose it or use it.
Your choice.¬†
You do have infinite choices, just takes different ammounts of time to realize them.
That's not what they said. 


You can choose to rest sure, hell, you can choose to learn how to survive outdoors, head into the woods somewhere, build a cabin and live there scavenging if that's what you want.
Even if there are upturns and downturns, the options available are insane. 200 years ago - how many animators was there room for? Creative people in general? How many people worked themselves to the bones shovelling actual shit who were smart enough to have done well in school and become a boring old successful, rich, vacation-and-luxuries-having accountaint or lawyer or plumber?

I won't minimize the hardship so many people face, and I've experienced a tiny handful myself, but to dismiss the freedom of the modern world is doing yourself a disservice. There's so much to do, and so many options to do it with other people. Will you have to try many times before succeeding? Yes! That's life. In the meantime, your belly is probably full and you probably have a roof over your head and a pot to piss in.
I dont know why we are here, but it doesn't really matter. We are here, though, and we get to choose what we do with the time we have. Do you want to be happy or miserable? 
Believe it or not, for the most part, it's your choice. You simply have to adjust your perspective and either choose to look for the positives or the negatives (this one is a lot easier). Also, stop overthinking life so much, try and actually enjoy it.
I'm not saying in a scenario where you are a slave, for example, you should be happy. You should instead strive to free yourself in order to have the choice.

Again, how should I know? It just is. The world isn't fair. It sucks sometimes. Sometimes more than others. Some suffer more, some less. If you want, you can help others so they don't suffer so much. That's a very noble thing to do. If you want to just be happy, that's okay too. Either way, don't put the whole world on your shoulders. Try to enjoy yourself and be kind to others. Don't do those who can't avoid suffering the disservice of not at least giving happiness an honest go.

I know it's all empty words at the end of the day, but life is pretty simple. You try to avoid suffering, and you try to be happy. Most of all, try and be present each day. Don't spend too much time on the past or future. Don't despair so much. I promise you, if you stop to appreciate the small things and moments, and maybe sprinkle some optimism in there, it can be pretty great. 
Thinking about life too deeply is not very productive. It's a waste of time unless you do something about it, but even then, you can drive yourself crazy. Look at all the philosophers. How many were happy people?
Hey, listen or don't. I'm just saying a mindset like that will only lead to you feeling hopeless. It doesn't have to be like that.
True. But on the bright side (literally), daylight savings time starts in about 4 days. So the sun will be out for about an hour later, and it'll gradually go later until June 21st. (assuming you live in the US.)
its because there is no meaning behind the problems theyre solving. they just want systems to play with, they dont actually care about anything very well defined like reducing suffering

when you would create a system to reduce suffering, thats so much different from just having a formless idea of a terminal goal for which you are making systems. when the system IS the terminal goal, the world is just a body without a head or heart.
You‚Äôre a cog as well.
But the reason they like them is because they are raw material they can dominate and make fit into a system and start functioning properly in it. its another meaningless challenge that is ultimately just about worshipping systems. Im glad when they dont try to force meaning onto their kids, but they also dont give them the tools to figure out what matters to them
For some people that's true. Children can give them meaning for the reasons you listed above. However, I prefer myself being curious, creative, unpredictable (in a positive sense) and moving.
Their children will Stop talking to them once they turn 14,they will then leave house at 19 and then will occasionally meet and then make rant posts on reddit üëçüèª

Oh I forgot the videos where the mother sees her grandsons after 3 yearsüòÉ
i dont give a shit. what i care about is, if your kids dont like life would you take responsibility for the fact they had to endure unwanted experiences? would you respect their right to die? or would you bully them into blaming themselves for their unhappiness
Emphasis on some with the understanding that it's a small minority and a minority of dads do this as well.
Electronics is a great field and you will have endless opportunities to pursue! Lots out there to learn and discover for sure

Hey, the world is shit, but the world is also what you make of it, there's things you can do to improve your quality of life, I obviously don't know you or your story but I'm not going to assume anything about you. 

I feel like there are plenty of things worth living for, love comes to mind first, you have to take the good with the bad in my opinion, its the only way to stay sane.

I know you don't want my advice, but if you did ask, my advice would be to always have something to look forward, t could be as little as going to the park with your day later today, or as big as getting a new car, essentially if you have something to always look forward to I think you would feel better.

Sorry for dumping that on you, just hope you're okay and not on the verge.

yeah you need to understand that you‚Äôre the outlier thereüòÇ well at least for this subreddit lol. people that dont care or think about much usually will not have thought enough to come to the antinatalist ideology. but just about everyone who does care about everything and think about all the problems in the world feels fucking hopeless and worthless and like there literally couldn‚Äôt be a reason to live no matter how you look at it.
I envy that about you. Not really giving a shit about much sounds epic.
honestly yeah true- part of me tries to convince myself that the good i do outweighs the bad that me existing inherently causes, but i would not be able to stay sane and happy without substances to distract my mind when im not actively helping people around me. you *do* kind of have to just ignore the world, huh?
Don't worry about being happy. Worry about solving real problems and you'll sometimes randomly find yourself feeling happy too
Love, Death + Robots
  
ever heard of it?
I was suggesting that because there's an animated shorts series with cats and robots in a post apocalyptic humanless world
Loser mentality.
Aim higher.
You can do it!
Yeah, fair point. You wouldn't worry about future, or about what other bears *think* if you chase them out of your territory...
you know what sucks (I just learned this) is that bears live in captivity to around 50 years old but only til about 25 in the wild. well yeah the wild is rougher you might think, nope because fucking human fucking activity and habit encroachment (meaning they tried to just fucking exist too close to where a spot we're currently infesting so we shoot and kill them)  

  
so we cut the lives of bears in the wild by short by half so the snot-nosed spawn of a breeding pair of the world's most invasive species can feel safe. we need to end and let this planet heal
Ok, so you do have more happiness than unhappiness in your life right now, it‚Äôs just that you think it‚Äôd be even better to have a mindless existence? Fair enough
It's not a mentality gained by being a loser. It's a mentality gained by observation of the world around you.
That's exactly what he said.

You do understand that back in those days peasants had over a hundred holidays to make up for the time they had to spend on chores?

Shove your bullshit wher the sun don't shine, the rest of us aren't falling for it.
All of this nonsense about mindset and motivation seriously needs to stop. I see and hear it everywhere. People aren‚Äôt monolithic. For some, it‚Äôs not just a case of ‚Äòpick yourself up, dust yourself off, put in the work and you‚Äôll see miraculous changes.‚Äô Some people have *real* problems that can‚Äôt be cured with a bit of basic therapy and a few daily affirmations. Jesus
I'm in UK but what you've said is generally still the case for us in terms of sunlight etc.
also the chance you will die from heart attack increases directly after changing the clocks forward.
Well said. And it feels that way. Like a soulless machine with no heart.¬†
How so?¬†
Any parent who believes they can shape/dominate their child is soon humbled. 

My teen has been his own headstrong self since he was a toddler. Instead of trying to fight it, I nurtured the type of independence he wanted (while being super loving, flexible, and available, which I think is key). We‚Äôre very tight.

I don‚Äôt really believe in systems, so it‚Äôs a bit thrilling to me to be witness to someone grow up and develop their own frameworks, ideas, and goals-negotiating which parts of the system he decides to accept and which ones to reject.
Fair enough. Not everyone wants a moving target!
Is this based on your own experience as an adult?
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the majority.

My colleagues in philosophy think about things a lot.. Yet they are pretty normal! They have kids, play sports, enjoy travel, and are pretty cool people. They don‚Äôt walk around with a dark cloud hanging over their head.
I believe in AN as well. I think a lot about these things, I just know I‚Äôm not going to be apart of the problem because I won‚Äôt be procreating so it‚Äôs something I really shouldn‚Äôt give a shit. I know I can prevent suffering by not procreating and that‚Äôs good enough for me. Sounds hypocritical but I don‚Äôt really give a shit about reducing suffering. I‚Äôm not procreating nor tryna to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù or spread the AN ideology. Im just gonna enjoy my little insignificant corner of the world while I can and that‚Äôs enough for me.
A lot of people misunderstand when I say that. Usually they‚Äôll say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why you‚Äôll get nowhere in life‚Äù or something similar. But it‚Äôs like, i gotta work hard? I don‚Äôt give a shit I‚Äôll do it. I‚Äôve had a long day and too tired to cook? I don‚Äôt give a shit I‚Äôm hungry so I‚Äôm gonna cook. It‚Äôs more like I don‚Äôt give a shit about the process of things. 

Only thing that matters is the end goal. With that being said most things like peoples thoughts of me or how im dressed or whatever I don‚Äôt give a shit about either lol.
For me it's videogames. I obsessively play them every free time I get. I absolutely hate to participate in anything reality related, I don't like moving or tolerating the elements/people. I just want to be a hermit in my black room drawing, coding and playing games untill my body starts breaking apart and then I get a greenlight to go through euthanasia. I pretty much hate anything that involves what people consider living. I have a family I financially take care of and 2 jobs so I can't use substances (permanent on call that requires driving) so tuning out mentally is the only escape I have. I have mentally checked out for over 15 years now, no clue how it all didn't fall apart.
I‚Äôm actually on the animals‚Äô side when it comes to these human invasions. We‚Äôre in their territory.
not really? i am more contempt and apathetic towards life and death both. i do whatever i can to make my brain release happy chemicals, whether it be hard drugs, risking my life physically doing dumb shit, or simply smoking weed and gaming if im in the mood. im not necessarilly struggling or starving or anything, like i have my basic needs met if thats what you mean by more happiness than unhapiness? but i have absolutely no desire to participate in society the way you‚Äôre usually expected to and would rather die than submit to a conventional desk job-
Clearly we look at things differently.¬†¬†
>the rest of us aren't falling for it.

Idk who you're talking for tbh. 


>You do understand that back in those days peasants had over a hundred holidays to make up for the time they had to spend on chores?

It wasn't to make up for anything, they just worked depending on the farming season, I would not want to live like the peasants of old that's for sure. 



What I meant to say, is that you spend your time how you see fit, the reason most people keep working those 40 hours a week is to sustain a certain level of living comforts they grew accustomed to. 


Nothing's stopping you from learning survival skills, parachuting in the middle of a giant forest and living there in a cabin for as long as you can.
I have more mental health problems than I care to count. I know what it's like to feel like you can't do anything about it. True, you can't get rid of them. I'll live with most of these until I pass, but you can fight them. I'm not saying it'll fix your problems, but it'll make you feel better at least.
Only if you rely on the clock to wake up. 

I generally wake up just before sunrise naturally, so I've been waking up an hour before I need to get up for the past month. I haven't used an alarm clock since college and have only overslept like twice in the past 10 years and only by like 30 minutes.

Spring Forward only messes me up because I'd rather lounge in bed for that hour instead of immediately jumping out of bed.
existence for existence sake at great risk of suffering is fuckin stupid dangerous addict mentality. suffering for the sake of ultimately reducing suffering makes sense but what people are doing does not. they arent even aware of how many peoples behavior is based on reducing suffering rather than pleasure seeking. Plenty of people fuck to reduce feelings of loneliness and pain, not because they are fine and just want more interesting feelings. i spent my whole childhood being confused as fuck by other people because my behavior has always been purely "what will lessen the extreme pain im in, if anything" and not "heehoo cake, babies and sex dopamine dopamine dopamine"
People don‚Äôt want kids. They want cute, squishy little humans for photo ops. Once they begin to grow, the parent wants to mold them into a complete clone of themselves. They don‚Äôt want a unique individual. They want stick their butt on the copy machine glass and slide out a younger version of themselves.

A lot of parent-child conflicts derive from the child being their own person, and not a 1:1 model of the parent‚Äôs favorite person in the world (their self).
No but  they all do
There are ways to do what you love. I specialize in helping people with this (for fun). I‚Äôd be happy to give some recs based on what you like and your skills. 

3 foreign languages is awesome! And who cares if the *world* doesn‚Äôt care what you want? If you care, there will be a way to get what *you* want.
neither do i! but its a conscious active effort to dissociate from the real world and treat everything in life as a game because at the end of the day there really is no point to anything and we need to just accept that:) our planet could be instantaneously vapourized at any moment by a cosmic ray and we would have no way to see it coming, and the universe would continue on as if we never existed. im just saying i really dont blame people who cant get over the fact that life is just a semi-stable series of chemical reactions-
Well I mean my personal stance is there is no inherent point to life so you might as say the point to life is to have fun, and it sounds like you‚Äôre doing that 

And most people don‚Äôt have the language to describe it, but deep down of course they would rather not participate in society while reaping the benefits, and in the end they decided that the package deal of working a 9-5 in exchange for a sense of belonging, security, and having more money to do the things they like was worth it

These are things that release happy chemicals for a lot of people, and I guess you‚Äôre not like that. But other than that, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre actually that different

I don‚Äôt really have a point I‚Äôm building towards, just curious about other people. I think my original question was already answered
So you do understand that the church gave peasants their days off to prevent them from.rioting right?

Are you just illiterate? You can't possible be this dumb on your own.
Damn so relatable. People are just hedonists really. I never found the stuff people do for fun remotely enjoyable. It was just chasing drugs (dopamine) like you said for the hell of it. And this is the system that people know and want to continue. To us it‚Äôs senseless. To them it‚Äôs life. I guess we are pretty similar. I was four when I realised that this place is crazy.
Are you a parenting researcher?
I‚Äôm sure if you zoom out, everything that is immediate to us seems pretty insignificant, and it will seem that we have little agency in the larger scheme of things. It‚Äôs a fun thought exercise I did more often when I was in my teens/20s. But it‚Äôs not really helpful to get stuck there. 

Zoom in to your immediate life, community, friends, and family‚Äî and then your actions start to have impact. That‚Äôs your real world, too. The decisions you make and freedoms you have to kick ideas around on Reddit, the games you choose to play, the people you interact with daily. The habits you develop and keep or kick. The goals you set and either meet or change‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs all very real. And impactful.

It‚Äôs all about your lens and locus of control.
yeah makes sense. its not like any one human is much different from any other, but what we value changes a bit i guess? and yeah i agree, the point to life is to have as much personal pleasure as possible without encroaching on others. I just dont see any personal pleasure in having a robust career or raising a family lol. i want to create art, do drugs, have (protected) sex, and die (hopefully while doing one of the previously mentioned things)
Oh I didn't know that, do tell me more

>You can't possible be this dumb on your own. 

Very Redditor like.
i was about 5. i learned what meat was and had a full scale meltdown panic attack and refused to eat. later manifested into an eating disorder and chronic panic attacks because i was denied vegan food. i became delusional to cope with the pain and guilt until later i was like wait fuck this im grown i can be vegan now but the issues i have from before are permanent now. i know countless other people experienced this exactly and society denies that we even exist because caring about suffering has never been a thing to them.
I‚Äôm an expert on everything.
its real and maybe ‚Äúimpactful‚Äù to a select few, but it is not at all *significant*. i do try my best to focus on just doing good deeds for those around me and taking care of my loved ones. its why im a foster pet owner. i do my best to cause as much of a positive impact as i can. but again if i truly sit down and think about it, it could all be made inert, as if it was never done, by an infinite amount of things out of my control.

this is what i mean by dissociate and pretend everything is a game. i ignore everything at the scale that the universe (or even our world/our fucked geopolitical climate) actually fuctions on and just treat each day like a new level i need to bring my chracter through. collecting as much ‚Äúgood karma‚Äù as possible to increase my sanity meterüòÇ
Must be nice
A game is a common and useful metaphor! And to your foster pets, what you do is incredibly significant. Everything is relative.

Okay, I can now be convinced to play this game.
I can't get over how cute your Coop villager is!
Where is Tom Nook's Above a Convenience Store?
Damn fine.
Oh man I love it!
This is amazing
I've always turned my basement into the black lodge in Animal Crossing.
Wow, you can do all that in this game? Is it fun?
Wow! That‚Äôs some dedication!
Oh I'm so visiting your dream island!
Got a light? Thanks much!
ü´°ü´°ü´°perfect

So cool! ü§©
Amazing
How did you make this ?
i named my town twin peaks too!
Let‚Äôs party
Amazing work with your island and I think this should also be shared with the r/AnimalCrossing subreddit.

Way too much time hahaha that‚Äôs about it
I'm glad you included the code, I am gonna check it out :) I was also working on a waiting room in my basement at one point so this is some good inspiration to continue it

We simply can‚Äôt fathom bringing a child into this chaos of an economy. Can barely afford housing. Our food is slowly killing us, and jobs are no longer guaranteed.
You cannot force people to have kids unless you take their rights away
Conservatives reading this: "we clearly need to oppress minorities, take away women's rights and shove bible down people's throats more to fix this!"
Fun fact‚Ä¶ I live in a state where abortion was banned. When abortion was a normal option, I was nonchalant about birth control. It was kind of, if it happens I have plenty of time to think about what to do and who knows‚Ä¶ maybe, keep the child. When abortion was banned, everything turned upside down. I panicked and beefed up my contraception. I have no choice but to do that. If necessary, I‚Äôll go celibate. Those that take away women‚Äôs right to basic healthcare such as abortion are pure idiots. They‚Äôll get nothing but extreme resistance from women in particular because women who know what their rights are were backed into corners. Not only birth rate went down, sterilization rates went up. I can‚Äôt imagine getting pregnant, not wanting a kid and not being able to get rid of the fetus safely. This is a sh.. show and with that, the birth rates will continue to fall. If I was on the fence before, I fully made up my mind now. I don‚Äôt need sleazey politicians to tell me what to do with my womb.
Most of them don't want it because of money and because they want comfort and are rational about it, but not because of ethics. Anyway, any woman who doesn't have children is a victory for that child.
I've never understood what's so interesting about them.  I mean, I experienced childhood, I saw the children & families around me, why REPEAT it?
If I don't have 2 million liquid to give to my child why would I have them? They will be born a slave and die one too
They marvel at it while desirable real estate is affordable only to privileged classes and corporations monopolizing ‚Äúinvestment properties,‚Äù food costs are increasing, the economy is shaky, job market is unpredictable and unfriendly to employees let alone employees with families. 

They created this mess and yet expect people to pop out kids like it‚Äôs 1905 on a Midwest farm.
I wouldn‚Äôt call myself an antinatalist, but like. 

The only things I do are work, and recover from work. Oh, and consume resources and then feel bad about consuming resources. 

I think life is beautiful, but it‚Äôs also a fucking lot, and knowing that *this* ^^^ would be the inheritance of my offspring is. Whew. 

I can‚Äôt do that to somebody, at least not on purpose.
Yeah ummm. Fuck kids? Cool study. Anyone with a brain isn‚Äôt procreating. Unless you have a god complex, a lot of money, or like to see suffering or something. Common sense. End your lineage
I have a total disinterest in having kids, plus I couldn‚Äôt afford them.
It is better to regret not having kids when you are old than to regret having kids when you are old.
I thought I wanted them, then I was a foster parent for a few years and changed my mind.
i never want kids. im 23 and if i could become infertile for life i would do it in a heartbeat üò≠
WE'RE WINNING
They say this world is going to shit, so why force another conscious being into it? The audacity of some people‚Ä¶
I've been anti-natalist for decades, but jesus christ, when I see children born post covid I'm just like "what hubris, what the fuck were your parents thinking."
The richer a nation becomes, the lower the birth rate. It's not the end of the world. It just means that we will rely more on technology to do the work that humans once did. It also means there needs to be a higher corporate tax rate and restructuring of social security starting with lifting the cap.

Conservatives act like our timeline is the plot of "Children of Men". It's not. We simply need to adapt.

Conservatives¬†want live babies¬†so¬†they¬†can train them to be¬†dead soldiers. - George Carlin
There isn‚Äôt any amount of money you can pay that‚Äôd make me want kids. I‚Äôd rather die, honestly.
Why should I have a baby when me and my husband‚Äôs rent is $3,200 a month for a one bedroom in San Diego, and we will never be able to afford a home.
Child free does not mean antinatalist, and antinatalist does not necessarily mean childfree (adopting). Do not count them as your allies.
There articles and studies give me hope. People are less likely falling victim to the lies we've been told since we were young
Good news finally :3
One disposable diaper takes 450 years to decompose. Every diaper produces that wasn‚Äôt incinerated still exists on this planet.

That fact is more than enough for me.
Not even counting the antinatalist argument, I just don't have the patience for screaming kids. I never have. I've had to babysit and it definitely wasn't for me. I'm not saying I'd be an abusive parent, but I'd break down many times due to the stress caused by that going on for damn near 4 years straight
üòÇ fuck the country. They can suck my left ass cheek. I ain‚Äôt popping out no damn worker
I honestly did want a family some day. It seemed nice to focus on raising children, settling down, and investing in the younger generation in older years. But I don‚Äôt want to pass on my genetics. It sucks but I won‚Äôt make a good parent. 

I focus my attention on my partner + kids in my family and find other ways to contribute to helping others to fill that need to invest into something outside of myself
The majority of these people who are saying they don't want them is because they can't afford it. There are plenty of natalists in the US. Everyone is paid dick when inflation keeps going up. Not that hard a mystery to solve for the powers at be.
Why would people have kids when we all know it costs a fortune that we couldn't even dream about having? Majority of us can't even go to the doctor when we're sick because we can't afford it and they want us to pop out a child? Do they understand that giving birth alone costs like 2-3k? Do they understand that mothers who are still breastfeeding are forced to go back to work? Do they understand that just quitting your job and becoming a stay at home mom would make you financially dependent on your husband and also ruin your career because of the years long gap in your job history? Probably. They just don't care I guess.
WooooooooHooooooooooo!!!!
god can they just leave us alone already? It‚Äôs not that hard of a concept to understand. I‚Äôm waiting for the headline that says ‚ÄúPeople are STILL out here actually making a conscious choice to procreate! Can you believe this shit?‚Äù
I can‚Äôt wait for my ligation.
Who will fight the wars the Republicans want and who will the priest molest if we stop having kids?
"Into the breeder camps with you!" - JD Vance
i want to live my life so i have no kids.  too busy anyway for em
Republicans hate this one simple trick!
Someone on TikTok under a comment I made abt antinatalism‚Äî said ‚Äî-

‚ÄûLiterally how is it egoistic to start a family and raise kids‚Äú

I can‚Äôt
I just cannot wtf
Anybody else feel like they went, ‚Äúthey said‚Ä¶ they just didn‚Äôt want to‚Äù, after getting told off for 30 minutes straight about how shit the world is?
We are winning
The older I am the less it makes sense to have a kid. Like whats the point of it.
Republicans being so anti-immigration is one of the most frustrating aspects of this situation. 

We shouldn't be forced to give birth when so many people would just be able to take the place of that fictional child
Just found out there are dangerous amounts of Cadmium in chocolate and baby food and huge amounts of pesticides in most fruits and veggies. I don't know what to eat anymore, imagine being pregnant and feeding the fetus all this toxic, neuro-degenerating poisons. And plastics! Even in placentas!!!
Its almost like the rise in CPTSD and Taxes has a correlation to how willingly people settle down/feel secure

Fascinating stuff we've known since the end of the feudal era but *shrugs and sips tea* it is as it is no?
I never wanted kids but it seems like at least once a week I learn about some different genetic disorder that is rare but devastating and the parents had no idea it even existed before they had the kid. I'm so glad I'll never have to live with the guilt of bringing a child into the world to experience that kind of extreme suffering and early death.
I would love to probably have more kids, but the average American can't afford a house. Where am I supposed to pull all these kids?
I kinda hate how that title boils it down tho. Like would I want then if I wasn't bringing them into a world with our current and future climate? Like....probably. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
it's also happening in malaysia, except eastern part
There's so many out there to already take care of, children who need a home a family a life in abundance because of various reasons 

Namely politics 

Please consider adoption
i love this for us
Do they not understand that people can‚Äôt AFFORD it as well. Lmfao
How about we just respect the individual choices of the individual and how they determine to live their lives or not. Jesus, it‚Äôs not hard and I‚Äôm a mom of one!
*Jordan PeterPooh starts crying
ok i'm AN but this is the dumbest, no-shit-sherlock thing ever. The problem is most of them change their minds at some point one way or another (or not), and wind up part of the problem anyway.
What the hell is that title. I read it 3 times and still don‚Äôt understand
I know this is an unpopular opinion in this sub, but wouldn‚Äôt that just mean that the politicians will just relax the immigration laws or turn a blind eye (e.g. Biden‚Äôs controversial immigration policies) to adjust for the decline in birth rates in the country? After all, the wheels of modern society does not work without the working class (let‚Äôs not forget the ‚Äúessential‚Äù employees during the height of Covid). All evidence point that while first world countries birth rate is indeed declining, third world country birth rates are accelerating. We grew as a species by 1 billion in like 10 years and forecasted to grow even more in the near future.
Is this sustainable for a nation? I mean, if this is still going on another 15 years wouldn't the US have a massive depopulation crisis? Sweden is importing working age adults en masse because they started this path a decade earlier.
USA!!!

We live in a discreet poverty, those who can afford nice things for themselves know that it would be a mathematical impossibility to do it with three or more individuals, to divide the resources and get the same live style for each one
It isn‚Äôt because of antinatalism
That‚Äôs awful
The difference is that they don't want kids for themselves...

And *you* don't want *anyone* to have kids.
Yall want em just can‚Äôt afford em be honest

Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt want to have kids in the US either. The women outside the West are top tier. More men are married than women in the US. Why? Foreign brides. Also more women own homes than men. Why? Divorce. Men aren‚Äôt playing this stupid game anymore of risking losing 1/2 of everything you own + child support. Men- don‚Äôt marry or have kids with Western women. Thank me later.
[removed]
Is this a political news sub or a sub about an ideology? I'm sick of hearing about the economy and the conservatives. So when things better you will consider having kids again? I am sure most of you will.
[removed]
My friend group which is about 18ish people, all have planned to have 4-6+ kids starting this year or the next few to combat anti natalist, some have already started.
Chaos of climate change for me, but w/e your reason, fewer humans is better
It's not just that. The government institutions are failing. Criminal justice system is anything but just, we have what amounts to essentially legalized slavery. Social security isn't even enough for a lot of people to pay rent anymore, let alone afford food. Intergenerational households are becoming the norm in the United States, because it is no longer possible for the current generation to afford their own homes even if they are making good money and have prospering careers. 

Many are having to choose between having children and having a home/ financial security. By the time they might become comfortable economically, it might be too late to have kids. 

Natalists will argue that many people in third world countries with worse economic outcomes have a lot of kids and make it work. Yeah, but raising kids in third world standars in the US could literally get them taken away. And might lead to even worse outcomes for you and your family. Thank you criminalization of poverty. 

The hell would anybody bring kids into this situation?
But democrats say this is the strongest economy ever ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That‚Äôs ideal. People who are not capable of achieving any measure of success are not passing on their genes.

Those who are driven and talented continue to do so. The end result should be a better and more capable human race.

We're working on it - America
What gets me is that that JD Vance freak's whole thing is that his mother abandoned him, and that's why he's resentful towards women- but if he outlaws abortion and forces women to have kids they don't want, that'll lead to even more abandoned children.
If they take away rights, you can be celibate and then there‚Äôs nothing else they can do. They‚Äôll just replace the country with immigrants I guess who are willing to accept a lower standard of living.
Kinda though.  If women have choices, they choose not to have kids.  Minorities tend to have less choices, and therefore breed more.  White replacement is happening, it's only a problem if you treat minorities like trash.

oh.
I mean, to be fair it would probably work, ain't what i call an ... acceptable solution tho
Don't forget dismantling the public school system and ensuring that the population is being educated as little as possible.
You forgot legalizing child marriage
Spot on.
Looks like those Bible thumping evangelical conservative. Christians are gonna have to put their little Nepo babies in the line of fire finally and go out and get real jobs since daddy can‚Äôt give them small loans of $450 million to start a lifetime of failure. No more bones spur deferment so we‚Äôre gonna have to go and be cogs, conspicuous consumers of crap, wageslaves, and actual non-evading taxpayers on the front lines ‚Äî

Conservatives oncels grabbing women by the you know having to go get real jobs l‚Äîbut they won‚Äôt be any because the capitalist pigs eliminated them all with AI and the Christian conservative conson√© fueled hypocrite automation nation..

I‚Äôll have to consume their own crap because we ain‚Äôt buying it anymore‚Ä¶so yeah consumers and cogs and cannon fodder tax base of the military/bigPharma Ponzi scheme no longer

The charmed anointed capitalist worshipers of fantasyland skydaddy they‚Äôre gonna have to produce on their own now.. they are about to find out what class antagonism and ‚Äúsurplus labor ‚Äúreally mean. hopefully their luck is running out and they‚Äôll see there is no meritocracy‚Äî- only plutocracy and aristocracy, and theirs is about to end in one giant crash and burn meteor strike fireball; welcome to the real world
they'll be doing that regardless
Don't give them idea ngl or soon America might copy china's dictatorship.
Ending no fault divorce, abortion, birth control, banning women from working, and taking away suffrage would do a lot to make women more agreeable.
Not to mention that in states with abortion bans of any type, both infant and maternal mortality rates have gone up. Banning/restricting abortion helps no one and relegates women and their families to a garbage quality of life. I‚Äôm glad states are starting to put abortion on the ticket this election.
I am male and I strongly support this too. The equivalent would be like someone forcing me to donate sperm and then forcing me to raise the children born from it. Its just not right.
Are you suggesting that abortion was a form of birth control before it was banned? Be nonchalant about contraception and if you get pregnant you could just abort the damn thing?
Abortion is murder
The best form of birth control is simply looking at the families around me and that I see as a cashier

When they're young there's the screaming and crying and asking mind numbing questions (yesterday I was checking out a woman in her early 20s with 2 toddlers who she was explaining how to use cards to, as someone who enjoys listening more than talking & gets tired of it quickly it looks like an easy way to cause me daily breakdowns). Not to mention that I get to see the amount people spend on kids clothes

When they're older they begin getting greedy & trying to find ways to fuck parents over specially financially wise. Being Mexican ive heard many cases of a parent working in the US and sending money to their children, then finding out later they're using that money to party, drink or hang out with friends

And now my parents are old and are worried about how me and my brothers will deal with the grief when they're gone (happy for myself though whos the youngest out of my brothers & cousins i talk to & the only girl so hopefully ill die last and have no one to miss me or mourn for me, I can die in peace)
‚ÄúI had a bad time so everyone else must have had a bad time too‚Äù
Even 2 million doesn't go all that far these days.
Seriously it‚Äôs so dumb.. people believe they‚Äôre just a few months from becoming rich it‚Äôs a disease.. more than likely your child will be average just like you and will slave away like most people AT BEST
Oh hell yes. I feel like 99% of people are fucking oblivious to how competitive and expensive everything is now. Are people completely blind? Things are rapidly moving in a direction where children today don't have the hope for a basic future (even just a hope, not a guarantee) for a basic standard living that past generation had. Why anyone who didn't have a cool 2 million liquid TODAY would have a kid is beyond me.

But eh, my choice is made. Masses will have to learn the hard way.

This is why no one likes antinatalists
Let's not give ourselves too much credit, most of the birth rate decline is because people are realizing harsh reality for themselves regardless of whether we point it out or not.
We still increase the worlds population by 240,000 every day.
antinatalists aren't "winning" by talking to each other on Reddit. Hardly anyone outside this site knows what antinatalism is.
Another blunt way to put that is you and your worldview is dying out.
Yeah! Literally look at the USA, Japan, South Korea, China 

All have become rich either throughout the past century or the past 25 years 

Birth rates plummeting
Both result in less births, so I say we have plenty in common
I'm both! Hey yall!!
This!! Lol
lol
Yeah pretty much. Maybe for future generations they will start paying more to fix this but by then they missed the boat with at least 2 generations.
Oh, they understand. They just don‚Äôt care. To be fair, though, they probably can‚Äôt hear other perspectives very well over their very predictable and intellectually lazy cries of ‚ÄúSelfish!‚Äù Citation: a few trolls in this sub

Exactly 
Plus my woman and I are best friends and (we can't have kids now certainly due to surgery) but even to entertain the discussion, like what, put wealth building aside and spending time with each other aside? Just why? Yeah no 

Being a childless couple is literally so fun
Right‚Ä¶just let everyone from poor countries come in and replace the native people while they die off. Even if that happens it only works temporarily, because their kids will grow up here and have the same mindset. They will just have to start planning for a smaller population of people.

Why is it so hard to believe that some people don‚Äôt want kids?
Can afford, don‚Äôt want.
I used to work in family court handling divorces. Your statement is so far from the reality that I saw that it‚Äôs actually laughable.
Well as a tentative progressive/centuries this deeply worries me.

Tentative because I don‚Äôt believe in the false blank slate theory and accept that behaviour is heavily dependent on genetics and genetics are hereditary. 

The people that care about the suffering are literally breeding themselves out of existence. 

We can wonder how many times have anti ideologies risen up and then died out throughout human history before‚Ä¶ I bet you more than once.

lmao it is deranged to have kids to "combat anti-natalists". Once again proving that breeders only have kids for selfish and weird reasons.

Weird people with weird ideas.
Are you in a cult? Will you sacrifice the firstborn? Are the 18 of them having an orgy around some circular altar?
I find it hard to believe that 18 people outside of Reddit have ever heard of antinatalism
[deleted]
Wow. I will lose a lot of sleep knowing that some people I‚Äôve never met are going to spend all their money and healthy years raising children to stick it to us antinatalists. Way to ‚Äúown‚Äù us. Have fun with that!
And that‚Äôs not even getting into our test tube mass production plans!

What about nonhumans? What are your thoughts about their future?

There are some people that I think foolishly believe that nature is some sort of utopia if humans were simply removed from the equation.
Yeah, for the 1%.
All governments claim their economy is the best ever. Republicans have historically loved to kick down the can for the next administration to fix. Democrats seem to have started doing that as well.
Are you a childfree republican?!
It's already happened.
[removed]
It's "white replacement" only for white racists to whom whiteness is something to cherish and preserve (even if at the expense of rights and freedoms of women and POC). What's happening is a slow movement towards a post race society where no one is of one or another race enough to be viewed, judged and discriminated against based on it, and it's a good thing and may lead to better conditions where people might be more willing to start families, you vile fascist dirtbag.

 White women choose to not have kids, among other reasons, because so many white men in their dating pool think like you, who'd sacrifice their rights and freedoms for high demographic numbers, so the rich won't pay too many taxes and their wealth can finally start trickling down to them.
Need to have less than choices, lack of education is also required to be a baby farm.
Found the racist
Genuinely curious to see any evidence to back up these inflammatory conclusions you've made.
Being essentially boxed in and forced to do something with no viable alternative isn't exactly what I'd call being "more agreeable." 

That's like saying threatening to torture or kill a hostage makes them more agreeable to giving you information.  Like yeah, no shit.
It might be a "last resort cause every thing else failed" birth control, but yes, it's still a form of birth control and healthcare.
Abortion has been a form of birth control since the beginning of time. Most men are apparently unaware of this fact. Hell, there's an instruction manual in the Bible - check out Numbers 5:11-31. Women worldwide have been using abortifacients for thousands of years. Men have also *forced* women to have abortions for thousands of years.

Just because you haven't done the research doesn't mean that this is some new phenomenon. Women worldwide have induced abortions for generations. It is very cute, however, that the sex whose only part in reproduction is an orgasm feels they have some sort of moral high ground here.
Invested from the day the child is born, maybe. As inheritance, maybe it will be able to buy a box of M&Ms, given current inflation.
The problem is, previous generations saw nothing wrong with that. That‚Äôs the mentality I see. Most people had kids and lived an average life and were content with that.
The boomer parents told them it will all work out, or they threatened their inheritance if they didn‚Äôt have kids.
Damn. Some sort of Jew hate. Heavy.
That‚Äôs vague. Cause we don‚Äôt like to watch suffering? Cause we don‚Äôt like to spend money on a soul who didn‚Äôt ask to be here on this plain of existence? 
Cause we don‚Äôt have to create life to convince ourselves we have power? Genuine curiousity. No animosity intended. I think your glasses may need to get checked
More people getting on board everyday. The tide is turning. I guess saying no one does is false.
You got the line wrong! It‚Äôs ‚Äúthis is why no one likes moral philosophy professors‚Äù
Yeah, I'd say subs like kidsarefuckingdumb are putting in more work than our sub that is like 50% natalists brigading and 25% infighting.
It‚Äôs mostly because people are selfish and would rather live a more fun lifestyle than take on the responsibility of raising children
They don't have to know what it is while actively living an antinatalist life or having similar views. I spent most of my life with social indecisiveness before learning it was anxiety.
Maybe in the long term. But for now it seems to be correct!
Happy cake day!
It's funny because I have not seen a single instance where someone was like "welp, you know what, you're totally right. I am selfish I should go devote all my time to making some." What an absolute troll brigade. They aren't convincing anyone but their own fanatics
Hahaha this is awesome  üòÇ
As a woman, I don't want to be forced to have kids is my point
Because miserable people need to feel validated In their decisions.  They get that validation by assuming everyone else would choose the same.  Someone choosing to be childfree invalidates their decision and messes with their heads.
Same!
Majority of men lose in divorce court, pay alimony & child support. Almost every woman on Forbes made her money through inheritance or divorce. You working in family court means jack shit. You‚Äôre avoiding reality or flat out lying. (Exception =\= rule) Foreign woman are still a risk but Western women are a near guarantee of divorce & wealth loss. (And they‚Äôre masculine/overweight in the US) If you deny that then get out more. Get a passport and prove me wrong. You wont.
I work in the court of having a general look around at things. His comment sounds like it had some merit imo
Imagine believing a random reddit comment and taking it so personally
Something like that
I mean, the tone was pretty on-brand from what I‚Äôve seen of the trolls here.
üòÇüòÇ idk how no one realized I‚Äôm joking
In what regarf
>There are some people that I think foolishly believe that nature is some sort of utopia if humans were simply removed from the equation.

Well, if humans suddenly disappeared, pollution would dramatically be reduced almost instantly. Similar to what we saw during covid shutdowns, but to an even greater extent. 

Nature tends to balance things out. Life is still brutal for animals, but no less chance of them being born into a mass production farm, or being hit by a car. 

I can't say for sure where our climate is heading at this point, but if humans disappeared, the rest of the planet, for the most part, would be better off.
Life and existence is not a utopia, the fundamental and immutable building blocks and laws of nature are such that it's about survival, not fun, not enjoyment, but a battle to simply continue being alive. Why do you think we have not seen any life anywhere else? Because life is pretty much a fluke and quite difficult to sustain, the world wasn't made for living beings, living beings reproduces RAPIDLY (especially the early ones like bacteria) and the VAST majority of them died, but the other ones continued reproducing and they just so happened to have better survival genes (otherwise they would have probably also liked), do this 10 billion times and you have complicated organisms that are still prone to hundreds of diseases, predation, injuries, you name it.

  
The reason we don't consider nonhumans is because like humans, they reproduce because they want to (instinct), rape does happen, I mean look at ducks, but it's ABSURDLY beyond the capabilites of humans to do jack shit about it. So we should center on human suffering, we owe nothing to wild animals except leaving them be and hopefully not destroy or negatively affect their environment.

Fewer humans would still be better for nature, no utopia, but better, because instead of 1000 things trying to kill them, it will be 900 (the numbers are as an example, not realistic at all), because we took out deforestation, pollution, bringing invasive species, plastic, etc.
Insects are going extinct
We're in the new Gilded age
Yea such a joke, these last few years have wrecked our economy, I can‚Äôt blame anyone for not wanting kids in this economy
Yea such a terrible situation. Since I have citizenship in two other countries I‚Äôll probably relocate soon.
Not republican and I have several children that I know about
Oh, there's still more to do. We haven't banned birth control at a federal level yet! We haven't allowed Texan bounty hunters to drag pregnant Californian citizens (as determined by period tracking apps) to Texas to be caged until birth.

We still might even get to appoint child brides for incels! (LOYAL incels, that is).
Fair wages and a good work-life balance is the alternative‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm not sure I see those in power going for that one.
Sure seems that way
Well, I would not go that far. I hope sometime in the future women could have 2 or 3 kids without too much hassle and still be able to work if they want to. It's just that nowadays many are disencouraged by how expensive children are and how much attention they require. As long as having children means sacrificing most of the other fun things in life, then yeah, I'd say most women will have fewer or no kids and THEN only can the birthrate stay stable if women are forced.

But if we get to that point, extinction is the better choice.
What's really funny is that many of those "lily-white" racists have black or other dark skinned heritage in their bloodline.
Have you met a black person who didn't have black pride? Post racial society my ass. If anything, people are more concerned now with their race than they were 30 years ago.
That poor people have children in higher numbers is generally not contested. Poor people tend to have less options than middle class+. They‚Äôre not going to college, grad school, traveling. Their options are military, or low wage jobs. So they have kids because that will a) bring them joy in a somewhat bleak life, or b) make them eligible for government benefits. Minorities overindex on being poor. What part is inflammatory?
Well, at least we won‚Äôt have a problem with split families or the birth rate.
Well that just changes my entire perspective about Abortion. I start to see why some people want it banned in their state. Calling abortion similar to birth control or contraception is wild.
Back then a janitor could afford to support a family and have his wife stay home with the kids. Now it‚Äôs impossible, a decent life is much harder to obtain and will be harder for future generations
All you said here is that you're broke asf
Do people not choose to create life based on any form of morality at all or? Professor or not I would definitely give that some thought. Just to be present in the moment, but still that‚Äôs a cool line I guess
How is choosing to not have kids selfish? There‚Äôs no line of ghost babies waiting to be born and collectively going ‚ÄúOh darn!‚Äù when somebody uses a condom/gets a birth control rod implanted. 

What‚Äôs REALLY selfish is having a kid and then constantly rubbing in their face how much it costs to raise them/what you had to give up for them/how they wrecked your body. No child EVER asked to be born and it‚Äôs literally the law that you have to feed/clothe/house/educate/take them to the doctor if they‚Äôre sick. If they‚Äôre going to be resented then just don‚Äôt have them in the first place. 

I would also say that it‚Äôs straight up child abuse to bring a child into the world when it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre going to be living in poverty. It‚Äôs not about what anybody ‚Äúwants‚Äù in this case. It‚Äôs about can you afford the extra $1,097 a month (barebones minimum cost to raise a kid to 18 in the USA)? It‚Äôs not the responsibility of other taxpayers/neighbors/extended family/anybody who isn‚Äôt the parents to provide for kids that aren‚Äôt theirs.
How is it selfish to recognize you can‚Äôt afford to give the child the life it deserves without choosing to also be absent while working all the damned time? If anything, that‚Äôs the OPPOSITE of selfish. Opting out of something because someone else may suffer is not a selfish act. Forcing them to have children they can‚Äôt afford while also removing all assistance for those children so you don‚Äôt have to pay more in taxes is what‚Äôs selfish.
To whom am I being selfish by not having kids?
I'd argue having children is the most selfish thing you could possibly do.
[removed]
At least, when it comes to me, you're absolutely correct. I wonder, however, which is more damaging: recognizing that I am selfish in this way, or failing to do so, and growing to resent my offspring?
Kids are a choice, not a requirement.  You are not selfish if you choose not to have kids.   I support the economy by working a full time job and paying my taxes.
I am unabashedly absolutely super duper selfish.
I‚Äôm interested in what you mean by ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù. 

I‚Äôd love to hear a brief summary of your worldview and how you come to that conclusion.
They should have ‚ÄúTroll Brigade‚Äù flair ü§£
So don‚Äôt have them. Immigration should not be a solution to this. Planning for a lower future population is better.
They might not even be miserable about their choice‚Äîjust upset that not everyone is impressed by it.
I am neither avoiding reality nor lying, and I have a very well-worn passport. I am also in great shape. Can you come up with some more baseless assumptions for me to laugh at?
Which part(s)?
The planet cannot suffer‚Ä¶ Only scent in beings can suffer.

If the habitat of sentient beings is damaged that of course can cause an additional suffering to sentient beings. 

6 1/2 years completely animal product free. 

I have spent considerable time within vegan circles and antenatalism is very widely subscribed. 

But I see these vegans committing the same logical fallacy as non-vegans I‚Äôm going to go out on a stretch and say including yourself are committing‚Ä¶ 

That is the naturalistic fallacy which says that nature is good.

No nature and natural are evil if evil means anything.  Mitigated suffering when it may not be unmitigated is evil.

Humans are creative, compassionate and capable‚Ä¶ Important emphasis on the last one‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the one that gets us into lots of trouble. 


It is our capability that truly sets us apart. 

We can literally rewrite the DNA to avoid debilitating illnesses‚Ä¶ Or we can lock up animals in tiny cages and kill them and eat them. We have tremendous power.

What I advocate for is the compassionate use of this tremendous power to do good. 

But I also believe in the deterministic impact of genetics on behaviour.

We don‚Äôt know where compassion comes from‚Ä¶ Many traits are 50-50 in terms of environment/genetics.

Either way if a group of people determined to reduce suffering organise around the idea of not having children they I fear will quite literally breed out these genetic traits. 

Yes‚Ä¶ All of these ideas combined mean I have very few friends!
We intervene with wild animal all the time‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve literally erased countless species from existence in a very short period of time. This has had countless impacts on the remaining wild animals which may or may not have increased overall suffering of the individuals in the remaining species.

It‚Äôs also not widely known that there are positive things that humans have done for wild animal populations such as vaccination drives and other suffering and harm minimization techniques. Of course, messing around with any ecosystem is inherently extremely complex, so it is important to test, implement, verify, and test again, and repeat. However, I also don‚Äôt think letting perfect be the enemy of good is a great idea, given how carelessly we have annihilated much of the earth's ecosystem in the past couple of centuries.

I think if we actually put our concerted effort into intentionally making specific interventions that are tentative well tested and even reversible, that is a great path to follow.

As someone who has lived for over six years completely animal product-free‚Ä¶ I have a bit of a different perspective‚Ä¶ 

If we can successfully convince a majority of people to do the same and avoid human-caused animal suffering, then we might have the chance for a coalition of people who might take the next step in much more broadly intervening in wild animal suffering. But, I admit engaging in a discussion about this while people are eating animals 5 to 7 times a day is a little premature, to say the least.

I say this just as a defence of my worldview that I do, in fact, care about the suffering of all sentient beings. However, there are clear, obvious practical limitations based on the overwhelming behavioural patterns of most humans today.
We must address that. Where there is a will there is a way. 

We need to educate people so that they will this action to occur. 

Non-human animals and humans survived alongside each other for hundreds of thousands of years‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs nothing inherently about humans that causes environmental destruction but simply the choices that we have made‚Ä¶ We can make new choices and we can correct past mistakes.
Why do people keep bringing up "the economy" like that changes anything? Even if everyone in the Impoverished United States could be born with an entitlement to a 10 bedroom house, Ferrari and Iphone what changes? Like "yay lets bring more people into this world to Eat, Shit, then Die üòÉ"

Edit: assuming theyre born with their eating and shitting and eating capabilities fully intact and funtional
Outstanding. 

Getting more than one citizenship is the best thing a person can do. No single government can screw you over.
Gross so why are you here
There's currently a law on the Texan books, making it illegal to get an abortion in a different state. This has a bazillion legal challenges to it, as it's pretty obviously unconstitutional under the interstate commerce clause. However a lot of people think it might be upheld by the current Supreme Court anyway
I can't imagine having to have my horrible period symptoms again. This is not just for being childfree, it's hard to live without bc. 10+ days with heavy flows are a nightmare. I don't want children, but this is going to fuck up lives for even people who want children and need to be on bc
Including banning vasectomy etc. Mines already done so at least it would be many times harder to force me into a reversal.
Black pride is very different to white pride. Black pride is a reminder of what black race survived to be here today, and white pride is a clinging to the power and privilege that's slipping away. Black pride is a thing of today, and it very much belongs in today. Post-racial society will happen when society will heal from the wounds white colonialism inflicted on humanity. It won't be soon, it might never happen, but we have to go towards it one step at a time today and keep going no matter how long it will take us.
Or also they might just have them bc they don't have access to health/ family planning care!
I think they don‚Äôt like that white replacement is real.  It‚Äôs supposed to be a conservative conspiracy, but it‚Äôs just demographic trending caused by all of what you said.

It‚Äôs only a thing to fear if you expect minorities to treat whites like conservatives treat minorities when the demographic shift reaches a tipping point.
Are you advocating for this?
Buddy, if I do everything in my fucking power to not get pregnant and I get pregnant, I'm either killing myself (which will kill the fetus anyway) or I'm aborting. Fuck that noise.
It‚Äôs the last resort, as someone else mentioned. When I said I was ‚Äúnonchalant‚Äù about contraceptives, what I actually meant was that I did everything I could without being worried about getting pregnant. I was never worried about having sex with my partner. I used everything available to me on the market. I know that nothing, except some forms of surgical sterilization, is 100% effective and I was ok with that because I still had the last resort option. I could safely abort under regular medical care without being worried about my own health. 

Now, sex became worrisome to me and I can‚Äôt treat it as nonchalant as I used to. One of my basic care rights was taken away from me. 

Also, remember one very important thing: A WOMAN CANNOT ABORT A PREGNANCY IF SHE WAS RAPED! Does a single, celibate woman need to take birth control? Why should she bother? What about teen girls that are entering womanhood without a care in the world? There are many women out there who do not need to worry about this kind of thing unless they are raped! What‚Äôs wild to me is that you don‚Äôt understand the absurdity of banning abortions.
Because broke people are the only ones aware of what they do with their money! I get it. ü§£ very funny guy. I love jokes
It‚Äôs a joke from the show The Good Place, but go off
Someday you will draw on social security you will be too old to work or care for yourself and you will need younger people to provide services for you, maintain infrastructure, etc so for you to take advantage of all that without doing your share by repopulating is freeloading 

Additionally kids are expensive and time consuming to raise, lots of people would rather spend that money and time on themselves. Some people might claim they don‚Äôt have kids because climate change, crime etc and there may be a few who genuinely feel that way but most just don‚Äôt want to responsibility and burden ie selfishness
[removed]
Nice straw man.
Not kidding is selfish for several reasons, first you are choosing to spent your money and time on yourself than raising people to be good stewards of the earth: your own comfort is more important to you than improving our world and society. Second, you benefit immensely from others having children, the economy, infrastructure, social security, all falls apart without population being replaced. You take advantage of programs but refuse to give back ‚Äúfuck then, I got mine‚Äù is your mentality. Someday when you are old you will need the infrastructure and services run by younger people to live, but you are too selfish to think critically about this.
That‚Äôs why you are bad at making arguments ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Then it‚Äôs good you don‚Äôt have kids, that‚Äôs why I am an antinatalist, it‚Äôs not for everyone
I dont have much to offer in that regard, just that in general it seems to be an increasing trend as time goes on and personally believe it will continue to increase unless the general trajectory countries are on starts swinging the other way (also think that's very unlikely.)  Hope that's what you were looking for.
I think a lot of people don‚Äôt realize that having kids is a choice not a requirement until after they have kids.  Then they get angry at those of us who knew it was a choice when they didn‚Äôt.
Ok so you know I‚Äôm right then. Western women can‚Äôt compete with non-western women (unless it‚Äôs a pie eating contest). America is one of the fattest countries. You also don‚Äôt know what an exception to the rule is. That‚Äôs laughable. You being skinny doesn‚Äôt mean most are. I‚Äôm just happy more men are marrying overseas. Passport bros dominating. Am I ‚Äúwrong‚Äù about that too? Let me guess not true cause ‚ÄúI married an American‚Äù. I love your straw-man arguments. Thank god marriage rates are down. It‚Äôs a Lose/lose for men. You‚Äôre gonna have to keep working hard! No more free rides.
>Either way if a group of people determined to reduce suffering organise around the idea of not having children they I fear will quite literally breed out these genetic traits. 

The only reason that childfree ideas never get that popular. They're not raising kids from birth to believe the things they do. 

Childfree livestyles are adopted for all kinds of reasons. Lack of financial stability, lack of reproductive ability, lack of funding to adopt, a desire to travel a lot, a disdain for noise and mess, etc. 

It will never catch on the way "big family good" mentalities do, because we aren't thrice multiplying our numbers and raising people who will likely go on to live the same way. 

Child free people are just big chilling. 

For now, I'm child free because kids are messy, loud, and expensive. And I'm a woman, so I'll be statistically a lot more likely to do most of the work. 

If I were a man who didn't have to give birth, lose career advancement opportunities, or handle the majority of the childcare labor, I would be more down to have kids.

As a woman, it's too much work, and I don't want to. That could change with the right partner, but even if I did ever raise a kid, I would (as they get older) teach them about respecting all different ways of living.
No, no, you misunderstand, I agree we have caused extinctions. Are they countless? Compared to all animals not even CLOSE. But we do still objectively negatively affect the environment. But here's the REALLY important part, we do it because of economic reasons, we get richer, more tech, medicine, infrastructure, just all forms of comfort that you and me now use for granted. Heck, have you ever ridden a car or any form of public transit, well, you are using the fruits of some environmental destruction.

But vaccinating animals that are not pets is the exact opposite, it can come only through higher taxes, it's best if they come from the rich, but we all know that has an even lower chance than what we are talking about. And if it happens, give it a decade, now it's no longer so. Because helping nature takes resources away from people and therefore makes us poorer.

Having both a perfectly intact and healthy environment AND having TVs, internet, phones, etc. is not compatible, it's a contradiction brought about as a consequence of what resources nature itself says are needed (you can't change cobalt for some simple rocks, it has to be cobalt due to its inherent physical and chemical properties that arise from immutable laws of nature, namely quantum mechanics), where those resources are and how to efficiently (synonymous with cheaply, otherwise it will be more expensive for you, the consumer) get them, which most often than not happens to involve some environmental destruction. 

This is why I am antinatalist, utopias are impossible, we cannot have our cake and eat it too, but the unborn are perfect, they have no wants and they are literally incapable of minding or caring or complaining about anything whatsoever AT ALL.

On the veganism stance, that is easier to defend, veganism has some pretty good arguments. But that won't save nature I'm afraid, we only eat like 10 animals, mostly 3 of them (pigs, cows, chickens), not the other thousands.
Probably their top concern. Others can include but not limited to: climate change, overpopulation, limited resources, limited time, etc.
Yes but the other citizenships I have, Canadian and Italian, are not much better lol and worse in some ways. There is certainly no perfect place.
I am pro children for myself but I am against all of you degenerates (the general public) having children, so i consider myself antinatalist. ‚úå
Username checks out lol

What about my ancestors who were enslaved by Muslims?¬†

Oh wait I don‚Äôt give a shit because it was hundreds of years ago. Every single race has been slaves before.¬†
So you at least can agree that we are currently not headed to a post racial society. If black people aren't on board with that until they heal...then we won't reach that point as a society. Until everyone, including blacks, can approach that society together, conflict between races is inevitable.
That too!
[removed]
Oops. I forgot the subreddit. Lol
If you ask for my personal opinion (not that it's relevant): I only understand abortion in cases of rape, incest, minors and life of the mother. I'm dying on that hill. 

The fact that people think it should be alright to abort a 20 week fetus is truly something else. Not sure how we came to this point. That's a child you're killing and pulling out of your body. It's a human being. 

Two adults should take responsibility for something they create. Why should we allow abortion? What reasons are valid for taking human life? We don't allow men to walk away from fatherhood (for good reason). Abortion is taking human life for convenient reasons. 1 in 5 US pregnancies end in abortion, that's awful. 

I do not mean to patronize you, I do not write legislation for the United States. My opinion means nothing. I just want to understand your perspective.
The pill is 99% effective when used correctly, so are condoms. Tracking your ovulation cycles is another effective method. IUDs are higher than 99% effective. A combination of these birth control methods would put your pregnancy odds close to zero. Getting pregnant at that point is a miracle.

Surgical procedures are obviously highly effective. If you're certain you never want to get pregnant that's always an option.
I love jokes too!
Lmao bro, if I'm ever that helpless just take me out back and put me out. you'd be doing me a favour anyway. I dont need to leech off my non existent kids labour the way rich do. Selfishness my ass.
How is making sure a child isn‚Äôt born into poverty selfish? 

How is making sure a child isn‚Äôt resented for existing selfish? 

There‚Äôs no way you aren‚Äôt a troll so I‚Äôm stopping all interaction.
No it‚Äôs not a straw man. I choose to not have children because the child would suffer in the life I could provide for it. How is that selfish or a straw man?
Nice low effort
>choosing to spent your money and time on yourself than raising people to be good stewards of the earth: your own comfort is more important to you than improving our world and society

Bold of you to think I don't do this myself. If everyone has kids to improve the world, then nobody is actually doing the improving

>the economy, infrastructure, social security, all falls apart without population being replaced

It's not my fault the current economic system is a pyramid scam that always needs more and more people to be sustainable
Having Children is a choice. Not a requirement. I work a full time job and pax taxes.  My taxes pay for things like schools, wic and snap.  I‚Äôm not utilizing these resources.   I also don‚Äôt get the tax breaks that people with children do.  I do not owe the world a child. 

Why are you here?
Good stewards of the earth LMFAO!!!!! Improving the world and society? Have you met the human race??? We just fucking bomb the shit out of each other and burn oil!

I agree. I knew I never wanted children when the first time my parents asked me to babysit the Neighbor kid and I did. I was like fuck this. Lol.
oh, not quite, I mean, when you say antinatalism is "correct", what is your reasoning that lands you there?
Ah, yes, there it is. Assuming that I, an attorney, am getting a free ride. You are good at this! You are absolutely right about one thing, though: I‚Äôm not going to disclose my identity to an angry, aggressive stranger on the Internet so I can prove to him that I have a passport, am not fat, worked where I said I worked, and saw foreign women playing American men like flutes. Also, way to highlight women in Forbes in one sentence and exceptions and rules in the next. Anyway, what do I know? I‚Äôm just a passport sis who married a foreign man. Enjoy your life and stop making assumptions about people. You could have disagreed with me without creating a character in your head to hate.
This is beautiful.
That‚Äôs very interesting. I‚Äôd love to hear your take on this:

Scenario:
An unknown animal, potentially a human, is behind a curtain.

Question:
Without using the word ‚Äòspecies‚Äô or any named ‚Äòspecies‚Äô (human, dog, pig, etc.), what information would you need about (a) the individual and (b) factors external to the individual to make an informed decision about the ethics of breeding, killing, and consuming the individual?

Purpose:
The purpose is to have you clearly state your criteria for making ethical decisions. This encourages you to think more deeply about what really matters in ethical considerations.
What are you talking about? Italy is a founding member of the European Union. You have a large choice of countries to go to. 27 of them.
Cool story bro
Why u avoiding the question
Western society of today is still built by whites for whites and to treat non-whites as second-class citizens, so no, you don't get to demand sympathy when you stub your toe or when your white privilege is being dismantled. You'll have same rules for all when all will be on the same level.

Maybe that has something to do with the fact that you had hundreds of years of Muslims having no say in how you lived your life? Like if racism stops being a thing on all levels they won't give a shit either in a few hundreds of years?
We are on our way there. Healing is part of the journey and needs to happen first. It takes work we have to put in now.
Or maybe they just want to share their love with children and a spouse and build a family

So weird, right
Pretty sure whites are under 50%, but still the largest demographic.  Doomsday is still a bit off.
So is it better for the child to be born to people who don‚Äôt want or can‚Äôt afford him/her?
Who cares. Women will get abortions whether it‚Äôs legal or not. It‚Äôs just a matter of easy and legal access vs other ways. Rich people will still get their abortions. They won‚Äôt ruin their life because some rando would disagree with their choice. Also, plenty of men walk away from fatherhood and have loopholes to get around it if they want to. I feel like this topic is blown out of proportion and shouldn‚Äôt even be involved in politics. From a spiritual perspective, I find it‚Äôs not a big deal. If someone wants to be born, they will be born whether it‚Äôs to that person at a future time or someone else.
Oh, I get it now‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre right wing, probably, religious pronatalist who came to this sub to try and change people‚Äôs perspectives on life, death and childbirth. The conversation is over‚Ä¶ anti nataliats do not argue‚Ä¶ they made their minds long time ago and people like you only solidify their choices.
‚ÄúDid you know the average cost of raising a child born in 2024 is 312,000 dollars? Man. Yall some brokies out here for not wanting to spend that!‚Äù
Me if I was Mr Jokey Joke Maker
Children are expensive, some people choose to not have children so they can instead use that money on themselves, it‚Äôs not hard to understand
Not your fault but you still benefit from it immensely
Right? Our tax dollars fund schools that we don‚Äôt use. We pay into social security but probably won‚Äôt get a dime out of what we put in. We pick up the slack at work when people go out on parental leave or have all kinds of child-related obligations. There are children in foster care who need good families, and this troll is in here calling US selfish because we are exercising our right to decide what to do with our bodies, time, and money. Gross.
Humans do way more than those two things. I suggest you educate yourself

Yea some people are too selfish for it, it‚Äôs good to be honest about it and there are ways to improve the world outside of having kids
Ah that's where our confusion lies. I didn't mean it specifically to say "antinatalism is correct" but to the reply you had to "WE'RE WINNING". in other words, I just believe in the time being that original commenter would be correct in saying that more people are trending towards not having children. 

With the assumption that your reply saying "your worldview is dying out" means without children to pass on that view, it will die out eventually. Which i could be making a mistaken assumption  there as well. Communication is hard.
Well, tbh my criteria is if I am killing it for meat and I know it's edible, then it's more ethical (according to me and other humans, not as a fact of life or objective in any sense, to a cow we are monsters and rightfully so). 

If it's a human I wouldn't want to kill it for the sole two reasons being that it's the same species as me and that it can feel higher mental pain than other animals because consciousness and higher cognitive functions are a burden that causes suffering. Same reason we ain't satisfied with having what animals have, they just don't know more or even have a grasp of it, ignorance is bliss.

I know you didn't want me to use the word "human", but I hope I expressed my reason as to why I treat humans different to animals, but don't expect it to sound satisfying. Life isn't satisfying and rarely gives such answers.

Ethics is solely a human thing, a bear will not care if it tramples you, it will not mourn, not will most other animals (apes might be different, unsure), and reality as in the Universe and all its laws REALLY doesn't care for ethics, an asteroid capable of killing most life will not change its trajectory for us.

But I do agree animals feel real physical pain, like humans do, they just don't care if they inflict it on others. A lion kills a deer without mourning. A seagull will eat a mouse the same way. Just giving examples, you know the jist. Sounds terrible, right? Welcome to objective reality! It's why I don't want to being children into it.
In terms of healthcare, I know it‚Äôs low cost or even free there but I have a good job in the US that subsidizes mine right now (federal government) so I get good healthcare from American doctors, also all the unchecked immigration in Europe has ruined a lot of the cities, maybe similar situation in the US but where I live in Colorado it‚Äôs not an issue right now. If things get really bad then I‚Äôll jump ship to the EU or Canada but for now it‚Äôs better healthcare and safer here, who knows how that will change in November though, might have to make a rapido exit
Check my post history I hold many antinatalist views

Japan was racist as shit to me. I didn‚Äôt care lol.¬†
Lol no we arent. Part of that healing is going to include not blaming "white people" we aren't close to that at all
Some of them, sure. But what choice do a lot of them have? If I didn‚Äôt go to college and start a career and travel and go to grad school, I might‚Äôve popped a kid out at 18 too.
Yes, a chance at life is infinitely better than being killed. Besides, why is that your decision? The bottom line is, it's not your life. It's another human being, and killing it because you think it doesn't want a life is a tragedy. It's not your life, it shouldn't be your decision.

We don't offer to kill unwanted babies after they're born. It's clearly not okay to kill a two-week-old infant because the parents don't want it or can't afford it. How is that any different? 

There's no difference in mortal being between a two-week-old infant and a 35-year-old adult; they're just at different stages of human life. The fetal stage is the first stage of human life, preceding infancy. We must protect every human life to the best of our ability. 

Your argument is similar to "is it better to die or be homeless?" Some might say it's better to die, some might say it's better to live. In the end, it should be your own decision. There's no right answer, and I hope nobody tries to make that decision for you.
That's $15k per year shared between 2 parents! Yall some brokies for not having $7k each year. Goodness! $550 a month before tax benefits? I could never imagine. 

The jokey joker maker strikes again.
What‚Äôs wrong with that?
You didn‚Äôt go to school? It‚Äôs starting to make sense now
Yeah we do i know. Its just really frustrating sometimes we could be so much better. And personally I feel like we've already overstepped our consumption of the planet with this amount of people.  I know we have conflicting opinions on this but personally I think we could ease off the birthrate for awhile and stabilize at a smaller population and we'd be better off. But in the grand scheme of things its not gonna matter much to me what people choose to do.
Indeed communication is hard but it sounds like you are a pro. Great job.

So what are your thoughts about antenatal ism?
I'm getting really bad vibes from this rhetoric of cities being "ruined" by immigration... while talking about "jumping ship" in the same breath.

It's not for you to decide what it should or shouldn't include.

Some people think that living life totally self focused

Might be unhealthy
So it‚Äôs better to condemn a child to a hard life than to terminate a pregnancy even before a nervous system is detected and pain can be felt?
This seems very different from another person deciding whether I become homeless because in that case, the other person‚Äôs body is not going to be permanently altered in the process of giving me a miserable life. If there are no right answers in that scenario, why is there a right answer in the case of abortion?
Hell where I stay, that‚Äôs a one bedroom apartment for the year. On one head, two heads doesn‚Äôt matter. That same 15k. You could essentially retire on that. Keep the jokes going I‚Äôm rolling. You‚Äôre really striking alright. Striking out. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ü§£

Yea some cities are completely unlivable if you value the safety of your family
It's not "bad vibes" lol, Europe is sinking quicker than America is. Healthcare is in shambles, taxes keep going up, immigration is causing problems and wages are stagnant. 

EU nations have just as many problems as the US. Pick your poison I guess.

‚ÄúNot really‚Äù
i dont know what she means still
Still proud of Lynch and Frost for that one. And for making a fully developed trans woman character in a 90s sitcom.
These five simple words have formed a major underpinning of my philosophy for acceptance.
Hell I enjoyed this comment because he's in it
Man is responsible for the invention of the word "shipping" to mean pairing two characters together.

That's part of history right there
I love David Duchovny. I‚Äôve enjoyed just about everything she‚Äôs been in.
I never took a close look at Leo's ad; I don't see how he couldn't be bi, posting that
Ronette was bi too, she and Laura had a thing. Also Theresa Banks.

And believe it or not, Josie. Apparently the English lessons Laura was giving her were just an excuse to hook up, which Laura disliked because she felt deceived and liked to keep those parts of her life separate.

Also Blackie, but Blackie can fuck herself.
Diversity win! The local drug dealer wife beater rapist is bisexual üéâ
Weren‚Äôt Laura and Josie lovers per the secret diary? No?
I read Secret Diary recently and I seem to recall it implied Leo is bi in there too. I think Laura mentions something about Leo always wanting other guys involved or something like.
You know, I never looked closely at the ad. You're spot on! I did always wonder why he had a photo of his damn truck. But that figures now, as he's baiting as the butch trucker type, lol.

For those who haven't looked closely at the ad, it reads:

"KS19.087. Single white male... young and virile, seeks older females and couples as well as some select Bi males. Have 4 years of swinging experience and a lot to offer sexciting playmates. Prefer couples where half is bi. Photo and phone necessary for reply. I want good times, so serious inquiries only, please."
Also, do allies and supporters of LGBTQ+ individuals not deserve to celebrate pride? They‚Äôve always been welcomed to pride celebrations where I‚Äôm from.
Sorry, only the T matters now.

I think the love boat had a trans character
Dog Day Afternoon
I'm guessing you may be a younger fan. I see your point, especially in this day and age. Its hard for younger folks today to understand just how TRULY GROUNDBREAKING Denise was for the time.A NBC police procedural show in  1991 is considered to be the first real ( not for a joke) same sex KISS on network television. So, to have an unapologetic, strong, sensitive, intelligent, and complex transwoman as an important character was beyond groundbreaking. It shattered the whole damn floor.  I think Duchovny handled her character so well even though this would have been quite a risky role for his career at the time.
Eh I'm trans and couldn't care less ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the portrayal being humanising is all that matters to me. I respect your preference, but it's always been way below realistic and human portrayals on the priority lost for me. Fortunately these days we have a wider range of representation that also includes trans people playing trans people, and trans people playing cis people too!
1992 was a long time ago
Would‚Äôve been really cool if she was played by an actual trans woman, it is a shame that a lot of trans roles were given to cis men, but I think that we should be appreciative of the fact that the role was played very respectively!
Tbf, she was cross dressing at the time. She was still egg.
I don‚Äôt understand why people are downvoting you and I‚Äôm sorry that they are. I‚Äôm not trans myself but for the sake of discussion I‚Äôd like to pose the question - how many out trans people were pursuing acting careers in mainstream media in 1991? There may have been some, and Twin Peaks was good about casting lesser-known actors, but I don‚Äôt think there was a very large group to choose from
Can never win

Ugh.
It‚Äôs funny but I recently watched X Files without having seen it and TP for a long time. I kept thinking Duchovny was playing both him and his sister in X. Some episodes were really out there so it didn‚Äôt seem like a total stretch until I looked it up üòÇ

I mean, it was 1990.  Baby steps are better than not going anywhere.
What about a straight character being played by a gay actor? Where do you draw the line?
For one, trans people can be straight what on earth are you talking about, I hope you meant cis and aren't just ignorant.   
Secondly, its acting, thats the point. Are you really implying that trans actors should only play trans characters? How alienating that would be that people that can easily fit a look of a character but should only play characters like themselves. It would be good if trans actors got roles but if there was a trans actor in Twin peaks they shouldnt be forced to play Denise just because they are both trans.

That's offensive and you are borderline transphobic.
Why can't a straight actor play a trans character?
I don't know how I feel about a woman being played by a man kek
Everyone, no matter who they are or where they live, puts their pants on one leg at a time. 

Denise is saying "it doesn't matter how I look, we're all still humans, still the same" 

Only she says panties because it's a little spicy and fun
üòÇ I reread the quote about 10 times to check for spelling and each time it made less sense. Duchovny's delivery sells it, tho. So good.
Audrey is *that* hot.
her conversation with Cooper at the dance (or whatever it was) was so great.
besides hawks lines unfortunately :(
Is he ? When did he come up with that ?
Keep in mind that Leo was never out as a bisexual man though. He had gay/bi fantasies that he acted out in his sex parties. If someone had actually accused him of being queer to his face he probably would‚Äôve beat the shit of them. 

In this way I think Leo is an extremely realistic character, even in today‚Äôs day and age. How many hateful, awful, anti LGBT politicians end up having gay sex scandals and secret boyfriends. And then they go on TV and talk about how homosexuality is the reason God is causing hurricanes and crazy shit like that lol. Repressed homosexuality is way more common than people think.
When I was a kid, I thought it was kind of cool that Dune had a villain who was incidentally gay. This was before I understood nuance in general, and how *maybe* conflating his homosexuality with his ephebophelia might be bad.
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd use the word ‚ÄúLovers‚Äù for a full grown 30 year old woman taking advantage of a high school girl, but yeah in Secret Diary it‚Äôs revealed that Laura and Josie had sex.
ü•¥
I was three years old in 92. I do understand what you're saying it is pretty cool. I think it's easy to forget how different it was back then. Hopefully we don't go back.
Honestly just thought I was expressing my ideal situation but seeing the reaction I'm getting I'll compromise and agree with you. Portraying us as real human beings is definitely something I want.
hmm people can still be trans without hormone therapy or surgery. And women can be masculine, so she's still trans. If she was an egg she wouldn't have realized she was a woman.
Probably not many but my intent was to share how I feel about a situation, not tell anyone what to do or try to change the past. I don't mind the downvotes, I understand representation is a nuanced discussion. What bugs me is people saying they "can't win", as if I was claiming some sort of authority on this matter. Like I'm going to call the woke police on Twin Peaks, my favorite show, or some shit.
Nobody's winning or losing I just said I don't personally prefer it. Maybe I should have said nothing.
Can very easily win. By casting trans women to play trans women.
A character that is a trans should be played by a trans actor or a cis person of that gender. So a trans woman, in my opinion, should be portrayed by a trans or cis woman. That's what I was getting at, the genders should match unless there's some sort artistic reason behind it. It would be weird for a cis man to play a cis woman, right? Or for a trans man to play a trans woman? So why can't we feel the same incongruence for a cis man playing a trans woman, or a cis woman playing a trans man?

I came from /r/all but I'm glad to see mods on so many subs cracking down on stuff like this.
I usually hate mods but danggg does this sub have great freaking based mods or what
Based mod
So based. Thank you for this!
Good morning good mods!
Speak for yourself. I sit down and double leg it, but otherwise your statement is accurate.
I thought she was referring to her cock, like uhh she has three legs to pull her panties over. Like her cock is so big she gotta take an extra step in tucking it in right when putting on her tiny panties.
On another hand, it‚Äôs unrealistic that every character in a small 90‚Äôs town in the US will be open and understanding of transgender people. I took Hawk‚Äôs line to show that he‚Äôs ignorant, not hateful or anything like that. I bet The Return Hawk would have learned and grown if he continued to work with Denise. 

I was born in 91 in a small town and I don‚Äôt think I saw a trans person until I was 20 years old.  I was ignorant when I was young and I easily could‚Äôve (and probably did) make stupid jokes like Hawk did.  Some of us grew up from that time and fixed our hearts.
isn't Hawk initially skeptical but grows to like her quickly?

I remember him having one or two grimace-worthy lines but nothing egregious, *especially* for the time. I expected it to be way worse than it was, or played for jokes.
The fanbase did in response to a shift between those who wanted Mulder and Scully together and those that didn't. The ones that did were called "shippers" in reference to the X-Files
And you are definitely entitled to your feelings and perspective as well. Just always like to pount out jsut how differently things were not that long ago. I just love Denise because she was one of the first to help usher in a more open world, here's hoping we keep moving forward not backwards. Fix your hearts or die!
>hmm people can still be trans without hormone therapy or surgery

Of course.

The reason I say that is the way Denise talks about herself in season 2 is that she prefers to go by Denise and find she liked wearing woman's clothes, but she didn't seem to speak in terms of a full realization of her identity yet. The impression I got was that it was a process in motion, one that was fairly new. Buuuut admittedly I can't exactly recall the specifics of the convo she has with Coop when she talks about the stakeout and how she discovered herself, so maybe I misread or misremember that.
Yeah, it‚Äôs these kinds of discussions that get varied opinions out there and bring about positive change
Please continue to express your thoughts on here without fear or hesitation. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you there are idiots everywhere who want to intimidate people into silence. You're amongst friends here ‚úä.
Does a gay person have to be played by someone who's gay?  Nah.

At first I thought you meant that you put both of your legs in one pant leg hahahaha
It‚Äôs unlikely that Coop‚Äôs colleagues in the Philly field office would be open and understanding (although big city cops around them were probably a little better than we think, just because they‚Äôd at least run into trans sex workers). The best movie of that year had a problematic pseudo-trans antagonist that its creative team would later have to do damage control on. Trans people just weren‚Äôt generally taken seriously for a couple more decades in mass media. This was a generation ahead of its time.
I'm glad you fixed your heart. Many trans people, including myself, experienced the same intolerance. If you're like me and grew up in a small community and don't know you're trans until you're 25, then they're 'the other' to you just as much as everyone else. It's a hell of a thing to get over not just that the people you're othering are people, but that you're one of the people you've othered.

Also, if I may offer a correction, 'transgenderism' is a term that's uniquely used in anti-trans rhetoric rather than by trans people. It's a term used in lieu of 'trans people' to make it sound like more akin to a cult movement. 'Poor confused people taken in by transgenderism' type fear mongering.
Something like fifteen years later, CSI had an episode about sex workers, and a main character referred to as corner as ‚Äútranny town.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt something like ‚ÄúThe Wire‚Äù with honest portrayals of flawed people. It‚Äôs a CBS procedural where the cops are unambiguously portrayed as the good guys. What Hawk said possibly wouldn‚Äôt be considered too problematic in 2005.
Even now that you made me realize that they are played by the same actor, my brain remains incapable of processing it.
I hadn't thought about how it actually was very open to interpretation. I kind of assumed it was a product of the evolving language and terminology but that she was transgender. My brother and I love Denise and thinks she's good representation for the time. When my brother did his transition in 2013, the term used was "transsexual" in Sweden. Which just merely a few years later was incredibly outdated. So I thought it was something like that. The language to describe things was different. 

But, I looked into it a little and it seems like, allegedly, a part of the script for season 2 episode 18 was cut where Denise says to Cooper "So one thing led to another and I'm currently into a specialized kind of program called Gender Relocation Inhibition Therapy, or G.R.I.T. Part of my treatment is to dress the part for six months prior to any further therapy; hormones, electrolysis - ..." .

Part of the original source is behind a payroll but interesting if it is true.
I love Denise and I love "fix your hearts or die" as much as everybody else, but if you look very closely you will notice that being gay and being trans are different. Like I get all the ways that it's complicated and I trust that we all mean we but at the end of the day I think it's kinda goofy to argue that it is better to have cis men plays trans women than it would be to have trans women play them
Are we really still concern trolling in 2024
Trans people have written about this extensively, it's up to you whether to listen to them. But fwiw in this case yes i do think it is explicit that Denise is trans and David Duchovny is not
Cate Blanchett did a fantastic job playing Bob Dylan that time.
This is how I feel as a trans person too. As long as the actors learn and respect the role they are playing I am totally happy for anyone to play the part. David did an amazing job here, and seeing Denise in The Return filled me with so much joy. To this very day Denise is at the very least tied for my favorite trans character in media.
[I pretend to be... the person I'm portraying.](https://youtu.be/nyoWmkhRyp8?si=wGr0JTqgqWUb3N6x)
There are examples of cis women playing trans characters, I'm not sure what you mean by "without insulting her". But to answer your question, back then having cis men playing a trans woman was a way signaling transness to the audience, a kind of visual shorthand. But that doesn't really represent the reality of a lot of trans people. Some of us may be "visibly trans" but some of us aren't, as hard as that is for some people to believe. This is why I was framing it in terms of my preference. Like filmmakers can do whatever they want, I have no power to stop them. But if they want to do representation well, in a way that represents the lived realities of the people being represented, maybe they should let them be a part of it.
hey now, I was just asking a question. if you're too sensitive to interact with me, maybe you should just ignore my comment.
Do you jump put both feet in at the exact same time? Do you lie on your back like a baby with both feet in the air?
The Panties are purely a comfort thing ü§™
I'd be lying if I said that's never happened before the coffee kicks in.

Thank you for the correction. You are 100% right.  ü´∂üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
I dont think they are saying it was intentionally problematic. Like you said it wouldn't have been problematic but thats the thing, it would have been realistic, its just of the time.
Did I ever say it would be better? Jeez. Just that acting is just that, acting.  I watched In the Heights at a community theater you can bet your biscuit that everyone wasn't the proper ethnicity, many being of latin american descent.  Dunno/doubt anyone there was actually dominican american. Still was a great show that the players clearly felt great connection to.

When I put on my Panties I give a little bunny üê∞ hop and try to get both feet through their respective leg holes at the same time ü§£
Yeah, I do the _double dutch_, jump and both legs in at the same time.
I‚Äôm talking about Silence of the Lambs, and didn‚Äôt even know that The Crying Game was the same year. I got admonished online by none other than Lindsay Ellis for pointing out that Jame Gunn wasn‚Äôt trans; she was looking at how there character was framed, and I was agreeing with what Hannibal Lecter (who‚Äôs nigh-infallible) said about him. I think we were both right.
Like I said, Denise's "masculineness" is meant to be a signifier of her transness. And maybe we should move on from that. Again, just my opinion not a dictate from the grand council of representation policing. And I think you may be under a misapprehension about how actors seek out or feel about roles. If David Duchovny didn't have too much pride to play a trans woman, I doubt many cis women would. Like another commenter (rather disingenuously) put it, it's just acting.
belligerence is in the eye of the beholder, my verbose redditor. may you find what you deserve.
Thats pulling up though, it's the putting on part that's being mentioned

Ah.
>by offering him this specific role, he simply gets to highlight his acting chops. his openness to take on the role is still indicative of his professionalism and probably a lack of bigotry

Yeah I'm not sure what's stopping a cis actress from having the exact same considerations. Forgive me if I'm oversimplifying, but it sounds like you're saying that a cis woman would feel insulted at being cast as Denise because she would read that as the show runners calling her ugly. And I think even a more complex version of that carries some assumptions about trans women, women in general, and actors. It sounds like you're willing to listen to other viewpoints, I hope you're open to examining potential biases you might have. If you don't find any biases that's fine, it's just good to take the inventory from time to time.
Last year I proposed at the falls, this weekend we‚Äôre getting married :)
I‚Äôm happy to share with my fellow Twin Peaks fans this picture of me proposing to my fianc√© at Snoqualmie Falls last year. After a year of planning and seemingly endless amounts of vendor bookings, we‚Äôre getting married this Saturday :)
Twin Peaks was the first tv show my fianc√© and I fell in love watching together. It‚Äôs remained our favorite show through the 10 years we‚Äôve been together. We experienced watching The Return during its original airing, attended the Real Twin Peaks Festival, met David Lynch together, met a handful of the cast as well and continue to reference and quote it to this day. 
‚ÄúWith this ring, I thee wed‚Äù
If I were to re-do the proposal, i wouldn‚Äôt have done it in front of that damn fishing sign ü§£ü§£

Now that's the right kind of comment!
I always felt strange about things like this. It's a magical moment in their lives and the thought of altering the scene feels so... i dunno, disingenuous to me. Either way, this is wonderful and i'm so happy for the couple <3 <3
Mom finally explains why she wants me to have kids so bad..
I (34f) traveled to my hometown with my partner (36m) to see my family for the first time in 3 years. I was questioned several times about having kids. Even after making my position VERY clear (absolutely fucking not. No. Never.) I endured a week of pressure and responded with kindness even when they ignored my requests to stop asking. 
Toward the end of the trip, I challenged my moms thinking. ‚ÄúWhy is it important to you that I have kids‚Äù 
She didn‚Äôt even bullshit with the ‚Äúchildren are a blessing‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want to be a grandma‚Äù bs. She straight up said, ‚ÄúI want my genes to be passed on.‚Äù 

I do not understand this thinking. Frankly it strikes me as egotistical, narcissistic, selfish, and out of touch. I‚Äôm supposed to sacrifice myself so my fat moron mother can feel satisfied her ‚Äúvery special‚Äù genetics get passed on‚Ä¶ btw all of her children have personality disorders and are straight up losers (myself included). 

I‚Äôm poverty level and on food stamps. I have BPD. I have no friends. I have been horrifically depressed my entire life. My mom knows this. Doesn‚Äôt care. Still thinks I should have kids. 

It‚Äôs not about the kids. 
People think reproducing means they live forever and it doesn‚Äôt matter if the earth is dying and nobody can afford to fucking eat.
People mostly suck
Remind her that it‚Äôs her genes that she passed onto you that made you not want to reproduce.
Tell her she is welcome to have another child herself if she feels so strongly, and she might understand what she is asking you.
The whole gene thing living on is the idea of being immortalized, living forever through time despite being dead, that you are still relevant, which makes no fucking sense. Its just a glitch of mind that assumes that you somehow live on. 

Explain to her that you are not her, she is not you. You're body, your mind, is not her, its you. You dont experience what she experiences nor do you experience what she does. It will be the same if you had a child. When your mam dies it wont mean anything to your child in terms of legacy, genes etc. Tell your mam she'll be too dead to care if her genes are passed on.

Secondly, your child may not wanna be here, may have their own views about being here and will likely not give a damn if your mother in some stupid way lives on through them. Your child will have to live their own life, have many struggles, so fuck biology, fuck little particles that replicate and regenerate, that ensure theres red hair or a nose a certain shape, no one cares.
Having a kid to pass on your genes is useless, i mean, they are just cell code, they are nothing special, what's so special about passing on genes if we are going to suffer anyway? I guess people want to pass their genes into their future kid because this gives them a feeling of immortality, but the truth is they are not the genes, they suffer and once they die, they die, and the kid suffers and dies
I'm so lucky that no one in my family pressured me for kids. 

My family is a cesspool of every mental disease that exists, will be discovered or invented. 

I won the genetic lottery and got depressed only during the pandemic, when I also developed epilepsy. Still, I feel superlucky because, believe me, there's so much worse in my family. 

People truly should ask themselves: are my genes any good? Because it's about raising a child that will suffer and  might need support their whole lives. Why subject someone to that?
It's always the ones who shouldn't have kids that have the most kids. I'm sorry you have to deal with your mother, she sounds like a real narcissistic cunt. I would highly suggest you burn bridges if you can
i never understood the passing on the genetics thing. It literally won't matter when someone is in the cold, hard ground or getting heaved into the oven. What if their descendants don't pass on the genetics as well? correct me if I'm wrong, but Mozart's genetic line died out. I don't get these people.
So, I‚Äôve gotta tell on myself here (feel free to light me up - I promise you can‚Äôt be meaner than I have been to myself). This was my first holiday season without anyone from my family of origin (as it is, I only have my sperm donor and my egg donor‚Äôs brother left, both of whom I willingly cut out of my life). My kids (18 and 19) are the last of our bloodline and heritage and neither wants to have kids. Though I never shared my thoughts with them, I have struggled with this ùí∂ ùìÅ‚Ñ¥ùìâ. It wasn‚Äôt until I brought it up with my therapist that I realized just how much of an impact generational and cultural trauma have impacted my life.
It's really very simple: for a woman in the throes of limbic delusion, reproduction is genetic capitalism.  From her point of view, she 'sacrificed' time, resources, and her health in some ways, to have you.  Her self-esteem is tied up in your success.  Not material success but in your *evolutionary* success.  Her evolutionary worthiness as a woman with reproductive potential was satisfied through successfully reproducing; her worthiness as a mother is tied up in *your* reproductive potential.  If you fail to reproduce, all those expended efforts and resources were pointless.  She bought the genetic blue chips, now she wants her return on investment.  Tell her, as pointedly or subtly as you care to, to fucking shove it.
Sorry Mom, no matter what, you‚Äôre still going to die.
This is one of the main reasons I will not have children. My genes are fucked up
That idea is so stupid. The closest genetic relatives one will ever have is not their children and not even grandchildren but their siblings from the same mom and dad. Any next generation will be diluded and mixed up with other genetics, so at best if would be a watered down resemblance of her. The idea of preserving oneself through children is pure delusion.
To me it‚Äôs like an oozing goo‚Ä¶ people don‚Äôt necessarily *believe* they want their genes passed on, it‚Äôs just the natural dripping of genetics that may or may not stain the table. I personally want to set the table on fire, so naturally I‚Äôm invited to parties with a grain of salt.
She can feel however she feels, but her behavior isn‚Äôt ok. 

‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôve told you multiple times I‚Äôm not ever having children and that decision is final. If you mention it again, I will leave.‚Äù 

Then do it. If she talks about kids again, walk out. If you‚Äôre on the phone, hang up.
it‚Äôs eugenics. white boomers were told to breed (bc we have to preserve white dominance!) and they never questioned why or if that‚Äôs what they actually want. boomers think they‚Äôre the top dog alpha males and the best genes go on to survive right?! it egotistical at very least, thinking you‚Äôre special enough to deserve your genes to continue to be passed down. one day everyone who could have ever known you or continue your memory will die and be gone there will be no more evidence of your existence no matter how much you breed we all return to dust
Tell her there‚Äôs no legacy to be passed on.
I don‚Äôt get this line of thinking. It‚Äôs so fucking twisted and weird and just‚Ä¶ nonsense. 

Like, at least my mother wanted grandchildren because she wanted more people to love. It‚Äôs still not rational but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot nicer than ‚Äúmy genetic material!!!‚Äù.
Should have told her it doesn't matter, we all evolved from the same common ancestor. Humans will thrive, and so her genes will too, so similar enough. 

Even if you did pass on your genes to the next generation, it'll get diluted from being intermixed with other's genes. Eventually, it'll get so diluted, it'll be as if you never had kids.
My own schizophrenic substance and gambling addicted mother said :,it's so you'll know and understand what I went through.' 

This is why I support my kids when they've said no kids.

My son has just turned 24, come back from Europe, to a clean, uncluttered house and was able to rest off his jetlag before going back to work, he works in immigration law and policy.

My daughter has multiple disabilities.

Yep you fat sow I now understand why you dumped your kid's so you could sit in the r.s.ellie and put all our benefits money in the pokies.

Cos if god wanted her to be a good mother he'd give her a lotto win.

My grandmother took over the raising because her kids left and we were her insurance policy against loneliest when she was old.

The old bat and fat sow took too long to die, but with luck we're buried face down so they could see where they're going
Choosing to not have a child when you have BPD is incredibly UNSELFISH. Good for you. BPD is an extremely serious disorder that would impact a child profoundly. Anyone who disagrees has their own agenda independent of your, or your potential child‚Äôs, needs.
My boyfriends mum is exactly like this. I told her if she wanted grandkids so bad then I would rip out my uterus and serve it on a platter. I also have BPD and I can be a massive risk to myself at times. So even though I‚Äôm never having kids, it wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea for me in general.
Never have kids for someone else. 
That's is literally just feeding the machine
# Genes passed on to what?

What is the end goal here, and why do people insist we continue to suffer for it?
I'm seeing that the more intelligent the human, the less likely they are to want children.  The average intelligent just procreate out of some basic biology.  But the thinkers, the people who really consider what it means to bring a child into the world, they're the ones not doing it.  You're smart not to want to pass your struggles onto someone else.
>‚ÄúI want my genes to be passed on.‚Äù 


does she want you to give a birth to her clone lmao? because you can only pass about 25% of her genes (not counting mitochondria[that are, well, the only thing that a hypothetical grandchild would directly inherent from her unless you have a mutation in your mitochondrial dna], Y chromosome and different unpredictable genetic mutations that might occur). All that "you have to pass muh precious genes" is dumb: what genes are being passed to a hypothetical child are randomized as well as how they might manifest.
By the fifth generation you share approximately 2% of that ancestors genes.

There are still families that are alive in this time frame depending on the age at which they have children. At that point you share as much DNA with a relative as you do with almost anyone else in your region. Also: genes are not passed down equally, there is an element of random selection that means your family tree is not neatly laid out like a maths equation. 

We're all just human genetic stew, people. There's no magic 'gene' that survives through antiquity making anyone particularly special.

Breeding does not equal immortality. 

As long as some ancestors from your mother's line are still around, there's her genes.
Isn't she happy to know that every human on Earth has more than 99% the same genes as her? No? Weird that she wants another human to have slightly more of their genes in common with her than any other human.
Hey there, I‚Äôm not actually a part of this sub, Reddit just recommended this post.

Completely unrelated to your post,  it sounds like you‚Äôre having a hard time and  I hope things look up for you soon.
I have ms I had to kids by 25 had no idea I had ms until 30 yrs old if I had known I would not of had children  just because  I didn‚Äôt want to pass the gene ,,,  so far they don‚Äôt have ms 43 and 39  thank god :: but I still worry every day I wouldn‚Äôt wish ms on my worst enemy
I would honestly reply with "the bloodline ends with me". What a gross person, yuck
\*\*mom is coming to terms with her own mortality and is wanting to 'live on', because is may give a sense of her not dying. 

You can acknowledge that very human experience while also not changing who you are or your awareness or your life circumstances. 

Tell her you love her; give her a hug, and work on a Legacy Project, such as a cookbook or something similar that can be shared with the community; or plants she has grown that can be shared. :) Our legacy lives on in many ways; and truly, she may be trying to come to terms with facing her mortality. It can be heavy.
 Did she say why she wanted that?
Her greens were passed on, and now their yours, to do with as you please
I expected that in 34 years of life you would know what the person you've lived more than half your life is like as a person and nothing they do would really surprise you or provoke a rant like this, but I guess I stand corrected. ü§∑üèª
The weird thing is that your genes are very soon hugely diluted by all the strangers that come after you. 

It‚Äôs so stupid the way that people think reproduction means passing themselves on intact for the rest of time! Idiots.
I have been very clear about not wanting children, 36f and my husband got a vasectomy. Last weekend I was in the hospital for stomach pain and the first thing they do is make sure you aren‚Äôt pregnant which makes sense. I let my mom know they‚Äôve run all of the tests, did an ultrasound and they can‚Äôt figure it out. She pops back with ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre pregnant! I know you don‚Äôt want kids and I respect that, but I would be so excited!‚Äù üôÑ
My BPD and MS are major reasons I would never have kids‚Ä¶ who deserves these shitty genes?
People keep confusing legacy with one's lineage.  They aren't the same.
My father said the same thing and got offended and pissed when I said kids weren‚Äôt possible bc my plumbing didn‚Äôt work right - like it was somehow MY fault.  This was after he got pissed when I said I intended to change my last name to my husbands, legit tried to manipulate me into keeping HIS name bc he wanted HIS hypothetical grandkids to have HIS name. Then I told him we weren‚Äôt having kids bc my plumbing didn‚Äôt work. 

Yeah it was all about his genes and his last name.
I mean, there's two things at play here.

One is the brainless need to see your family line continue in some way that brings meaning to your life.

The second is the psychotic North American mindset that we have children and then subject them to work slavery and poverty while also expecting them to fulfill the destiny of point one.
There's absolutely *nothing* special about anybody's genes.
My mother finally started making grandchildren comments paired with heavy side eye. Like, is my furry cat not a grandchild enough for you??? 

In all fairness she's likely gonna have to settle for adopted children if that even happens at all
You have a friend in me. I like your sense of humor
Remind her that ‚Äúpassed on‚Äù also means dead. You not having kids means her ‚Äúgenes‚Äù are dead. ü§£

Anyway, thats the most bs thing. Genes arent that important & she must be related to someone else somewhere. Brother/sister or whatever. Her genes are safe enough & not THAT important.
She is trying to fill that void inside her. Disgusting
I hate people who act like this is the 1600's.  Your genes are worthless, you have no "family line" to speak up.  That's it.  Boom.
I am happy to disappoint my mom and be a genetic dead end üëå
you should see the looks on my family's face when i told them how i cannot get pregnant. They see it as broken, i see it as a feature.
My mother has the same thinking! She put in this world 6 kids, from 3 different partners. I remember we used to struggle to get food to all kids. Man, poverty sucks
It\`s always about muh blooooooooodline.
I understand the desire, they had kids to do that and they want you to continue that. Life is kind of all about getting your generation to move forward. 

But you can‚Äôt pressure your kids into having kids. They decide what‚Äôs best for themselves. Your part is done and part of life is not being able to control what comes next. 

To me it‚Äôs not horrible to want grandchildren, but it is horrible to try to force your kid who clearly doesn‚Äôt want kids to have them. Honestly if you want your genes to move on you should have had more kids, but I know having more kids makes it more difficult but if they really wanted that they should have just had more to increase the chance of getting grandchildren. It very hypocritical to not put in the extra time, money, and effort into achieving this goal and expecting your one child you had to do it instead of you taking it on.
Tell her that'd only be valid if she had good genes to start with
I hate when people push their opinions on someone.
Ask what's important about her genes. She won't be able to give a coherent answer.
Nobody‚Äôs genes are important enough to ‚Äúcarry on‚Äù. It‚Äôs nothing more than massive ego to believe that this matters.

Personally, I think it‚Äôs just one more way that some humans try to cope with the inevitability of dying. Because they can‚Äôt deal with that eventuality.
No one's genes are special or superior. We are all just meat suits that unfortunately developed consciousness. Also, the cure for cancer or world peace wasn't aborted. No one is special, nothing matters lol.
My mom said something snarky about people with disabilities reproducing so I said ‚Äúyup that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt!‚Äù Just wait for her to say something shitty and then ‚Äúagree‚Äù with her. That generally works for me. üòá
People think they live in game of thrones. Absolutely no one cares about your genes and in 3 or 4 generations everyone will be forgotten. Did she even know anything about the father of her grandparent? Ask her that.
The more I think about it, is because our parents grew up and raised in a society making them believe that marriage and having kid(s) are the purpose of life. But, if you ask your mom would she go back and live in a society that forbids women to vote, go to school, and be treated as a property to their father/husband. She probably without a hesitation would say no. So, I think it is understandable for her to say that. But, for your own sake please do NOT give in, if you are not the one that wants a kid, you shouldn't sacrifice yourself for the wishes of others.
Correct. When people say life is a ponzi scheme, this is exactly what it means: bring in more clueless, helpless creatures to reap benefit off of with no regard for them in the process.

You have to be a monster, a moron, or insane to go ahead with it. Most people are a combination of the former two.
You're not a loser. Now if you imposed life onto children, that's a loser.
Never call yourself a loser. You are the only one who is actually smart.
is she going to pay for her muh genes when the kids are here?????
Cut her off if she won't stop because fuck all of that
It‚Äôs because she is facing her mortality. She will die soon and having kids etc is a way for her to continue living in this world. It‚Äôs human nature and has been a common experience for thousands of years.
I‚Äôm one of those people who wants to pass on her genes. But that‚Äôs only because I want to and I will go through it. 
I‚Äôm not forcing anyone else to go through that pain and discomfort, my kids whenever I have them can chose to do whatever they want. 
Your mom does sound narcissistic, she can‚Äôt be controlling your life to this point. 
And I see you‚Äôve thought about it from every angle, so do what you feel is right and what you think you can handle. 
Genes get passed on and then what? Is she coming to help?
I doubt your mom has anything special (genetics wise) worth passing down lol.
You sound terrific. /s Maybe try spending time around people that aren't neurotic like yourself and you'd actually enjoy people's company.
Wow...uhhh...that's literally what humans are basically programmed to do? Make sure our genes continue on and the species continues? Like, socially, yea yikes ouch narcissistic, blah blah blah, but evolutionary, and on the other not so "how dare you bresth the same as me, rapist, blah blah blah" side, it's kind of normal to want to continue to see generations of family. Damn did all of yall drop out before they taught that?
Donate an egg
Tell her to pop out a few more herself then.
She could also freeze her skull.
What's so great about her genes and how does it impact her if they keep going? I don't get that
If she wanted to pass on her genes then she should‚Äôve had more kids to bank on the fact to produce more kids. Far as I can tell this sounds like a her problem that she‚Äôll need to live with.
She already did pass them on and I‚Äôm willing to bet she didn‚Äôt ask you if you want yours to be passed on cause that‚Äôs what grandchildren would be and I wish more people like your ma saw it that way
check out raised by narcissists
>‚ÄúI want my genes to be passed on.‚Äù

I suspect there is more to it. You not having kids forces her to face the facts that make you not have them. Like the hereditary health condition that impacts your life.
NTA. Yes Mom I'm really going to have kids just so I can pass your crazy genes to another generation, because I would do anything for you, lol. 

What did she really expect you to say to that?
Lol if she wanted her genes passed down to the next generation she should have produced more children since the probability increases with the number of kids.
It's probably for the best her genes die off. Natural selection exists for a reason. Not all genes should be passed down.
Thankfully OP you‚Äôre closer to aging out of having kids than not ‚Ä¶. Consider sterilization?
The only people who should have kids are those who truly desire them and can provide for them. Although, there is still a chance the person born might not even want to be here.
How would you describe your life with bpd?
Hate em all.
Damn I wish I would have thought of that
Better yet, remind her that the genes a bio kid inherits are random and they still might not be anything like her lol.
It‚Äôll go right over her head. She‚Äôll reply with something something menopause. Something something I did my time raising you and your siblings. Something something it‚Äôs your turn now.
A good way to remember this is to try and have anyone try and recall an ancestor even a handful of generations up the chain. Those people are ultimately meaningless to you, despite carrying their stupid genes. The genes survive as memory of them as individuals fades away. The genes don't give a fuck about that
Holy shit that's a good comment
Even if life was utopia and nobody ever had problems, you're still right.
This is a very, very insightful comment. People with special needs are very hard to care for  once they grow older.
I keep my distance. She‚Äôs nice. She‚Äôs just dumb but thinks she‚Äôs very smart.
Can you help me understand why you struggle with it? (Not a challenge. Just trying to expand my capacity to understand)
This clarified a lot for me about this perspective. Thank you!
Wow ‚Ä¶ I am floored. You‚Äôre absolutely right.
Her societal worth is also tied to that extremely, ESPECIALLY as a woman, though men have that problem too to some extent. I have seen women who think they only truly will experience womanhood, when they have a child, and I know at least one woman, who said that women without children are inherently inferior to herself, if they have not birthed children. A similar thing goes for being a grandmother. The women want status and do not care about the child at all. And it is only partly biological as in a pack animal like humans not every individual is supposed to reproduce, some individuals are there to either adopt in case parents die, be aunties and uncles or do other things to ensure survival of the pack. Plus, we are humans and thus more than our instincts. Like say I was not childfree and not AN, and my child did not want children I would respect them, because they are people with their own values. I would be sad, if my child suffered poverty and bpd, but I would not blame my child for ressources as it would have been my choice to take the risk. ( Am non- binary afab )
In addition to that, from my observation people treat their children and grandchildren  as objects and projects not as people.
I have seen eldery people having the following conversation:
Eldery man1: "My daughter takes me to her holiday flat every weekend."
Eldery Man2: " That is nice and good, but my daughter visits every weekend and cooks for me for the entire week." 
Eldery Man3: "And MY daughter lives with me. She cooks for me and cleans the house. And my granddaughter works in an advert agency and earns a lot of money, she has a great car." 
Having children and grandchildren was something akin to having a fancy car or a tool and grandchildren were a fancy gimmick.  
And there even has been a study, where they said that middle class parents treat their children as projects, which leads them to bragging with their children's achievements and compare their child to other children. I was born in 1988 in Russia and I experienced this: "Look at Dima, he is like a little adult already and you are so childish." "Look at the children in the children's singing show, look what they can do in your age, you are already 4, 4, do you realize that? And you are running around echollalling, look at those children, they sing and dance."
It's spelled *diluted* but yeah she's deluded too

The legacy of poverty
Also‚Ä¶ she already DID pass on her genes.

To you.

The amount of genes a child inherits from their grandparents are pretty minimal in the grand scheme of genetics. (Get ya squares out science nerds :p )
I mean, I would have shortened that advice tidbit just to the first three words
I have wondered if she urges me to reproduce because I turned out to not be the clone she always wanted.
Thanks man, that‚Äôs nice of you
This is a compassionate and level headed answer! Yea to more of this
She just shrugged and said she felt like she wanted her genes to live on. There‚Äôs not much critical thinking going on with this woman.
I moved across the country very young after my dad died. I rarely visited home and my siblings all stayed in the same town with my mom and‚Ä¶ after 11 years I‚Äôm finding that I‚Äôve changed in ways they can‚Äôt cope with or (want to) understand. They‚Äôre very stuck in the past.
Why are boomers so unhinged?! Sorry for your stomach problems. Hope you‚Äôre ok
Who sold us this monarchy lineage style idea? bc it‚Äôs fucking dumb and I want a refund
Agree
Well, she‚Äôs waayyy into ancestry. So I think I‚Äôm a way, she does view it like that type of lineage.
I appreciate your kindness.
She was cute in her 20s. So that‚Äôs something?
You‚Äôre making a lottttt of assumptions about me from one post about a tough week. Back up, Jack. You‚Äôre the asshole in this situation.
You must be new here. Maybe do a basic spell check before calling everyone stupid? Also it couldn‚Äôt hurt to fuck around and read the philosophy the sub is dedicated to. Also what was that about rapists? Are you projecting or?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
I think I‚Äôm too old and they don‚Äôt take people with personality disorders.
Yet, here we are with assisted Darwinism, 
life support for those who cannot live naturally on their own. Natural selection doesn‚Äôt really exist in modern capitalism. If there‚Äôs a way to keep someone alive, even if they‚Äôre brain dead, by god. we‚Äôre going to do it.
It‚Äôs just very ‚Ä¶ very unfair. Every day is confusion, suffering, and loneliness. I didn‚Äôt do anything to deserve this and I wish so badly I could have one year with a normal functioning brain.
That's, like, the opposite of Pokemon.
Me too
The fact that you're misanthropic probably means you're a terrible person to be around who's extremely anti-social. Best for us all that you stay away from all us.
[removed]
Ask her what makes her think your kids would turn out different than you. If she doesn‚Äôt think they would, knowing your experiences, then that‚Äôs crazy.
There will probably be a next time so have it ready!!
I also like to remind people, that the absolute most SELFISH act a person can do is have a child. Think about it.
>Damn I wish I would have thought of that

I suspect she has it on the back of her mind. That's why she pushes so hard to have them passed, so she can ignore the issue with "see it wasn't that bad"
I'm sorry, I have to laugh. "I had kids, so you have to." Is the most hilarious argument to push people into becoming parents. 

Do you have siblings? I'm curious what their stance is on having kids or if they have any.
>it‚Äôs your turn now

Not unless you somehow agreed to being born subject to such conditions, it isn't.
"I did my time", sounds like prison üòÇüòÇ which, well, kinda true.
The vast majority of people don't even meet their grandparents' parents. That is a forgotten lineage within 80 years of death.
Here's a rough primer on how antinatalism relates to evolutionary psychology:

[Part I](https://reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/157h8le/thanks_for_that_babe_x/jt4rdcv/)

[Part II](https://reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/157h8le/thanks_for_that_babe_x/jt70r2l/)
Nice people don't demand you sacrifice yourself in order to give her grandkids all because she wishes to pass down her awful genes. Nice people don't care if you have kids or not.
I‚Äôm completely open for conversation, I just need to brace you that I‚Äôm still trying to process my own bullshit, so I may not be as clear as I would like.

My grandparents emigrated here from Seville, Spain. I had a very large family growing up, and we‚Äôd all hear stories about ‚Äúthe old country‚Äù. There‚Äôs a very large part of me that wants to keep that heritage (?) / ancestry (?) in tact. My grandparents and older family members were the best people I‚Äôd ever met. My parents sucked ass. I suppose that some of my thinking also has to do with wanting to preserve the good parts of my family?
Eyo, thx for the grammar check!
Oh lol, thank you, you too!
But that is even weirder, if you are dissimilar to her, your kids will be even more so...
Absolutely agree!!
This is most grandparents üò≠ they don‚Äôt even want to babysit the kids they just want to pass on their genes lol
Haha, my mom seems to be an extra special case, we have limited contact so it just makes me laugh when she says stuff now. Thanks- it was just a glitch in the system, always good to make sure it‚Äôs nothing serious though, especially with age, lol.
Yea projecting, no, I'm talking about how everyone over reacts at every little social sleight against them and turns it into a giant issue, basically having to scream rapist, or abuser or whatever at someone else who disagrees with them, and hey, good for you, you don't want kids, that's your life, you do you, but if you don't understand that it's a basic human function to want your genes to continue to be carried on, then I dunno. That's all. I get not wanting kids, people do it for whatever reason they wish, and that's perfectly fine, its also fine to have a natural instinct of having your genes carried on.
How does the splitting of the self work with bpd?
Gotta throw em all
And your comment isn‚Äôt misanthropic at alllllll.   Right? Nope. We can all definitely ascertain that you are empathetic, reasonable, and altruistic. Yep. What a GOOD guy you are! Here‚Äôs a gold star for saying all the good guy stuff to someone who‚Äôs struggling! WAY TO GO!!
We like staying away from you so win-win
K.
Use dictionary bro. 

BTW you suck too
We have removed your content for breaking Rule 6 (no trolling).
My older brother is going through a rough divorce so I think he‚Äôs somewhat sentimental to the issue. He says if I don‚Äôt have kids, I‚Äôll be completely alone (which honestly is heaven for me. I love being alone). I think he‚Äôs worried I‚Äôll regret it. 

My sister is my moms favorite so I assume she thinks whatever my mom thinks
Amazing!!!
yeah ok, people can still be nice outside of their opinions
Ok, that‚Äôs reasonable. It‚Äôs coming from a sentimental place and I can vibe with that.
You can celebrate your heritage and ancestry with people that are not blood. But as someone who wants to adopt, I understand wanting to have little kiddos around to help guide through life.
I am childfree by choice and anti-natalist, but I do understand your sentiment. I love the *idea* of a big family and celebrating/passing down traditions, but not enough to outweigh the myriad of reasons why I don‚Äôt want children/want to bring people into this existence.
I thought that too.. I‚Äôve been considering the idea that maybe it‚Äôs more about physical appearance rather than who we are as people‚Ä¶. that‚Äôs all genetics really are, right? At least, that‚Äôs what breeders seem to focus on ‚ÄúI want a little me!‚Äù
Grandchildren are trophies for boomers. Nothing more.
For the most part I agree, however, I think something that‚Äôs going over your head is the tone of eugenics in this dialogue. 

Sex is a basic human function/need- breeding is optional and should not be forced or coerced on someone who is unfit and does not want it. Moreover, the social aspect of my mothers expectation is the subject matter here; like most breeders, the drive to procreate is coming from a self serving place and not one of compassion. We can talk all day long about biological instincts but we are cognitive beings capable of critical thinking.
Hm. Not sure what you mean by that. ‚ÄúSplitting‚Äù is a term we use to address our black and white thinking patterns. We often see people as all good or all bad (which can transition back and forth at any given time) our emotions are very very intense.. so it‚Äôs often really difficult to be reasonable in tense situations because our brains are hijacked by this ‚Äúlive or die‚Äù extreme. It just makes it really hard to see things clearly
Well, I'm married and we don't have kids, so for me, that's a silly argument anyway. Plenty of people don't want to be parents.

But, your mom sounds like she has two perfectly good kids who want to have kids. That's at least 2 babies with her precious DNA.
>if I don‚Äôt have kids, I‚Äôll be completely alone

Don't threaten me with a good time
If you have two siblings then why is your mum pressuring you to pass on the genes?  My mum was a bit offended when I said I wasn't having kids and I just said "oh well sibling wants them you'll be fine" and just moved on. Not being mean to you of course here, just like your mum's logic is bizarre because you're not an only child!
Finally, around 40, it was such a blessing when people quit asking me when I was going to have children. It's really terribly rude.
The only women I know that regret not having children are ones that kept pushing it off, not ones that decided they absolutely do not want to have kids lol.
Does your Mom have actual npd?
Sometimes, but only when those opinions are truly inoffensive like enjoying Pineapple Pizza or the Patriots are the best American football team. When it comes to opinions like Hitler did nothing wrong, 911 was an inside job, Trump was the best president we've ever had, that's when it doesn't matter how nice someone is, they're fundamentally a terrible human being

Even Nazi can be nice and even kind, but under that facade of civility, they are still fucking Nazis and deserve what's coming to them
Which is exactly how my kids feel. And I don‚Äôt blame them a bit. The world isn‚Äôt getting any better.
This and objects to brag with.
Oh it's the tone of eugenics, got it, selective breeding for desirable traits, nazis, all that fun stuff  it must of flew right over because I didn't think anything at all about the third Reich while reading this, I just thought there was someone who couldn't understand the basic instincts of  humanity to wish for a continuation of someone's genes. So, you do,  you have an understanding of it, so you must have the understanding of someone who may be emotional/selfish/ hell, even deluded that their genes won't continue.  It's because it's not rational thought,  it's a drive for a continuation, especially if you're the last of the bloodline, or best option  then it's definitely something that's hard to grasp, but that's on her to grieve. The drive to do anything in life is self- serving, though.  It's self- soothing to you to say "I'm protecting a child by never having one!" Isn't it? It only serves to help you out,  not the child that doesn't exist. Either way,  there really isn't any debate here , good for you for not wanting kids, if it bothers you that much maybe go NC, and I hope things go better for you.  Ciao.
Would you say that you like to live a life full of adventure?
I think it might be because out of her three kids, I‚Äôm probably the most capable and ‚Äúready‚Äù. My brother just went through a divorce and is kind of spiraling. My sister is an  eternal child and just moved out for the first time at 30. So it kind of feels like I‚Äôm her best shot.
Not that I know of. To be clear, I only said her reasoning behind me having kids came off as narcissistic to me.. while she does have some narc traits and behaviors (don‚Äôt we all?) I think her backwards self serving thinking comes from her conservative partisan background. I was talking with a therapist about this and she pointed out that genetic capitalism usually goes hand in hand with conservative ideology.
[deleted]
TLDR
I‚Äôd like to! But I‚Äôm often too exhausted. Do you?
Thanks for the info. Conservatives also often do not understand poverty, mental illness and choice soo...
It only makes sense in archaic cultures, for nobility or extremely successful people, ( makes sense does not mean I agree with it ) if she demands kids from someone with bpd (!) who is on food stamps (!) with no support network to raise the child (!) to have children to pass her special genes ( which apparently contribute to create personality disorders ) it is wild. 
(Not that people with bpd are less than others, but her potential grandchild is more likely to be doomed to a bad life due to poverty and lack of said support  network )
When you‚Äôre right you‚Äôre right!
Unrealized Antinatalism in the wild.
12k unrealized antinatalists. But I bet if you told them what the philosophy of Antinatalism is, many of these folks liking this post would reject it, for some reason. And a large part of me thinks that most people reject Antinatalism because the thought of never existing terrifies them, almost as much as death. Which is sort of ironic considering after you die, it‚Äôs almost like you never existed in the first place, since your consciousness and memories are erased. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
At this point the only thing they don‚Äôt like about antinatalism is the title.
[deleted]
This is going to sound shitty‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

But a lot of the natalists have lives that I would absolutly hate to live as well. 

They have fucked up genes. Are balding and have no will power to diet. Have little emotional control over themselves and constantly fight with their spouses. 

I also read that the majority of parents are unfit  parents. A lot of them abuse their kids and treat them as pets. Then some people turn a leaf and start to treat them as humans along the way. They argue that ‚Äúwell it was better that they were born and went through hell than to never have existed‚Äù. 


Fucking stupidity. 
I think the majority of parents think this way.
Even if you only showed the trailer I guarantee fetuses would mass-miscarry themselves worldwide.
natalists are just in denial, that‚Äôs why they are always on this sub because everything actually makes sense over here
This is how I feel.
Yeah, I wouldn't exist. I'm not depressed, I just feel apathy at this point. Everyday is survival mode, I don't get enough sleep, I'm just running on adrenaline, and I always have to be the bigger person in everything, thanks to shitty decisions I made from 2021-2023. Yeah no.....I wouldn't commit suicide because I don't wanna die, I just wish I've never been born at all.
[removed]
Maybe we are, but dont remember?
Considering most of my life has been trauma, pain and depression I would definitely decline the offer to be born. I‚Äôm only 24 and already have CPTSD, persistence depressive disorder, multiple anxiety disorders and either BP or BPD (diagnosed with BP but symptoms match BPD more. Trying to get that sorted out) and most of that is from trauma! I was born with a little of it though
I think we do
The human hubris. Irony in its finest form.
I mean, I think thus far I would still choose to live. But mostly because I‚Äôve never had children, and neither have any of my siblings, so we‚Äôve all gotten to do whatever we wanted for basically our entire adult lives. And holidays are actually way more fun with just adults, in my opinion. Assuming you like those adults.

And we‚Äôve all had some awesome dogs, too. So much of my trailer would have cool dogs in them, and I would definitely choose getting to meet them and have to experience grieving their loss again in exchange. Because I have really loved all those dogs.
I would definitely choose to live. I‚Äôve gone through shit, addiction, assault, betrayal. But it‚Äôs whatever, life is pretty dang good right now. Good cooking, good kitties, fulfilling job, healthy relationships. 

However, if I didn‚Äôt live in the USA (where I‚Äôm from) or Europe, then I‚Äôd probably choose to not live.
This is what‚Äôs called a meme

Yeah because clearly all 8 billion people secretly hate their lives obviously. No it's not just you why would you ever think that.
I propose that all the people in this sub who wish they'd never been born voluntarily remove themselves from certain facets of society.  No longer allowed to vote. Not allowed to drive public roadways, Etc.  it's unfair that the actions of people who wish they weren't born should affect the lives of people happy to be alive.

Okay, so what are you going to do about it? Three choices. One is to stop existing. Two is to keep being miserable. Three is to make changes in your life, take accountability and change/improve your life. Up to you.
My parents hardly taught me anything, I learned my morals, sympathy, and other things all by myself. School didn't help at all beyond 5th grade.
"Oh no I'm balding guess I should end humanity" what the fuck is your problem
How would they know what they were seeing?

What values and knowledge are they using to make the decision? Do they have opinions?

Thats just stupid theory. We know life is formed from an egg and a sperm. we also know that if you get shot in your head your brain will die, and then you will die. We know consciousness orgin is the brain. Thats basic science, basic knowledge. Stop with the crazy theories and just dont have children and then you'll see that even if there are "souls" wishing to be alive and saying "yes" to existence. No one is creating them here so they cant enter and their answer aint worth shit...
How would your theory even work in reality? A "soul" is asked by some godly being if it wants to exists and then if he says yes, then Cupid is shoting arrows on potenital lovers and creating love story between them and make them have sex??? Bro...

That's my hypothesis as well. The ultimate RPG.¬†
trailers usually take the best parts of the movie and leave out anything the editor doesnt want you to see. this includes major tragedies and how/when the journey ends.
I mean.. imagine choosing to be born into an abusive household. If people could choose their lives there wouldn't be any hardship whatsoever.
You can‚Äôt ‚Äôchoose to be born‚Äô
from the strangely personal insults sounds like you need to embrace positive feelings more often
The only people on earth who only experienced a single bad day in their life are the infants who didn't even survive past said bad day.
I want to end it, but i want it to be quick and painless, do you know some methods?
Do you realize how unintelligent you sound?

‚ÄúiF yOu DoNt LiKe SoMeThInG, LeAvE!‚Äù

Humans wouldn‚Äôt be here if we followed that logic. There‚Äôs been SO many things in history changed because someone didn‚Äôt like it. They certainly didn‚Äôt get told they should off themselves because of it. (Well maybe some, by forgotten people who did nothing)

Here you have 200,000 people in a subreddit that know the world can be so horrible so they aren‚Äôt going to gamble on someone else‚Äôs life or there‚Äôs a few adopters in this group. For you, one troll, to tell all these people that they should leave if they don‚Äôt like things makes you seem like a petulant uneducated toddler. 

Many ANs are happy with their lives!! They just know that regardless of liking life, someone did take a gamble on theirs and it could‚Äôve went well or horrible. I‚Äôll speak for myself when I say I won‚Äôt be a hypocrite and do that to someone else when I don‚Äôt like that someone did that to me. 

So, you know, you can cry about our decisions all you want but at the end of the day no one here cares about your shite opinions! 

Hope you have fun shouting to the void in here! üòÅ
Im still here because im already born. Suicide wont "reverse" it. It'll cause grief to my family and close friends. And like, since im already here i might as well try and make the best life, and lift others who are suffering up in the process. If I cant find my own happiness, I'll try and help others find theirs.

I mean‚Ä¶ You‚Äôd have to assume you get to preview more than one life. It‚Äôd be weird to trailer just one and be done. I almost said something raunchy. I just want you to know I retrained myself and I am proud.
Can you though? Your point seems
to contradict your username. Also, nice username. Lol
You can't if you don't have the money for the plane ticket or the physical ability to get yourself there
cant wait to spend money i dont and never will have on going to the tropics many miles away from all family and friends with no way of contacting them to the point i might as well have just died instead because either way they're never seeing me again.

Nah. Anyone roped into this should have a voice for how they are governed.
Nobody is going to remove themselves from society just because you're a snowflake.
"wonder why these people are so unhappy. anyways i believe in abolishing human rights and ruining their lives even further. we should do absolutely nothing to improve anything - if you aren't already happy and well then tough shit."
So, fascism?
Have you taken a look around you lately? There‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù about what‚Äôs going on in the world
I‚Äôm a F and I don‚Äôt want kids because the state of this world‚Ä¶. Can‚Äôt afford to bring someone into this world and then let them suffer. That‚Äôd be cruel
You don't know anything about the people on this sub except for the small snippets they write on here. It's interesting that you feel some compelling need to come up with a theory of who the people on this subreddit really are. Why? Is it because you need to come up with an ad hominem attack and therefore you need to define the invisible target of your attack in order to come up with suitable insults?
there's a feminist aspect to AN that resonates with me (female) pretty hard and I'm far from alone.


namely, when we are permitted to choose how many kids to have, we go beneath "replacement rate" - implying that coercion and violence against women were the reason the population was growing. and with that being the case, this sick species deserves to die out.¬†
[deleted]
Yes but what you‚Äôre describing is exactly the sort of situation which gives evidence to the AN philosophy. That is not a conscious choice to have mental health issues. It is not a conscious choice of someone who is paralyzed to remain happy. These are totally outside of our control and define our lives forever. 

It isn‚Äôt something someone who has a baby can control either. The kid just may or may not enjoy the experience, quite apart from whatever choices they make. Personally, I can‚Äôt justify doing such a thing to anyone being that there is no reason to do so other than that I have a biological urge to.
Source?
Suffering prevention is not the basis of antinatlism, it is just a large part of it for many antinatalists!! (Side note: for what reason would you not want to prevent all suffering to happen to somebody you don't even know when the only thing you have to do is nothing? I cannot imagine a non selfish reason for having a child, but if you can think of one please do feel free to reply with it) Anyways, even if a person lives a 100% happy life completely devoid of suffering (which is unfortunately impossible both due to systemic issues and our biology), I would still be an antinatlist. The entire experience of life is a HUGE experience that we impose on a person and the fact that they have no way to consent is extremely upsetting to me. I hate the idea of forcing anything on anybody and I can't imagine anything bigger than the forced experience of living. The only thing close to consent we have is  that those who regret having been born turn to suicide. (It is extremely tragic, but it is why I believe in the right to death)
>In reality AN‚Äôs here are typically just lonely young men with mental health problems

There was actually a poll that happened here at some point which showed the majority was actually women.
I forgot that philosophy figured out that happiness is the meaning of life. I guess I'm done since your logic is infallible.
Sounds oddly specific. You sure you‚Äôre not describing yourself there, matey?
This only means their parents could have prevented this.
lol I‚Äôm in a loving relationship with my gf of 5 years and we share the same AN values
i'm not even a man. also thanks for the pep talk, i'll be sure to continue to blame myself for rising house prices and me getting bullied and groomed when i was a kid. it's all my fault that everyone i know and love is going to die. it's all my fault that there are multiple wars ongoing right now.

sounds like you have a lot of disdain and hatred towards many of your fellow humans. if only there were some way to... y'know, prevent that from happening... you're responsible for your own happiness, after all.
How are their supposed mental health problems character flaws? And you think they are easy peasy to cure? Nice victim blaming

I have stated this exact thing multiple times on the AN sub, it's not the answer they're looking for. You are dealing with folks who have existential anxiety over the mere existence of the possibility of suffering in many cases. 

A noble effort on your part, but fruitless I'm afraid.
to be fair hair can give people confidence
Yeah antinatalism is logically sound but this eugenics-adjacent attitude ain't it. You can be bald/fat/ill and be happy with your life. It's the fact that breeding brings a potentially unhappy life without consent that's wrong.

My point is aimed more at the spiritual aspect not the physical aspect. Humans do not know what exists outside our time in earth. From a spiritual aspect it is possible that the "soul" chooses to be born.
you missed the point of the comment. Darkfigure145 assumes that in the theoretical situation where an infant could view their life before they were born, they still would not always know if it was a good or a bad life and if it is worth living or not.
And antinatalists that support the argument of OPs pic need to embrace the entire spectrum of their feelings more often, instead of cherry picking hedonism and than raising the minimum bar of life to an impossible level by never wanting any negative feelings, rendering their expectations unachievable and philosophicly to a typical controversy of the definition what life is and how it works

I can get behind certain aspects of not wanting to reproduce, but it just seems like post like these are more against life itself than having children.

I love my life and wouldn't trade with anyone. I guess im just lucky
Yes you literally just can. You can also decide to cut off your own arms and jump into a dumpster to bleed out. You can drastically change your life for the better or worse at any point, its just most people don't actually want to
Yeah for example you can be one of those kids who makes under $300 a year working at a Nestle cocoa plantation
You can get to any land mass easily for free through volunteer work with something like peace Corp, unv, international ngo's, and faith based missions.

Its possible to do, its just most people don't want to actually change their life
I doubt you have friends tbh
No
Life is easily worth it even when it's hard.
100% this.
Couldn't have said it better myself
Just because no one will remember it,you decide to do something wrong?


That's NOT how you should decide things,it is a line of thinking that breeds evil actions
Trust me, bro
I made It up
Wasn't that just a couple weeks ago? People forget pretty quick
Haha. Can‚Äòt really judge anything without knowing it‚Äôs end. For example:‚Äú imagine after you die you wake up in gamecenter and this life was just the newest videogame‚Ä¶ Than you would laugh and all the pain you experienced wouldn‚Äôt way that heavy anymore‚Ä¶ all the trauma and shit it was just a game‚Ä¶ Simular to-> woke up from a nightmare and am happy it was just a nightmare‚Ä¶all the pain was just a dream
then try fix them if possible. there's almost always something you can do to help yourself
Guy said his problems are health related. 3 is impossible to do without access to quality healthcare, and even then, it may be unfixable.


So, either 1 or 2. What should he do?
You saying noble effort just proves you have some sort of saviour complex. Just leave the subreddit and don‚Äôt try to change peoples minds. We‚Äôre mostly adults here
So why not work on ensuring lives are happy instead of giving up?
Yeah I have noticed the odd eugenics bent to a few people here.

Ah, so that justifies roping the non existent into this? The CHANCE there is some magical utopian paradise waiting for us after death. Lol‚Ä¶yeah, okay.
If you wanna embrace Hellraisers-level masochism and experience as many negative emotions and incidents as possible then you're free to do so. It's your birthright. Just don't subject a child to it, and don't expect us to subject our own children to it either. They aren't you.
I'm not complaining much about my life. I'm complaining about how much worse most other people's are. I don't think it's fair for me to have all the fun and privilege, and more to the point I don't think it's fair to subject a child to the same shit for no good reason. If I'm whining for anyone, it's everyone. I'll whine on your behalf too since you'd rather take your misery out on internet randos than reflect on your life. I expect yours is far worse than mine if this is how you're spending your free time - or dull work hours.

You sound quite angry and resentful that others aren't sitting down and taking it like you were instructed to. You were taught to Suck It Up Buttercup and when others aren't compliant like you? You feel robbed. But you can't lash out at the powers that be lest you face punishment, so where do you turn? To everyone else getting screwed over. Grasping at any sense of power or superiority you can get in a dog-eat-dog environment. 

So again: yeah, I'll whine. For you. I'll whine because you'd sooner complain about us feeling sorry for you than acknowledge just how bad you really have it for fear of being "childish". That's far more tragic than anything I've been through - and I've been told to get checked for CPTSD, for comparison. Who hurt you this badly, for you to be so hellbent on others being hurt with you, for the misery to have company?

Are you an olympic athlete? Because if everything is so easy why wouldn't you be one.
If someone is physically disabled, they won't be able to do what you just suggested. Your advice doesn't work for everyone
and obviously all of those volunteer work organizations have unlimited places so everyone can do it no questions asked no physical requirements whatsoever
But people can only decide that for themselves, it‚Äôs not your choice, and not knowing their choice is the issue
I'm not trying to be antagonistic, I am just shocked at this statement ü§£ life has literally never been worth it for me, not even in my happiest moments, not even after achieving some of my dreams lol. Do you really find life fulfilling? At all times?
i would have had no capacity whatsoever to miss anything in my life had i never been born. individual things in life are "worth" doing to ease the inherent misery. life itself isn't. the hands of time march forward to a rotten end whether we love life or not. either we hate it and embrace the end as a mercy or love it and have to try to convince ourselves that it's fine that it does end, be that through religion or saying we did and saw enough (good luck to anyone tryin that second one if they have health issues or otherwise dont expect to live very long).
Forcing life upon someone is forcing them to work constantly to survive. You're giving a "gift" that can't be returned. You are using your experience to determine whether life is worth the trouble or not. You may create someone who completely disagrees with you. 

It's OK to feel that way. I don't think it's a good reason to bring someone here to exist in a cruel world without their consent. And then expect them to be grateful you created them to be a wage slave.
Frankly, I disagree. Some lives just aren't worth living and I say that without ill will to those of us who are living the hardest lives.
That depends on how hard we're talking. Some people live terrible lives, experiencing horrors well beyond your comprehension.
You can't say that for someone else, you can't talk for others. How do you know if others feel like life is wirth it? Unbelievable, see that's the problem natalists have, they think their children will think however they want them to think.
guys wait you gotta bring your kids to watch the post credits scene in morbius its gonna be so epic. why are you still walking away.
There‚Äôs also always a possibility that they can‚Äôt do something about it. What do you propose then? 

Not everything in this world can be changed for the better. And if it was so easy I doubt the world would be this trash.
And if you can't?! You're so insensitive and ableist.
*Has health issues


"Have you tried helping yourself?"
"just stop being so down's, bro!!"
It's a turn of phrase, awful lot of juvenile angst present for "mostly adults"
You do realize noble effort is just a turn of phrase right? Chill out bro.
Oh I don't think antinatalism is giving up on people: I totally agree that we should make every effort to ensure that living people's (and nonhuman animals') lives' are as good as possible. However bringing more beings into existence without consent makes no sense, it's bringing more potential unhappiness that we then have to fix. Not breeding= no possible harm, breeding= possible harm, possible good. I think that no one should make this gamble since it's someone else's life.
I think you missed the point. Your meme implies that if everyone could see there life before being born then no one would be born.

All I said was that we don't know that we haven't seen our lives already before being born. In terms of religion everyone believes something different and there is no way to be sure. For all you know you saw a trailer of your life and how you will live and your soul still decided to come on down.
Great attempt to discredit everything Ive just said with your foolish attempt to draw the most extreme opposite end.


Your body allows you to feel "bad" emotions for reasons. Its not me who implemented it into your or your childdrens body.
So all they expierience is themself, their own spectrum, and ALL parts are needed to have a human expirience of life.


Go on, cry how tough human life is and thst your antinatalist, while in denial o that.
If I did, and you died, I would never be able to forgive myself for causing the death of someone.
No, because I have no interest in being one. Also that takes many many years to do, what I was talking about doesnt.

I never said it was easy, I said you can do it. Its not hard like becoming an Olympian, its hard like going to the gym. Anyone can do it, its just most people don't feel like it
Holy shit yall are so desperate to be victims hahaahahaha
A extremely large number of people find life terrible,unfulfilling,more people contemplate suicide,lots more antidepressants,the kids who are born now have no real future,except the promise of misery.


On the other hand there are people who are literally too stupid to tell whether their having a good time or not,but they are not and should not be considered the norm
I find life wildly fulfilling,  and despite some of the horrible things that happened to me (abusive mother,  dad dying of cancer when I was 22, girl I thought I'd marry cheating on me,  etc) I'd easily do every bit of it all over again because of how worth it life feels to me... that's not to say everyone will feel that way,  I'm not ignorant to the fact some don't,  but I say it not to try to convince anyone to be happy with life, instead just keep in mind a potential life could be miserable even if given everything they could ask for,  or they could be joyous with having nothing in life,  or anything in between.... it's really a flip of the coin.
Even if I wouldn't "miss" life had I never been born,  it'd be tragic considering the idea of me never having been able to experience life even if I wouldn't have known what I was missing. That would be awful.
I don't think some people not enjoying life is not a good reason not to bring new life in. At least if you chose to make the life it can decide for itself if it's worth it,  we all have an opt out option.
You'd be surprised.
Well obviously my statement was subjective to me,  but you can't assume the child _won't_ feel the way I do either,  meaning you'd be screwing them if they didn't experience life. 

Meaning it's a coin flip,  damned if you do,  damned if you don't.

Until you find a way to get consent pre-existence then ethics has to be ignored if humanity is to continue.

The problem with Antinatalism isn't the logic of the argument but its usefulness. 

So you're right let's say, nonconsensual life is immoral. What next?
[removed]
Since your brain didn't exist before you were conceived, how exactly would you view the trailer of your future life and how exactly would you make the decision whether or not to be born?
"Your honour, the victim wasn't really a victim because they knew it was going to happen and decided to be born to experience it anyway!"
The future hasn‚Äôt happened yet‚Ä¶.
What's the reason for someone who doesn't exist to feel bad emotions
in denial of what. of course people have the capacity to experience pain from the moment they're born. that's exactly what i'm saying. why do you think i don't want more people to be born? why would i want more people to get hurt?
That's understandable
moving to and living in the tropics is free guys. if you cant afford clothing theres like, literally no authority figures stopping you from being nude on the beaches full of tourists. diving for fish is perfectly safe because theyll definitely give you free medical care if you get stung.

u just dont feel like it  : /   :  /   ! ! !
Just as it's not easy cutting your arms or an other suicide method, you either have to deal with survivor instinct or the government locking you up and drugging you in psych prison.

And just like having no desire to become an olympic athlete i have no desire to have a life but since I'm unable to end it i just rot away all the time hoping i get worse to the point some survival instinct won't be an issue
And you are so desperate to blame people for the hand others dealt them.
This is very true and just from what you wrote, I can tell you I haven't been through anything as devastating as you mentioned, especially not at a young age. Whether it's hereditary or due to hormones, obviously people view life differently.
How old are you? How long did it take you to feel like that? Or have you always felt that way?
Awful why? Is it not a greater tragedy that no matter how beloved someone is, death is sure to claim them whether anyone wants it or not? You not being able to experience life wouldn't mean anything in the absence of "you". "Someone" who doesn't exist, never did and never will cannot care about not existing, nor can "they" ever be missed or mourned. Do you think it's also tragic nobody is living on the sun right now? That most of the universe moves on just fine with nobody in it?

In a world without life, who could lament anything, how could any tragedy occur?
How would you feel about a friend or loved one deciding to "opt out", as per your suggestion?
Having children is not a game, a poker or something, it's a very serious decision. You can't just flip coin
guys you gotta bring your kids onto the planet so that some user on reddit can tell them they should end their life. dude life's so amazing and awesome and there are so many cool people on in this world isn't it incredible? it's really inspiring seeing users like andrew tell people to end life right after going off about how life is good.

the meme of the op implies a scenario where that is exactly possible
We are fighting over a probability that in practicality is never going to happen. Also I discard the fact that soul chooses what life we are born into. Whatever laws are, they need to be universal and applicable to all living forms. Gravity cannot exclusively act on humans. It acts on bacteria too. Did the bacteria also saw the trailer üôÇ.¬†
But humans exist, and you wont make it stop single handed.
So your hyptohetical "if" construction never applied.
Because thats the price to pay of any complex living organism. Humans wont devolve back to unorganic matter.

That you are short¬†sighted to not acknowledge that and therefor even wish others to never have the expirience to make their own decision is pure self centered. Typical phrase of good intentions lead the path to hell (i dont believe in a god, obviously) fits great.


While the other 90% of people who are such indoctrinated, lul, decide that their life expirience justifies to repeat the cycle and continue humanity.


So gl and hf, outcast, sick mind, denying his own origin, to promoting human extinction rather than evolution and progress.
Guess what: Nature proofs you wrong, since at least a couple million years.
Funny history wont even remember this unimportant matter of personal life expiriences¬†that came to the conclusion that Utilitiraism is their only objective, to the extreme they can not even recognize its them speaking for themselfs but not for anything but close to the masses.
Guess what: Same expirience can still lead to a different conclusion, and people who really suffered are the people promoting life the strongest - while people mentally suffering their own boredom tend to radicalize themselfs into the most abstruse things.
F.e., promoting human extinction by voluntary actions. Lol
Your able to end it, getting permission isn't the thing stopping you. The thing stopping you is you dont want to
Cry about it pusay boi
I suspect hormones,  though I can't reasonably explain why it'd be beneficial for the body to do that to itself. I'm not attempting to downplay those whose outlook is massively darker than mine either,  I genuinely feel for you. Neither of our outlooks really count as reality,  just perspective,  and neither one is likely "right" for feeling like we do,  maybe it's just luck of the draw.... which is kinda sad in and of itself.
I'm 40, and I have felt this way at least some since about 14ish, probably fully felt this way since 24. But to be fair the first 13 years of my life were stuck with an abusive crazy mother,  so had that not been the case maybe it would have come earlier?
Naw, I don't see death as negative,  it's what gives moments power. If we had immortality moments would mean less to us due to the abundance, thereby taking some of the magic out of life.

Objectively It'd be tragic,  obviously not subjectively since your hypothetical removes the subject lol
Sad,  but not upset with them.  I'd miss them,  as I think is fair.
Oh OK then explain to me how you know what your child will be like ahead of time?


Or maybe it's that the coin flip is inherent to the nature of things? Which would mean we do and should just flip a coin.
[removed]
I chose that prior axiomatically.

I'm not interested in anything that would lead to humanity's extinction.
More to the point, how does someone who hasn't existed yet have the practical or emotional intelligence to comprehend being shown what their life will be and make an informed decision? If their memories are completely wiped when they are born, is that really the same person anymore?
>you wont make it stop single handed

On an individual level, we can make a difference by eliminating the suffering of 1000s of future people by not procreating. And by spreading the idea, millions of people may be spared.  This can be a significant and empowering life choice.
Of course we won't stop it single handed. That's precisely why we're asking others to consider antinatalism alongside us. And that still doesn't explain why you should create people and make them suffer.
"Because thats the price to pay of any complex living organism" Right. So. Let's stop making more people. So there's no "price" to pay whatsoever. Who are we paying this price to, exactly?

"That you are short sighted" Rich beyond words. No self awareness.

"wish others to never have the expirience to make their own decision is pure self centered."

Your decision to have children doesn't just influence your own life, because the child suffers as a consequence - they are also capable of causing suffering for others. On the contrary, my decision to not have a child can't affect anybody because my child is never going to exist, and therefore can never be harmed, nor ever long for a good life like the children born and deprived do. The act of having children is inherently selfish - any needs of the child you fulfil are because you created those needs in the first place, resulting in no net gain. What's wrong with caring for the people already here, who already need help, instead of making even more people who need help?

"denying his own origin" genuinely who/what the hell are you talking about. Who's he.

"Nature proofs you wrong, since at least a couple million years." Most of the universe is devoid of life and species go extinct relatively often in comparison to the planet's own span of existence.

"Funny history wont even remember this unimportant matter of personal life expiriences" How do you say this and not realize that anyone who decides to have a child is equally as unimportant. People usually don't get remembered for having kids, they get remembered for actually doing something interesting or notable. Copying the behaviours of a fish or rabbit isn't special.
>therefor even wish others to never have the expirience to make their own decision is pure self centered.

  
Aren't you being self-centered by "wishing" that on to the "others" you are not creating? You are making an active decision to only procreate selectively. You will probably have a maximum number of 3 children and then deny the experience to all those others you could have created but choose not to.
So i actually want to work 8+ hours something i hate to the point I'm completely drained and cannot do anything except rot in bed after work? And when i say anything i mean anything, I haven't done any house cleaning for a few months, my only socialising is through Reddit, I haven't enjoyed any video games for a long time, i just can't do anything in my free time, and you are telling me i enjoy that?
im not even a boi and my eyes are pretty barren
does that not imply that it is better for our lives to be cut short than for them to be longer on thus decreasing the "magic", "power" or value of it? what is the magic of life in the first place?

and... "objective"... tragedy...? what exactly does that mean? how is any tragedy objective? objectivity requires a lack of emotional influence, tragedy is processed emotionally... how would those two things fit together???
So if you had a child, do you think it would be good for them to "opt out" and upset you, their other family members and their friends/colleagues?
There are many things inherit ti tge nature which we don't follow anymore. We have intellect to decide whether it's worth it to have children or not. I do not know that's why i won't risk it and won't have children. Plus what if they didn't want to be born at all what should i tell them that i wanted to fit in society or i felt miserable so i created you to fill the hole inside me? Hell nah
We have removed your content for breaking our subreddit rules. Remain civil: Do not troll, excessively insult, argue for/conflate suicide, or engage in bad faith.
Why?
True that. I don't find any logic in this.¬†
Your just an idiot putting words in my mouth. I didnt say you enjoy it, I said you dont really want to change it. Big difference 

Humans are creatures of habbit, thats why people stay in abusive relationships
That would only work if your expectation of life would be to be cut short, because otherwise you'll put the same weight on moments we already do with the expectation of living averagely around 80 years. 


It's objectively tragic if all life ends everywhere. It's a loss objectively even without an emotional creature to observe it. Same with this.
I don't think it'd be good,  but it'd be better than never existing at all, which would be the worst case.
I do have the intellect to determine if it's worth it and it absolutely is to me. The coin flip though was commenting on if the kid would find life worth it,  and nobody,  you included,  can answer that question with any confidence. It's a coin flip. I choose to flip the coin.

If they didn't want to be born they have choices to make. That's on them to make those decisions. But having them has nothing to do with fitting in or trying to fill some hole in myself.
Why would I support an action or argument whose end result would be the end of humanity?

If there are no people then there might as well be nothing as there's no one to experience it.

Like I can accept that no one consents to existence and that perhaps there's some grievance there but aside from that where does the argument go?
Decline of the small town thread
‚ÄúI want to take you to your mother's home...your home at one time. It's very important.‚Äù

Twin Peaks, the town, isn‚Äôt looking so hot. The original series played up the romance of the small town. The cracks are showing in The Return.

Was I too young to notice how bad things were growing up or did rural areas really get bleaker?
  
1-1-9! 1-1-9!
In my opinion ‚ÄúThe Return‚Äù was showing the degradation of the collective psychology of the nation or even the world.
If it makes you feel better, I live near north bend and I go to the twin peaks sign spot to swim in the river and it's desolate out there. There's no signs for anything ever. It's always peaceful.
Rural areas in the US have generally gotten bleaker. I can get into theories of why, but it‚Äôs pretty obvious to me. And most rural folks are aware of it.
where's the vape shop
DL: If we lived today in the golden age, we would be there at the end of Twin Peaks. But we don't live there, we are in front of the Palmer house.
If there's a town that could use access to quick and easy divorce, it's Twin Peaks.
I think that was the subtext of the original series, and especially FWWM, that small towns have a quaint veneer that masks a dark truth. Nowadays the shine has come off and the social code that kept up appearances has all but vanished. The dark truth can be seen plainly, and the mysteries are only unknown because they are repulsive when viewed up close, so we prefer to look away.
Small towns are profoundly bleak these days.

In the PNW they are nicer  b/c the nature rules.

But in the Midwest, they shipped all the jobs overseas so they can run run the people like slaves and pay them pennies and pocket the difference.

So yeah it is grim
This feels very true to Twin Peaks to me.
This is art. You made me feel something today, thank you
Needs a bikini barista stand and weed shop sign.
Over eight billion people on Earth in 2024.  There were 5.3 billion in 1990.  Remote work.  Etc., etc.  This image is totally hilarious, though.
the kratom/cbd shops are everywhere now.

except in alabama.  in alabama i could go a half mile over the state line to florida and buy a $40 bag of kratom, get pulled over with it after i cross back into alabama and it would come with the same charge as trafficking heroin or cocaine.  anything over 4oz, which isn't a whole lot of kratom, is considered trafficking a schedule 1 substance in alabama.  probably just a coincidence that they keep spending billions on new prisons.

We used to be able to see the stars. Now there are 2 gigantic pickup truck dealerships that take up what used to be 2 plaza‚Äôs worth of local businesses. I wish a meteor would hit this fucking place.
I'm in an illegal kratom state so I gotta agree about that part
This meme is the entire PNW tbh üòÇ I love it here
Seeing that population pisses me off every time. I grew up in 5k population town in Washington. It‚Äôs larger now. But the fact that the producers didn‚Äôt think it was a real number so they made lynch add a 0. 

Insane. Growing up I knew a lot of gossip about random people I barely talked to. 2 high schools.
I love the idea of Kratom tea while exploring twin peaks!
This is what it feels like driving by North Bend or Fall city (where TW was filmed) I‚Äôd also say that this is very Everette (where the Laura Palmer house is‚Ä¶ especially of 99)
this brings Silent Hill to my mind
I think rural areas are suffering in a similar way cities did during the era of ‚Äúwhite flight.‚Äù

People with money leave the country, looking for better accommodations, which drains local economies and spirals us poor folk into communities choked with opioid use and reverse mortgage lenders.

The evils of humanity is ever-present, but kept at bay when people are comfortable in their own lives.

Wait did we ever see her arc? Lmao what was her last scene?
If ever a character needed a spinoff like the Jeffersons from All in the Family, it‚Äôs 1-1-9 lady. 

Maybe the core dynamic and ongoing gag is that she does elephant-killing amounts of drugs but her weird shrimpy kid bails her out of trouble without even realizing he‚Äôs doing it.
I think it‚Äôs both. The original series showed the darkness brimming under the surface of small town America. The Return shows that darkness boiling over, and also shows how it exists in other parts of America as well. A virus that keeps getting worse and keeps spreading.
Shovel yourself out of the shit!
I lived there until a couple years ago and can confirm.

However, whats happening to North Bend/Snoqualmie isnt rural desolation, its suburban expansion.  

There are cookie cutter housing developments and $900k townhouses going up for people that commute to Microsoft etc.  

There are still places where elk just wander about but fewer than there were.
Yes!  I was thinking, ‚Äúdid these signs get put up yesterday or is OP being funny‚Äù
Ever hit up the RR?
No question. The atmosphere in rural areas near me is not good, and the people who live there often feel abandoned.
I'm my experience they already were 30 years ago, now it's soul crushing instead of just crushing
Kind of  related but I think the game night in the woods handled this topic really well. Would definitely recommend to pick up the game. The whole game has a vibe of living in a dying rural town and the whole plot centers around that. Even  has quite a few twin peaks vibes.
> I can get into theories of why, but it‚Äôs pretty obvious to me. And most rural folks are aware of it.

Please do, I'm curious to hear your thoughts.
At least American cities seem to be doing great! /s
Eh not really lol, the nice towns just stay off the map.
> I can get into theories of why, but it‚Äôs pretty obvious to me. And most rural folks are aware of it.

Not sure if racist dog whistle or not‚Ä¶
The place that sells Kratom
can you explain this to me ,
Hasn‚Äôt the Chevy dealership been there since the ‚Äò50‚Äôs though?
What lol? Why would she get an arc?
Totally. That theme of an underlying rot hidden by innocent Americana is present in a lot of his works. I feel like some of the ideas and themes that David Lynch had running through his mind while filming Blue Velvet worked their way into The Return as well.
I think this is essentially why we have those more disturbing scenes like the woman in the car and the puking.¬†
Yes, and it loops back to small town America (and as a Canadian, I‚Äôm including Canada in that), too. I feel like whereas the original showed both sides of a s town, the good and the ugly, The Return basically shows small town America as an empty husk bereft of any positives. Just living out the remainder of its time on the few remaining vestiges that are dying out. 

As a British Columbian, The Return hit home. A lot of our small towns have lost their culture and sense of community, some have literally burnt down, others don‚Äôt access to basic medical care, and so on. And the really small towns will be ghost towns in 10-15 years when most of the populace has died.
I‚Äôm trying but all I have is a regular ‚Äúnon gold‚Äù shovel. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be working.
Sounds like Ghostwood.
This is true: the suburban sprawl isn‚Äôt all encompassing yet.
Every once in a while. The banana cream pie is damn fine. The coffee is alright lol
which stands to reason, considering they are abandoned
Manufacturing employment decline (employment not output; manufacturing output is up a lot over time, to my knowledge), heavy drug use from the 90‚Äôs onward, brain drain, cultural asymmetry with the rest if the country.

Cities have taken on increasing allure to bright young people. Remember that in the late 60s-90s, big cities were seen as dirty violent places. They got better over time, and more nice suburbs and exurbs were built, so smart upwardly Mobile people became more killed to leave small towns.

Here in Indiana part of the problem has been state gov policy. People love to say they love Mitch Daniels, but he closed down a lot of small town high schools and forced consolidation. That hurt local social capital. He also oversaw a state amendment capping property taxes, which was a giveaway to rich homeowners in Indy but made a lot of small towns unable to finance basic government services and education (because small town property values are lower, a lot of small towns had high-ish property taxes).

There is definitely a cultural element too. Not sure how mean I want to get with this, but America is an increasingly diverse, socially liberal, religiously moderate or non religious place. Small towns don‚Äôt fit in with this super well. For one, higher levels of racism prevent a lot of black and latino and mixed race people from moving there (though this is getting better). That‚Äôs bad news in an increasingly black and latino and mixed race country. You also miss out on immigrants, who are good at boosting local fertility and productivity. (Though I do think immigrant populations in small towns are increasing).

Also you have to ask how many knowledge-based companies want to move their office to a community where evolution and climate change are doubted, where the Confederate flags fly freely, and where much of the population believes that God determines outcome more than people and their individual efforts. I‚Äôm not criticizing these traits so much as pointing out that they don‚Äôt comport well with the culture of the knowledge/office-work economy. They do comport well with hands-on work like construction, manufacturing, transportation, etc., and you see a lot of rural folks do well in these industries. But you‚Äôd rather have both sides of the coin going for you.

Finally, I think the decline of agriculture is part of the story. There are just fewer ag workers today than in the past, and that was a good reason to live in a small town. The income also provided demand in the small towns, but as farming has depopulated, I suspect that a lot of the revenue is being shipped out from the small towns and farm areas. The cultural significance of agriculture has changed too. 50 years ago, many people‚Äôs parents or grandparents were farmers. Today that is pretty rare. Farmers are often the butts of jokes and seen as provincial bumpkins. The respect for agriculture has faded, and this makes a normal person less likely to see a small town as a desirable place.

How- how is that racist
I love kratom
The world is much more densely populated in our year now than the years during which *Twin Peaks* was filmed.  Additionally, many folks who work remotely, on work computers from home, have moved to small towns now that they don't need to work in an office in a city like Washington DC, New York City, or San Francisco.  Therefore, it kind of makes sense than Twin Peaks, the town not the show, would have grown since the show aired 35 years ago.  More advertising comes with more people. Does that explanation make sense?
My point is what was her purpose? Did she do anything significant besides scratch and yell 1-1-9
Yeah like the opening of Blue Velvet which is showing a normal suburban area and then dropping into the dirt with the worms, symbolizing the rot and darkness beneath the surface.
Yeah exactly! It‚Äôs not so much plot as it is a a visceral image to give you an idea.
Wish I‚Äôd got that pro tip a few weeks ago. My wife and I popped in for a visit and went with the cherry pie. Good, but not Cooper quality. Still, I was in heaven in that atmosphere. So cool what they did with the place.
It's the American way. It happened to cities after ww2. Anything that's not economically viable will be left to rot with little to no help.
Depending on how you look at it
They shot themselves in the foot with their desire for deregulation, unfettered capitalism, and hating anyone who is different
Can relate, I live near east palestine, and have seen how quickly they were abandoned/ forgotten about after the explosion. Pretty much my whole life, small towns near me where already in a pretty disparate state, and only seems to get worse and worse.
It's not really the lack of Starbucks that bothers us. It's the meth, the churches, the post-white flight towns turned to ruins, the abandoned industrial infrastructure, the run-down trailer parks, and the neverending series of MAGA flags that make it seem bleak.

Obviously, not all of rural America is like that, but as someone who has lived in both urban and rural places, more than enough of it is like that to leave a lasting impression.
There might be some rural towns that appear to be doing okay, but the truth of the matter is most are extremely crippled due to drug addiction, few have any meaningful, long term career paths and most rely upon their farms likely owned by multinational conglomerates which are sucking up all the profitability from the land and sending it to the financial centers of cities.
It‚Äôs not inherently, but that‚Äôs kind of the point of a [dog whistle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics)). They‚Äôre intentionally vague with the intent of signaling to like minded people while maintaining plausible deniability. 

By vaguely saying they have theories but failing to elaborate on them, it allows you to fill in the blanks with whatever you want. There‚Äôs a subset of conservatives that blame rural America‚Äôs woes on immigrants and ‚Äúglobal elites,‚Äù which is often coded language for Jewish people.

I‚Äôm not saying OP is racist or that anyone replying/upvoting is. However, the fact that they didn‚Äôt respond to clarify that they meant something else certainly leaves that possibility open.
Same here. Saved my life
Kratom was really nice for me for a couple weeks and then it made me violently sick to the point of vomiting. It‚Äôs nasty stuff and apparently hugely addicting (I never made it that far).
Same here. Saved my life
i gotta watch that movie fr
yeah but it's a lot worse now. the people that own everything used to be able to look five minutes ahead and acknowledge that sometimes you gotta spend a dollar now to secure better profits down the line, but since probably the reagan years (but you could easily make an argument it started before that) conditions have made it impossible for them to do that. rate of profit keeps falling so they gotta make it up somewhere, which means eventually they're stripping the copper out the walls
Hey buddy. Not all of us rural folk are fascists. Just most of us, sadly.
a lot of rural people fit that bill, but they aren't the cause of the peripheral rot around the cities. that shit's happening because it's cheaper to do neoliberal cutting of social services, and flooding places with opioids is lucrative as fuck

this is basic dying empire stuff, which the regular imperial subjects basically aren't ever responsible for
All the people who aren't that and yet stuck there didnt follow the bulletproof advice of dumbasses online: just move :)
This dude went off the deep end over a Starbutts joke lol.

And the person who got downvoted, like what the fuck?

He got downvoted for defending rural towns not all being shitty? Or were the 30 downvotes over the Starbutts joke?

Either way is...weird.
Yea I hear what you‚Äôre saying . It is super tiring that the rural conservatives fall right for the same tricks fascists always use: they blame a minority whom they consider an out group; rather than the capitalist system, and corporate greed.
I've been using it as like a morning coffee for years. I just take two of those little capsules and it gets my day going. I've never upped my dose beyond that, and I can go weeks without taking it without any symptoms of withdrawal, besides being more tired (which is why I started taking it in the first place)

For me anything more than like a gram gives me nausea, so I've never wanted to abuse it.
It‚Äôs great and probably Lynch‚Äôs most ‚Äústraightforward‚Äù story.
Or Red Lobster
NAFTA sucked all the jobs out of small towns and sent them to Mexico.
it ends up being a vicious cycle. since time immemorial rural people have been more conservative on average than city dwellers, but it surely doesn't help when people in the big population centers treat people in the hinterlands like benighted troglodytes who don't know what's good for them and deserve what they get for voting wrong. that fuckin sucks
Fascists don‚Äôt believe in unfettered capitalism.
It is great. I get from a great mom and pop vendor online dirt cheap so I know what‚Äôs being put in it.  There is an insane amount of disinformation on it.
red lobster too definitely
Strip mining by private equity is how I describe it lately.

What was Cooper doing in the Black Lodge for 25 years?
I always wondered, what was he doing? Was he just seeing doppelgangers and trying to find an exit? He wasn't hungry or thirsty, right?
Also, why is he wearing a different suit?

(I watched the 2 seasons, FWWM, The Missing Pieces and The Return)
Sitting.
Waiting for that gum to come back in style.
There's footage of Lynch directing Kyle for the brief moment Cooper meets up with Andy in the foyer of the sheriff's department in Part 17 and Lynch instructs Kyle to act as though no time has passed. Maybe very little time has passed in the Lodge which may be why he reacts to his reflection the way he does in Part 4, he didn't expect himself to be so old.
My guess is he was staring at somebody else because that's what people do in there. It is like a hardcore eye contact fetish club.
Changing his suit and adjusting his pin.
time does not move at the same pace in the lodge, to Coop, it probably felt like a couple hours. i imagine since the brain can't quite comprehend what is happening due to the distortion that he was probably just sitting trying to make sense of what he just went through before entering. if he remembers what just happened right before, it also seems the lodge tends to wipe your thoughts, so maybe he was just waiting. hence the waiting room.
Bangin' hoors and doin lines

Nonexisting
Twenty-five years in the lodge he wanted manicott', but he compromised. He ate grilled cheese off the radiator instead. He wanted to f*** a woman, but he compromised. He jacked off into a tissue. You see where I'm goin'?
My theory? Cooper was mostly in the white lodge, with the Giant Fireman showing him the horrors of the universe on that big screen and prepping him to defeat the sources of all that evil, known as BOB and JUDY.
Probably working on a plan to get out. Time doesn't move there exactly the same. Mike and the arm were collaborating with him. Magic is tricky, and because the Red Room is essentially purgatory he was more or less in prison.¬†


BOB was working to keep him in there. He was making plans to thwart Coop's escape attempt. That was the reason for the box in NYC.¬†
Where‚Äôd you watch missing pieces
Watching one piece
Earning a degree from DeVry
Very little. Time works different there.
In Lynch‚Äôs worlds, you need to suspend your expectations that the laws of this reality extend into the others that he has created. I don‚Äôt think Cooper felt like more than a brief period for him, and this may connect to his final comment wondering what year it was. It was like a dream for him. When we wake up from sleep, we can‚Äôt recount every single moment of what we did during that time, and that would be the same for Cooper. This also matches Mike telling him that he needs to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù. Cooper was in that liminal space between being asleep and awake, being aware and unaware, and as such didn‚Äôt fully exist in either domain. There‚Äôs also Monica Bellucci‚Äôs comment about ‚Äúwho is the dreamer?‚Äù. Some of, or perhaps most of, what we watched was Cooper‚Äôs dream, thus again we need to suspend the rules of reality, as we believe them to be. Look at Mullholland Drive - the whole first half of the movie has been conceptualized as a dream of Diane‚Äôs where she envisions herself as living the life of Betty. 

Lynch lives a lot in dreams, in liminal spaces, in worlds where the laws of reality as we know them (such as time) are suspended.

My take, from his first scene in The Return, is that he spent the time learning how to navigate the world of the black lodge and coordinated with the fireman for a plan to trap Judy, get rid of Bob, and try to save Laura.

The beauty and horror of the black lodge is that I represents so much of what Lynch tries to do in his work. Let the audience decide what it is. I personally think it‚Äôs a bad dream. Nothing makes sense, time moves much differently and the ability to talk, eat, sleep, shit is nonexistent.

- *from The Black Lodge promotional pamphlet.*
*cries in Leland* that's my favourite gum!!
Perhaps this helps explain the ending? Coop is running on the premise that it is still 1989. He even says to Carrie 'I think you're a GIRL called Laura Palmer'. At the end he asks 'what year is this?' because he suddenly realizes that a really long time has actually passed?
Wasn't that one of the first scenes they even shot for The Return too?
Time is definitely fucky wucky in the return
That's a nice theory. Didn't know about the existence of that footage
this was a main problem I had with the Return. We‚Äôre given the impression time doesn‚Äôt really exist in the Lodge, so he goes in to save Annie, the love of his life who made him believe in love again, but immediately comes out (25 years later in the real world) having forgotten entirely about Annie and now suddenly in love with Diane?

Lynch can do the Lynch thing til the cows come home, I accept the surrealism and even the occasional contrarianism. 

But that just felt like bad writing based on not getting Heather Graham. 

But I don‚Äôt really get that bc in a Lynchian world, they coulda just had another actor play Annie.
It really feels like conceptually that Cooper wasn't supposed to really age, I think that was the whole reason for Kyle's Marvel Body shot. The face is a lot trickier obviously and I think he made the right call by not deaging Kyle.
It would have been a funny little inside gag if Lynch just did a little refresher scene at the beginning showing the moment Cooper sat down and he just immediately ages and then gets back up and then the series starts with him getting zooped to the Firemans place.

? I was under the impression that the box was to capture Judy, with the lack of security and random hormonal young dude being a setup to attract Judy to that realm. Cooper entering the box for a moment just being a side effect of that place being hotspot of black lodge energy or whatever you want to call it. What‚Äôs leading you towards your view on it? Not arguing, just really curious
Can you tell me more about the box? I'm interested
You should be able to watch the missing pieces on YouTube
I got the two week trial membership for the Criterion Collection just to watch The Missing Pieces. But it‚Äôs not necessarily a narrative, it is most definitely the cut scenes from Fire Walk with Me. It definitely deepens the lore and has some characters that were cut from the movie that you‚Äôd expect to be present the week before the Pilot takes place. I can‚Äôt picture what Fire Walk with Me would be like with all of those scenes intact though, The Missing Pieces is still 92 minutes long.
They are all available on YouTube there's a Playlist of them
Definitely watch THE MISSING PIECES. They are cannon  to, and have some ‚Äúanswers‚Äù to questions from, THE RETURN (granted, they‚Äôre the kind of answers that lead to more questions‚Ä¶but those are the best kind).

I think it's the opposite. He knew his conversation with Laura would happen in twenty-five years and seemed surprised when it didn't turn out the same as their dream (The Arm isn't there, and Laura whispered something different to him). I think "What year is this?" could mean a few different things, like how it's 2016 but also 25 years after 1989.

Happy Cake Day!
What year is this?
It was on one of the behind-the-scenes documentaries from the Blu-ray set of the Return, lots of cool stuff in there and it's in a fly-on-the-wall style.
If they could do it with Donna, they could sure as hell do it with Annie.
Time may not exist in the Lodge but there's a heavy implication that knowledge can leak through the veil, in both directions.  It's likely that Cooper knew that Annie was gone when he came out (or, perhaps, she emerged from her coma and moved on with her life without him, like Castaway), along with many other things that had changed.  But he didn't know everything, and perhaps wasn't prepared to reckon with the mortal cost of time's passing.
But didn't they age him for a "future sequence" back in FWWM?
Oh SHIT. What was Lynch trying to say with that one?!?
i think his physical age was effected because mr.c tricked the lodge into thinking coop was still outside the lodge. had coop not snapped out of it, he probably would have decomposed in the waiting room.
So you‚Äôre saying Dougie Jones most likely has a certificate that makes it clear that he does not have Donkey Brains?
The log outranks you. The log's a special agent. Are you a special agent?
That‚Äôs my favorite quote from any television series, ever.
You nusta been top of your class
sharp as a cue ball this one
I think Mr.C knew that Judy and Coop would be hand and hand. Judy comes, does her thing, and then Cooper comes through. If anything I think it was to allow Judy to come through that port, and unleash herself on this realm which would be why things go so weird in The Return because she was out of lodge and in the world. Mr.C was trying to unleash the dark on our world so I could see that as his goal. Both parts to the plan were probably foreseen and intentional!
1. The job was to observe the box. Assumedly they had other people come in so it was watched around the clock. It wasn't just the one guy. There would have to be at least three people per day, and probably some part timers to keep up surveillance. 6 people minimum. Why would the hormones of one of the six people be the point of putting that whole place together?
2. The surveillance has obviously been going on for some time. Years, probably. Maybe decades. The fact they were using video cameras with physical digital media rather than the cloud is telling.

3. The procedure of the place is that no visitors were allowed. The lady snuck in. She wasn't supposed to be there. She wasn't even supposed to be in the foyer.
4. There was security, also around the clock. They didn't really need anything more than the one security guard and the key coded door. They were banking on anonymity to keep other people out. Who knows what happens in every office suite in New York. There was probably security at the front door to the office building, too.
5. The man and woman having sex attracted the random monster thing, which I don't think was Judy. This happened specifically because they violated protocol. It wasn't how things were supposed to go. The observer was supposed to sit, be calm, and watch. If something appeared someone was to be notified. Probably Mr. Todd.
6. BOB mentioned Judy a few times but nothing he did in the Return was specific to capturing her. His main mission was to remain in Cooper's body and to avoid being sent back to the Black Lodge. The doppelganger of the arm, the box, shunting Coop's soul to Dougie (remember that Mr. C sent guys to kill Dougie after Coop's soul inhabited it), his use of the black guys to revive him after being shot, and sending Coop's son to the coordinates in his place were all precautions against this. BOB's primary goal was to remain active in the real world.
7. The good guys (Mike, the Fireman) had some strategies working on their side. Dougie/Coop was saved from assassination because he was bent over to get the Great Northern key in Jade's jeep. They helped Dougie/Coop to win all that money to introduce him to the Mitchum Brothers. They helped him to figure out the insurance fraud to reverse the judgement against the Mitchum Brothers. And they sent the dream about the pie to Bradley so they wouldn't kill Dougie.


To further that, it wasn't coincidence that Coop came back to the material plane right after surveillance of the box shut down.¬†
The glass box was constructed by BOB to catch Cooper should he escape the Red Room. The box is to be watched around the clock, both by people and cameras, and should something appear in it BOB would be notified.¬†


The person watching has to sit quietly and be as emotionless as possible. Strong emotions may attract other beings to the box.


When the two people started getting hot and heavy that is exactly what happened.¬†


Because of that incident, and the subsequent police investigation, no one was watching the box when Coop did pass through.
I have to recommend the fan edit ‚ÄúBlue Rose‚Äù I believe it‚Äôs called. I found it online, could probably figure out a way to send it to you if you wanted. ButI realized early on there wasn‚Äôt a narrative in the Missing Pieces unless they were placed into the feature-length film (the added scenes make it about a 2:40 run time)
All the Twin Peaks extras on that channel are incredible. Great great stuff.

For Carrie Page
Underrated comment
So how far is it to A. C.?
I like to say that the Lodge and related phenomena exist in "The I in 'Jeremy Bearimy'".

![gif](giphy|RMheEO0XU25GmTEuok)
What else is on there?
Yeah, they aged him up in the original run. There was the vision Cooper had is S1 when Laura whispered her killer‚Äôs name into his ear. He was aged up there too. I don‚Äôt believe that Cooper was supposed to stay young 25 years after entering the Lodge. I‚Äôve understood it as Cooper had always been sharp, physically and mentally, while Dougie was an imprecise copy ‚Äì just not up to Dale Cooper standards. That said, time in the Lodge is not the same as time in the real world. Cooper may have felt like he was only in there for a few days; we just don‚Äôt know.
Yeah, I personally took that as a visual for us to show the passage of time that was on the table. I'm probably wrong. it was just my take.
Like milk, too.
They wouldn‚Äôt‚Äôve let him leave the hospital without it
He was gay Gary cooper?
I think this is a very well thought out and fair assessment, we just look at lynches storytelling a lot differently. I tend to assume he wants us to view what we see onscreen and not think too heavy into what‚Äôs going on outside of those moments, so while in the real world there would be shift changes and lots of people working there, he simply wants us to view what we‚Äôre being shown. The older camera lacking internet functionality is for security reasons, remaining disconnected means it can‚Äôt be hacked or otherwise tampered with without easy accountability. The procedure of security is in place strictly to be broken, with Mr.C wanting something devious to happen to attract Judy (in fascinated by your belief that the monster isn‚Äôt Judy, I believe the cooper/diane sex scene in the end is a direct parallel to prove this). The relationship between the man in the room and his fling seems fairly new, I‚Äôm apt to believe it‚Äôs possible she is being directed by Mr.C to make this happen. I agree that BOB‚Äôs main goal is to remain in the real world, however I believe besting Judy is a part of this. I read his desires for a more permanent residence in the real world as an action against Judy‚Äôs directive. There has to be a reason we don‚Äôt see everyone from the lodge doing the same thing, as it truly was not a difficult task for him and he likely would have been easily successful were he to replace someone more random and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù rather than cooper.
I don‚Äôt agree with this interpretation. The box was constructed by Mr. C ‚Äî who is inhabited by and uses the power of BOB but is a separate entity ‚Äî to capture Judy, who is Mr. C‚Äôs ultimate goal. His safeguard to keep Cooper in the Black Lodge involves the ring, not the box.

Obviously part of the beauty of Twin Peaks is the ambiguity and you‚Äôre entitled to your interpretation.
Thank you for the info. When you say BOB constructed it, you're refering to Mr. C I suppose.
That would be amazing I would absolutely watch that.
A lot of fanlore has sprung up around Judy. I don't think Judy has much to do with anything. Judy was mentioned once in FWWM and her name doesn't even come up much in The Return. We don't ever see her. Frost wrote some about her in the Secret History but again not very much.


The creature in the box came from the in-between place that Coop fell through. He landed on that house thing that the woman with no eyes lived in. Assumedly other beings live in that realm too.


Coop appeared in the box as soon as he escaped that realm. If the box didn't exist his soul would have been drawn directly to his body. If the box has been under surveillance maybe Mr. C could have kept him trapped in the box long enough to kill him. Instead Coop just floated there for a little bit then moved on to try to take his body back from BOB.
I agree with you, I don‚Äôt think you can use Mr. C and BOB interchangeably. 

BOB creates Mr. C at the end of season 2 when Cooper enters the Red Room to find Annie, we see it shortly after he deals with Windom Earle and Mr. C begins pursuing Cooper. Cooper is trapped, but Mr. C makes it out in his place and effectively lives as Evil Cooper for 25 years. 

Mr. C definitely harnesses the same evil energy that BOB does, and they are tied together in that way. But they aren‚Äôt the same entity; I mean they defeat BOB separately after they get rid of Mr. C in the return, they definitely seem to be separate entities to me.
Yes indeed!
I made a Twin Peaks arena in WWE 2k24

And then make the Arm and make them a tag team.
I might make one!
James has always been cool.
Made me cackle how good of a setlist that is.
Cooper has a Bret Hart vibe to me so I‚Äôd say the Sharpshooter. Then for Bob, maybe a chokeslam?
I could honestly watch an entire YouTube series of these.  Give me one where Maddy gets to slam Leland through a table.
Never!

The nerve to write this out and then pose like you‚Äôre sad for tiktok. You knew and cursed this baby anyway
"Like her siblings"?!?!?!!! So she knows the risk but clout comes first than her children's wellbeing.
Like her siblings ? So you already gave birth to more children who have the disease? Wow.
This is really fuckin sad all around
I don‚Äôt want to pass down eczema, autism, and being irritated by certain foods. Maybe it‚Äôs better to adopt.
Slaves to an evil nature, it's really sad.
This infuriates me.

10 weeks into pregnancy this can be tested for - well before you start to "show". She could have tested and be certain of a healthy baby or had a preventative abortion.
I think the ‚Äú50/50 percent‚Äù here speaks for itself‚Ä¶
Why did they keep having children!?
I know of somebody I see in town a bunch. As a couple they are both disabled. And have five biological children they can't control that are all also disabled. These people are relatively very young still so no doubt they'll just continue having them.
This kind of stuff is disappointing, to say the least. One of my relatives got his girl pregnant and they were told while she was pregnant the kid had issues with the heart and likely wouldn‚Äôt survive the pregnancy. They decided to ‚Äòput it in gods hands‚Äô and she gave birth early, the kid was messed up, doctors said he probably won‚Äôt make it through the first week, he did and has so many issues and his parents are young, poor, white trash that think god answered their prayers. Meanwhile this kid is suffering and will probably die a horrible suffering death and my whole estranged family is like well he will have had a good life. NO HE DIDNT HE FUCKING SUFFERED EVERY MOMENT OF HIS EXISTENCE. 
I‚Äôm really glad to have found a place where other people not only understand WHY I feel the way I do, but AGREE. How do people not recognize the awfulness of it? How is it a GIFT?
[deleted]
Geez - how can you properly care for multiple children with this syndrome?  I can see 1 child if you didn‚Äôt realize you were a carrier .  Like someone mentioned, a child with disabilities isn‚Äôt an issue and can live a happy fulfilled life with an understanding supportive family but the parents need to be committed to that child‚Äôs needs.
Ah yes, I MUST HAVE biological children even though my genetics suck ass. These people suck.
Holy fuck‚Ä¶ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Fuck how your child's life is gonna be I guess, cause you just want a kid. She wants a kid, she doesn't want to be a parent
You could've completely avoid that risk by simply just adopting but of course, adoption isn't the "same". üòí
Stop. Reproducing. They know their genes are faulty and still want to doom children to this?
Imagine 1. actually doing this, and 2. posting it for internet points. Wow, these people are deranged. They deserve all the misery they've brought on themselves and more.
Ew, this is so staged. Using your belly as a prop so people feel bad for her? 
These parents are so selfish. With everything that's going on in the world, don't ask for sympathy over a choice you knowingly made. And it's a bad choice.
Selfish twat
I'm not even anti natalist and I find this selfish.
What the actual fuck.
This is just cruelty at that point. This is selfish. I think this is the only reason I joined this subreddit cuz that‚Äôs just cruel.
Why not adopt???
"we decided to wait"
If you already knew you carried that specific X syndrome after your first kid. (Because you didn‚Äôt care enough to get tested, to ensure you‚Äôre going to have a healthy kid to begin with.) 
WHY ON EARTH would you continue to have kids? Knowing they‚Äôre going to suffer the same fate? Fucking disgusting!
Is it so f\*cking hard to adopt a child? This is beyond cruel!
My birth mom passed down Lynch Syndrome. This makes certain cancers easier to get. I am in the hospital now. It turns out I had a mass in my colon and near my bladder. I now have a stoma and a colostomy bag. I also had to have a catheter put in. All 4 of our sisters have it. It was just a selfish thing to pass along. I am cancer free now, which is great but I wish it could have been avoided.

Yeah but if she has a disabled child think of all the attention and sympathy she will get! No mind that the child is suffering! That just gets her even more attention and sympathy!
This kid is screwed either way, no fragile x means they‚Äôre getting ignored all the time and need to be strong (not have emotions) because their siblings have it worse, or they have a horrible illness. There‚Äôs no winning for this kid and I already feel bad for him/her.
To the people in the comments eugenetics is VERY pro natalism and eugenetics practises aren't just sterilisation of people but also "positive eugenetics" where people deemed healthy and good were encouraged if not manipulated into breeding. 
The Nazis tricked Scandinavian young healthy, smart, beautiful women into having unhealthy short term relationships with ss members and often had their babies taken away. 

If you are an antinatalist you can't be an eugeneticist BY DEFAULT because you don't want anyone to reproduce you don't have a plan to "better" mankind or your ethnic group, you just think breeding is bad and most likely want anyone to be sterile. 

Antinatalism is also NOT a politically correct philosophy.
Selfish bitch
I mean, I'm sure those with Martin Bell syndrome are lovely, sweet people--but if you're so insistent and determined to care for children and you know this will likely happen, why not adopt a child that doesn't have a loving family?

In no way do I support regulating reproduction, but I just don't understand the logic. It breaks my heart knowing how many already-born children will never have parents </3
fuck this twat and her fuckin husband and her fuckin healthcare providers

wear a fuckin condom, get on the pill, wear an iud, stop fucking. you are repulsive
My genes are ok but i find life in this planet so cursed that  i decided to fuck off and dont bring another slave to this jail called planet earth
Or why not just do a damn genetic testing before even trying for a kid.
Could‚Äôve had amniocentesis and known for 100%,  but why the fuck would you listen to a scientist,  smh
Mothers who keep popping out defective kids need to be... I can't say it or I will probably get banned from reddit. ü§£ Add my own mother to the list.
These people will be like "everyone deserves to live, even if they have a disease" but then keep trying to have a "normal" kid despite already having kids...
Would this be considered as Maunchausen syndrome by proxy?
omg thats horrible why would she do this .
Fuck those people
This is so irresponsible. In her case, the only way she should be allowed to have children is through IVF with preimplantation diagnosis. They would only implant embryos that don't have the gene. What is the excuse for not doing this in this day and age?
Evil.
‚ÄúLike her siblings‚Äù pisses me off to no end
That is horrible and irresponsible of her to do this.
This world is cruel even to those without intellectual disabilities.
If you have two children with Fragile X syndrome then you know the chances aren‚Äôt 50/50 it more likely to be 90/10.
(90 percent more likely they will have it)
I can‚Äôt stand irresponsible people and I don‚Äôt feel an ounce of sympathy for her but I feel so sorry for the child.
And the low IQ award goes to...
I once knew a couple where both the man and the wife had multiple chromosome translocations. BOTH of them. The woman was SO desperate to have children, she went ahead and got pregnant to her husband against genetic counsellors' advice. Please note neither of them had significant issues technically.
The pregnancy was nightmare fuel. The fetus had multiple, MULTIPLE significant chromosome abnormalities. She carried it to full term. Child was not compatible with life, lived five days. SHE knew every step of the way what was likely to happen.
She said next time, they'd go through IVF. I remember everyone around her was horrified when she said that, because  1.We were all medical professionals, and all knew no medical intervention could help produce a healthy baby for that couple.
2. The genetic counsellor reiterated that the two should never get pregnant again.

The absolute worst thing was how that woman manipulated the situation for sympathy. The sob stories were something. (They couldn‚Äôt afford the funeral for the bub, some debacle around baby clothes.) There were many more stories surrounding that couple, and their financial situation. How the frick they were going to afford IVF was anyone's guess. There was a lot of fundraising and collections involving this woman.
I think the thing that got to everyone was the amount of delusion this woman had. It was next level.
Why would she knowingly put her child at risk when she knows there‚Äôs a high chance of her inheriting that?? My little brother suffers from this and I carry the gene. His life is already so hard and he‚Äôs only 7; I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on any children and I won‚Äôt be having any knowing they could also be born with that disability.
When the dick is just that good to gamble with someone‚Äôs life. Breeders are quite disgusting.
Relationships are too fragile.Most won't survive and don't do also if partner doesn't procreate.The delusion never seizes to end.
Why would you do that to a child
Disgusting.
It's not too much to encourage ppl to consider their genetics when weighing the choice to reproduce. I don't think it's ever the most ethical choice to be made, of course. But even for natalists, that's a big factor to take into account.

I do find it distasteful that she's posted as if this is something that's happening *to her.* If this is a planned pregnancy, she knew what she was doing. (That's what it appears to be, given the staged photo.) If not, it's still inappropriate to grieve a child's possible medical challenges in public. Either way, my heart goes out to the child. They don't deserve to be forced to exist at all, let alone to be exploited by their parent for fake internet points.
Selfish AF
Pretty sure most natalists would also consider this selfish and insane.
Gambling addicts be like:
What a selfish pos
*LIKE HER SIBLINGS*?!
I knew a mother who had Marfan Syndrome. She told me about the countless operations she had and how horrible it was. Heart surgery, eyes and ears etc. (And she looked so disfigured) 
50/50 change her child would have it too. 
And lo and behold he did. And of course she had another child. Both of them had numerous surgeries even before they were old enough to go to school. 

I always trie to understand other people‚Äôs reasoning, but with her I just couldn‚Äôt. 
She knew first hand the pain and suffering √°nd the bullying because of the looks. Why would anyone want that for their children?
What a sad fuck. And people like don't die.... they just breed more. Isn't this world truly fucking sad?
Absolutely disgusting. They are no different from gambling addicts except these are much MUCH worse.
Garbage humans.
Disgusting.
She could have had a sperm doner but instead she wants to curse her children

Bro at that point just go all in on blackjack if you think 50/50 chance are good chances to win lmao
Shocked that they have the time to have more kids when they have multiple kids with disability already. I hope those kids are getting the love and attention they need despite their parents desperately trying to have a "normal" one.
this is honestly sick and evil
This makes me so angry I don‚Äôt even know what to say.
Taking a gamble with someone‚Äôs life like this is insane. These sickos think this is a flex or something. Like, this isn‚Äôt a gacha game bro üíÄ
Idk why this sub keeps getting pushed to me as i disagree with a lot of the sentiment here but this sort of abhorrent behaviour is the kind of thing i am totally against. Playing games of chances does no one any good whatsoever
How is this not cruelty?
People in this sub keep seeing these kinds of posts because they interact with them more thanks to the algorithm. why do you do it to yourselves? I used to use twitter before musk happened and I eventually stopped because it made me so angry and sad. Now it‚Äôs filled with the most inhumane shit imaginable I would never go back lmao
Awful. I keep circling back here because I‚Äôve got Joubert/VUS, very symptomatic. Sterilization is a gift. I‚Äôd never force my severely disabled existence on children. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôm not *that* much of a narcissist. Lots of problems but not that one. There‚Äôs plenty of kids without reliable adults. I can volunteer at the pediatric hospitals or become a foster care-approved babysitter. I don‚Äôt have the energy for babies but I like telling kids about dinosaurs. Why create new ones when there‚Äôs lots already?
I had to look this up and you can get this test done before birth. Why wouldn't someone do that? Why wait? Wouldn't someone want to know, the sooner the better to prepare for it? God I'm so glad I'm not havibg kids. I don't have to worry about this stuff (side note, I'm tired of mommy influencers. Yours kids are people, not props).
Looked it up, and there are worst conditions out there.  But it does seem shortsighted to keep having kids if you know there's a good chance they'll end up with a severe case.  Especially if this is in America where there aren't really a lot of resources to help people.  What's going to happen to her kids when their parents die?
but im selfish for not wanting kids‚Ä¶..

oh. okay.
Sterilize her. Srsly she is sick. Kids should be taken away by cps.
It would be just as bad if she had a 0% chance.
The story repeats
Yeah this just is so fucking insane to me 
Why would you do this‚Ä¶. What‚Ä¶
So... what happened?

Did they win or lose the coin flip?
I hope this little girl will be one of those lucky ones with mild symptoms is she has it. What a terrible parents.
I‚Äôve never seen this group or heard of the term until Googling it now.

For myself, I now am completely against having bio kids of my own. I (30) learned I was autistic this year & just started having suspected autoimmune flares 35-40 days ago. I‚Äôd never subject a child to the misery I‚Äôve been feeling for 1.5 months. Both my mom & dad are littered with health shit & I‚Äôve recently grown angry. I haven‚Äôt had a choice in being here. This influencer makes me upset for her children.

Side bar: an ex and I fostered from 2019-2021 and it broke my heart and soul. Don‚Äôt regret it, but I don‚Äôt have it in me again to try again. Especially not on my own. Totally content being child-free.
I usually don't agree with this subreddit but that's fucking awful, average IQ of 55!?!!
Yet it's eugenics to say that it's a horrible and selfish thing to knowingly bring children into the world with terrible shit like this üôÑ
But in her warped mind bringing a human into existence is selfLESS, no matter what their quality of life may be. Not saying I agree but it‚Äôs easy to understand her retarded point of view
My brother in law has fragile x syndrom. And he‚Äòs a happy guy, no suffering whatsoever.

Not saying this isn‚Äòt selfish. You shouldn‚Äòt roll the dice on the health of a child.
Her daughter didn‚Äôt have it. Females are largely unaffected by fragile x because they have two X chromosomes while males have XY. They are carriers, though. Her first is a girl and her second is a male who has fragile x and is symptomatic. The third is a female who is clear. Just in case anyone wanted an update.
You people are so sad‚Ä¶ my God‚Ä¶
I think I heard somewhere that testing the fetus could result in a miscarriage. Maybe she was afraid?
Can someone explain
I fucking love this

I got this subreddit randomly recommended to me by reddit and this is just plain funny at how you react to a person simply choosing to not give birth

A fucker in some random ass place is choosing to kill his child in case they have autism, so fucking what? Theyre just a nobody you never knew until now and have no right to boss what they do

And to the kids who have autism here

Did you fucking get a prompt to be born with autism? No, bitch if you fucking knew you wouldnt have it
You people act like the child‚Äôs life doesn‚Äôt have value if they have this syndrome. What the fuck is wrong with you people?
Oh is this a eugenics subreddit?

Because that‚Äôs not very cash money

People with fragile x can be really great people. They can enjoy their lives a lot

Why the fuck are all of you upset that this person decided to raise not one but two?

The fuck is wrong with y‚Äôall
I just want to point out that if you agree with op, you support eugenics.
Y‚Äôall are skirting dangerously close to eugenics with this one. Disabled people deserve to exist
Why are you all eugenicists? I agree that this person should have tested genetics before to prepare but come on. Saying shit like disabled people shouldn't be allowed to reproduce is just echoing Nazi talking points, Jesus Christ.
I am torn on this one to be honest. 
Because on the one hand, I am all for suffering babies, but on the other hand, I am not sure how I feel about a woman having a opinion. 
Tough call.
She‚Äôs like 8 months pregnant do y‚Äôall really expect her to ‚Äúterminate‚Äù that late
Lol some of these comments. As someone with a child who had special needs, his life isn‚Äôt less worthy than yours or any ‚Äúnormal‚Äù human. And he was the best thing that happened to his siblings so to tell a parent they‚Äôre selfish to bring a child into this world is pathetic.

I love eugenics
Question: In America, do Antinatalists vote democrat or Republican?
It depend...if the family know the children got those issues after the baby got formed then we cant blame them

Yah yah I know not the group to put this on. Did anyone even look up this "horrible" disease? It's an intellectual disease; anxiety, social awkwardness, maybe some word repeating or repetitive body motions. At worst mild stomach issues, flat feet, lazy eye and big ears/forward. Probably what Forrest Gump had. Not a reason to never have kids but maybe just one is a better idea if you end up knowing they have Fragile X. I'm not AN but I think this needs to be looked up before calling it painful/horrible.
It's her body, her choice. How is she being selfish?

EDIT: Obviously, I'm going to get downvoted by extremists. You guys are clearly not pro-choice at all. Having children isn't selfish in the same way that not having isn't selfish, but to attack an individual woman for her own personal choices is just a mob mentality at this point.
Why can‚Äôt disabled people have a good, happy life?
Just because her children are disabled or may be at risk of having a disability doesn't mean that these children are less valuable, just because you guys don't want children, it doesn't mean you can call others "Selfish" for wanting to keep their children, since it's her body and choice, right?
Hey OP: Fuck you
Most of the people criticizing this mom will never contribute close to as much as this baby will end up contributing. Nor have they made any effort to understand this story from any other point of view than their own.  People who post on this subreddit are just mad that they've come to the realization they add no real value to the world and are incredibly jaded about life.
Ah, eugenics posting again.
Why are people calling her selfish? Because she doesnt want to abort or because she is posting this on Tiktok?
[removed]
Let's not forget family services tend to come after you because they think the parents are disabled And they really over scrutinize your life.
She doesn‚Äôt care because she‚Äôs doing it for content, and she‚Äôll get financial help for them being disabled as well as people watching. She‚Äôll be making money both ways and she seems like a mom that likes this kind of attention (I forgot what the word for it is, but I‚Äôve heard of moms who like attention for things like illnesses and such on true crime shows). Her last post is her begging followers to tag scrub daddy so she can ‚Äúthank him‚Äù aka so they‚Äôll reach out and send her free stuff lol. You don‚Äôt need people to tag the owner of scrub daddy just to thank him‚Ä¶you can tag him yourself and thank him. Lol. She‚Äôs in this for the free stuff and publicity sadly.
I had a family member like this. She had four kids and the fourth was born with a heart defect he had to have like 5 surgeries and a pacemaker to correct. They were told the chance of another baby being born with the same defect were super likely, but had a fifth anyways. She was born with the same defect and a rare genetic disease she'll live with the rest of her life. She's had countless surgeries and still lives in the hospital half the time. I can't imagine how little attention the other four kids get and how hard it is on them. It pisses me off so much.
while wearing a shitty surgical mask that provides zero covid protection‚Ä¶ just what the baby needs when she‚Äôs born‚ÄîCovid!
So it‚Äôs ok to kill over a ‚ÄòChance‚Äô of having something bad?

So anybody who has Down syndrome in their family genetics should never be allowed to have kids because there is a chance of having a debilitating illness?

Same with any illness out there.  Autism, Crohns, Diabetes, MS, you think it‚Äôs ok to murder because there is a chance to be born with it?

Eugenics isn‚Äôt a good thing!
People can have a fulfilling life with Fragile X though, right? The world should be more accommodating to people with disabilities, not creating some wierd eugenics argument to stop them from being born...
I think those who upvote this kind of posts and make them likely to appear on the top of this subreddit really need to think about the consequence. Antinatalism is suffering a huge amount of reputational damage because of this stupid subreddit which doesn't seem to care about the responsibility that comes with the name "r/antinatalism."
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome

Just wanted to point out that FXS tends to affect girls a lot less than guys due to them having a "backup" X chromosome. In fact, female patients generally have close to standard IQs and many display no intellectual disabilities at all. Premature menopause and seizures are possible, but statistically pretty rare.
Not just any pose, this bitch is sat like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh
That is what does it for me, the pose. This is not a candid moment captured, she sat there and asked the Dad to take this shot just so she could post it, probably reviewed it and took multiple versions too.
The fact that she is posting on tic tok like this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. like set the camera up SOMETHING LIKE THIS ABOUT YOUR CHILD
I can‚Äôt. 
I swear ppl would have dramatic experiences on purpose like this for content 
This person makes me want to rip my hair out for multiple reasons..
Should be considered child abuse. Absolutely sickening
I think she‚Äôs supposed to be praying. In the video the next shot is her baby being born healthy and escaping the equally likely yet hellish fate awaiting her. It also has Christian music overlaid on the video. Implying that her prayers worked and god spared her child. Which like‚Ä¶guess god said fuck her other kids every other time?
[deleted]
How do you know there was genetic testing done before pregnancy? What do you suggest should be done differently?
Exactly what I came to the comments to write
I was proud to see that amongst all the sympathy messages that she probably so desperately craved, there were a lot calling her selfish!
The EFF.
She has 4 kids and 2 of them have fragile X syndrome
She has 4 children and 2 of them have fragile X syndrome but despite that, she still decided to have more kids ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The mother carries one mutated X chromosome and one regular one, so she's spared from the disease.

However, obv, she has a 50 50 chance of passing on either X Chromosome.

Now, here's the spicy part: The father must be afflicted by the disease. Otherwise, his daughters would be fine, even if they received a mutated X chromosome from their mother.

50% Chance for a daughter, who then has a 50% chance to get the 2nd faulty X chromosome from her mother, so 25% chance.

50% chance for a son, who only gets one X chromosome from his mother.

That means the only outcome where a child would be healthy, given the genes of these parents, is if it's a daughter and she is lucky enough to receive the healthy X-Chromosome from her mother. 

That's 1 in 4 or, in other words, only 25% chance for a child without the disease (though even these daughters carry one mutated X-Chromosome and thus can pass it on).

That means the Father must be somewhat affected by the disease, which means mental retardant to some degree and possibly autism.

And since it's a genetic disease, it tends to appear more often in certain families.

Sweet home, Alabama!
I don‚Äôt think they will mind, it says fragile X syndrome comes with intellectual disability
[deleted]
Everyone in my family has pretty bad OCD, including me. I also have autism, severe eczema and several other allergies. Why in the hell would I want to pass that on? It was hell having all these things as a little kid, especially the OCD. I plan on adopting as well.
Seriously.  I have bad teeth, bad arches, high testosterone  and had a wacky case of eczema and fifty food intolerances.  No way I am having kids.
Same, I've got autism as well as eye issues, while these aren't big problems for me I'm mature enough to understand that my genes aren't the healthiest for a child to inherit. Seems like a lack of regulated breeding has led to health issues becoming more and more abundant, guess that's what happens when natural selection doesn't apply to a species anymore.
Don‚Äôt forget generational trauma!
can autism be passed down?
I‚Äôm autistic as well and I think we need more positive autistic representation tbh. I personally wouldn‚Äôt have kids tho because I would be overwhelmed and have little maternal instincts. 

I know a lot of autistic individuals relatives and friends who are incredibly intelligent but lack confidence or motivation in entering fields that allow them to utilize their potential. I wish there‚Äôs more support and wider understanding to it.
what‚Äôs wrong with autism? i feel like it‚Äôs an advantage?
Unless you live in a place where abortion is illegal. 10 weeks is too late in many US states at least.
Maternal carrier screening can detect the number of triplicate repeats in mom, which can provide a risk assessment. A NIPT tests for many things but not for fetal presence of Fragile X. 

There are diagnostic tests such as CVS from 11-13 weeks or amniocentesis at >15 weeks, but these are invasive tests and unfortunately a lot of patients decline them due to the risk of fetal malformation or loss.
She doesn‚Äôt give a shit and probably wanted a disability baby for content.
apparently she didn‚Äôt even know she was a carrier for it and that her first kid had it until she was pregnant with the second kid and then got them all tested
I doubt she‚Äôd ever abort. The song on this TikTok she posted was a Christian worship  song.
[deleted]
That's just eugenics.
She has 4 children and before this, she already had 2 kids who had this syndrome but still decided to have another kid despite the fact that there was a huge possibility that her baby would have to suffer for the rest of her life. And most of the commenters were acting like this is the example of a mother's true and unconditional love like what? This isn‚Äôt love at all.
Sympathy + view count

Possible monetization as well
Especially when she already had 2 kids who have this syndrome but still went on to have 4 kids.
I'm sure their kids will grow up to be stable, well behaved and responsible adults lol.
Should probably have sterilised them
I've been ranting for years how poisonous religion is and many want to know why I'm so "bitter". Well it's because the worst sht I've ever seen go down has come from the people who think the world is only 10,000 years old and all our problems started with a woman being tempted by a talking snake. You can't expect anything rational from them.
It‚Äôs worse when it‚Äôs government mandated instead of a personal family choice!

Right now a Texas a woman wants to terminate a wanted pregnancy because the baby will be born with a terminal condition that will cause him to suffer and die. But because Texas is the land of Freedom, so long as you are a white male, they will tie her up in Supreme Court cases until she‚Äôs forced to deliver a non-viable life, suffer the trauma of childbirth for no reason, and prolong the suffering of her child and mourning period. If anything, if it were me, this fight would make me reconsider trying for another child! It‚Äôs the exact opposite the government wants!

I hope the reason she didn‚Äôt just skip the state and abort somewhere else was to ensure the case got the publicity it needs, but at this point, some states are so entrenched in their prejudice and high off their ‚Äúvictory‚Äù that I don‚Äôt know what will turn the tide.
Wait or they'll call you a Nazi.
And that‚Äôs you. I have it and my life outlook is completely different than yours.
[deleted]
Not this disability. Most of them aren‚Äôt even conscious of their own existence, and those that are want to die. I‚Äôve done my research.
Fr especially when the woman in the picture already had 2 children with this syndrome but still decided to risk it. This is not love at all.
Disabled people are inferior? That's the hill you want to die on?
They wouldn't adopt a disabled child but instead prefer to create one ü§°
Could IVF have removed this gene?
You'd think they'd be keen.
Any sibling here ends up a caregiver-not a fair start.
Adoption isn't as easy as giving birth in the US.
It cost thousands of dollars and many years if you even qualify.
They make too much money hoarding kids to make it easy for anyone.
But clout. What about clout? So sickening
She acts like she‚Äôs worried when in reality, she already had 2 children with this syndrome but still decided to have another child(who luckily didn‚Äôt have this syndrome) because she needed to have 4 children despite the fact that there was a huge possibility they would suffer for the rest of their lives. And people call this love?
It wasn‚Äôt just her 1st kid, she had TWO kids with this syndrome but still went on to have more kids despite knowing that there‚Äôs a good possibility another innocent life will have to live their lives in misery and suffering.
Fr especially when she already had 2 kids with this syndrome but apparently that wasn‚Äôt enough for her since she went on to have 2 more despite the fact that there was a huge risk that they would have to suffer for the rest of their lives like their siblings. Like one of the commenters said, how could you do that to an innocent life? That‚Äôs so cruel.
Horrible injustice has been done to you. I'm really sorry, congrats on beating cancer despite everything.
The baby she was talking about in the video actually doesn‚Äôt have the syndrome. However, 2 of her siblings do and yet the mother still decided to have another baby and risk it despite the fact that two of her children already have a syndrome that will cause them immense suffering for the rest of their lives. She legit has 4 children, FOUR even though she fully knew that there was a good possibility that they would suffer for the rest of their lives, especially when she already had 2 children that are disabled. That‚Äôs so inhumane.
It‚Äôs even worse when you find out that she has 4 children and 2 of them have this syndrome and she still decided to have another baby despite that.
The baby is a girl and she luckily doesn‚Äôt have the syndrome but 2 of her 3 siblings have it. And the children with the syndrome were born before the 4th one which is the baby girl and yet the mother still decided to risk it
They‚Äôre way too dumb and uneducated to ever understand that. We‚Äôre wasting our breath.
Because she doesn‚Äôt care
Agree and same
No, but we need to come up with a word for this! Parents that are willingly spreading their diseased genes, and sentencing their children to a horrible life of suffering.
No
Especially when she already had 3 children before this one and 2 of those children have this syndrome. It‚Äôs so cruel.
All the insanity aside, the fact that they couldn‚Äôt afford a funeral??? What is wrong with these people!!! How on earth did they think that they can afford having a child that cost of fortune over 18 years???
This!!! I despise the comments that are like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù. Really?????
Relationships could last if the people getting into them were mature, kind, and healthy--- but most people aren't those things. Then they think it's a good idea to bring kids into their mess. That's why the world sucks.
They never do. Everyone in my extended family should have been screened for the genetic disease I have, but none of them have bothered. Heaps on people on dad's side carry the gene. We have numerous relatives in the UK with my disease. They have seen me suffer, but they just pop out babies without a care in the world.
Right. Luckily the baby in question is the youngest one and she doesn‚Äôt have this syndrome but two of her three siblings have it. And the woman still decided to risk it. She knows fully well what she‚Äôs doing and how she could be responsible for another one of her kids suffering. She has no empathy.
You would be surprised to find out that they call us eugenics
Yep ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 2 of her children have it but she still decided to have two more children despite the risk.
The world would be better if your mom swallowed, but here we are
They don‚Äôt just need love and attention, they‚Äôre special needs require 24/7 care. These children need help eating, they will never be able to cook for themselves, they require help bathing properly, brushing their teeth properly, they will need a speech therapist, they will need physical therapy because they tend to have severe muscle loss they need special education, andteachers that know how to handle children like this‚Ä¶ The list goes on
It gets worse when you realize that before this one, they already had a ‚Äònormal‚Äô one. 2 of her children have it, her 3rd one doesn‚Äôt and the baby she‚Äôs talking about in the pic is the 4th one and she luckily doesn‚Äôt have it but why would you risk it despite knowing that 2 of your children already have it and will most likely suffer for the rest of their lives??
Can you explain what the syndrome details for future scrollers.
It can. The test (amniocentesis) has like a 1/500 chance of causing miscarriage. We were offered one because my baby had markings of DS but the risk of them having it was like 1/50,000 so we declined because it wasn‚Äôt worth the risk of miscarrying.
....what?
Are you insulting ANTI-NATILISTS or natalists????
I think you misunderstood the post‚Ä¶you are supporting antinatalism.
The group is full of eugenics supporters
Eugenetics is natalist ü§°
Yes, let‚Äôs create a brand new person from scratch, where there was none before, and sentenced them to a life of horrible suffering!! Where they need 24/7 care to even brush their teeth, where they will never fall in love, where they cannot even properly communicate their feelings in emotion, Yes, that sounds like a great idea!! They need help showering, they need help wiping their butts, they need help eating, but definitely great idea!! Never stop anything like this if you can! Just keep it going, especially knowing there is a high chance that your child will be born like this, still have it! Instead of adopting!! Do not adopt!! You are mindless. We have a problem because of people like you. Beyond sad.
WAS LOOKING FOR THIS COMMENT, THANK YOU.
Oh yeah, there's plenty if folks here who would tell them to "abort" the siblings.

No, no, no sorry that's insane. They just think it's cruel not to sterilize them. Very humane.
I'm disabled and I exist. It isn't that I believe they shouldn't be allowed to live, it's to protect them from the pain of disabilities.
Nobody said they didn‚Äôt deserve to exist. It‚Äôs not eugenics to not want a disabled child.
Who the hell said that??? We‚Äôre saying that if you know you‚Äôre about to bring a child that will suffer tremendously from a lifelong disability, you should prevent that.
Also, eugenics are natalists! They just want a very specific group of people to be the ones that reproduce! We don‚Äôt want anybody to reproduce. But situations like these are especially worse.
Where the hell did anybody talk about termination?? We‚Äôre talking about how horrible and selfish she is to purposefully inflict this on a child.

They did know ahead! After one child is born like that, you have another, and that one is born like that, and then you have another, and they tell you that there‚Äôs a very high chance of that one to be born like that, too!!
Why would you knowingly create babies that would get a disease that only cause it suffering?
No, it‚Äôs not! It has varying degrees of severity, and most cases cannot function in society on their own. you do not know what you‚Äôre going to get! And they‚Äôre willing to gamble with somebody else‚Äôs life
It‚Äôs basically autism. They wanted to test my oldest for it after they were diagnosed with autism. The dr told us ‚Äúif you have fragile x, you have autism, but you can have autism without having fragile x. It‚Äôs one of the newly found genetic links that is testable‚Äù
Cause it's a child that will have their whole life affected by her selfish actions.
They can, but bring them into the world knowing there is a high chance they would be affected is cruel
It‚Äôs selfish to sentence someone to a life of suffering!! It‚Äôs criminal!
I was looking it up and fragile x can cause disabilities but doesn‚Äôt necessarily affect quality of life. Esp for females with the disease- about 70% experience mild to no learning/intellectual disability. Regardless, intellectual disability doesn‚Äôt automatically equal a miserable life. Especially in a case like this where the parent is aware of the specific care a child might need and assumedly has the resources to provide that care, I don‚Äôt see why it would be cruel to keep the child. 

Like, I‚Äôm not sure I like the idea of continuing to have bio kids rather than adopting if you know you‚Äôre a carrier, but I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúif your baby will be disabled you should absolutely abort it and it‚Äôs selfish not to‚Äù is like‚Ä¶. Not the best take. It‚Äôs not that black and white. And it makes it sound like disabled people don‚Äôt deserve to be born.

The comment is deleted now but someone commented on another user explaining that though his brother in law with fragile x is intellectually disabled, he is still living a full and happy life. The response was essentially ‚Äúthat‚Äôs great but he‚Äôs a burden to the people around him.‚Äù Like wow we‚Äôre just veering into eugenics huh?
Because she choose to get pregnant knowing the risk
fragile x syndome can be tested for at 10 weeks. rather than know in advance, and make an informed decision such as aborting OR planning supports for the baby, she waited until the baby was born. This means getting supports is harder for the baby, and also shows a lack of caring regarding the health of her child

You‚Äôre exactly right.
Without proper context this statement is pretty funny.
*(Classic Eeyore voice)*: ‚ÄúThanks for noticing me‚Ä¶‚Äù
You should look up "free birthing", pregnancies and deliveries without any medical care. They usually only have a non-certified midwife/doula, even when the birth goes catastrophically wrong they do not seek medical care. The ones who do usually do it too late and are then ostracized from the free birthing community.
  Like one lady, her water broke in the birthing pool and it was brown meaning it had meconium(fetus has a bowel movement) in it. This is an emergency situation. She sat in that nasty water and labored for 3 DAYS, her fetus did not survive. There are many many many more stories like this. They are more worried about the "experience of free birthing" than the outcome of said pregnancy and labor.
And that's the thing about these fanatics. They're just blindly adhering to (as far as they're concerned) an arbitrary set of rules because it's much easier to sacrifice thinking for yourself and still BE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME!  

 Because even when you're WRONG, you're still RIGHT! How, u ask? It's simple!

 It's God's will. IT'S GOD'S WILL! *God's* will. Because it's God's WILL. God's willllll. Yup, evvvvvvverything is God's will. Everything that ever happens is exactly right because it's God's will. IT'S GOD'S WILL, DUMMY! 

And no, we're not meant to understand it. Why? Because it's *God's* will. And he's always right. So we're always right. 


Sorry guys, you can't argue with a crazy person.
What exactly in this comment is a ‚Äúnazi talking point‚Äù? Saying they cursed their baby with a debilitating genetic mutation? What‚Äôs next, praying for a healthy baby is ableist?
Glad to hear that. People are waking up.
Where is this page of people calling her selfish I must contribute
You can spin it the other way - being selfish by having your fetus tested and not having to shoulder a burden. In Denmark the number of kids with the Down syndrome being born is at an all time low for number of years now due to mass testing when necessary.
Shit maybe there is hope
She's already done this 4 times, she has two healthy children, wtf is she doing?? My bf has a 50/50 chance of passing on a rare but not disabling eye condition, and all down the generations it is literally half of the children. Science doesn't screw around. Screw her, though.
Pardon my ignorance but mental retardant is not what we call it where I'm from and intellectual disabilities are very different from the neruoatypical disorder of ASD. An autistic person can be very smart or have MLD, so how would it effect both and not effect other neruoatypical disorders such as ADHD?
Having a child you KNOW will be born with a life altering disability where the child will be in permanent discomfort, pain, or inability to move is FUCKING SELFISH. You can cry ‚Äúableist‚Äù all you want. this woman knew this would happen.
[deleted]
expanding human suffering that didnt exist before... is definitely not antj anti nazi position. As someone with a severe disability and a parent no parent should ever make the choice to thrust a life like that on their unborn
I'd bet my last dollar you're self diagnosed autism. Y'all are the only ones that talk like that and absolutely ignore the utter suffering we go through daily and how selfish it is to willingly and knowingly risk forcing that on another soul. ('we' being those who actually do have autism).

GTFO with that crap.
Eugenics isn't really a bad thing, and it's something that people naturally do throughout the dating process (whether knowingly or not)... It becomes a, potentially, bad thing when it's a state enforced program.

I don't want a government telling me who can or can't have children, or what children are permitted to be born... but I'm not sure I trust people to make responsible decisions either. I'm not sure I trust a political committee to make those decisions either. Very conflicting.
Nazis also valued family values and community, are we to group everything with nazis because they agreed with it? Id like disabled people to be euthanized, but that doesn‚Äôt make me a nazi.
Is OCD‚Ä¶ genetic?
What‚Äôs wrong with high testosterone?
>Seems like a lack of regulated breeding has led to health issues becoming more and more abundant

You think the government that was just controlled by Donald Trump should decide who can give birth, who will have abortions forced on them, and who is "worthy" of reproducing?!
Just because you are a loser doesn't mean eugenics should become a thing in any functional, progressive society.
Natural selection is an incredibly undiscerning force. The only way natural selection actually removes anything from the gene pool is if it inhibits reproduction and/or survival to a reproductive age. Beyond that, it doesn‚Äôt give two shits about quality of life.
Autism is highly heritable: It is estimated at least 50% of genetic risk is predicted by common genetic variation and another 15-20% is due to spontaneous mutations or predictable inheritance patterns. The remaining genetic risk is yet to be determined.

 https://www.uclahealth.org/news/new-genetic-clues-uncovered-largest-study-families-with#:~:text=Autism%20is%20highly%20heritable%3A%20It,mutations%20or%20predictable%20inheritance%20patterns.
It's highly genetic.  These days a lot of people with mild autism who may have gone undiagnosed are having children together because they meet online due to shared interests.  Then their kids have more severe autism.

A former friend of mine had an autistic son and I kept wondering where that came from, and it hit me that her mother was almost certainly autistic. Schizophrenia also runs in her family, and this is not the first time I have seen the autism/schizophrenia cluster in one family.

But of course none of them ever stop to think about any of these things before bringing more children into the world.
it is genetic, it‚Äôs just there‚Äôs like hundreds of genes that work together to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù autism so it‚Äôs hard to track which ones specifically are hereditary or not
The advantages are not that useful.
Advantage on what? Lol wtf
Agreed, autism actually has many advantages not many people are aware of. Highly sensitive to detail, creative, faster pattern recognition and visual thinking, etc. I think this world needs more autistic people and wider understanding of what it is and how to support neurological differences often misunderstood.
What a fucked up country.
You can travel to get an abortion. She doesn‚Äôt strike me as the kind of person that was forced into having a third child. So she did this consciously and willingly. If she doesn‚Äôt have the money to travel to get an abortion, she should not be having a third baby! It‚Äôs that simple.
in this case the mother already knows she carries it.
but this is kid 3???
Having an abortion because a group of cells will grow into a person who suffers their entire life is not ‚Äúnazi shit‚Äù it‚Äôs preventing paid and suffering. You‚Äôre also diminishing all the messed up stuff that happened to all the kids that were used like lab rats too, your gross dramatization of comparing the 2 makes me think you don‚Äôt actually know how horrible the nazi regime was, and that‚Äôs concerning.
Those of us who are disabled who wish we weren't born.... I guess we don't matter :D


Us not existing means we're nothing. 
Us existing means there is gonna be some suffering (even if there is good as well). 


Sounds like you want more of us to suffer.
Yes, yes we absolutely should
If she wasn't interested in knowing whether or not the baby had fragile x, and didn't care, she wouldn't have tested after the baby was born either, and wouldn't have posted about it.

Since she has an investment in the outcome, she should have found out in time to use that information for the baby's good, or to abort.
Yeah, they are clearly doing it for attention and money
4 kids!?
[deleted]
I'm sorry for being blunt, but this is an extremely shitty take. Forced sterilization is WRONG, full stop. It has been used by men in power time and time again to exert control over different groups of people (typically women). Giving any government or institution that type of power over someone's body, male or female,  without their informed consent is dangerous and disgusting... I understand that people don't need to have children they aren't equipped to raise, and that does include some disabled people, but forced sterilization is not a valid solution.
[deleted]
Woah hold on... you know who also thought disabled people should be sterilized? Nazis! No one should have any medical procedure done without their consent!
Yeah, I have to stop looking for logic where it never existed. üòÇ I guess sometimes I HOPE that somewhere inside all that brainwashing there is a person with rational thinking. But there rarely is. üòû
I‚Äôm with you on every single point! And I‚Äôm so sorry that this is happening in your family! I know how traumatic that can be to you, even if you are not the person that‚Äôs directly involved, being around that and seeing that kind of suffering and pain is horrible
Oh I know. Been following. I used to live in Texas. Never would again. NEVER.
Fine but morally you don't have a right to inflict it onto someone else and just hope they have your outlook.
To paraphrase: And that's you. Hitler was right: disabled people should just die. Round them up and sterilize them all, they shouldn't be alive anyway."

Please please please for the love of whatever you jokd dear, unpack your ableism! And get rid of Nazi sympathies
Who is saying the kids she has should die?? No one. People are saying that it‚Äôs wrong for her to knowingly bring more kids in this world that she knows will likely suffer a LOT. Obviously living disabled people should not die but it‚Äôs pretty fucked up to bring that upon someone
Nazis also enjoys ocktober fest, is yhat nazi shit?
So you're going to pass on a genetic disease to your kids? That's the hill you want to die on? Bitch I have autoimmune diseases and genetic defects guess who doesn't have kids. Bet you didn't take a moment to consider that now did you?
No but their genetic mutation causing the disability is. ü§∑
I think they probably would‚Äôve been able to choose a more viable embryo that tested negative Genetic disorders. But clearly, they don‚Äôt have that kind of money. However, they think they have enough money to raise three children into adulthood! You can‚Äôt teach stupid.

Edit: *3 children with severe disabilities!! That require physical therapy, special education, speech therapy if they can even speak, etc etc
She knew and she did it anyway and wants social media likes. Her and her partner are sad.
Exactly. She chose to.
I will never understand people like this. Why would they want to make more people suffer?
Thank you! Yeah my sister and I were like she didn't give us anything besides cancer. She had 4 daughters and had us adopted. Lucky to nice families but she was really irresponsible.
The good ole "but love is all they need" from parents. Like no, mam. I don't need love. I need sh-t tons of money for my medical care, I need a world that actually helps disabled people and I need a good hospital system. I also need a normal f-cking life span too instead of being dead by 50 and propped up with spare parts.
She and her husband moved away and lost contact with everyone. (How they afforded to do that, I'm not sure?)
I feel like there was a tonne of scamming happening, because they disappeared of the face of the earth, and there were rumours they were being charged for some sort of benefit fraud. It was a dodgey setup. Apparently, the husband was claiming some sort of benefit and selling drugs on the side.
Their genetic problems and the baby was real though, but man, was she good at getting out the violin.
Don't get me wrong, the whole situation was a tragedy, but that sick feeling you get when you feel you're being taken advantage of? Was always present when she started up with the "poor me" act.
I remember how upset an acquaintance and chief fundraiser was when she found out about the benefit fraud.
Every time I think about that situation, I feel skeevey.
It‚Äôs a classic case of people talking on something they don‚Äôt know anything about. They don‚Äôt know how horrible the seizures are and how much it messes up brain development. And that‚Äôs only one of the horrible symptoms
Yes, that was implied in what I was saying.
His intelligence level is roughly like that of a 7 year old. He can‚Äòt read or calculate. He recognizes some words like his name or his favorite football club. He knows small numbers. So i can ask him to bring 3 beers for example.

He can‚Äòt express feelings that well. One of our cats died. He had a deep relationship with it. He went on for months just saying ‚Äöchilly died‚Äò over and over again. But no tears or verbal expression of his feelings. 

And he‚Äòs a copycat. I‚Äòm his best friend and he just copies most things i do. Even a simple cough. If i cough a lot, he starts doing it aswell. But also potentially dangerous things like taking drugs. He now lives in a special kind of dormitory and some of his neighbors have to take drugs. He then started taking random drugs from our home pharmacy at night. He took some antidepressants for example. Now we have to lock it all away if he‚Äòa staying for a night. 

But he‚Äòs a really happy and easy to handle guy. I have lots of fun with him talking about football and cars or listening to his favorite music together.
Does it make a difference????

Who the fuck cares, and who the fuck knows
So fucking what

I cant be both?

I cant be in the middle ground?

Cant i just not care?

Im saying let them do what u want but im not gonna advertise baby death
Idk man, the ones who support forced sterilization are copying right from the eugenics handbook.
When a person inflict suffering upon another, what do you do? You imprison them! Who will speak out for these innocents? That are subjected to a life of suffering because of the selfishness of one person. Who speaks for them??? Where is the justice for them??? What are you even doing here you mindless twat?!
I‚Äôm also disabled, and yeah that‚Äôs thinly veiled eugenics.
Ofc not. But people here are shaming a mom for the opposite.
They try so hard to distort the point being made in posts like this üòÇ

It's not about "superior genes", it's about having a kid KNOWING that they could have a high chance of inheriting a *debilitating and painful* disease/disorder from you

That's why it's in an anti-natalist sub
You sure? All we got is a short video and that it

We dont know if that family know their child disability after the baby got formed or not
[deleted]
I'm disabled myself and I am glad I get to live my life. Is it hard? Sure. But with the right provisions and help I excel in life and live in ease. There is specialist and medical support for people born with disabilities or have a disability later on in life.


Anyone can be or become disabled, you don't have to be born with a disability and you don't have to be old either.
X Syndrome isn't as bad as other disabilities, they can lead a normal life as long as they get the right help. Honestly, I don't think you care about that child's suffering, you just want to further your own agenda.
>if your baby will be disabled you should absolutely abort it and it‚Äôs selfish not to‚Äù is like‚Ä¶. Not the best take. It‚Äôs not that black and white. And it makes it sound like disabled people don‚Äôt deserve to be born.

Yeah that's the issue I have with this take. Its inherently ableist. Its the difference between having an abortion because you don't want kids vs having an abortion because you specifically don't want disabled kids. The latter is problematic imo
A lot of insurance won‚Äôt cover that testing and it‚Äôs expensive. 

Fragile x isn‚Äôt a death sentence.
No it doesn't. I've never had any screening tests for genetic issues like downs testing etc when pregnant because it wouldn't change my decision either way. If you know you won't terminate there's literally no point.
This is horrifying. What the fuck this needs to be illegal I‚Äôm sorry but what 
That baby could of survived 
I don‚Äôt understand that sounds like low key manslaughter to me
[deleted]
This is on TikTok and idk if I‚Äôm allowed to state her name publicly so I‚Äôll play it safe. Not only was she being rude to the people in the comments who were calling her out for being cruel selfish but she also continued to have kids despite 2 of her children having this syndrome. She has 4 kids and like one commenter on her video said, how could you do that to an innocent life?
Just search ‚Äúfragile X syndrome‚Äù on tik tok and it‚Äôs the first result
I just typed in ‚ÄúFragile X‚Äù and this lady‚Äôs video was the top trending one, smdh.

ourfragilexlife is the profile
Yes, because she made the baby herself
And surprisingly there's a group that sees this as a bad thing. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
I have a daughter with Down syndrome. She is wonderful.
Most patients suffering from fragileX syndrome exhibit some level of mental retardation. 

Some also have autism - but it's not like because they have autism they are smart.

People with autism can be intelligent, but we are talking about fragileX syndrome here.
I mean I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúmental retardant‚Äù is the correct phrase when the r word WAS appropriate.
Having a 3rd child and willfully being in denial about the real probability of its disability and the problems they will face. Better to just spend ones resources caring for the struggling children they already have, rather than playing the genetic lottery over and over, with the same sets of dna. They've got rose colored glasses on, hoping for a different result so they can have a "normal" baby for whatever egotistical reason.
ETA it's specifically the denial of foreknowledge that the child will have a specific condition that bothers me which would help in making informed decisions for the babies care. That's like not finding out you're having twins and only having half of what you need.
there are literally no life-threatening health issues that are linked to the condition. many people with this condition even learn to drive and live normal lives. nothing you mentioned will happen to this child in question lmfao what?üòÇ
It‚Äôs the implications of ‚Äúyou made two more of these fucked up things?‚Äù That‚Äôs the neonazi point. The idea that disabled people, specifically, shouldn‚Äôt reproduce. 

In the oop case, she‚Äôs being wilfully ignorant. She knows there‚Äôs a good chance the foetus will have it and she‚Äôs choosing not to test until the kid is born, at which point it‚Äôll be too late to change her mind about birthing a child that she knows will suffer. 

TLDR; Comment hate should be directed at her for choosing to ignore the issue, not for already having disabled kids.

Edit - spelling
[deleted]
Lmfao exactly. Guarantee it‚Äôs some self diagnosed shit
>Id like disabled people to be euthanized, but that doesn‚Äôt make me a nazi.

Luckily, people like you don't get to kill people like me who are disabled and happy with our lives.
There‚Äôs lots of factors that go into OCD, though since it is an anxiety disorder I‚Äôd imagine there is a large genetic component, as well as environment
OCD is part of the neurodiversity family, same as autism, adhd, schizophrenia, bipolar etc, so it can be hereditary
I‚Äôm pretty sure it is. I doubt it‚Äôs a coincidence that almost everyone on my dad‚Äôs side of the family has it. We all have different types/issues, though- like my dad was a compulsive cleaner, my sister is a serious germaphobe and I struggle with intrusive thoughts.
As a woman?  It messes up a lot of things but yeah.  Anything out of the ordinary is not good...
Didn't say anything about the government, America isn't the center of the world. meant that more as a humankind thing, as in we just go around screwing each other with little concern for the resulting children's health. 

I saw an article a while ago talking about a couple with a bunch of different ailments-if I remember correctly dwarfism, osteoporosis, and partial deafness, purposely set out to have as many kids as possible. See If we as a species were more concerned about our well being genetically speaking, we'd realize this was pretty dang cruel for the kids born with all these problems. But everyone just embraces these clear disabilities now. 

Of course people born with such ailments don't deserve to be treated differently or subjugated, but we should have enough dignity and common sense to know when not to reproduce. Sadly, we don't, and now we have a bunch of people with all sorts of genetic problems, some being small like needing glasses, having weaker teeth, and others having chronic lifelong effects like down syndrome.
Breeding is typically regulated by natural selection, but we are subverting that, and it's resulting in more health problems. I'm not saying the government should choose who is able to reproduce or anything tho. Just saying how breeding is regulated in nature.
Interesting argumentative rebuttal
Interesting. Autism and schizophrenia both run pretty heavily in my family - I had no idea that both presenting was common.
True. Some of the genes could be from spontaneous mutations, especially if there is no family history
they are in my line of work
Yeah we‚Äôre going backwards and it‚Äôs weird..
I totally agree with you.

This just isn‚Äôt the case for everyone though. Also, if you live in some states they will prosecute for traveling for an abortion too. They created an ‚Äúauntie network‚Äù but if you have that testing on file then ‚Äúmiscarry‚Äù that would definitely cause some problems.
Correct, she carries enough repeats on a single X chromosome (although that‚Äôs an assumption, genetic counseling and knowing exactly how many repeats are important), but that does not necessarily mean the fetus is affected. That‚Äôs where CVS or amnio comes into play. She‚Äôs also having a girl and it‚Äôs an X-linked dominant disorder. If she were having a boy this would be much worse, but there is a chance for a completely unaffected daughter even with a high copy number on carrier screening.
Kid 4
[deleted]
Not really. If you're going to keep the child either way, there's very little advantage to knowing in advance. It's only useful info if you plan on terminating.

Fragile X syndrome isn't even anything horrific. It causes learning disabilities. People w learning disabilities can live full and happy lives, why are you all hating on their existence?!
I might‚Äôve phased it wrong but the woman in the picture has 4 kids and her first 2 children have the syndrome and yet still decided to have more despite the risks. And some people in the TikTok comment section are praising her for her selflessness when this is the complete opposite of selflessness.
[deleted]
It's a hard and disgusting choice, I'm not entirely sure who would be the one to decide. It's dependent on so many things.
It's okay to be blunt. This is just the most efficient solution I can think of for the situation where they couldn't be separated.  I'm aware that it is wrong, and its use in genocide.
Zyklon-B was used in America and the Nazis got the idea from us ü§∑üèº
A lot of Nazi shit was reappropriated American shit. Doesn‚Äôt change the awfulness, but it‚Äôs baked into the American culture and unlike German Nazi culture being rendered almost extinct, the American subculture that spawned some Nazi beliefs is unfortunately thriving lately‚Ä¶
Cry about it lmao.
I'm aware it's eugenics. 
But why is it okay for these two people to produce offspring that they themselves cannot even raise, and also have the same disability. So now those children can grow up and do the exact same thing as their parents.

To be fair, it's probably easier and less morally questionable to just segregated the women and men in different care facilities so they don't get the idea to breed uncontrollably. Is that more to your liking, it's still nazi esque, but less morally questionable.
My aunt literally bribed her BIL (who was developmentally delayed and had rage issues) to get a vasectomy and they would pay for their wedding/nice hotel for the honeymoon.

He did it.
Maybe just segregated them so they can't breed, maybe that would be better. 
In the case above though, they've already made 5 heavily disabled kids, what happens when there's not enough people to look after them, it's not like their parents can take care of them.
What‚Äôs wild is that isn‚Äôt my only relative to know their kid was going to suffer and decide to carry it anyhow. My family line is riddled with issues both mentally and physically but they KEEP BREEDING and I don‚Äôt get it. And of course, I‚Äôm the jerk because I have pointed out from a young age that our family seems to have a lot of issues so why don‚Äôt they stop having kids‚Ä¶ gods will and all that bull. üôÑ I‚Äôm against having kids period, but it just feels extra shitty when it‚Äôs people that know they are passing stuff down and they know that kid is more than likely going to have just as hard a life they did or worse and they do it anyhow. And won‚Äôt adopt because it‚Äôs ‚Äônot their kid‚Äô.  Those are the people that DEFINITELY should not be raising the future.
And nowhere did I say I did.
Wtf are you even talking about?? That‚Äôs the opposite of what my comment saidüòÇ 

So let me clarify what my comment really says:

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your experience. Mine is different. Despite having the same disability. You can‚Äôt guarantee that the child‚Äôs life would be miserable.‚Äù

Nowhere did I say, or imply, that disabled people should die.
so everything that nazis liked is nazi?
Yes disabled people can also be ableist and support eugenics. Same as women can be misogynistic and LGBT people homophonic. That doesn't prove anything.
Seriously. The woman in the picture has 4 children but the baby she was talking about luckily doesn‚Äôt have this syndrome BUT two of her three siblings have it.
that‚Äôs awful, but hopefully he doesn‚Äôt realise how bad his situation is
Oh wow that's definitely not what I expected. While I'm glad his existence is pure, I can't imagine if someone with that disability raised in an abusive household. Definitely good insight, thanks for that!
Um‚Ä¶
Nobody was asking to kill the fetus. They were just pointing out that it‚Äôs selfish of the woman to procreate knowing that her child would likely suffer.
I support humane trap neuter and release programs for humans üòÖ regardless of their condition. If we can do it to feral animals I'm not gonna act humans are any different.
This is a paragraph supporting eugenics and screenshotting it.
Nah
Exactly! There are no superior genes, to us all life is suffering. And in these cases, these children will have 10 times more suffering and more struggle. It‚Äôs inhumane and criminal to do this on purpose to somebody. But folks like these are too idiotic to understand.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs not called autonomy to purposefully give birth to somebody that‚Äôs going to need 24/7 care, that will most likely never achieve anything, that will most likely never fall in love, that cannot cook for themselves, that cannot care for themselves, etc etc. that is selfish and beyond cruel! Once the baby is born, nobody has a right to say anything else because you‚Äôre already here, and you exist. But if I can prevent an existence of suffering, I absolutely will.
Which is great. we should have everything possible to make the lives of those with disabilities easier.  

But knowingly making the choice to bring someone into the world that will have a disability that would actively cause them to suffer just because you wish to be a parent is selfish.
And you‚Äôre an idiot. And there‚Äôs no point in arguing with you.
[removed]
I would also understand if it was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the money and resources to care for a disabled child‚Äù like. I get that. If you do not feel like you could provide adequate care and support I think that would be fair. But this is just wild
If you can‚Äôt afford to do the test, you can definitely not afford a baby!
I genuinely forgot about the testing costs (which is kinda wild considering im american and like health is prohibitively pricey)
If she didn't care, she wouldn't have tested at all.
Needs to be an illegal practice., hands down
In the context of the comment ‚Äúcurse‚Äù is being used as a verb, not an adjective. So no they aren‚Äôt calling a baby cursed rather they‚Äôre being cursed by irresponsible selfish parents who would rather risk their baby‚Äôs health.
Nothing says love like deliberately condemning your children to an awful medical condition.
I am a special Ed teacher and worked with a boy that had fragile X syndrome. He was wonderful but I would never wish that type of dependence he had on adults around him on anyone. His parents were older too, so sad.
Absolutely insane‚Ä¶no sound minded able bodied human would rather be fcking handicap dude im shook.
The dude prolly wanted to abort but we all know we have no rights when it comes to that.
I wish there was a way for those people to get it later in life! I really wish they couldn‚Äôt endure this kind of suffering
I have a daughter with Down syndrome. She is wonderful.
Great for you, but let‚Äôs not forget that depending on the severity of the disease (maybe your daughter is different) this can mean life-long care on the part of the parents.
Sometimes autocorrect has its own mind.

In this case, patients suffering from fragileX syndrome often do exhibit mental retardation to varying degrees.
>They've got rose colored glasses on, hoping for a different result so they can have a "normal" baby for whatever egotistical reason. 

They need a healthy child to grow up and then care for the unhealthy children when they themselves are old and unable to care for their medically needy offspring.
Actually one of the issues that comes with this is seizures. Fucking seizures my man. You think that shit is harmless? Lmao you‚Äôre hilarious
But her already having these kids IS her ignoring the issue. She's cleary not.  

It's one thing to have a child and risk having  autism,adhd,  behavioral disorders passed on.  Nobody knows the full risk, nature vs nurture, so many factors to consider that an average person honestly can't. Including the risk of passing something down, you didn't even know you had. So no ,disabled people shouldn't  have to think about that  harder than nondisabled  people when having  kids  if they can care for them  


But when the doctors tell you the EXACT risk of  50/50 with known behavioral issues, and known medical issues (definitely the worst of the other is manageable to a degree)  and you roll that dice 7 times (and lose!)  you deserve all criticism. You can play heads or tails  and get one side  20 times  straight

Most couples with genetics that would produce a child with a  debilitating genetic disorder would agree to not have a child who would live a life of pain. That has nothing to do with disabled people and everything to do with not being a selfish cunt.
You‚Äôre on the wrong page! The page is called ANTINATALISM!! We are against ANY REPRODUCTION and SUFFERING!! Not only is she reproducing, she is creating life that is born directly into more suffering by having a lifelong severe disability. Gtfo!
It‚Äôs her mentality of knowing she has a disease she can pass to her children. Has already had one or more that has the disease and has yet ANOTHER one almost like she‚Äôs going to keep trying knowing there‚Äôs a big chance her child will be afflicted with a life long disease and the suffering that comes with it. She can easily adopt a child. But people are so hell bent on squirting out something with their own DNA.
Does medical condition suit you better? Sorry, there is a negative connotation to disease for obvious reasons. As someone with a disability, why are you upset that people are upset about a person knowingly creating people with disabilities? Or at least a 50/50 shot. 

That is not eugenics. It's not nazi shit. Nobody is saying throw the cursed child into the reject pit. They are disgusted at the selfish nature of the mother.
Caring about someone's suffering isn't eugenics....It's not the disease that's seen as negative, it's the fact the mother knew her child would suffer and still decided to go through with their child's further suffering. That's SELFISH. Her choice is SELFISH! If you don't agree with antinatalism that's fine, but GTFO cuz clearly you're looking for problems where they don't exist.
I wouldn‚Äôt kill you. Goodness
As a native person, this is so very cringe inducing 

Actively calling for eugenics, forced sterilization (another thread) and just the genocide of disabled people ??? Wild
>Didn't say anything about the government,

Generally, when speaking of regulation, the government is involved. The government regulates many facets of life. That's why my mind went into wondering why anyone would trust their reproductive rights to politicians.
I don't know how common it is but I have seen it in three families so far.  I would not be surprised if there is a genetic link.  Both disorders affect the brain.  One big thing for me is how many children with autism regress or going suddenly non-verbal.  It reminds me of schizophrenia in that it appears to come on quickly after previously the person appeared normal.
Same in my family. My uncle was schizophrenic plus he had PTSD from Vietnam. Such a haunted man. He eventually committed suicide. 

Only one of my three siblings has kids. Smallest one has sensory issues. Hopefully they won't experience schizophrenia.
I hope Canada doesn't go the same way.
especially places like texas where people can sue you for money over just suspecting it and then use that to file charges up to life in prison
I wasn't aware of the baby gender. It makes a lot more sense to not test for a girl who is likely to have minimal or no symptoms than if the fetus was male.
yike

tbh i think 4 is too many anyways. no one can give a good upbringing to that many kids. 1-2 is the utter max!!!
I was bullied too. This is not a unique situation for you. That added to my ptsd. I am suffering because of my chronic health issues as well. Society cannot and will not support us. You're politically ignorant if you that a capitalist society would do that.

How can you kill what is never born? I'm very interested in how you think not procreating is murder. 

When every cradle is a grave it's you people that are the killers.
Fuck off on your high horse/wheelchair.  We all were told to kill ourselves.   That's school in a nutshell.  *That's standard issue humanity.*
Knowing in advance allows for making preparations for the baby's needs, including finding providers for specific care needs.
Why would she have more even though there is a risk of the child getting the condition?!
[deleted]
Something is seriously wrong with you and it's not your disability. You're all over this post calling people "asshat," "fuckwit," saying "fuck you" over and over to complete strangers. You're deranged. And you have the nerve to use your disability as a cudgel to beat other people down. "I can verbally abuse you as much as you want because I'm disabled! I'm DISABLED! EVERYBODY LISTEN, I SAID I'M DISABLED YOU FUCKING WORTHLESS FUCKWITS!"

I'm frankly shocked the mods haven't removed you already. It's a real shame. Now, I'll eagerly await your insulting response.
Cry and scream ‚ÄúNazi Nazi‚Äù all you want lmao. You‚Äôre a loser
Nazi shit is also christianity right?
Hitler actually praised the US on the systematic erasure of native americans (forced sterilization, religious conversion, residential schools, blood quantum, etc)
I mean. He did consent
as a disabled person, this comment is fucking disgusting. we're human beings.
Wait I'm so sorry this was meant to go under someone else's comment and I have no idea why it's here
In this case? Yes. Nazis were trying to exterminate anyone who was inferior, including Jews, Romani, disabled people, queer people... so, considering this was a direct part of their mission? Yes.

Now, if we were talking about a love for Wagner? No. But their systematic extermination and sterilization of disabled people. Most definitely
Oh stfu. Being intelligent and not wishing to pass on what would kill someone without medical intervention isn't ableist you're so dumb. Do you go to dumb school and wear your dumb hat and tell your dumb stories to the dumb people of dumb town?
We're here for antinatalism, not eugenics. No child should be born. Its not about disabled humans but humans in general
No he doesn‚Äòt. And, again, he‚Äòs happy with life. Way happier than i am.
Also not everyone with this disease is happy. In the Netherlands you would be eligible to assisted suicide. If someone has it and is happy, all the better!
Yea he would be easy to exploit. I don‚Äòt want to know how many disabled people are being abused around the world. I‚Äòm just happy that he‚Äòs in good hands and has a loving family
That‚Äôs this one case. The severity of the disability varies from person to person, most of them cannot even do the simplest tasks by themselves such as showering, cooking, nothing of the sort. They require 24/7 care.
Humans are much different than feral animals, comparing the two is super weird. You cannot, ethically, sterilize a human against their will. I‚Äôm sure the women who were sterilized against their will by the government would probably agree, we‚Äôve even had a few court cases about it. Bodily autonomy and consent and all that.
Do you even know what eugenics means??? They want children to be born, except they want only certain types of children that fit their criteria. 

Antinatalist means: We don‚Äôt want ANY children to be born because we believe life equals suffering, so none of us are having kids. And on top of that, bringing a child that you know will have a disability into this life that is already extremely difficult, where none of us chose to be here, it‚Äôs beyond cruel and unforgivable. It‚Äôs a crime.
She has two other kids that have it!!! it‚Äôs not that hard to do the math. Anybody that knowingly brings life into this world knowing they will suffer for a terrible disease, should be punished.
Even people without disabilities have lives full of suffering, you‚Äôre grasping at straws here.

Yeah exactly. This is straight up just people thinking being disabled makes life not worth it.
We were told it would cost nearly $20,000 for the testing. I have 2 kids, the oldest is 4. I have not spent nearly that much on the both of themüíÄ
That's not strictly true. If my kid had shown features of say, downs at birth, I'd have had them tested so that they could access support (which isn't really needed by a newborn, so no reason to do it prior to birth). But I'd never test in pregnancy, because it wouldn't alter the pregnancy.
[deleted]
Also chronic pain, scoliosis, and self harming behaviors. That sounds fucking terrible to me.
Right. And we hate the mom for making that choice, not the kids for being born to it. 

That‚Äôs the fucking point. The kids didn‚Äôt choose to be born like this. Direct your anger at her, not the kids.
[deleted]
>I wouldn‚Äôt kill you. Goodness

Saying you want disabled people euthanized and then acting shocked that a disabled person was happy you couldn't do it, is a thinly veiled manipulation tactic. ~ Says something terrible, then is üò≤ when someone takes you at your word! ~ Classic.

Thank goodness people like you are just keyboard warriors.
Some people just seem one bad day at work away from writing a manifesto and buying a gun.
I certainly don't trust the government nor the healthcare organizations provided by them. I certainly disagree with the idea of government regulations on reproduction, hence why I wish we were able to manage it better ourselves.
If you want socialism we can trade places and you can live in the heavenly Venezuela
[deleted]
But that's not needed for something like fragile X. They're no different as newborns, as far as I know.
[deleted]
I mean. Seriously.

I don‚Äôt know why some people on Reddit can‚Äôt disagree with others without cursing them out and calling them names. Like grow up.
What is your disability, if you don't mind telling me?
Oh lol. It happens!! No worries
This is just reaching for nazis. Including jews? What are we talking about here?? Disabled people are inferior, biologically proven, hence the name disabled. I have a disabled sister (genetic mutation), had she not been born, it wouldve been all the better
Fragile X syndrome, the disorder in question here, doesn't kill anyone and causes learning difficulties, something many people are able to live happy and fulfilling lives with. 

But Jesus Christ, that reply is so fucking immature. What's next, you gonna call me a poopy head and say I stink? Blow a raspberry at me? Average antinatalist lmao.
[deleted]
If he has the intelligence level of a 7 years old he definitely does.
well that's a difference between downs and fragile x.

im not an expert on fragile x. i only know what a quick google showed. so maybe i have an inaccurate understanding

but what google said was that there was prenatal testing

and that there are therapies that are essential to have during infancy

and knowing the american healthcare system, that means you want to know asap. it took 2 years for my SNAP and WIC application for during-pregnancy assistance to process so i can only imagine how long getting an actual expert physician and in-home care would take
Listen if you want to play keyboard warrior, go find the real Nazi pages instead of shaming people for being rightfully upset about selfish parents who knowingly condemn their children to live in cages that are their own body.
as someone who is literally disabled and been that way since birth- they have cursed this child for their own selfish gain.
I am DOUBLE disabled and I‚Äôm happy to say that they cursed this baby to live a mostly painful life that they won‚Äôt be able to do much during, and have done so multiple times before- just because they are selfish.
Cursed isn‚Äôt being used instead of disabled, and that‚Äôs the point they were trying to convey to you. 

‚ÄúDisabled,‚Äù is an adjective in the sense that you‚Äôre using, and cursed wasn‚Äôt an adjective in that use. They‚Äôre not saying ‚Äúthis baby is cursed,‚Äù and intending it to mean ‚Äúthis baby is disabled,‚Äù 

When the use of a word changes the context, it‚Äôs not semantics it‚Äôs clarification. 

I‚Äôm not saying I agree or disagree with the mother, but you can‚Äôt just call something semantics. Words have meaning and this person clarifying isn‚Äôt being a grammar police or anything. They‚Äôre trying to get their point across correctly
You‚Äôre one of those losers that bitches and whines anytime you feel ‚Äúoffended.‚Äù Quit being over sensitive. You aren‚Äôt saving anyone
POSSIBLE. Each case of Fragike X is different. Some people with FX have very few symptoms, if any. It's just like many other genetic conditions that have a large variable of what the person's life will be like. Some are extreme, some are negligible aside from possibly passing I down. 

My son was misdiagnosed with FX while we waited over a year for the genetic testing to come back. They just assumed he had it. He doesn't. But during that time I nose dived into every possible thing it MIGHT come with to make sure I knew everything available. Including medical journals and research papers. 

I still have contact with many parents whose children do have it. The symptoms you both describe are worst case scenarios and almost no child has all of those symptoms. 

I'm not defending this mother. I'm telling you that your perspective, based on the idea that all people with genetic disabilities should be killed before birth because they will live miserable lives, and catastrophising something you know nothing about, is WRONG.
Is the anger directed towards the kids in the room with us now?
People conflate diseases and disorders all the time. Even I did it. I do it sometimes with my own disability. Simple mistake. It's not people being ableist or using it in a negative way. I'm sorry disease has such negative connotations to you but it's really not that deep. Also you're the one coming in here projecting your own issues with your disability like it's our problem. No one is talking about breeding out a disease or disorder or genetic condition. We're talking about how selfish it is to have a child knowing it's going to suffer. 

You're clearly projecting your own issues with how people have treated you and your disability and I'm sorry for that but despite what you think this just isn't the place for it.
You also have to wonder : what counts as ‚Äúdisability‚Äù to these guys 

I have glasses, is that a death sentence? 

I have flat feet, it causes me pain when I‚Äôm made to stand for long periods of time, is that a death sentence ?

But wait flat feet is common in my racial group, is that death for them ? 

Whoops, looks like someone started an ethnic cleansing. 

Honestly saying you want all disabled people to die, like current, living, disabled people, and not fetuses that can be aborted, is just genocidal, and evil. 

How wide is the spectrum, sure abort a fetus with fragile x 

But are they also expecting to shoot a man in a wheelchair and act like it‚Äôs the same ? 

AFAIK, AN is about the prevention of suffering, not having children because the world is a disaster 

I didn‚Äôt sign up for ‚Äúwe should kill all disabled people/any undesirables‚Äù 

I signed up for ‚Äúhaving kids is selfish because that would force a human being to suffer.‚Äù
Oh I didn't realize I only had 2 options
Statistically, Venezuelans are happier and less suicidal than Americans.

It turns out that socialism works up until the USA funds a drug cartel to go fuck it up
You think me not having children means I'm a killer? Me deciding to get sterilized makes me a murderer? Really think about that for a second. 

Every cradle is a grave. Everyone dies. People not born don't die. 

I'm pushing for no one to have children. I don't think non disabled people should have kids either.
It actually causes seizures too.
[deleted]
Why are you yelling at someone whose against forced sterilization? He‚Äôs not saying he should be the one to pick???
It's their choice for sure, but we can say it's a selfish thing to do depending on the situation.

I also think you responded to the wrong person, considering they said they think forced sterilization is wrong (which it is). The person they responded to is the one that actually thinks it's a good idea.
If the vast majority  of taxpayers knew how much money just 1 disabled person cost the taxpayers, I doubt they would think it was fine for genetically disabled people to reproduce.

For instance, a family member is a devout pro-life Christian.  When I gave him a rough estimate of what 1 of our soecial needs clients costs a year, my family member emphatically stated, "They should  be euth'd!!".

If someone cannot take care of themselves,  it is wrong for them to be allowed to have children whom they also cannot effectively raise.
Ok... I feel like you don't realize you're basically doing the "but I have a black friend" excuse. 

Also... wow. It is hard on siblings for sure. But that doesn't excuse eugenics or someone's right to live. And believing any person is inferior to you is a pretty obviously horrible thing to think.
You mean have a hard life and struggle when mommy and daddy could have just not? Stupid. 
Also I'm being dumb on purpose because you're dumb. If you want an intelligent conversation then say something intelligent and think outside of life = right. That's silly and not thinking before spreading your genetic defects is selfish and 100% avoidable. I can go all day however, my daily dose of why the human race is losing their jaw line is over.
I have a neurological disorder that makes my life hard, looks wise and mentally. There‚Äôs a 50% chance it‚Äôs passed on. My mother told me I shouldn‚Äôt have kids in the future bc of it. Your honest opinion on her statement? (I‚Äôm 50:50)
That's an actual vile stance holy shit.
7 years old roughly speaking. Don‚Äòt take that word for word. A 7 year old can read and calculate better than he does. But he‚Äòs still more mature than my 10 year old nephew.
I'm not American so there's differences there. For me, if the kids ever needed anything and the wait was too long we'd go private. I did this for my eldest, who's autistic - standatd wait was two years, I rang a consultant to assess him privately and we had it within 6 weeks. Downside was I had to pay four figures but that's something I'm prepared to do. So I really disagree that not doing prenatal tests means the parents don't care.
the nazis will parade such poor takes around as a strawman for the entire left
Well I don't believe abortion is murder so fundamentally we disagree.
[deleted]
Well now you do so better get to stepping.

Isn't that in something like 10% of people with it? The vast majority don't have seizures AFAIK?

Why do you assume people with learning difficulties have shit lives and are inferior?

I'm sure you think you're very intelligent, but the fact you have all the opportunities in the world and still manage to make your life suck so much you'd prefer non existence says otherwise lmao.
Hard to say without knowing what it is but my *personal* opinion is that if it isn't life threatening or intensely painful or anything like that, I wouldn't be overly concerned about it. I have EDS and an neurodivergent. Being ND isn't a problem imo, having EDS is a fucking nuisance. I wouldn't think of it as a reason not to have kids though. It's also a 50% chance of inheritance like what you are referring to. It isn't life ruining though, and it doesn't outweigh all the good stuff so for me it's not a big deal.

Others on this sub will lean the other way
(me being shook that 4 figures is a downside when the average here is in that range and going private would cost astronomically more)
"ABLISM‚Ä¶NeoNazis‚Ä¶Eugenics‚Ä¶This sub is an echo chamber‚Ä¶"

Did you get an invitation to the sub, or are you being held hostage in here?
You literally wrote to me "It sounds like you want to kill disabled people."

I need you to explain how me not wanting anyone to procreate means I want to "kill all disabled people". 

Letting people know the cons of having a baby isn't EUGENICS NAZI SHIT
10 percent is a high degree to me. Especially because any seizure can potentially kill you.
can you read???? your comments are really embarassing
[deleted]
No. I think spreading a genetic defect is wrong. If you want to say that's thinking they're inferior then that's a you problem. I never said they were. Just said it is wrong to know and spread it to their kids.
Ok fair enough. And yes I‚Äôm not even talking about being ND but that it impacted my looks and height. 

To be honest with you, I was offended when she said it.

I have met people that have died from seizures because they're breathing can stop they can hit their head on the floor If only they tried hemp products it may have helped
Idk, if someone told me I had a 90% chance of soothing I'd feel pretty confident.

Why? It's not a terrible fate to have a learning disability. I'd argue most folks with LDs are happier than 90% of this sub
I hate how human society tends to reward shitty people.
Sure, it sometimes rewards good people too, but it seems like the most powerful people In society are always some of the worst human beings, all throughout history it can be seen time and time again, it can be seen in today's ulra wealthy and politicians. This is probably the thing I hate most about this world.
Life on earth is a survival battle.
I don't wanna play that game.
It's more of a *perceived* weakness.
[deleted]
its not necessarily a weakness but enough people have learned to exploit it. 

but the root of it all is... you cant be just kind to everyone out there without even knowing the person and the real circumstances coz you could be aiding the wrong bad person lol for starters. kindness is not the weakness, carelessness is.
As the saying goes: "No good deed goes unpunished"
Evil seems to be rewarded, Those kind of people make me sick. This system can't continue this way.¬† soon the¬†
First shall be last and the last shall be first.
It's easy to be kind when you don't have mortgages, student loans or money problems or 36 hr shifts at work. But still, Kneau is a üíé  that is a solid human being right there.
Well played
Speaking of contempt for weakness -

[Our Contempt For Weakness: Nazi Norms and Values - And Our Own](https://search.worldcat.org/title/20183563) (Engl. translation, 1989). Written by Harald Ofstad, professor of applied philosophy at the University of Stockholm.  Said contempt for weakness was the driving force of Naziism, and antisemitism mainly to the extent that being Jewish was deemed weakness.  Argues that Naziism wasn't (and isn't, tbh) so much a unique one-of-a-kind philosophy as it was/is *an exaggeration of* certain mainstream Western values - values still widely held today.  Warns that without tackling contempt for weakness (and other kinds of distaste for mere difference from the norm) something like Naziism is bound to arise again sooner or later. You've been warned!

When kindness is deemed weakness, and the weak are held in contempt, what happens to society?
I know and often the shitty have kids. It‚Äôs an endless shitty cycle.
Nope it "rewards" people who fight for their wealth. Doesn't have to be always fair, or nice so that's why a lot of successful people are what they are.


It doesn't reward people sitting on the internet crying about it.
As per the game of life experiments, being kind (collaborative) is not a weakness, and kind societies always win out against selfish ones.  

Additionally, all it takes for a society to start becoming kind is a small concentrated group of kind people. As these collaborative groups help each other and thus grow in power, they eventually will outpower the selfish group.
It‚Äôs literally used against you. I‚Äôd rather die than be in this selfish devil planet.
It's because weak people support them. I have been attacked on Reddit for speaking up when others wouldn't. It's how humanity is. The majority want to be slaves.
They excuse abusers,force victims to pretend like their harm never happened & get mad when they want to see their abuser suffer as if that wasn't smth the other side deserved & call them "weak".. Yeah sure man, wanting justice is such a crime, maybe go hold hands w them & get the f out ‚ò∫

I agree with the post.
And decided to post a person everyone loves and tries to reward as much as they can...
It will and always has been unfortunately. Its how we‚Äôve come this far as species
Yeah, not a fan of battle royale games either.
I‚Äôd have no issue with survival if trust was real but that same person you trust could be selfish and ruin your survival. We need better humans

Mine is more "successful", but I wouldn't want his life. He's an obese prison guard with shitty friends. I'll take being able to see my feet/dick when I look down anyday.
Not surprised. Studies show that bullies tend to be taller, more attractive, more popular, sometimes even physically stronger‚Ä¶‚Ä¶which is pretty obvious when you think about it. 

Why would someone suffering self-esteem issues pick on others? It‚Äôs the ones who think they‚Äôre hot stuff that do all the bullying
There is no karma, life here is just shit.
Pretty sure karma is supposed to be what affects you in the next life and not this one. So...they come back as...who knows? If soul families and all those shenanigans I read about in the reincarnation subs are correct then they just come back as even more rich soulless people.
You guys keep up with your bullies just to see how they're doing? Kinda cyber-stalkerish
I read that the earth is flat, too. 

A lot of school-level bullies can be big fish in their tiny high-school pond, but if they stay in their pond they look kinda pathetic, and if they leave their pond, they find out that other fish are much, much bigger than they are. Some do well, sure. Most do not.
I think it's fine for kind people to be kind to everyone, they just don't need to go so far to the detriment of themselves.   Especially for someone they don't know well. But sometimes it's hard to tell if someone is 'bad' or not until it's too late.
Yeah at least he struggled too.. He didnt get roles by asskissn, he was lucky to be in some good movies.. I remember keanu said fame is the worst thing 4 him, he is not the typical mask actor 4 the Media.. which is refreshing. I dont like any actors these days..¬†


Guys like Vincent price, Peter cushing, Gene Hackman, Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken ya cant say they take their job not serious..
I think we‚Äôre confusing kind and generous. I agree that people are struggling so expecting generosity in these times is silly.  But it takes nothing from people to be kind. 
Everyone nowadays seems so mean, impolite and miserable
Sure, it‚Äôs easy when you don‚Äôt have those problems, but do you see most people at that level of status treat people with kindness? Nor is it impossible to be kind even if you do have those problems
None of those things are stopping you from being kind. That is still a choice.
so what?

being kind is literally, genuinely and truthfully the easiest thing to do in the modern world. 

You don't have to give money or food. Just be kind. That's it.

If you can't even do such a simple thing just because you are "tormented" by your problems, you don't deserve life.

Everybody has problems. Why make it hard for other people by being rude.

Depends on how obese, you might have to hold up a flap or two and in the case, still be unable to see anything.
I mean, about kindness and cruelty.

You are saying that kindness can be misplaced and that some people should get none when they are abusive, etc.?
I get it now. Rest assured, Drag Race is my favourite show lmao
Yeah, since horrible people deserve to suffer & they rarely face consenquences of their actions & don't even fell bad for what they've done. Also they most likely abused an individual that was kind themselves & took advantage of that. And it makes zero sense why would they expect to get treated nicely when they themselves harmed someone else who was nice to them.
Exactly
There is truth to your words.

I just wish people would just get along and people who cause mayhem just realize that what they did was bad and evil.

Sure. Punishment but for the sake of learning, not out of cruelty.

May be i have Stockholm syndrome but as much as i was used and abused and at times i want put cruelty on these people, more than anything i want them to just... have a realization of theirs misbehavior and change for the better.

But that's wishful thinking.
I have to disappoint you but these people barely learn. And if they go emotional,its mostly since they're mad they got caught or are surprised when shit happens to them,I know this from multiple experiences or from someone else.
I know. I know...
Poor people who CANNOT set their kids up for life are literally creating drones for rich people, and setting up literal human beings, who had NO say in being born, for a life of exploitation, suffering, and abuse.
Why? 

To fulfill a psychological need? What does the kid get out of it? Why are you subjecting a life that had no say in being born to all of the shitty trials and tribulations of life, from watching you grow old and die, expose themselves to potential sicknesses, experience violence, and so much more.

So they can sit in a classroom for 18-22, maybe 26 years of their life, to attain an education to work for someoneone else 9-5, 5 days a week, every year until death, facing poverty, heartbreak, war, famine, etc?

**Nah. F. That noise.**
No these breeders will tell you there creating engineers.
I am one of the dead from within clueless zombie. I don't know about me. I don't know about people and life in general.

I never knew anything. The things I know I have gathered the knowledge by myself and I wish I had the same thought process earlier.

My parents emotionally abandoned me and they were far worst than poor. Sperm donor abandoned me, egg donor was never ever caring and emotionally available. I grew up poor and in a pathetic situation even an animal shouldn't survive like that, shouldn't even born there

No proper environment to prosper or even sustain 

Now I am left with all self sabotaging behaviour and no clue how to make money and whether I'll be even able to make it in life without going crazy, bitter or dead
I had a liberal family member get mad at me because I said it wasn‚Äôt responsible for poor people to have kids because it‚Äôs setting them up for a life of misery and she was like ‚Äúbut the world relies on poor people‚Äù. Well, there shouldn‚Äôt be any poor people in the first place! The reason is because rich capitalists hoard wealth and don‚Äôt pay workers a living wage. My grandmother was a teen mother and died young because she worked herself to death. I‚Äôve broken the cycle. I had a hysterectomy two years ago. I‚Äôm not bringing any wage slaves into this planet.¬†
My parents could and chose not to!
Also, it came as a surprise and they had never openly discussed their intention to abandon me at 18. They have counted every penny they have spent on me since - I'm now 42 and it really isn't a lot.
Not only that but they try to gaslight them that this is normal, and should actually be looked upon as a positive aspect of life, and try to bully them when they mention that something is wrong.
Yes. I am a person with multiple children. I love them all but I wish I would have known more about this issue before. I might have considered adoption.¬†

Does anyone else in this group compare having children to getting puppies from a puppy mill? ¬†There are so many rescues that need help that it seems irresponsible. Instead I brought another collection of mouths into the world.¬†

But the cycle might end here. My children currently do not seem to want children. They want to enjoy life and travel until they die. We probably will have enough money to allow for this.
Other side of this coin is the few who become rich, and spend their lives having others as worker drones for them.
Correct. Rich people know this and they do treat these children like a farmed animal to be abused, physically and sexually. We all know how Jeffrey Epstein uses the lure of "work" and "income" to groom young women into prostitution for the rich.
I hate my parents¬†
Despite growing up in poverty, and my biological father being an abusive POS even before I was born, mum's excuse for bringing me into the world was that she'd had miscarriages before and couldn't bring herself to have an abortion because of them. Oh, and my favourite: she had a 'psychic vision' of me as a child and 'couldn't ignore it' üôÑ

How narcissistic do you have to be to create a life and force it into existence because you think you had a 'vision'? Ugh I hate her so much.
Life is full of trouble no matter what socioeconomic status you belong to. But if you are poor, it is really shit. Poor people who breed are doing nothing but crapping out wage slaves for the elite.
Literally my cousin, she's already on welfare and just had her sixth kid before she's even 30. They've all been girls so far too...  They are all gonna be preggers by their mid teens I'm assuming at this point..
How crazy would it be if women got paid to take care of their own children?¬†
‚úÖ

They say "oh, that's just a part of life." 

No. It's a consequence of poor choices. Without endlessly duplicating impoverished and slavish conditions there would be no iterative sequences of suffering. 

There's a major hangup with believing God supports life. In fact, most religious and spiritual paths are about transcending the world, not recreating it.
Tell me about it. My X's fundie family were of course dirt poor. Grampa always told her kids "school ain't important cause you're all gonna be preachers." Those kids didn't stand a chance. One is a male sex worker, one is homeless with six kids all wards of the state, and the successful one is working a dead end job at Target.
Being rich doesn't make a good parent, though.
Real
I'm 42M and poor AF.  Guess how many kids I have? 

0!

And never going any higher than 0!

Well its not going to be the rich kids who tear down oppressive structures‚Ä¶
I know my mother had me/my sibling with the intent for her to have people to care for her later in life. I find that so sick. You raised me and pushed me to be the smartest and brightest hardest worker just so I could take care‚Ä¶ of you‚Ä¶? Do NOT have a kid with the expectation that they will care for you later in life. I have no interest in taking care of my abuser mother and find it disturbing that the entire time I was being farmed instead of loved.
Don't forget to cut their dick skin right after birth.
I agree with you op. there‚Äôs too much suffering for some people that didn‚Äôt consent to be born. poor people are like wage slaves to rich people. If they get lucky they could have great employers(but it‚Äôs more common to not have a great one if you work low quality jobs), but they will have other tribulations and suffering of being poor. You should only have children if you can set them with with a good quality life.¬†
I think I am missing the point of the anti-natalist arguments in this sub. I think of it as a logical utilitarian thought experiment rather than complaints about being born or being upset that parents have children, no matter the cause.

Suffering is inherent in all creation. Living things must eventually die, and every action or inaction by a living thing goes towards the ultimate end of eventual 'death'. Hell, even "non-living things" like the fucking Sun eventually die. That is the nature of entropy, a law of the universe by which we all must live by.

Due to this, as a utilitarian, we look to reduce the suffering as much as possible for the most people as possible. Like "Increase pleasure for the most people and decrease suffering for the most people" is a very basic utilitarian argument. That's where anti-natalism comes in.

Since existence has the inherent attribute of suffering, which generally doesn't decrease (I am talking about inherent suffering, like getting old - not suffering like war, which can be decreased in some capacity), the utilitarian perspective would say that bringing forth existence into the world Non consensually (you can't ask your baby if they wish to be born while in the womb) is a concrete increase to the amount of suffering in the world. When a child is born, they have that inherent suffering of existence (the march towards death) that can never be reduced, and so, having a child is explicitly contrasting utilitarianism in this form.

The arguments against anti-natalism do not focus on this inherent suffering of existence - they focus on the suffering and pleasure that IS managed, like War or poverty and such. In that argument, more people/less people doesn't matter - in fact, you would typically want more people because with more people, society's capacity for pleasure increases (even though the capacity for suffering increases as well, in addition to the inherent suffering). The more people you have, the more opportunity society has to reduce the general suffering of people as well. Two heads better than one, and such.

Both arguments have their merits, but ultimately, the anti-natalism/pro-natalism arguments are just utilitarian on both sides, which isn't something that makes sense to complain about.
Absolutely for every engineer or physician they get out of that: who by the way will be put out of job soon by AI anyway and  worthless as the rest of humanity‚Ä¶ Yours is likely to get a paraplegic myrmidon scion  of Satan screaming to be put out of its misery like the protagonist in a metallica anthem
Yeah you‚Äôre right and it‚Äôs so sad. Even sadder when you and your siblings turned out to be one of those kids.
>What does the kid get out of it? 

Existence. That seems pretty straight forward.

I want to have children, but until I can give them a good life I refuse to
That‚Äôs why rich people and politicians are so worried about birth rate
Why do you guys insist that people ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to have kids. Like yea obviously now that we have birth control and abortion which has only been around for about 70 years of the human species 200,000 years. Before that people had babies because they had sex which any other species does. Our literal entire human structure is geared towards procreation even if people don‚Äôt want to admit it. Nobody ever said that life was supposed to be easy and how entitled do you have to be to believe that the only life worth living is a wealthy one with 0 struggles? Poor people ARE worthy of life. Poor people DO have the right to families just like wealthy people. And guess what. If only rich people had kids they‚Äôd find a new way to get a working class. Nobody is entitled to wealth or a perfect life and rarely are people‚Äôs lives void of suffering even when wealthy. To suggest that people should only have kids if they have wealth, you are suggesting that either people should not have sex until they are ready for a kid (which im not totally against) or that women should have to live their life on birth control (which for some women is catastrophic) or be willing to have an abortion (which many believe is murder) Children are apart of life just like death just like needing to eat and like sex.
Would never bring a child unto earth but if I was rich I would definitely adopt children and give them the best life possible. To be all out against natalism is wrong though many are only against it because of the way the world works right now.
You just sound whiny as hell.

Then there's seven hours of other time and seven for sleep. ( I took two out for commute and preparation. very generous).


Two hours for chores maybe and you still have five hours.¬† Two hours for food and cleanup, unless you're doing something fancy and you have three hours. And this is being very generous with how long the previous stuff takes. If it's just one person, no dependants, it can take far less.


So, one hour I hike or hit the gym with my tunes. One hour I veg like the potato I am. And one hour I either read or play games. And honestly, I wouldn't want to do those things more than a hour day anyway. ( Unless there's a game/show/book I really, really like. But those are rare)


And then I get two days off.¬†
You guys are like Scrooge from a Christmas Carol when he talks about decreasing the surplus population
I for one am thankful I wasn't raised wealthy in a rich household.
Wow everyone in hear operates by FEAR of everything and anything.
Ok
Do you think poor people are drones or what
So dramatic
I enjoy my life. I'd rather live the life I do with all the pleasures I've had and continue to have rather than never experience anything at all. I definitely don't feel like I'm simply a drone for rich people. I get paid for 40 hours per week and I work maybe a few hours a week from home. there are ways to enjoy life without having a free ride. I grew up poor as dirt.

Just because you think a middle class life isn't worth living doesn't mean everyone feels that way. If my kids live a life like mine and are as happy as I am at my age I'll be cool with that. There was no specific reason I had kids. I don't care about passing on my genes or any stupid shit like that. My wife and I did plan to be childless when we got married. About a year into our marriage we got pregnant. We scheduled an abortion. The morning of we were getting ready together and both decided that we wanted to have the baby. we are able to provide a good life for our kids while they're growing up but we certainly can't set them up for life. So far they are happy kids and don't seem to be upset about us giving them life. I hope that continues.
What about all the poor people born who are wildly successful now?
18-26 years? You know you don't start school at birth right?
In other words: "life is trash because I can't slack off 24/7 nor have infinite money"
This is such a pessimistic way of looking at life. So no one has any free will then? Maybe if you teach your kids good values, tenacity and hard work, they cancel make something of themselves.
This is such a fucked up way of looking at the world. Imagine not being defined by your career or what‚Äôs in your bank account. Plenty of people get by but don‚Äôt amass wealth and are fine with that. Is it too hard to get by? Absolutely. Does that dictate everyone‚Äôs happiness or perspective on their life? Absolutely not.

Most of humanity has never been rich, and yeah, working is a part of life, so what? Being alive is better than not being alive. OP thinks he's being deep when he's not.
I guess poor people shouldn't be able to experience the joys of parenthood. I thought this subreddit was based but it's actually just a bunch of millennial numb-nuts
[deleted]
By not having kids, youre a bigger slave to the rich than having them. Youre proving them right that you have so little value that you shouldn't even do the 1 basic thing we're put on this earth to do. So keep thinking you're clever as the rich laugh their asses off at this.
>literally creating drones for rich people

What if the kid manages to open its own company, and employs people instead of being employed?
So humans have no free will and can't  make something better for themselves if they are poor
Noted
or a future president or curing cancer
Ever see the Twilight Zone episode where the guy accidentally goes into the future  and by a fluke finds there is medicine that can save his son in the past. It saves his sons life when he goes back, but since he got it from the future he also finds out his son was the one who invented it when he got older. But if he had died, the antibiotic he needed would have never been invented by him!.
Did their parents say that too?
*They‚Äôre
Same
That sounds terrible! You should have children though, bring them to the earth to endure the same pain you went through, and possibly even more! It will be so meaningful and I'm sure it's going to be worth it for the good of mankind okay I'm just being sarcastic.
You already sound pretty bitter brother. Maybe just change your perspective? I'm not saying it's easy but it's definitely easier than changing your reality, with essentially the same effect on your happiness
Well, your family member is sorta right, humanity relies on poor people, inasmuch as the whole thing is a pyramid scheme to benefit the people at the top. But even the poor have the ultra-poor, schizoid population to look at and feel superior to. It‚Äôs a sad, disgraceful system, especially considering that the elites are just about as miserable as everyone else. But I don‚Äôt know if humanity could function without people to look down upon and to do the most unpleasant of jobs. To be clear, I hate all of this and I wish there was no being as intelligent/cruel/selfish as humans.
I also broke the cycle and god dammit, I‚Äôm proud of myself!


Congrats honey. With great power comes great responsibility.

She said the quiet part out loud
You should not praise making something as basic as reroducing a rich only activity
That‚Äôs why I do horrible things to rich people. Our group ‚ÄúAmericans against America‚Äù have had enough of the rich doing whatever they want whenever they want. The poor suffer while the rich vacation. We are growing daily. We outnumber them.
Mine are similar.. it sucks to know there are people who would say no to a million dollars if it meant selling their dog but you can imagine your own parents considering it and asking follow up questions
>Yes. I am a person with multiple children. I love them all but I wish I would have known more about this issue before. I might have considered adoption.¬†¬†


This "issue", you didn't know there was a possibility of terrible things happening to your children? You didn't know they would eventually have to face their own mortality?¬†
Great.  And if more people take that approach the human race will die off.  Congratulations.
I remember the last rich fuck that tried to touch my kid. I got an assault charge, but that rich fuck can barely walk anymore. Good thing I knew the judge. They spent hundred of thousands in lawyer fees. Feels good to see the rich suffer.
My father abused the shit out of my family, especially my mother. The day he died, we celebrated. My mother did not want kids but he coerced her into motherhood, even though he said he was not interested in having kids and she was pursuing so many other things in life. She gave it all up while he lived his life while my mom took care of me. To this day, it breaks my heart seeing pictures of my youthful mother chaning due to it.

I hate rich people
My mom said something similar. You're not the only one. :(
Generational curses are realüò≠ Their mom aint setting them up for a different and better life than hers; so they will most likely follow in the same depressing footsteps.
I support that. Women take all of the physical risk of pregnancy. Society should reward them for it.
I hate that. I hate when you point out when something in the world absolutely suck, and the response is, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just part of life‚Äù. Sheepish pathetic thinking. Some people really are happy little slaves
Correct, but you can set your kid up for a good life
It‚Äôs not really about being rich tho is it? It‚Äôs really about being stable.
I have kids, and I‚Äôm rich.  I work hard, make great money, and my kids have a great life.  Got a problem with that?
Capitalism? Did capitalism exist during the Communist Revolution in China which led to 10-50 million people dying? What about the crusades? What about the Bubonic plague? Or the Ghanis Khan's conquest of the Near East? How about the Holocaust? Or the R3pe of Nanking?

You assuming that this is only an issue with capitalism is misguided. It has to do with everything that is part of human life, that all the shitty aspects of it, are forced upon us. 

We do not consent to it before birth. We are birthed without consent. And the person taking the consent away from us, especially the poor, need to do everything  in their power to make sure that the child has an excellent life.

They can't? 

Then do not have kids. If you cannot provide the child with a great life, then what is so bad about not having kids? Why does that kid, born to poverty, deserve to be subject to the trials and tribulations of life all because you as a poor person have a desire to create life?
[removed]
So here is one solution & it‚Äôs fairly simple. Just move ur hypothetical family out into the country.  Nice small town , decent job  pulling 40k a year and you can reallly live pretty comfortable let alone if Ur partner for life is also pulling 40k. 


 Don‚Äôt play the mammon game. That noise is a waste. But also don‚Äôt let them steal ur ability to live free and find happy. 

 Do you have to have kids ? Of course not. Don‚Äôt be so narrow minded as to discourage others.  


 FYI. I‚Äôve said the exact same thing. Like exact.  Time circumstances and perspective are generally deciding factors for us mensch. Or any bidepal creatures with higher thought process. 


 Obviously some are smarter or much more long lived and wiser or wisest of all. 

 That ain‚Äôt me. I‚Äôm just a retiring butthead looking for love in all the wrong places :( but i persevere I hope. 


Love yall.
>utilitarian, we look to reduce the suffering as much as possible for the most people as possible.

This speaks to 2 different goals. "Reducing suffering" and "the most people possible". If the goal is to reduce suffering than more people is counter to the goal of reducing suffering since the more people = more suffering.

 Also your pain vs pleasure calculus is flawed. Pleasure has a much shallower upper limit than suffering does in terms of impact of experience. This is why torture victims can be broken in minutes or hours and it takes years of positive experiences to only maybe counter that to bring them back to where they were before. As Schopenhauer pointed out "**compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is eating the other.**" Their is no balancing out of pleasure and pain unless your one of the fortunate few to whom suffering is rare and minor.
If it's a life of non-stop misery is it worth it though?

So many lies. Show me proof. Send $399,999 to Planned Parenthood. And date and label it "SquatDeadliftBench is the Drone, not me. Na ah!"
Right now? For sure. But growing up? My father abused the shit out of me for 15+ years of my life. The most brutal of it. He used to keep me in a dog cage (kennel) until it became too small to hold me. Wouldn't the world be great if more people were told to not have kids if you can not provide them a great life prior to forcing life upon them?
I know! You tell us, Human_Unit6656. Telling people to think twice before having kids is so weak. THIS IS THUNDERDOME, BABY! FEED THE MACHINE!

HUUUUUUUUUURAH.
We have removed your content for breaking the subreddit rules: No disproportionate and excessively insulting language.

Please engage in discussion rather than engaging in personal attacks. Discredit arguments rather than users.
My issue stems from it all being forced on you, without you being able to consent. And, if you cannot consent, then your parents better prepare to provide you with a great life that lessens the burdens of life, if not fully nulify it. **Otherwise, what right do you or I have to inflict life on others?**
Two hours for commute? That‚Äòs fucked up. Two hours of your day wasted on commute. It‚Äòs horrible ü§¢
Projection.
yeah pretty much
why yes actually, we are.
There are currently about 1 billion people in the world living in extreme poverty, living off of less than a few dollars a day. About 150 million people that live in life-threateningly-levels of poverty. So about 1/8 people living in terrible poverty.

That is a lot of people living and suffering due to people having children without being able to take care of them.

So all because there are poor people who do become wildly successful now, there are far more people living in abject poverty that makes it just unfeasable.
Survivorship bias. You hear a lot about the very rare success story, you don't hear about the overwhelming majority that remain poor and live and die miserably. This capitalist fable of escaping poverty through sheer willpower is not supported by statistics, but it's a good way to get the masses motivated to give all their time and energy to the system so the rich can get richer. It's a kind of idiot tax when you think about it, like the lottery.
Like who? I have a feeling you're really buying into a bunch of media lies because there's ample evidence to show that breaking out of your economic class is a very difficult thing to do because you don't have the same access to education, connections etc as those above you...
Billions should suffer so that a handful of millionaires and billionaires can exist!
For every poor person who ‚Äúmakes it‚Äù, there are many others who don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm afraid. There are so many talented smart people who don't make it. I had a family member from the middle of nowhere in Eastern Europe who grew up poor and got rich and even a bit famous but he got extremely lucky. He was not the norm. He was the only notable person from his village. I can‚Äôt imagine he was the only one who was talented and smart.¬†
Anomaly
99% of poor people will always remain poor. This is fact of life. Now the rich are getting richer while poor are getting poorer.
I was going to make a joke but to help you understand that number, I did not say age. I said, "for 18-22, maybe 26 years of their life," which means the amount of years invested in the classroom. When they begin doesnot matter. You could start school and finish when you are 35 attaining a BA, MA, and Ph.D, for example, which add up to decades.
Wrong. No one consents to life. So whatever comes after life is forced on you is unfair.
I don't see consent in your response.
No consent.
I know right. After a long day of work, nothing more fascinating than visiting this shitshow.
How is being alive better than not being alive? One we can experience, the other we can't. Something like that should require a little evidence.
>Being alive is better than not being alive.

You don't get to decide that for others
I respectfully disagree.
> poor people shouldn't be able to experience the joys of parenthood

So selfish. 

Set a kid up to be a slave to rich people in the name of "experiencing" something. Tell that to all the kids in the Philippines sold by their parents to predators because they couldn't feed them.

Or the kids in Afghanistan sold and wed off to 50 year old men in the name of culture.

**I'd rather be a numb-nut than buy into your heinous immorality.**
Is it joy when you‚Äôre too poor to provide a quality life for your children? Is it joy to watch your child miss out on everything because hobbies and experiences cost money?

If you find that joyful then you‚Äôre selfish as fuck.
So what? They didn't chose to be born
>So keep thinking you're clever as the rich laugh their asses off at this.

Lol then why the likes of Musk are so worried about population decline?

I think they would laugh at the poor people who haves children instead. I definitely would, after all these idiots are raising my future cannon fodder and labor slaves for me without me lifting a finger. What's not there to laugh?
Weird cope but okay ü§î
Usually it takes some amount of capital to start a business. For instance, Jeff Bezos borrowed money from his rich parents for years in order to get Amazon running successfully.

If the kid is born to poor parents, they're gonna have to be an employee for someone else in order to start saving up for their business.

I'm not saying you're wrong or anything, I do see your point!
This is great but how many companies do you know that treat their employees respectfully, both in terms of salary and day-to-day interactions? 

Jeff Bezoz enriched himself on the back and labor of people who were not allowed to sit or take bathroom breaks. That person was made by two people (their parents) and abused by another (human, Jeff Bezoz).
Perhaps it could be worded better with terms like "virtually." You'll hear about success stories, survivorship bias. The CEO of Chobani. And there are extraordinarily heroic people v extraordinarily evil people who are born and impact humanity on both small and large scale. How would the course of history be impacted without their presence? Maybe in some cases, it doesnt matter and their contributions were or are inevitable.

But where and how and to who one is born determines so much the trajectory of one's life despite all of our knowledge and advances in technology. How is it that life is short and brutish, because so much war and violence is waged on each other, economically, politically, socially, health? We're really going to create more cannon fodder? This is directed to people who are unlikely to read it.

 And if we set the minimum standard of life for everyone in an ideal utopia, what then? What's the drive and force? Perhaps a higher universal consciousness? The next level in human evolution? Telepathy, time-space travel? So hope. Hope is what can motivate someone to take the biggest gamble in their life, procreation. 

I think the least one can do if they make the life altering decision to introduce new members of society is to assess their financial stability and mental acumen. And to consider that that life had no free will entering this world, so their responsibility to their progeny is practically infinite. Some understand this level of responsibility. Maybe that's generous, few? I doubt so much people are self aware, much less comprehend this notion unless they're in this sub, or they have taken a theology course and studied the concept of free will. We have no agency entering this world and to create self agency can be such an arduous task beset by so many pointless, regressive obstacles. In fact, the concept of choice is often an illusion. 

How can we realize or maximize potential, regardless of circumstance? Lady Fortuna plays an outsized role. It's something to consider.
They absolutely can. Which is why it‚Äôs so incredibly reprehensible that they would choose to have children before attending to thier own financial betterment.
That is exactly what I meant. Yep. /S

So poor people have all them children and continue the brutal cycle of suffering, instead of breaking it and not having children until you are financially stable and able to give them an amazing life. 

Get out of here.
My child will be the president of cancer, commanding unprecedented levels of brain rot.
These humans are all so precious and all yet these breeders, pro lifers, and religious all don‚Äôt give a shit about any human in past or how precious or there beauty. Nothing.
Or every other possibility.
lmao. they have a better chance of getting cancer than curing it. these cows and their cavemen need to pull their heads out of their behinds!
The point is it‚Äôs the breeders mindset not any individual necessarily. Why do you think a lot of breeders think of there crotch fruit as meal tickets, oh they need to go to the most prestigious school as they can‚Äôt tarnish me by not looking prestigious, or not driving a BMW, etc. it‚Äôs very prevalent in wealthy areas.
Thank you.
I can't that's why it is the way it is. Not everything is in your hand. And if you don't know anything about someone then it's better to stfu. It would have been better than being so called preachy!!
I too broke the cycle. The last few years I have come to the conclusion that it's better to be an employer than to have children. I got rejected and totally shunned by my family for being lgbt and using weed.. That experience will stick with me for the rest of my life. My parents made theirselves out to be the most kindhearted, loving parents in the world and then in a blink of an eye, discarded me like a dirty rag...so how is that any different from having an employee? You make them do everything for you, and if they start to misbehave, then just fire them and never think of them again. At least when you're an employer, you are making money vs being on the hook for spending endless amounts of money with no guarantee that you'll see a return.

I figure the more people who have parents who created them and can't provide for them financially,  the cheaper I can source labor
Um no. I am referring to the other problems like over population, global warming, food shortages, etc. I don‚Äôt think I am as far down the rabbit hole as you are on the nihilism train.¬†

Absolutely. Her whole family has a twisted view on procreation. All of her siblings have at least 4 kids too.
Agree.
Or even worse, "life isn't fair" üôÑ
At the cost of others having a bad life, rich people can only exist right now because of poor people.
A good life that many others will suffer to maintain.
"Can" doesn't guarantee anything.
I have a good life because I know how to work for myself. My parents didn't need much money to set me up for success. This post is sick. People have children because they love each other and want to raise a family together. You people should seek psychological help.
You likely were set up for success early in life. I hope you appreciate it.
Where did you get your sources form?

Plus the solution to birthing people without consent is to make a society that people would consent to and provide medical assistance in dying to those who don't consent to life,

Because a lot of low quality of life is the direct result of discrimination and those people want to commit genocide on margalized people. They are trying to make life so unbearable that people choose not to reproduce as a form of soft eugenics.

That's pretty interesting, and i agree. The utilitarian argument from a personal view, you would want to reduce suffering for the self, which can lead to increase in suffering for external entities, and societally you may increase your own suffering for the sake of lowering suffering in generality.

And you're also right about the calculus thing. The measurements of what suffering is and to what level is a very touchy subject, since it can invalidate some people's suffering when comparing to others, which isn't right either. Suffering is suffering, so quantifying it is rather dangerous imo.

Good post. Updoot for you.
Lies? Why do I need to prove myself?

It is easier to prove yourself as a loser than a winner. And i gain nothing from proving myself to a bot
Commute both ways and washing up/getting ready. And I was using large amounts of time for these to prove that you can have a bunch of time left over. In reality, you can use a lot less.¬†

People still have children in war zones. I cant wrap my head around that. And a lot of these places forbid adoption.
Why are you conflating poorness with suffering? Some of the happiest people are on earth are quite destitute. At least until they require healthcare.
Pyramid POWAHHHHHHH!

Which is why you picked nice round numbers like 18-22. Which would be what 5-9 years of college? Doesn't that usually begin around 3-4 years, not 5?

Assuming you go to college,  trades are usually only a couple of years to do, and total school time is like less than a year
Well it comes off as very I want to live if I don't have to work at it at all and get handed everything for a lifetime.

  
lol
Hack my back dude
That‚Äôs really only a persuasive argument for control freaks who think any of us every having agreed to our circumstances has any bearing on anything at all. The studies on choice show those things are not at all connected.
okay so sometimes when a man and a woman love each other....they make a baby. Now, the baby doesn't exist in anyway before the man and woman make the baby one night and can only come AFTER the man and the woman.
I do though, lmao, it's a fact of life. That's why murder is considered evil

I personally know dozens of business owners, and barely any of them had any money when they started. You need to acknowledge that billionaires aren't the only business owners.
The seed company I did research for treated their employees fantastically. I loved working there.

My husband's engineering firm treats him really well as well.
>This is great but how many companies do you know that treat their employees respectfully, both in terms of salary and day-to-day interactions? 

Almost every company owned by middle class people that I know personally. You only focus on the biggest players and ignore small and medium businesses.

1) Jeff Bezos isn't the only business owner
2) Jeff Bezos didn't force anyone to work for him
I know that this is an AN sub, but I just wanted to make a little point on what I quoted in the original comment. I had no intention to fully discuss antinatalism, just the aspect of OPs assumptions.
Being born poor with good loving parents is better than rich bad parents. It's also viable enough
I've never heard of a poor person become middle class or rich ever
And once you reach 18 it‚Äôs all you need to get over whatever happened to you when you were growing up, like you can turn off a switch.
Why should anybody give a shit about anybody else more so than the kids they choose to have? Don‚Äôt try to sound so high and mighty about people making kids; is it possibly,maybe, there are people who think your dumb breeder parents should have decided to be childless? Or maybe they don‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business who is having kids, cause it‚Äôs none of their business.

The joke went over your head there, bud.

The joke is that their parents also said the same thing. Those kids ended up working at McDonald‚Äôs and other dead-end jobs and had kids they couldn‚Äôt afford. Those kids likely won‚Äôt become engineers or doctors either, since obtaining high-level jobs requires resources and money.

To raise an engineer or doctor, you need to provide children with resources for a better education, involve them in activities that encourage interest in engineering or medicine, and offer mentorship to help them make the right choices for success.

A high school dropout isn‚Äôt the best mentor for an engineer, nor can they afford to live in an area with a good school system.
That's a lie, one you regularly tell yourself to your own detriment. Your perspective and how you react to the trials of life are the ONLY thing you or anyone else has control over. That much IS in your hands.
Exactly. 

It‚Äôs all a scam. It‚Äôs power and psychological mental torture.
Of course you're not, you have children that you will worry about for the rest of your life.¬†


You still didn't answer my questions. If you knew terrible things could happen to your children and that they would eventually die, why did you become a parent?
Man, he was just fucking evil. He controlled everything in both of our lives, until one day she went to the police, had him arrested, and then we both left to go to her country of Taiwan, where I currently live and reside.
Yup, it‚Äôs very dismissive
Then eradicate capitalism, not mankind
They have the means to guarantee it. It's up to them to act on it.
Hahaha seems like they struck a nerve üòÇ
Did you consent to being born? Did you consent to taking on all the challenges that life has to throw at you? Did you consent to dedicating 18-26 years of your life to becoming educated so you can work and enrich someone else and take on a life of debt doing so? 

Yes, yes, and yes? Well this post isn't about you.
If you love your kids you won‚Äôt have them.
People have kids for selfish reasons. The world is sick. Elon Musk demands more wage slaves and I feel the people doing the bidding of the corporate overlords are the sick ones. You know you are bringing innocent children here to work most of their lives for a smaller piece of the collective pie. Forcing them to play a sadistic version of musical chairs until they die. 

I don't know if you are from America. But here, you can get sick or injured, and all the hard work you have put in won't save you. You are no longer a productive worker bee, and your life now has no value to society. Now you're just a mooch. A broken person without access to reliable Healthcare. *I don't feel this way. This is terrible, but this is the society we live in.*

I'm a conditional antinatalist. I'm not against people having children if we had a fair, equitable society where anyone can succeed. But that's not what we have. The top 1% holds about 30% of the total wealth. The bottom 50% get to fight over about 2.6% of the total wealth. 

If you want to start a family with a partner you love, you can adopt. Someone has already forced the innocent child to play our sick game. Damage already done. If you want to bring an innocent child here on purpose, you should seek psychological help. 

Ps. Climate change. Are you not paying attention? The earth is begging us to stop bringing more people here.
I think if you read between the lines you might come to understand a lot of people on this sub didn't have what you might have had - love.

So instead of gloating about it why don't you just get the fuck out and let people be? 

But yeah, I do agree, poor people just add more fuel to the fire for rich people.   
  
But congratulations and good for you.
I‚Äôm not anti Natalist but even I understand this perspective
I just worked my tail off.  Starting with school, through college, and now on the job.  It can still be done. Gotta work. Real.  Hard.  It‚Äôs not fun sometimes, but I find it is worth it.
if you are working in a job, you to as well lmao.
Why are you not acknowledging the lack of consent? Life is forced on to you.
You just answered a big part right there lol

Control freak? Asking for consent? What?

Also, what about victims of terminal cancer, should they not have an option to end themselves because according to you "Being alive is better than not being alive"?

And how is it a "fact of life"? What if I think life sucks? Are you going to decide for me that it doesn't?

Plus, what does any of that have to do with choosing not to have children because it's selfish on multiple levels? Is that murder to you?
At least I get to made that choice
Considering that new businesses mostly fail and that people in poverty can't make savings, they're lucky if they don't fall more and more into negative... I'm pretty sure your dozens of business owners  weren't actually in poverty when they started.

Sometimes when well-off people say things like "I had no money at all!" or "I will lose everything if we fail!" they just mean the level of their employees, which is hopefully above poverty.
We you say business owners...do you mean people that actually pay their staff so their staff doesn't have to run around working 3-4 jobs to make ends meet? 

Do you mean people that pay their fair share of tax? 

I can create a company and call myself a business owner, that doesn't make me a good or solid person, yeah?
How long are these people in business for? Do they sell an actual physical product or are they doing passive income/landlords/drop shipping? Are you aware of how they start a business and run it successfully with no money? 


I'm being genuine, I'm betting more than just me would love to know the answers.
Point 2 is highly flawed because jobs are not optional. Most people *must* work to survive.

The Global Slavery Index estimates that 50 million people are experiencing slavery.
‚ÄòLoving‚Äô parents wouldn‚Äôt allow a child to be born without proper resources.
I doubt every poor parent is loving. 

Source: my poor parents were definitely not
I would've much rather had bad rich parents that turned me into a spoiled little prick who never had to work a day in his life. Grinding just to survive sucks ass.
Yes exactly. It‚Äôs magical you didn‚Äôt know that. It‚Äôs not even that. It‚Äôs way sooner they even expect it when your little and the reason is society and other breeders rather just ignore. They don‚Äôt care about solving. Just out of sight out of mind.
That wasn‚Äôt the point. The point was those three groups are always lecturing us about how precious yet don‚Äôt give a shit about anyone other than themselves. It‚Äôs really just virtue signaling. It has nothing to do with having kids or not in the previous.
>¬†think your dumb breeder parents should have decided to be childless


I think my parents should have been childless
I know. I was illustrating that oftentimes those three groups ignore the fact that in order to achieve those kinds of jobs you have to have huge resources and the vast majority don‚Äôt have those resources.
Ok. I know little  of what you are saying is that important -my dh grew up with lower middle class parents. Who didn‚Äôt encourage him at all. Didn‚Äôt help or expect that he would go to college. When the school complained about his behavior his parents refused to help. He went to college on a grant and for Engineering. He has a decent job will retire after  over thirty five years on the job. My point is it is up to the individual what path they take. Putting this on the Parents abilities  or finances is pathetic.
Stf
Do you wish you wish you had never been born? ¬†I don‚Äôt wish that. I think that most people would rather have a life even knowing that they will die
Capitalism is a very small part of the problem but it doesnt end the inherent issues with existence.
Why not both?¬†

I just think this sub is a fucking joke. Victims of brutal ethnic cleansing don't whine as much as these people.
Fuck yeah brother. I loved school and just existing from the get go. I used to hate having to go to sleep because there was just so much to do and learn. I absolutely consent to working foe the enrichment of others too. I teach...
As I said, you likely were nurtured physically and mentally well, something most children in poverty are not.
Because that point is pointless. My mother caused me to exist with almost no input from anyone else, and I fully blame her for bringing me into the world just to be her emotional support human, but the only logical conclusion to truly believing that your consent was violated just by being born is to kill yourself. That's why no one will acknowledge your stupid point on this otherwise correct post.¬†
So it‚Äôd be fine to not have someone born due to your own reasoning then, without their consent (according to your logic). No being will ever have the thought ‚Äúwow, so glad I was not born due to my live being pre decided for me.‚Äù 
I have no children. I am not ‚Äúpro birthing.‚Äù But you are literally flipping a coin and saying ‚Äúsee? This is the worst!‚Äù For the shitty half of the coin.
So we‚Äôre going to just deny people life because it gets uncomfortable toward the end?
Yeah, yeah, it is controlling when you are talking about imagining what someone who doesn't exist yet, would say about life. 

It's just birth, one of nature's processes - there's not a realistic conversation for you to have with a zygote - nor can it sign any legal papers, it's okay to stop pretending consent is some polite option you are listing. It's not. 

We are plain old talking about sexual reproduction of an animal species - most people are following their biological urges/actions on some level.
To be born? And for everything in life that happens afterward. Yes. That‚Äôs unhinged. Life is a natural process. It‚Äôs bizarre (and unusually fortunate!) that humans can control it to the extent we can. And yet, for all that control, we‚Äôre not happier or better off.
Now you're just moving the goal posts.

It's not any of those things. It's never existing in the first place so.....you'd be the base elements from the periodic table?

So.... It's better being the base elements than being a human? That's what you're jealous of? The base elements?

okay i guess.

I'll take being human.

>We you say business owners...do you mean people that actually pay their staff so their staff doesn't have to run around working 3-4 jobs to make ends meet? 

Yes

>Do you mean people that pay their fair share of tax? 

Yes

>I can create a company and call myself a business owner, that doesn't make me a good or solid person, yeah?

I've never claimed that having a business makes you a good person, although I see that people here think that business owner = scumbag oppressor
>How long are these people in business for?

Depends on the person, but 5-15 years.

>Do they sell an actual physical product or are they doing passive income/landlords/drop shipping?

Almost all of them sell physical products, and I know that some of them also rent their additional apartments if they own any, but I don't know anyone who does it as their primary income.
Yes, but nobody is forced to work for him specifically. You can choose other companies.
What does it have to do with absolutely anything I said?
What you consider proper resources is over exaggerated
Yeah but I didn't say that
Knew a bunch of guys like that who offed themselves or ended up cocaine addicts
i think mine should've too.
What I know of doctors families is that they like to mooch off their relatives for every reward or accolade their medical student gets. I‚Äôm tired of paying entitled adult medical student baby atta boys every time these adults who are 30 pass another of their tests. I‚Äôm tired of helping  to fund your college. While you live at home. Get a life.
Yes, I wish I was never born. You may not but people you know and love may come to feel that way.¬†


But, AN isnt about my life, it's the cruelty of people to each other and the brutality of nature, a never ending cycle of suffering and death that I'm opposed to.¬†
Completely agree with you. Material power don't guarantee no suffering. To say otherwise would be natalist apologism. 

However having wealth does help prevent _some_ forms of suffering like poverty, lack of food, lack of healthcare, need to rent, maybe need to work, stress about bills, debt, insecurity, instability, etc
If they're rich they do
Blah blah blah.
You do not have to partake here. No one is forcing you. You are consenting to participate in this sub. So, if you get ridiculed, it is on you. For your own health, just block this sub and move on. Check out Mommit or Parenting if having kids is your thing.

I say this respectfully but that is not what consent is. At the moment nearly 1/8 people in the world live in extreme poverty. I think they would rethink being born if they could, but such a mechanism does not exist. Look at the people in North Korea; they are literally prisoners that exist in the millions to support 1 man. Does that not provoke any thought into further planning in life before having children, to not feed a machine that depends on poor people to have kids and continue the terrible cycle of poorness that they depend on for the economic model?
Nope.  I worked for it.  Overcame the obstacles.  It‚Äôs possible.  You can do it yourself!

I was referring to the healthcare portion, which is not applicable to just the end of life.
> To be born?

Yes. Unborn children can't give consent to being born and taking on all of the trials and tribulations of life. Then do not have kids. Really want kids? Then you better do everything in your power to set this kid up for life. How? Make a ton of money OR become financially stable OR get an amazing job that can provide you and your child a great life. Can't? Then do not have kids. 

Or, you are just creating a drone for rich people and exposing them to a life of cruelty and suffering. There are 1,000,000,000 (nine zeros) living in abject poverty. Working 80-100 hours a week or no work because there isn't any. **What did they do to deserve a shitty life?**
I agree on that one
Think carefully about that last paragraph and then think about why there are so many unhappy people.
It‚Äôs interesting that you view my expectations as over exaggerated rather than considering that you‚Äôve been conditioned to accept scraps and are willing to pass that along to another generation.
You didn‚Äôt not say it.
I agree.
They do not,you cannot pay the Angel of Death to go away,you cannot pay for all maladies to go away,money gets you something but not everything

Right, so most people who have kids can and do take care of them. You don't have to call your self anti anything to want to promote women's rights and education that will lead to population stability or even slight decreases...

He has no idea how to respond to you. 100/100.
Because they have delusional beliefs
It really is absolutely fine to live humbly, objectively
And you didn't not say that you hate children. What's the point in what you are saying?? Clueless
Still, you do not understand the most basic level of this argument: No one is consenting to life. Life is being forced on people. The people doing the forcing are not doing anything to prepare the new life for a great life. They are just having the kid and setting them free to be subject to all the shit that makes life terrible, from low wages, debt, disease, and all the other crap that life has to throw at us. And my argument is, get rich or financially stable and then have kids. If not, you are just feeding the machine made by rich people. If you can't understand this, I have no idea what else to say.
