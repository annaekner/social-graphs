Malpractice case if my vagina was sewn shut? Signed a bunch of docs before delivery
I had a fairly traumatic birth 4 months ago. 22 hours of labor with contractions starting 5 min apart, not being brought to a birth room for 8 hours, resident put in my original epidural wrong because I apparently have 10% scoliosis so attending had to redo it. Not sure if you’ve had an epidural but they HURT. Then the catheter slipped and the epidural stopped working after just 5 hours and no one came to fix it. Was told to start pushing before I was at an appropriate station so I had to push for 5 hours. But the worst part of it all has been what the delivery doc did immediately post birth.

While I laid there in agony from feeling birth with no active pain meds, my doc furiously stitched me up for 35 minutes. I felt every stitch because she shot me with novocaine but immediately started sewing before the meds set in. Fair enough, I had a 3rd degree tear so she had to work quickly. But she sewed me SHUT. I’m not exaggerating, the hole was completely covered. In the fog of post birth, I remember the most painful part of the stitching was at the end, when she took her hands and sharply pressed outwards on both labia, as if to separate the stitches she just put in. I screamed in pain but she did it several more times.

I’m a first time mom so I didn’t know this isn’t normal. I thought she was “testing” the stitches, but now I know she was realizing her fuck up and trying to separate her overcompensation. Immediately after that, she started telling everyone in the room that I only didn’t have a fourth degree tear because I have a “long perenium”. This was said MULTIPLE times and charted so profoundly that the second doc I went to mentioned it the moment I went in.

4.5 weeks into my recovery I finally had the courage to look between my legs and see why I was still having so much pain standing, sitting cross-legged, and just in general after so long, and saw that I had no hole. I went to the doc who delivered me and she said “well, after you give birth the tissue is very edematous. This is within the range of normal. You are young and sexually active, have your husband do some perennial massage. You might have a very slight skin bridge and if you really want, I can snip it, but I’ve only had to do that once or twice in my entire 27 year career.”

I left feeling so depressed. I couldn’t even get my own finger in and was really looking forward to getting back to normal intimacy with my husband. I wouldn’t let him touch me for weeks even when we were messing around because I felt so painful and uncomfortable down there and spent so long fearing any other doctor in her practice would tell me the same thing and cover for her, when the only other doctor I trusted was on her practice. 

I had to beg to see the other doctor for my 6 week checkup because they didn’t want me to go to anyone but the doc who delivered me. It took until 10 weeks for them to finally let me see the other doc. When I finally got to the doc I trusted, she told me that I could potentially achieve penetration, but I’d need topical lidocaine creams and lots of lube. When I told her I wanted to enjoy having sex since I’m literally 28, she said “yeah I completely understand, if that doesn’t work call me and I will refer you to our urogynecologist so she can do surgery.” I asked if she could just snip it in office like the other doc had mentioned since it was just a skin bridge or labial adhesion, and she said “no this is the suturing and it would need to be revised on the operating table under anesthesia.”

Well, I tried to have sex and it was agonizing and unsuccessful. As I could see and feel, the hole was sewn shut. I went to the urogynecologist and she immediately got me into surgery (within 5 days) and the before and after pictures I took of my vagina are haunting. It looks normal now. It was so obviously sewn shut in the pictures before. She removed nearly two inches of skin that had previously blocked the entry. Turns out, I don’t have a “long perineum” at all. The recovery has been painful and has kept me from my bond with my son as I can’t hold him or get down on the floor and play with him. He’s starting to stop smiling at me when he sees me because I’m not getting quality time with him. 

All this to say I wouldn’t be seeking to sue if the delivery doc had been honest at the 4.5 week appointment. If she had even said something like “hmm it’s not healing right but you’re correct that intercourse would be unsuccessful and painful for you. Let me refer you to the urogynecologist.” I would have gone and that would be that. But I went through weeks of feeling depressed, mangled and unfixable only to have a delayed recovery since the doctor wanted to protect her reputation and have me just never have sex again I guess?? The pictures are clear as day that I was sewn shut. Do I have a malpractice case? I don’t want to go down this path if I have no shot at winning. I have no idea what I signed when I went in at the start of labor but I intend to give birth at the same hospital again with the doctor I trust, who is unfortunately in the same practice as the bad doc. 
Get copies of your medical records from your OB and your urogynecologist. Take those to consult with a few medical malpractice lawyers. These cases are very fact-intensive, and the records will be extremely valuable in helping an attorney figure out if you’ve got a strong potential case. 

I’m sorry this happened to you.
Not a lawyer, but you should talk to one. That was malpractice initially, negligence afterwards, and falsifying your records. Who knows how many other women have been impacted by this doctor? There was absolutely no reason for you to have gone through everything you did during the delivery then get forced into that recovery process. Best of luck from a fellow mother.
NAL but I’d couple whatever you do legally with some sort of psychologist or psychiatrist. You will need to work on getting past these feelings in the moment so that you can connect again with your child. There is absolutely still hope for your bond and ways to make this happen!
This is far outside of reddit's scope.


Get a lawyer. NOW.
NAL. You should post this on r/AskDocs, and find out if this is a common complication with tears. If it is a common known complication, I unfortunately don’t think it would be worth your time and energy.

It certainly seems like a possibility, but malpractice is really complicated and a lawyer is definitely necessary.  Doctors are allowed to make mistakes as long as they're reasonable. And with severe tearing it might be a mistake an ordinary doctor could have made.  Of course, it doesn't seem like it but that's why a lawyer is needed.

Makes sense, I’ll do a consult to see what a lawyer thinks. But yeah, if she had just made the mistake and tried to fix it when she realized or when I complained at the 4.5 week visit (where she examined me), I wouldn’t want to sue. It’s the pretending massage would remove 1.5+ inches of skin and basically being gaslit that made everything unbearable
Exactly she needs to consult with a doctor. Doctors are human,they are most definitely allowed to make mistakes, because, well they are humans. But with everything stated, the doctor knew they messed up, put false information into her record, and proceeded to not actually fix the mistake they made but gaslighted her. Lawyer up, only way to go.
Oh, absolutely! I'm certainly not trying to discourage you. It's just an extremely complicated kind of legal case and I wanted to dial in your expectations a bit.
My sister sold magic cards. Now the card shop says they’re counterfeit
So my sister decided to sell her mtg cards and the shop quoted her a total of 42,000 USD for the lot. Many were from the 90’s and were quite valuable. Now, the shop says they’ve determined they were counterfeit and refuse to pay or give the cards back. They have yet to provide substantial proof that they were fake

From my understanding, they have no legal grounds to hold the property. Obviously it would be illegal for my sister to sell potentially fake cards, but we want to have them tested by an independent party to the sale.

We do have reason to believe they may be real. The card shop *just so happened* to have listed the same cards for sale on their website after receiving my sister’s lot of cards. This could be a coincidence, but something rubs me the wrong way. Any advice would be appreciated! 

Edit:

I appreciate all of the advice! As I said in some comments, I’ve confirmed at least some of the cards are fake so I’m inclined to believe the shop. While I don’t agree with the policy (and stand by my assessment that it’s technically illegal) I don’t think it’s unreasonable for them to have it in place. I will not be naming the shop as I have no interest in being an asshole to a store that’s just trying their best 

Also, while I appreciate the advice, please stop private messaging me. I don’t know jack shit about mtg and there’s not much I can tell you that I haven’t said here. 🫶
42k is definitely lawyer territory.

This whole thing sounds really fishy. You would typically see major transactions on collectibles like this when the product has been sealed and rated by an authority. This would mean it has documentation and has been determined legitimate by that authority. Were your sister's card rated? Or were they just loose cards that she'd collected?

If the shop offered to pay that high a price for loose cards with no guarantee of authenticity, it starts to smell like a scam because that's a crazy way to operate. Even if your sister gets her cards back, how will you know they are the same cards and haven't been swapped out for frauds in the time they've been in the shops possession? This whole thing is very complicated by the fact that the shop already has her cards before you had a trusted 3rd party look at them.
Did she have a contract?

The issue I would foresee besides the ones that have already been brought up is that if the cards are in the shop’s possession and they claiming they are counterfeit, your sister has no idea if the cards are gonna try and give back or her actual cards, or they took the valuable ones switched them and I just trying to give them back
How did this go down? Why didn't she receive payment at the time of handing over the cards?
Sounds like its time to lawyer up.
Sending 40k+ worth of cards via mail (even insured/registered) is pretty wild. I would drive my ass over to my nearest large city to sell that kind of inventory.

Unless you took meticulous care to do high resolution documentation and scans of each card with magnification, there may not be a way out of this that satisfies your suspicions.

I don't believe that most of the super large vendors for MTG would risk their reputation over 40k but it's not completely impossible. Unfortunately, even if they return them now you don't have any way to prove that any counterfeits they return are the exact cards you sent in.

Try to get a lawyer to draft a demand letter for the return of your property which should not be too expensive. Unfortunately; see above point about traceability...
>We do have reason to believe they may be real

*may* be real? Sounds super suspicious to me. So, as far as you know, they could be fake? Where did they come from? When did she acquite them?
I'm going to play devil's advocate and guess that these cards are in fact fake. For so few cards to total $40,000 these cards would have to be pristine copies of dual lands, power nine, and other things that your sister wouldn't likely own copies of unless she played competitive legacy or vintage. Many of these very large stores like card kingdom and star city games have other copies of these cards already listed so it's unlikely the listed ones were your sisters and purchase these cards at buy list prices are already getting a good enough deal that they don't need to steal your sisters cards and it isn't worth the risk to their reputation.


I would ask you sister specifically where she got these cards unless these were opened in packs by her 30 years ago she should remember spending 20k on these cards as they have likely always been expensive. If you have a list of the cards you should share them. 

If she didn't A. Open these cards herself 30ish years ago or B pay hundreds to thousands of dollars each per card within the last 20ish years then I would be 99% certain they are fake. Did she save back any of these expensive cards that she got around the same time? There are fairly easy tests you can do in living a jewelers loupe on the green dot on the back of a card to tell if it's counterfeit or not. Look up Green dot test.
Can you clarify the “we do have reason to believe they may be real” bit?

It sounds like the expectation was that they were *not* real until you saw those cards listed on the website.

Also, did they ever actually offer her 42k, or did they just say “these *could* be worth up to 42k, and we’ll know once we’ve had them graded”?
Did your sister do the green dot test on any of the cards? That would be the only valid reason to believe they are real. Also, it is unlikely that someone would purchase or sell such high value cards without at the very least doing that check themselves.
Was it a major retailer such as SCG or Channel Fireball? If they believe they have received counterfeit cards they won't return them, they'll destroy them.
Why would you give up the cards without the money?
I reallllllllllly hope she took pictures and logged what you sent in.  This is insane
Ask r/MagicTCG
Do you have pictures of any of the cards? The main hurdle is going to be that you have to prove that the cards they have in their possession are the cards she shipped. There is a chance some of the cards were real, but have now since been replaced by counterfeit copies. 

Very important question: What shop did she sell them to? Several of the biggest buyers in the country will not send you back counterfeit cards and they will even destroy them. 

If you'd like to reach out to me, I can help with some of the Magic side of things, but I am not a lawyer. I just have a lot of experience with Magic.
This sounds sketch AF. Some of those early print run cards command a 5 figure price just for a single card. 

I know there are a handful of card shops that make tentative offers or you basically send in your cards and they will quote a total.

The problem now is your sister has no way of verifying cards she gets back are not swapped with fakes. And IANAL but I can’t imagine they have the legal right to hold your sister’s property because they decided “it was fake”. Law doesn’t work like that, they aren’t the police, and even fake items can have some value. Lastly if your sister had losses of these cards from the 90s it seems unlikely they were faked. mTG has had faked throughout its lifespan (including some printed from the actual printer but an employee!) but if she had them from the 90s it seems that likelihood goes way down.  Agree with asking in the mtg subreddit and maybe name the company to get other experiences. 
Wait… why did she just give them the cards without any money in hand first? There’s so many ways that could go wrong.
Get authorities involved yesterday! If I were to think like I scammer, I'd be looking for fakes to buy and swap out for the most valuable cards she sold them. Once acquired, they will return the fakes and keep the originals. I'm not saying that's what they're doing. Im just saying that if I was scamming, that's what I would do.
It seems odd that there wouldn’t be more care involved with handling these expensive cards. I hope she’s not keeping anything from ya. Anybody I know that collects these including myself are very careful with our reserved list cards which is what this sounds like.
It's also not *technically* illegal, or really even illegal at *all* for her to sell counterfeits to the card shop. It's their responsibility to verify their authenticity, not the customer's.
You could get a lawyer and try to sue them but if you don't want the expense of a lawyer I'd suggest just reporting the theft to the police.
42k is definitely get into a plane and bring them to them in person.

Its also, a malicious employee or company is likely to swap them out territory.

Lawyer up, like, right now.
[Content removed by user.]
Isnt the general rule for the sale and purchase of used items ‘as is’? I’d lawyer up and sue them for the money
Send a lawyer after them may just scare em enough to just relinquish them. Doubt you'll get the 42k
$42k you should've driven them to the store regardless of distance and you should have kept them in eyesight. Either this never happened or y'all are regarded and deserve to get hustled.
If this was any of the big mtg seller like Card Kingdom, CFB, or Starcity Games then their policy is to destroy counterfeits as it’s illegal for them to mail back illegal products so that someone else can be scammed.

People will then just report that they switched out the cards for fake ones. 

It’s very easy to counterfeit old MTG cards.

If they are real show them proof. Did you do the green dot test on them? A $5 loupe from Amazon would have been quick and easy to do.

IN THE UNITED STATES IT IS ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO KNOWINGLY RETURN A COUNTERFEIT BECAUSE UDER 18 U.S. Code § 2320  IT IS A FELONY TO KNOWING SHIP A COUNTERFEIT except by court order, to turn it over to the FBI, or with written permission from patent/copyright/trademark holder
Call the police, call a lawyer. $42k and they won't pay OR return the property is 100% theft, and any lawyer is going to be REALLY fast to say "well if they were willing to STEAL...."


They'll settle, but make sure you get the worth of the cards ($42k) PLUS the cost for time it takes to gather the cards (ie, cover the lawyer cost)
They probably took out cards that they had fakes of (maybe they got them in trades or accidentally bought them from others), replaced their fakes with the good cards and your sister’s good cards with their fake cards, and now they want to return them all. Nope. The deal is the deal if they were EVER out of your sister’s possession or sight.
Get police involved NOW. The more time that elapses the more time the shop owner will have to acquire fakes to swap out with your highest value cards. Also in the future never let some random small local company hold on to 42k worth of your property like that. If your doing large value transactions you need to work with reputable companies who specialize in those kind of transactions.
Whether they were counterfeits when you gave them to them, I can guarantee what you get back, if you get them back, will be counterfeits.

Take the website and do a control s on it. Save everything you can as proof of what they are doing.
Yeah this is def a lesson learned. Their policy is to grade the cards themselves. They were loose cards but some came from sealed packaging I believe. It was blindsiding because this shop is a big name in MTG and has a good reputation. However this policy of refusing to give disputed cards back could easily be abused. I wish I had known to tell her to have them graded independently first. Regardless, we at least want the damn things back.
Shops buy tens of thousands of dollars of TCG cards without grading, that's pretty normal in the industry.  The market for graded cards is far smaller as they can't be played then.
And police report
This is my concern too. I’m gonna find out exactly what kind of documentation my sister has of the cards before they were sent. If she took photos of them, we may be able to prove it if they do send back different cards. Fingers crossed 🤞
They were shipped to the store since we live several states away
Lol yes. I’m capable of this but I’m hoping the threat of litigation (and potential theft charges as the potential dollar amount qualifies for a felony) would be enough to get the cards back
Yeah that’s my thoughts exactly. I was not aware of the card values before we mailed them or I would’ve been more insistent on precautions.

I also don’t particularly think the seller is trying to scam us, as I don’t think they’d risk their reputation. But it’s also not impossible that there are individual employees that may be bad actors.
Yep. That line sounds a lot like an OP who says "I dont believe there is any proof the items I have are the ones that were stolen from the store" instead of "I did not steal anything"
What's crazy to keep is while question of where did she get them keeps being asked, and never answered. If they were real there'd be a response to this question.
Interesting choice of words, for sure.  Sounds like they are fake and OP suspected they were.  If the shop was going to verify them first, then I’d doubt they would agree to a price before verification.  No reputable shop (OP’s words) would agree to a price on a box of mailed cards from another state, at least not in any legally binding way.  I bet the best OP can hope for is getting the cards back.
One card, worth less than a dollar, was paid for. It came from the same sealed package as cards they are claiming are fake. This is what gives me pause. It’s possible that the cards were fake and then resealed to begin with, but I want them in hand to verify myself.
i got a feeling its one of them with what op has described in their comments
Yeah, I would guess sister had some nice quality fakes that she likely didn't know about and sent them to SCG or similar.  I don't know what would happen to the rest of the collection (seems unlikely they would all be fake) if it is partially counterfeit, but I sort of doubt OP ever had 42k to begin with.
But what are the odds that they're all fake?  Unless she bought her whole collection, all at once from one seller, the chances are that she has some genuine and some fakes.
It was a major card seller, which is why i am inclined to believe that they may in fact be fake. I don’t think they would risk their reputation like that. However, as far as I understand, it’s not actually legal for them to keep the cards if we want them back. They don’t have the legal authority to seize counterfeit goods, regardless of what their policies may be
Unfortunately the cards were rare and expensive and the victim of counterfeiting as far back as the 90s. There's a whole generation of fakes called "rebacks" made by splitting the front and back of the card and basically Frankensteining Collector's Ed' cards to appear to be their more expensive Beta counterparts.
And the post office
They said it's a major shop (so likely SCG, CFB or the like) and they shipped them several states over so it sounds like they submitted to a buylist online and when the shop received the cards and checked them (all standard procedure) they determined they were fake. At this point the cards will be destroyed, they legally cannot ship back counterfeit cards. They do, so far as I know, show evidence of the destroyed cards which also shows they are fakes.
So, PSA is breaking the law every time they send back a fake card?  

Authenticity is part of grading.     The shop didn't agree to buy the cards sight unseen.  OP had to ship them first and the shop would evaluate them.  It should go without saying that if some of the cards are not in the expected condition or authenticity then they'd lower or rescind the offer.   There's no reason why they couldn't return the 'questionable authenticity' cards.
They already said it was one of the big name vendors. They're not getting the cards back, they destroy fakes they receive.

Their store policy doesn't trump the law. If they don't return the cards, then its theft. Therefore, they stole your sister's property. Gather evidence, file a police report, and find a lawyer.

So you just shipped 42000$ worth of cards and you didn't get payment? 

Wow. What were you thinking?
Oh so they went interstate through a shipping service? Doesn't that also turn this into interstate wire fraud as well as theft?

# 941. 18 U.S.C. 1343—Elements of Wire Fraud.
Wouldn't that threat be more effective if it was coming from a lawyer and not you?
People who are serious about using a lawyer DON'T SAY they're getting a lawyer. They just have the lawyer make contact. The satisfaction you think you'll get by rattling their cage is much less than what you'll feel after you take them to the cleaners.   
  
I'm sure your lawyer will tell you this, but at this point  you should stop responding to them and let your attorney do the talking. It will be far more effective than anything you have to say.
[deleted]
Where did you get the cards? If it's one of the big online shops, it's unlikely they're scamming you. It may not be right of them to keep the cards, but it's likely they are fakes
I wonder how much they paid for the fakes that they are going to these lengths to recover them. They've already proven to be ineffective so I can't imagine they're worth anything.
Yeah nothing says legit like saying it's happening to a third party and refusing to provide any relevant details lol
The way it generally works is you submit the cards, they show you what they are worth under the claimed conditions, but they reserve the right to reject them or offer a lower price and there is no agreement or offer prior to the store checking the condition themselves.
Are you saying the buyer opened sealed product?!? Never heard of such a thing. Stores who buy collections inspect/grade them and offer a price to purchase. Shenanigans are happening and I’m not sure which end. If your sister thought they were possibly worth anywhere close to five figures she should have known to not mail them.
Definitely my read too.
It looks like it was around 80 cards from another post they made. Which means it was a small set of very high end cards, which is pretty much exactly how counterfeits are sold by the well known providers.
They legally cannot send them back if they're counterfeit.
Check the time marks. OP revealed that the buyer was one of the big online stores 20 min after I made my comment.

So these cards were definitely fake then. Even the OP wasn't aware of this then the sister probably was. You don't acquire a  "42k" collection like that without knowing the providence of your more valuable pieces.

It is common policy for stores like this to destroy fakes rather than risk them going back into circulation. Legally, they technically don't have the right to do this. But, you want to think carefully before you go down the legal angle against a company you attempted to defraud for 5 figures.
After they took them they could switch them out for fakes. Sue for payment

I know hindsight is 20/20 but holy shit. If this is the whole story….oof.
IANAL I AM a Magic player. Bit of context. Local game stores buy and sell relatively expensive cardboard regularly. $42,000 is still above what you would typically see other than a very large game store and very old and valuable cards. 

At $42K, we are talking large company buylist. Shipping your cards in and the retailer grading them and then paying you is standard practice.

Again, $42,000 is a lot of money in the sense it's significantly bigger than your average transaction, but certainly possibly selling old cards to Card Kingdom. But we are likely approaching the range of "take a flight to their HQ with the cards" territory rather than just mail them in.

As a magic player, $42K is going to almost certainly make these higher end and mostly older magic cards, AKA the stuff you are most likely to meet counterfeits of.
Seriously. 42K isnt worth a day driving there to ensure the cards are received and get cash in hand?

Honestly that part of the story makes it harder to believe the cards were legit. A neutral party hearing this story is going to think they were hoping to pull a fast one thru the mail and if the cards are realized to be fake get them sent back and try again.
Yeah I know. I didn’t realize it was 40k, when she told me about the sale I misunderstood and thought it was 4k. I wish I had realized just how much money she had been quoted before I helped her mail them out. 4k didn’t seem like a huge risk. 40k is enough to buy a new car
Is there an intent element? I’m an attorney but not criminal. Intent may not be needed but seems like it would be.
Oh shit I didn’t even realize that. If we can prove the cards were real that could be an even bigger problem. Thank you for pointing that out!
100% this. 

Dude is out 42k and thinks now is the time for threats and non-action. 

Assuming the cards were legit, every day he gives the shop without taking strong legal action is one more day for the shop to swap those cards with actual counterfeits and pull some extra shady bs.
Exactly, nothing makes me rest easier than hearing someone threaten me with legal action. Never in my life have I actually received a court summons after someone threatened to sue me.
This is what I'd be worried about. Ungraded cards get sold, an indeterminate amount of time later (OP hasn't provided a timeframe for any of these actions) the shop says "whoops, they're fake!" with no way to prove, even if the shop is holding fake cards, that those fakes came from OP.
The one question that isn’t being answered in the whole thread.
Sounds more like he's not familiar with the system and thought something was wrong. Notice that the sister who actually owned the cards has not been referenced as actually complaining or taking any action. If anyone knew they were fake it would be her
Is there a chance that OP is a counterfeiter?
PSA sends fake cards back ungraded and keeps the fee.
[removed]
Yes, but doesn’t this apply only if they can prove the items are fake?
Returning suspected counterfeit goods does not fall under the definition of "traffics".
That law says for purposes of commercial advantage. I don't believe returning to a potential seller qualifies
No one is shipping it.  Not returning the cards is theft.
I just looked up that code and it explicitly says what items would fall under it. Counterfeit mtg cards don't count in that law due to that they don't fall into any of the items it listed.
Thanks for the explanation.

Grading them after they receive them makes sense but even if they are counterfeit what gives the company the right to keep them?

Property is property.
Tbh my sister just thought she got super lucky with their value and wanted to stick with this shop bc she’d had good experiences with them before. Magic is something she played as a hobby a long time ago. She never would’ve tried to sell them if she knew they were fake, she does not want to get into any legal trouble
You seem to be acting like your sister is a little kid in need of your guidance instead of an adult entering a transaction on her own. If she is being iffy around the details you should consider the possibility she knew they werent real. Im also not sure how

Did she buy these on her own 25+ years ago from sealed product? With all due respect, if they were somewhat recently acquired it is highly likely they were fake because if she really knew she was selling legitimate cards she would be the one here.
Honestly with all their excuses, I'm starting to thinks it's fake.
Exactly. Plenty of replies have asked where did the cards originate from but OP has not replied back to any one of those. So this makes the background of OP's story a bit suspect. You don't ship out $42k without some kind of insurance in place. Hell, I wouldn't even ship out $4k worth of cards like that as OP thought they were originally worth.
I'd bet you my house they aren't real. All the talk about it being the sister, not knowing how anything works, refusing to say where the cards came from, not saying what store they tried to scam, it's all just shady as hell. Why would a store try to steal 40k just hoping the person on the other end was clueless and did nothing to prove they actually had real cards? None if it makes sense.
I would find that highly unlikely. As far as I've heard, Counterfeiters now make their money selling to people looking for high end proxies. Not to the large card buylisters that are more than sophisticated enough now to catch them pretty much all the time.

The counterfeits are usually sold in 'packages' as players looking for them rarely only want one card. This sounds like the Sister got one of these, hopefully not through ordering them herself, thought she had a gold mine and sent them in. 

One of the reasons this type of transaction is so dubious is how absolutely easy it is to tell a counterfeit  card. A simple 5 seconds test with a Jeweler's Loupe (a so called 'green dot' test) will eliminate like 99.9% of current counterfeits that aren't being created out of a multi-million dollar industrial grade printer. For high end cards there are even more easy tells. I find it strange that someone who had such a valuable collection could not do such simple checks. For the vast majority of counterfeits you can simply shine any light through the card and it will look different than a real card. MTG cards are very hard to perfectly counterfeit.
>”knowingly” 


Its also relevant and hard to define. They can’t just *steal* you shit op.

Get an attorney and file a police report.
Super easy to prove they are fake. Just use a loupe. Every MTG collector knows that.
It's property but if they are proven counterfeit then the damages are going to be hard to determine since their value is basically zero. For a very large reseller like SCG or CK that would do these type of sales I'd have to imagine they are keeping documentation/evidence.

Edit: For those not familiar with the market. Just for some additional information I will say that it is usually EXTREMELY easy to tell if a Magic Card is counterfeit. There are multiple very easy, very fast tests that a counterfeit will fail. I do not believe it's possible for a perfect counterfeit of these types of cards that the OP is referencing to exist, as they are likely vintage MTG cards from decades ago and you'd also have to match the ink, stock, and aging. 

Honestly in my PERSONAL opinion if someone tried to sell me such a high end vintage collection and it was all counterfeit, I would have a hard time believing they didn't know it was counterfeit. That combination of assets with an absolute lack of expertise usually only happens on staged showings of Pawn Stars and Antiques Roadshow
That part is certainly a question for the lawyers here.
It is illegal to knowingly ship counterfeits. 


And since magic cards are gambling the counterfeits thing sticks. 


This sounds like part of the story is missing, and or the shop is super shady. 
Honestly, we're sitting on a stupid 40-50k of magic cards from our youth. About 20ish+ yrs ago. The scenario is not unheard of. If she's about our age or even older then I have to say this is very possible. This is only from decks, we sold off our other cards previously.
For sure, but so far they have not provided this proof to us. What stops them from just claiming they’re counterfeit and keeping them?
Magic cards are not gambling, Hasbro spends millions to ensure that.
The store itself wouldn't because that's just terrible business. The potential reputation damage isn't worth 40k. If it's an individual employee running a con they probably just assume you won't do anything about it. 

It's possible when you sent them in you agreed to this as some kind of term. Do you sign for anything or get any kinds of terms of service when you sent them in? I'm not sure if a term like that would even work but it might the case
[removed]
>It’s extremely easy to make counterfeits of old cards that are indiscernible from the real deal. Happens all the time.

Lmao 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
On the shop to prove they're fake, can't just steak someone's shit on a hunch.
I guess we all should know what you’re laughing about.
My schools prom changed the rules to attending after selling hundreds of tickets, no refunds.
My school prom changed the rules of attending after most of the students already bought their tickets. The new rules were that you could not have more then 4 absences in the school year and 12 tardies. Almost everybody can not attend now. The students are mad and the school is saying no refunds to tickets already sold. Tickets were 65 each and 100 for couples. Over 240 tickets have been sold prior to the new rules. Is there any legal action our parents can take? 

Update: I took the advice that you guys left on the comments. I notified my parents and friends to tell their parents. Enough parents complained and they ended up keeping their rules and offering refunds at first but then once everybody got their refunds they realized that they had sold basically no tickets so they removed the rules all together and now everybody can attend prom. Thank you guys for the advice.
There is certainly a cause of action for a lawsuit if the rules were changed after purchase with no option for refund. They are taking money without offering the promised service or a refund.

The dollar amount of damages are pretty low though, but with so many people effected, someone might be willing to take the case

I would suggest getting together a list of all the people effected by the rule change, then contacting some of the more vocally mad parents with that list to bring to an attorney

They might have to shop around to find a lawyer who would take the case, but if you want justice from the school district on this, it's the only way. 

I imagine if the district are contacted by an attorney, they'll realize their mistake once it's explained they could be liable, and settle for a refund + the attorneys fees back.

Lawyer but not yours, not legal advice. Sue in small claims court. You all can do it individually. Don’t file on the same day; stagger it so that there are multiple court dates. Perhaps when served with that many complaints inconveniently scheduled they will relent. File fee waiver if you’re a kid with no money.
Definitely complain to the board.
Where? Public or private?

> Almost everybody can not attend now. 

How much is "almost everybody"? 230 out of 240 people?

But this is something for your parents to take up, if need be. Kids can't sue, and this isn't enough to sue over. And in theory at least, if someone has a ticket, they should be allowed in, correct? How will the parents at the door know how many tardies you have? (But discuss that with your parents as well.)
That number sounds oddly specific. It sounds like they’re altering the rules to fall in line with state attendance requirements to be eligible to participate in after school activities. I would look into your handbook and see if those numbers do indeed mean that. If they do, then it’s likely they never needed to inform you anyways as it’s already policy and ignorance of a policy is not an excuse as to violating it. 

EDIT: the above advice is for insight into what to look up to prepare to approach the school. Because it’s likely what they will tell you. It is NOT saying they are SOL. 

You should also gather parents of students at the school to complain about it if you want to make any ground.

Not necessarily so small. Dress that isn't likely to be worn elsewhere, tux rental, deposit on limo rental. Easily several hundred dollars/couple. Some of it depends on how much notice was given. I can see why the school doesn't want to give refunds because of monies spend on the venue, but that isn't the kid's problem.
At least in IL, could you sue a school district in small claims court? Because this situation is exactly what small claims is for, right?
[removed]
Public school. I wouldn’t know an exact number but I know almost my whole grade has more than 30 tardies as they haven’t really enforced tardies until today. It is probably 3/4 of the people with prom tickets. You also have not been allowed to fail a single class in the school year. In my school the previous years it has been school monitors at the doors checking you in with your student id number, all except for students from other schools.

4 days off in a school year is nothing. My daughter has had many off last week after getting covid.

For a public school, the next step would be to go above your school admin and have your parents complain to the school board. Definitely contact the member who was elected to represent your area. Have all of your friend's parents complain to the school board as well.
As long as they offer refunds, they can do this. If they don't offer refunds, then your parents are going to need to try to get the refunds. Or change the school's mind about the rule.
[removed]
Yes they shouldn’t have. Which is why a complaint is warranted. I’m just giving them advice on things to be aware of heading in. Our school pulled this too and parents had to step in to get kids refunded. They still couldn’t go to prom because of state policy though.
This is not correct. You can file claims against businesses through small claims court, at least in some states. I haven’t heard of any states that don’t allow small claims court to handle lawsuits against businesses.

Right. They need to offer refunds, and if they do offer refunds, they can refuse entry. It's a decision. Their "no refund" policy has to change, or their "no admittance" policy has to change. They can't have both.

My doc snuck in an expensive cancer screener in my lab work. I learned that she gets a commission. I feel tricked. Am I legally bound to this bill or should I fight it?
So I went to my doctor for my annual exam and asked for a pap and all the checks on my blood for hormones and health checks. After my pap, my doctor offered me a cancer screener from the company Grail. I asked if insurance covers it and she said that I could make payments on it every month. I replied, "I don't want it if my insurance isn't going to pay for it." She said that her lab assistant could help me with that information. The lab assistant who helped me told me that the doctor told her that I wanted the test. I told her that,"I don't want it if my insurance doesn't pay for it." She said,"Okay" and smiled before asking me to sign for several labs on my blood that the doctor ordered. The lab assistant gave me told me that Grail would contact me about fees. I figured that this meant that they would let me know fees and information somehow to get this done. Later after time, I received an email with an attachment that I opened that had cancer screening results and a $900 bill. After contacting them, their local representative, the lab assistants, the lab they worked for, and then the doctor, I finally got answers. The representative from Grail told me that the doctor's office receives a commission for every test they conduct and reminds the lab technicians to ensure that they ask clients before conducting the test if they agree to receive it. I did not agree. Grail keeps sending bills and says that they can't do anything about the bill I now owe. My doctor told me that I signed paperwork to have the test done, she remembers that I had initially told her that I wanted all the checks on my blood and that I can surely pay $30 a month for this test. I told her that I had told 2 medical professionals that I did not want the test and that I signed for my blood tests, not that one. I also told her that the lab assistant did not explain anything to me and that I didn't want another medical bill because I have other medical bills I pay every month. She said that no other client has complained and that all her clients are fully explained the test. I told her that I hadn't explained anything and that I must have slipped through her process. She let me know that I signed for it and that I was responsible for it. I feel tricked. Is she correct? I thought about filing with a small claims court. Does anyone know if I have a case that could win to give her the responsibility for this bill?
NAL.  I’m a pharmacy technician who takes a required fraud, waste and abuse module every year.

Report this to your insurance company.

Report this to Medicare.  I believe this falls under waste.  Even if you don’t have Medicare, they might be interested in the fact that a doctor that sees ~~Medicare~~ patients is performing tests without the patient’s consent.  If she’s performing unauthorized tests on you, it’s **very** likely ~~she is doing this test without Medicare patients’ consent as well~~ this is happening to Medicare patients as well.

Per the CMS (center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) website, you can call the Health & Human Services Office of the Inspector General
1-800-HHS-TIPS

Here is an explanation of fraud, waste and abuse.  The anti kickback statute is explained ~~in~~ on page 9.
https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/Fraud-Abuse-MLN4649244.pdf

Also, report your doctor to the medical board for your state.  Just Google your state medical board for their phone number.

I’m not sure what will come of this but it’s worth reporting.  Your doctor did an unauthorized test after you repeatedly told her you didn’t want her to.

Edit: I added a sentence.
If you are in the US, the doctor potentially broke an anti-kickback law as laid out by the Department of Health and Human Services:

https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/physician-education/fraud-abuse-laws/

Please contact your local health department to see what their reporting mechanisms are
NAL, but I do work for an insurance company. You can also see about filing a complaint about the doctor with your insurance, and if the test was billed to your insurance and denied I would also suggest filing a grievance essentially stating all of this information. Even if it wasn’t billed, you can try submitting for a reimbursement (depending on your policy) and when/if that is denied (or even if it only pays at insurance rates), file a grievance on that as well. It won’t make the doctor responsible for the costs, but could potentially remove your responsibility.
I am a physician and I would report this physician to their medical board.  Pretty sure getting kickbacks/commissions for tests ordered is against the law and completely unethical.  I would also report it to your insurance because they have a contract with your physician.  When you report it, ask to file a “formal grievance” or “formal complaint.”  This is so far beyond the pale.
Not a lawyer but I do work in healthcare. Contact your health insurance for the bill discrepancy then the OIG office of inspector general. This is fraudulent billing, not acceptable.
NAL, but I am a doctor. It is illegal for your doctor to get a commission or have any financial interest in a lab that she refers patients to. Report this to the state board.  As far as the cost, often the lab themselves will check with your insurance company before running the test and let you know what your portion of the payment would be and the lab would be the one getting your consent. Usually they do this to avoid having someone refuse to pay this surprise bill. Ask the lab to prove you consented to the test.
I would also (strongly) suggest getting a different doctor.
It is important you dispute the bill *in writing* with the billing entity.  Say you did not consent and the doctors office fraudulently requested  the work on your behalf.
You can call your State Attorney General Consumer Fraud division. They will be able to assist you and get your case to the appropriate divisions of state government. You should also call your insurance carrier and ask them for help. But you may end up owing the bill. Sorry
NAL. AFAIK, no insurance companies cover the GRAIL cancer screening test. It is a cash only test and the doctor's office should know this too.
[deleted]
I work for program integrity for the government in fraud, waste, and abuse.

Contact your insurance company and report this as fraud first.

Depending on what type of insurance you have their are other steps.

Medicaid and Medicare have websites to report fraud.

You can contact the medical board online in your state if in the USA and also report the doctor for kickback schemes. You can do this online.
If you are in the US: Do not pay this bill. Advise the company that you are pursuing a complaint against the doctor regarding violation of the anti-kickback statute. Read about that here https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/physician-education/fraud-abuse-laws/
Report the abuse and contact a lawyer.
well one things for sure, that cancer screener came back clean
Federal law, No Surprises Act: https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises
You are entitled to two levels of appeals of a coverage denial through your insurance company. The first is internal (often denied). The second is external. Although you blame your doctor, it’s worth exhausting the appeal process. Explain at each level that you were tricked into receiving it. Either the doctor or the manufacturer are capable also of writing this off. I would badger both with that request, and the appeal process will put further pressure on the doctor.
Ask for a copy of the form you signed as well as reporting your doctor. If you didn't sign the form you have more of a leg to stand on.

I had something similar happen to me. I let it go all the way to collections after they sold the debt. I settled a $1k with $25.
NAL. I am however a medical laboratiry technician. And in my job we have similar forms, called ABN forms. There are multiple options on the form, including one that states you do not want the test. I always tell patients to read the options before signing it. Not sure if this is the same or a similar form, but if you checked the "yes, i want the test and understand i will pay for it out of pocket, regardless of my insurance" box instead of the "I only want the test if my insurance covers it" box or the "i do not want the test" box, you may have a hard row to hoe here. Sorry if that is not the answer you wanted to hear, but your post made it seem like you were told twice you would need to pay out of pocket, and you gave your consent to have the test performed anyways.
OH HELL NO.  Do not pay one penny of this bill.  Also contact your US Senator and US Congressional Representative.  Go to their official .gov website and request assistance.  Your tax dollars also pay for your Senators and Congressmen's staff to assist their constituents with all sorts of matters.  Having a Senators office reach out to your physicians office to help clarify federal standards regarding kick backs can make ALL SORTS OF THINGS SUDDENLY STRAIGHTEN UP AND FLY RIGHT.  And, if you are 55 or older, this can also fall under elder abuse.  Yep, you go get them gal!  The audacity!
So they definitely broke some of the medical fraud laws, but u should know yourself it is fraud simply because they acknowledged that you didn't want the test and you signed under the pretense the test wasn't on the form. People have to read contracts, but the other party can't lie about the contents or meaning of the contract.

U just need to properly report the fraud, and with this proper reporting, you can collect compensation for various things that did or can happen. For example, a company can mishandle that debt and damage your credit.
On top of doing what everyone here has said, report the doctor and contact relevant boards, you should call her office and request a copy of all the paperwork you signed
Report to the medical board
Pretty sure this is about to happen to me with GeneSight, so I’m glad I saw the post. I was never notified/asked by them, was told I’d get a call. Just saw a claim with my insurance that was denied. 🤦🏻‍♀️ thank you for asking this and I hope it gets squared away soon!
I can't give you advice on your situation but I implore you if you feel you are not in the wrong to pursue this as far as you can within reason. My first doctor out of college did something similar to this a couple of times to me and I always just accepted it must be my fault because he's a doctor and he knows what he doing  But in the end he ended covering up two deaths related to a drug he was getting a payments to help trial with his patients - I'll always wonder way back in my mind if I complained more if something would have happened sooner and he wouldn't have been in the position to be involved in covering up those deaths. Every avalanche starts with one snowflake.
NAL but a healthcare worker, this a violation of your informed consent and like others have mentioned fraud or waste.

On the informed consent aspect, in addition to other channels it wouldn't be a bad idea to explore making a report to the medical board in your jurisdiction.
This is a violation of the anti kickback laws. Companies cannot specifically give doctors commission. Report her to the medical board and report the company to the FTC.
I would report the doctor to the state medical board, the lab to CMS, and fight the bill.

I used to think health insurance was a scam, until I become an RN and saw how much abuse do today do on a daily basis for money.
Are you in the US?  It is illegal in some US states for a doctor to receive a commission or referral fee such as what you describe here. You would have to look up your state laws or post your state here to be able to address that aspect.
Did you look at what you signed? If that test was on the list of labs, it will probably negate your claim.
Left my last doctor for something similar. I have high deductible and always check price but i always ended up with something added that triples the price. There is a reason i rarely go to the doctor.
I think ANY medical professional would want to stay FAR away from any threat of getting Medicare / Insurance Co. involved for any type of fraud. I would call the doctor back and suggest they cover this bill or you will be making complaints to anyone and everyone you can...the insurance company, the med board, social media, etc.
I would look up stark anti kick back law. I work in the lab it’s massively illegal to exactly that.
You should report this to the Medical College that they are a member of. Reporting to your insurance company or medicare won't result in any professional impact for them.
File a small claims against your doctor. She will settle.
Whether there was really a kickback or not (I believe there usually is and they come in various forms) medical providers in general have become more like used car salespeople than anyone focused on actual healing. Getting their billings up has become the main goal in medical care. So we as patients have to do our due diligence and say no to unnecessary procedures and medications. If that fails the suggestions made by paintitblack37 are excellent. Great advice there.
>,"I don't want it if my insurance doesn't pay for it." 

This is not the correct answer.  A medical office has no way to determine what is covered by a particular patient's policy.    If you haven't checked directly with your insurance company, your answer should be a simple, "No".
[removed]
Sounds like you signed something which could be bad news for you. Also, it’s not the doctors responsibility to know what your insurance covers, it’s yours. You should blatantly refuse any test or service until you call your insurance company first. 

Expensive lesson learned- you’re gonna have to pay that bill.

You should have just said "No" in cases where its ambiguous.

What did the grail results come back with?
Additionally, report to the state board of medicine (assuming US). Unnecessary medical procedures are malpractice. They’d probably have an opinion on this providers professionalism

Edit “state board of medicine”
Top comment. You can't perform a test without informed consent. OP didn't have it, by any definition.
And be sure you find a new doctor!
YES. I don’t know the state but this conduct is potentially an illegal kickback. I would probably just let your doc know that if the bill isn’t written off in 10 days you will proceed with reporting her to the medical board etc.
This is incorrect, as the federal anti-kickback statue is only applicable to items and services that could be paid for by federal healthcare programs (Medicare). It is likely that this screening is a cash only service that is not billed against any insurance company and is voluntarily consented to as not being medically necessary (as in there’s an alternative way to achieve the same results). Other regulations might apply, but the Anti-Kickback Statue does not cover this service.
Only for federal health care programs.  Tons of doctors take kickbacks all the time and, as much as I would love it if it were illegal, I don't think that's true.  Honestly, I would just settle for a disclosure, which is more than we get now.

My company sometimes does government work and a government employee is allowed to receive a max of $25 a year from all of our companies employees combined.  Pretty sure, my doctor receives more payments than that from pharma companies every day.

I even bought my meds from a website that advertised that they pay doctors for referrals.
This.  And the lab company is breaking the law with the payment scheme.   If these facts are accurate a talented attorney team would jump on this.   

If the lab company is operating like this, your doctor can’t be the only one getting kickbacks.
Also a physician, which is why I highly doubt the story. Namely the representative from Grail confirming the kickback. 

You're right a kickback for tests is illegal. That is why there is no way in hell the company would be stupid enough to do it in an illegal "tit for tat" way as a matter of policy. 

If they are engaging in illegal practices, I then doubt their customer service rep will disclose that to you over the phone. More likely they or you misunderstood. 

More likely scenario in my view: Doctor orders a test he likes, unsure of if insurance will cover it, because he likes it or believes in it, whether correctly or incorrectly (I believe incorrectly in this space). 

He assumes the lab or the company or someone will verify coverage first. No one does. You get stuck with the bill. By all means dispute the charge,  get representation, get the fee waived if you can but I doubt you stumbled upon a conspiracy of illegal malfeasance.
[deleted]
I am in medical billing and coding school, and this is the best and most direct answer. We just learned this last week.
The doctor refusing to engage with OP about financial aspects of this (even if she won’t figure it out, I’d imagine my doctor would say something about her experience with clients getting it covered by insurance) and the lab assistant saying that GRAIL would contact her about fees make me think they did know this.
I mean if they are getting a kickback of some kind, it’d be a pretty easy win, since it’s not a legitimate contract if you didn’t know what you were signing, and the kick backs would make it pretty clear to a jury or judge what more likely than not went down. Which is all you need in civil court. Without it I’d give it 50-50.
Haha idk why but this comment was particularly funny to me
a medical office can call insurance or use a portal determine what services they offer that insurance will cover. They do not determine if services another company offers are covered. Even if an office calls and is told these services are covered, it doesn’t mean they will be. Sometimes certain criteria is required to be met, 
Typically, you also sign something when you go in saying you will pay for what insurance doesn’t cover.
Surprisingly, most medical offices have telephones. And interestingly enough, most insurance companies have a number that can be called to verify coverage! Isn't that amazing?
Tha hell? So you think the medical office has no way to tell what your insurance covers? Have you ever been to the doctor? Try not giving advice when you obviously have no idea what you speak.
Insurance doesn’t cover (or almost never covers) GRAIL. Your doctor’s office can’t necessarily tell you exactly how a particular claim will work out, but they can tell you if it’s something they tend to see covered or not. In this case, the lab assistant said GRAIL would contact OP directly about fees, suggesting the office did not think it would be covered.
This is so wrong it is laughable. Any reputable office doing any sort of expensive services will have people on staff to verify insurance, so they aren't in this exact situation.
Would be willing to bet that she knows insurance doesn’t cover that particular test.
You have had some less than ideal experiences with your doctors’ offices staff. Every time I’ve had something come up that would not be covered, I’ve gotten a call from staff. And that’s across the board from PCP to orthopedic surgeon to OBGYN. 

Now if they make a mistake and believe something is covered that isn’t, it’s on me to have verified that with my insurance. Doesn’t sound like OP got that.
Please don’t do that. The poor customer service rep that answers your call didn’t do anything to you. They’re just another person trying to pay their bills and survive. It’s likely the same with the receptionist at your doctor’s office. 

Whenever you do call, be polite and let whoever answers know that you are calling about a problem that will likely require being passed higher up and briefly explain the issue. 99% of the time you will get a supervisor or manager right away. Don’t yell at them either. Your doctor is the one who caused your hassle. 

I have dealt with plenty of clients who have had issues with companies I’ve worked for. Them screaming at me has never once resulted in me solving their issue. But I have absolutely gone way above and beyond for people with a legitimate problem who have stayed courteous despite their anger.
A dirtbag move by a scummy, cash-register MD.
The BBB has no authority on anything.  It’s basically yelp before yelp existed.  Call the relevant state agencies.  Department of Health, attorney general, office of Medicaid inspector, etc.  those are the actual agencies that can deal with fraud or unethical practices.  As others said the insurance company may also be interested.

They had her sign an informed consent. It’s customary to assume you have read and understand everything you sign. 

I’d report the scam to her insurance company, the state medical board, and the state attorney general.
And when they do write off the bill report them anyway
Do you believe this is always an illegal kickback? Or are you saying that it’s an illegal kickback because the patient told the doctor not to?
[removed]
Grail isn’t FDA approved because while it has a relatively high detection risk of cancer it struggles to identify which cancer it is so it creates a sort of chase the disease through the body with tons of other tests. 

So it isn’t part of anti kickback laws yet as Medicare won’t touch it and most private insurance won’t either it’s cash only for most patients at this time. 

That said, OP you could have the doctor write a letter of medical necessity to your insurance to see if you can get some default coverage, usually around 60% of the test cost to at least lessen the burden.
In the US, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2910 mandates that federally no doctor or teaching hospital can receive anything worth more than $10 in value *without it being reported.* The pharma and medical device companies have to submit reports indicating what they’ve given to doctors and legitimate reason why and there’s public access to see what your doctor has received. “Kickbacks” ie, funds, favors, incentives to prescribe a particular drug are actually illegal. That’s not to say doctors don’t receive anything from pharma companies, like being paid to give a presentation at a meeting, but it’s nothing at all like it was in the 90s/early 2000s when the pharmaceutical reps would take doctors out on million dollar yachts or fly them to expensive golf weekends, etc. 

So if you want to see if your doctors have any disclosures, you can look here: https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov

(I used to manage training programs for surgeons to learn the procedures for how to implant new medical devices and was responsible for all the reporting and what was and wasn’t permitted.)
OP says that the lab assistant said that Grail would contact her about fees. That does not strike me as something you would say if you thought insurance was going to cover it. 

I get that’s not the doctor, but especially given her (the doctor’s, who is also a woman) punting/misrep to the lab assistant day-of, and later blasé “surely $30/month is doable for you to pay for this for the next 3 years!”, it’s not clear to me anyone there thought this was going to be covered by insurance.
Agree. I’ve worked in genetics labs for years and currently work for one that has a similar-ish product to Grail. There is absolutely no way providers are getting kickbacks for ordering the test, and I also highly doubt that a phone rep would have said such a thing. Something isn’t adding up.
Entirely possible the person they spoke to in the phone didn’t know they weren’t supposed to say it. It’s even possible the company doesn’t know it isn’t supposed to do it because some companies are managed by people wilfully ignorant of sensible legislation.
There's been a few times my PCM or a specialist suggested a medication but contacted my insurance first to make sure they would cover it; if they didn't, they gave me an alternative. So it's not out of the norm to think the doctor's office would check.
This will be on your RHIT, good luck out there!
[deleted]
  It would be amazing if this actually happened.    It doesn't.  Dr. office staff does not have the time, nor the responsibility to make these inquiries.
  I have worked in medical office management.   I'm fairly certain you have not, if you think that medical offices routinely do this.
Honestly? Who gives a crap about poor customer service drones at hospitals. It is a feature, not a bug, that people with no power are placed between you and solving your problem. 

From experience of working in this area: absolutely escalate with anger but do not cuss or threaten legal action. Make them miserable such that escalation is the only option - if you try to be reasonable that’s just you off the phone sooner for their metrics.
Not even remotely close to being blackmail. Saying if something isn’t resolved to your satisfaction then you’ll make an official complaint is about as far away from blackmail as you can get. OP also isn’t asking for a cash payment but rather for their bill to be written off. 

It’s no different than if a store erroneously charges your card $200 and you say that if they don’t refund you by x then you will make a charge back or contact the ombudsman. 

Terrible advice.
I don't think you know what that word means...
Where'd you get your JD exactly? You are offering legal advice, so I hope that your bar license is in good order.
Totally forgot about that. Usually a doctor can open a case with your insurance company case management and speak to one of the insurance companies doctor to “argue” why they think your insurance should cover it under your existing benefits.
I agree with you that it’s way smarter to settle this out of court, but I find it very hard to believe that there’s a zero percent chance that a magistrate or judge who knows about the kick backs aren’t going to side in favor of the person who says they didn’t agree to it. My bad on the wording for the quote though, I was more referring to the fact OP claims he was lead to believe he was signing something different.
That's incorrect. Clinicians and their billing staff do this all the time. It's routine to inquire about prior authorizations for medications, medical procedures or devices. Health insurance companies have provider-focused portals, customer service lines, and automated systems that allow them to check a patient's benefits based on the specific procedure/HCPCS or revenue code and primary diagnosis codes.
They do it routinely. It's called "getting authorization for treatment." My internist brother is constantly complaing about the arguments he gets into with insurance company staff.
Frankly, your office sucks.
[removed]
So your office was operated by "just send it to insurance and see what they pay"?
I work in medical administration. This is common practice. Sounds like your offices could use some quality improvement. Happy to recommend some resources if you’re interested.
lol they do it all the time. Countless amounts of time in my 35 years. You very obviously don’t work in “medical office management” but everyone lies in Reddit so don’t feel too bad.

*"call every single patient’s insurance company for each appointment."*

Not the claim. Don't exaggerate.
The patient has the ultimate legal responsibility for determining if a procedure is covered. But good providers can and routinely do assist greatly with that process. Don't shift blame for what is obviously a doctor taking advantage of less-knowledgeable patients.
Also in medical office management. Every single patient should know their own plan. Offices will know general rules, but every single office has a financial policy that states that the patient is responsible for knowing their plan. 

hospitals will know better since they have more resources or if someone is getting a procedure.
Wow. This is not blackmail. OP refused the test. The test was performed anyway. That is either purposeful fraud or basic incompetence on the part of the doctor/doctor’s staff. Both are reportable.

Asking for this unnecessary and unwanted bill to be fixed or being forced to report it to the authorities is absolutely not blackmail. It is warning the doctor of the consequences of their failure to handle it properly in the first place.
Yeah that’s a cop out statement for liability purposes. Any medical office that has the ability to bill insurance also has the ability to view the details of that persons plan and/or verify what is covered with the insurance plan. It is completely stupid and unrealistic to actually believe the average person is going show up with all of the intricacies of their plan memorized and know who is in network and out of network. Some of these plans are very difficult to interpret and the average person isn’t spending time on that. When a patient says they will only do the test if it’s covered by their insurance it is up to the doctors office to then verify that info and relay to the patient, or if they’re lazy bastards like you tell the patient it may not be. To just administer the test after that is just ridiculous.
I think the confusion is that Dr office will have medical billers whose entire jobs is to translate care to things the insurance will pay for 

Dr's Office should be able to tell you if a test they're performing is covered, something like OPs story sounds like it might be rarely covered
My daughter (15f) went on vacation with "friends" and they left her there after a fight (OH and SC)
My 15 year old was asked to go on a vacation with a friend of hers.  The friend (Jane) doesn't have many friends, and my daughter has always made an effort to include her, so she is often invited by the family to go to events and has been invited on trips before.  My daughter (call her Mary) does a lot of activities, and has never been able to go before (and didn't really want to go, but didn't want to hurt Jane's feelings), but this time the parents scheduled the trip around when my daughter would be available.  Jane is an only child and extremely doted upon by her parents, and they have shielded her from consequences and disappointments in the past- For example, Jane was caught on camera stealing another kid's Nintendo DS from his locker.  The parents swore that it was hers, then when shown the video, insisted she was stealing it back from someone who had stolen it from her.  They put up such a fight that the school turned it over to the police, but the father is a state trooper and the incident just went away.  They have also made big ordeals when Jane didn't make cheerleading, and when she wasn't invited to a private party.  This context is just to say, I don't blame the kid in this situation.

  
Apparently, the trip was fine for the first 3 days of the 5 day trip.  They drove to a beach about 9 hours away, stayed in a timeshare, and everything was fine.  On the 3rd day, a family that Jane knew from vacationing there before came, and the boy of the family showed an interest in my daughter.  My daughter had no interest in him, he is 2 years younger and she prefers girls generally.  She was nice, but firmly told him that she was not interested.  Apparently, Jane was interested and was absolutely distraught that the boy liked Mary.  When they returned to the condo, Jane screamed and threw a  cup at Mary, and Mary locked the door to the room and facetimed me.  We discussed options, but the nearest airport to them was over an hour away, and the parents were also angry at her for (??????).  I called the parents to discuss the situation, they told me my daughter was throwing herself at the boy and trying to steal him from their daughter, although they hadn't been there at the time, and only had Jane's word.  I spoke to the mother for over an hour and she finally calmed down and we agreed to just have the girls sleep in separate rooms and take a break from each other, since they were coming home soon anyway.  I checked in with my daughter the next day, she said things were tense but she was just staying in her room and watching her phone all day other than to make herself something to eat.  They were supposed to leave the next morning at 5am, and my daughter set her alarm and was up and ready to go.  When she went out to find the family, they were gone.  They must have left earlier or even the night before.  She panicked, of course, and called me crying, and I attempted to reach the parents because I couldn't believe they would actually leave her there.  It's insane.  They didn't answer and after 3 calls it began going straight to voicemail.  My daughter had them on findmy for the trip, and could see that they were already out of the state.  I arranged a plane ticket and uber for her, and she is home safe now, but she is incredibly upset and stressed out about this situation.  Can I do anything legally here?  I'm so sick of these people facing no consequences and treating people this way.  I can't imagine it's legal to abandon a minor that you are supposed to be caring for, but I'm not sure where to start. 
You can report this to CPS and make a report about the father as a state trooper.  You need to keep it very concise and fact-based (X was responsible for a minor child and abandoned her in another state.  X departed the state by plane and left the minor alone, Y hours from home, unsupervised, in a rental home, etc ) and not get into parenting styles, teen dating drama, etc.
You have several options, you can do any or all of them:

1. Call CPS in both Ohio and South Carolina against Jane's parents for abandonment. In [South Carolina's statute](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t63c007.php), abandonment covers: "...(a) the parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare:... (iv) abandons the child". 
2. You can sue Jane's parents for all costs in small claims court. 
3. [File a complaint against Jane's father in his capacity as a state trooper](https://statepatrol.ohio.gov/help-center/questions). As a state trooper, he is held to a higher standard.
I'm going to give you tangential advice:

All of this information regarding the parenting style of the parents/popularity of the child, etc, is irrelevant.

If you do speak to the police, make a complaint, whatever, make sure you stick to objective facts and lead with the important bits. Don't give anyone a reason to misunderstand, get lost in, or willfully ignore anything you say. This is important especially when dealing with government employees, etc. 

Imagine it like an essay, where you start with the most important 'thesis', ie, what you're arguing they did. Then give an overview of the objective, important facts leading up to it (the parents asked if the child could go, they took her, there was a disagreement or fight, she was left alone, everything they did afterwards)
Since they took your minor child across state lines and abandoned her you may want to contact the FBI.  It may cut through some of the push back from the father being a state trooper.
What the actual heck?! File a police report! They left a MINOR GIRL alone in another state! This is negligence!
What it is is child abandonment, file a police report
I would contact an attorney. What they did is neglectful as she was legally under their care at the time.

If there is a crime here, it would be in another state, and given the fact that your daughter was fine and safe the entire time, the police/DA may well decide not to pursue it.  You can make a report if you wish.  

You can sue them in small claims for the cost of the uber and flight if you wish to make the effort.  Collections may be difficult if you win.

This exactly. Try to leave emotions and dramatics to a minimum(even tho it's hard, and it's warranted in this instance). Dates, times, screenshots of all communications with your daughter and that family.
[removed]
Yep they’re not a big fan of this kinda thing, seconded to report to FBI
This might be a felony.
I generally don't like discouraging people from hiring attorneys... But OP's civil remedies against the family may be limited to the costs of getting the daughter home. And I'm not even certain whether OP is entitled to that. Hiring an attorney is going to burn through the cost of the plane ticket in a hurry. 

OP could also try reporting to the police and to CPS.

Do I legally have to bring my date back home if I took them out? (It was quite a substantial distance that we drove)
I matched with a girl on Tinder and chatted for a couple of days. She mentioned that there was a big event happening three states over and asked me if I wanted to join her on a short holiday for a week.

I agreed, picked her up, we had dinner to see if we clicked, and then I drove to the event.

When we reached the event she ended up hooking up with another guy in the hotel room I'd booked. She scarpered off and eventually returned to the hotel room very, very late after not seeing her for hours and very, very drunk.

Obviously, I was pissed that I'd been used as a free travel ticket, and I had to spend most of my time at this event alone. I wasn't expecting to be rewarded with sex, but at the very least don't abandon me in another state while you go shacking up with other guys!

It is still going on for three more days, but can I legally just abandon her here and drive home? Or do I have a legal obligation to take her with me? I'd rather not waste any more of my time, and I might be able to do the Maquoketa Caves if I leave now.

I told her I was going to leave and she insisted that I had to wait for her, as I was the only way she could get back home.

States involved are Iowa, Illanois, and Indiana. Currently in Indiana.
She didn’t sign a contract with you for round trip transportation. Leave her there
You hold no legal obligation to act as a free taxi service and provide her a return trip to her home state.
Are you both over the age of 18?
Did she pay you anything or do anything that can be construed as consideration for a contract to provide round-trip transportation and accommodations. "We're doing this. I'll pay for meals. You provide the car, gas, and room."
No, it’s not illegal to leave someone in a different state.

We're both over the age of 30.
We split the hotel room. I booked it, she transferred me 50%. I paid for our first dinner.

She gave no money for gas or transport.
Yeah, gonna go off and enjoy some time to myself.

In all fairness, I've done this twice before and had a great time. Did Gencon in 2023 and a cosplay/anime convention back in 2018.

We didn't really click romantically, but we stayed close friends and still meet up for Christmas. :)

My ex-bf used a fully nude photograph of me for a public art show without my knowledge/consent
I was dating a photographer for a period of 19 months before he broke up with me.  We have been “no contact” since.  No calls, texts- I have heard zero from him since this day.

This past Wednesday, I found out, on my own, that a photograph he took of me while we were together was being used for a “nude” exhibition in an art gallery (that is not in my home state.)  It is an internationally juried show.  This photo was included in an online gallery exhibition, as well as a book you can purchase at the show. The photo is extremely intimate, as I am fully nude, face showing, very recognizable.  I never ever gave permission or consent.  I was never asked if this was okay.  I am devastated.  

I contacted ex bf with a text “you do not have permission to use my image”. He did not respond.  I thought I was blocked, so I sent an email to him with that exact statement.  Hours later, he responds, stating “I understand.  I respect that and won’t use it”.  Then he proceeds to text that he takes this seriously, he thought he “had my permission”, and that he called the curator and the photo will be off the gallery wall the next day.

He called me to “talk about it” and was completely non-chalant; stated “we” made that picture and he didn’t think I would have a problem with it because it was “art”.  He said he had “no intention” of hurting me. 

I have been in a really bad place mentally/emotionally because of this.  I am in shock, devastated.  I’m not exactly in a place where I can afford lawyers retainers (4k was the cheapest)… i have called some lawyers, they say they can send him a “letter” requesting that all forms of this picture will be removed from public display.  I am a person that is very recognizable and known in my community. I am a single mother. I have missed 2 days of work because of this. I am in a dark place.

I asked him point blank- “if I had not found this on my own- would you have even told me about it?” And his response was “probably not”.

What can be done?  What are my options?  Thank you in advance for any advice/support/help.  
Lawyer here, who has worked a ton in the area of revenge pornography - bottom line, most of the information people are posting here is wrong. 

I suggest talking to a lawyer yourself, who understands the law in PA. Stop focusing on revenge porn (it’s unlikely a prosecutor proves that charge, as it requires an intent to distress in PA…many states have a specific intent element to that offense, like my own state of MI). Focus on the harm a non-consensual nude image is having on YOU, and communicate that to a lawyer. She/he will know the right steps to take.
NAL. Have you contacted the art gallery owner/currator/book publisher? I would not trust that he has done so.
Hi, I am so sorry this has happened to you. I am a lawyer but not your lawyer - go back to the lawyers you have spoken with and draft that letter ASAP - especially because of the books. Not sure what country you’re in, depending on this you may need to notify and request the gallery to immediately remove the photo from the book. In Australia this is a breach of confidence by both your partner AND the gallery.
Depending on the state, this could be criminal disclosure of intimate visual content. In some states it’s a felony. No retainer necessary for a call to the police. 

Do with that info what you will.

*Edit to add*: Because there is a potential criminal charge involved here, I would not recommend engaging in any “settlement negotiations.” The risk of slipping into extortion is too high. If you’re going to do anything, filing a criminal complaint with law enforcement is probably the way to go.
Just for clarity. Did you consent to the photo being taken initially?


Be mindful of identifying details in this post. I think you should edit it. There is the risk of the Barbara Streisand effect. The Venn diagram of people who know you and people who carefully view some random online picture competition (honestly there are thousands of these globally) may not even intersect. If this isn't accurate and he is in fact a well known and wealthy photographer then ensure you make this known to lawyers as you might be able to shake him down for a bit of a settlement.


If not, a letter from a lawyer should be much less than 4k, it sounds like he's taking the necessary steps you just want to make sure you have a stick as well as the carrot.
[removed]
Generally speaking, and this is very general, photographers retain the rights to their photos and can use them as they wish. There are many exceptions, that would require consent or at least be highly advisable. 

However, while you can license a photo for editorial use or for sale, typically, in order to use a photo for commercial reasons it requires a release.

There's also the context in which the photo was taken. Generally speaking, photos taken in a public setting, or where someone would have unlimited expectation of privacy, will be legally sound to be used. However, privately taken photos that weren't expected or intended to be used publically, could be an issue.

I would ask how much the juice is worth the squeeze for you. Litigation on something like this could be costly, and it doesn't seem like you are trying to sue for monetary compensation. If your goal is to simply have this photo no longer used, then it seems like the easiest route is to also just contact the gallery and tell them the situation. Once these galleries here that you would be seeking legal recourse, they will remove that photo immediately. Also, well I don't know anything about your ex, that's a judgment call you have to make as far as if he would honestly remove that photo. 

So long story short, yeah he probably can't use a private nude photo of you in an art exhibition, but as long as the photo gets removed, that might be the best outcome for you. Good luck and sorry this happened to you

Why do people never post their state? That's a very important part of this. Depending on the state, your ex may have violated revenge porn laws and you could report him to the police. Look into the laws in your area and file a report
NAL but you've received some good advice here. Check in with the gallery to make sure it has been removed. I would also want evidence if him deleting the pictures. 

On a side note, I find the whole 'im a photographer so it's totally cool if I take a picture of you naked' so fucking weird.
Did you sign a model release? If not, sue him.
Talk to an attorney.

I would file a police report for revenge porn. And press charges
NAL. 

If he tries to claim it’s art and he had the right to use it, does he have consent/release forms for other models whose image he has used as art? I wonder if you’re the first partner he has done this to. Might be a weird kink of his, because I am not buying a professional photographer doesn’t know he needs consent. 

He knows the legal more than commoners. Like what measures does he take with other subjects? Any differences? And like did he make sexual advances toward you or say sexual comments about your body that if you’re the subject and not the gf, are those behaviors not sexual harassment.  If I work on my partner as a patient, I can’t make comments about their body or touch them because they are my partner because in this instance we are doctor patient and they are due all the considerations of that relationship. If he claims subject artist he loses the more intimate privileges of bc/gf- if he wants protection by it, you should get the same relationship protections and in this case it would be subject/professional. 

Did you request his professional services (ask him to take it) and did he then use the material you commissioned without your consent? Even if he waived the fee, I would think she would have the rights of the purchaser instead of him having rights as an artist, because his primary relationship was professional client, if not bf/gf. 


Above are just some possible scenarios he might try to defend his actions. I think he either did it spitefully, or with intentional disregard for OP. I think he knows OP would likely have said no. Due to his profession, he understands the unique nature of how he has caused harm, now and into the future by including it into print. Even when things have been corrected after print, they cannot be corrected fully. 

The gallery might be liable for not making sure they had consent to publish the materials. I wonder what measures they take to make sure they aren’t participating in producing pornographic images. It’s not publishing art, it’s publishing perpetual harm when the subject doesn’t consent. I feel they can’t claim no harm no foul if they are the ones publishing, promoting, profiting/benefiting from the harm. As a sponsor in the event, they have a responsibility to make sure policies and procedures exist and are enforced.

I think that if you’re the one being harmed and the other is advancing themselves at your expense without your consent, you should be eligible to recoup, especially since you will have ongoing therapy bills and continued harm because people have already bought the book. 

I would also like to see proof that this photo was removed from all forms of media and all the measures have been taken to have the process remediated and that the image/digitalis etc need to be destroyed. I’d ask him to provide me with a copy of all the communication so you can satisfy or contact them yourself. I’d probably send a cease and desist letter/demand letter. 

You can probably find a template that gives you a good idea. You don’t get into the emotional of why, how, etc. you might be able to get an attorney solely to help with drafting the letter. If you’re going to draft it yourself, I’d keep it as basic and as simple as possible. I’d inform them it’s unauthorized use, whatever your demands are regarding the removal/retraction, and request to be furnished proof of the measures they took to rectify the situation. I am not sure if this would be good advice, so hopefully you can find someone who can help with the letter for  $200-500 depending how much pre work you can do getting timeline and or a pre written for review. 

If you end up going legal, you could be introducing your information to public record so I’d be more interested in a settlement and I’d have an attorney mediate that and go for attorney fees.

Was the photo taken in an intimate situation (like with a phone camera after sex) or was it taken as a part of an actual photoshoot where you were modeling for him?

If its the latter there is probably not much you can do. The photographer holds the rights to the pictures and can do whatever he wants, the model has no say in it. Doesn't matter that you are NC now. However if you can argue that this wasn't that but intimate photos between lovers you *might* have a case. But it is not straightforward.

What you can do if it is the first is negotiate and buy the rights to the photos from him.
NAL, but at best, he doesn't have a license to publicly display that photo and at worst, it could be considered revenge porn and thus a crime per PA Section 3131.0 Title 18. 

But again, not a lawyer. Just something I saw on one of my many tangents.
[removed]
Police report ! Illegal distribution of private photos! DOnt need a lawyer to get involved
Call the police for him sharing it. It may be able to be prosecuted as revenge porn.
[removed]
Thank you.  I will do this as soon as possible.
I must mention that he is good friends with the gallery folks.  He is an artist that is represented by this gallery.
Thank you.  I am in the US
And the publisher/printer.
Thank you.
> Be mindful of identifying details in this post. I think you should edit it. 

Just to really underline this point, there's more than enough personally identifying information in this post to find the gallery being referenced. It took me about 30 seconds.  

With a little more digging I doubt it would be difficult to piece together OP's identity. *I'm* not going to do it, but that doesn't mean someone else won't.
I consented to the original photo.  I, in no way, consented to it being submitted for public display.
OP needs to edit the post to delete the name of the exhibit unless she wants to lead more people right to it.
[deleted]
I consented to the original photo.  He keeps saying “I never meant to hurt you”, I do not believe him.

I am under the impression that he didn’t think I would find out.  He was attempting to sneak under the radar and use this for his portfolio.

To my understanding copyright law isn’t the issue here, the photographer still owns the copyright. HOWEVER the dissemination of the photo is the issue at hand. She should absolutely pursue this and protect herself.

You don’t own copyright to a photo just because your face is in it. So, she can’t start selling that photo herself even if she wanted to. He owns the copyright.

He also can’t post it online or put it in a gallery or anywhere though—just being an “artist” doesn’t give him any special pass or loophole with revenge porn laws or personality right laws.

Also: make sure you are documenting all communications with him. The fact that he tried to “sneak this under the radar” and hoped you wouldn’t find out is going work against him. I hope you have a good support system and friends to lean on, I hope everything goes well for you and stay safe!
OPs ex owns the copyright as they took the photo.

>You can hire a public defender for free from the court because your lawsuit is a criminal lawsuit because now you will accuse him of defamation and publishing indecent personal photos (and I think it's a criminal all over the world), and if you want compensation and make a civil lawsuit you can ask for Pro Bono lawyer or hire a law student from law school clinic

There is an impressive amount of wrong in this single, run-on sentence. No. Just no. No to all of it.
A public defender is only appointed to someone who can’t afford one when said someone is charged with a crime.
It was of an intimate nature, not posed, not “a shoot”.
Thank you, I’m looking it up.

In OP’s state (PA), revenge porn requires “intent to harass, annoy or alarm,” which would be hard to prove here.

All the posts here are talking about “consent,” but in this context the term is the “model release form.”

He cannot use, exhibit, or sell your photos without you signing a “release form”

Don’t let him use vague and improper language like “I thought I had your consent.”

I take art pictures of fully dressed people (not nudes), and I have them sign a release form. I have a standard form. 

You said he is a professional artist. He should know this. He can lose his art gallery access and his livelihood for this mistake. This is a big thing. 

(The only professionals who don’t need a release form are news reporters if the photo is of a newsworthy event. That is to protect the freedom of press. For example, criminals are not going to sign release forms for the pictures of their arrests, politicians will not sign release forms for their embarrassing pictures, etc. You don’t fit into those categories. Your picture is not newsworthy and publishing it is not in the public interest. Therefore, he needed you to sign a release form. Art photographers need their models sign a release form.)

I doubt the photos are pornographic. Not every nudity is pornography, especially if he is a good artist. I wouldn’t try that road. You are better off working the “he doesn’t have a release” path. 

I have a story about nudes and release forms, but too long for Reddit.

You mentioned the gallery wasn’t in your home state. That’s where the criminal activity, if any, would have occurred, so that state’s laws will apply.
Stop posting information here that could help people find the picture! (Name of exhibit)(state redacted) google search will lead people right to it. You're making things worse for yourself.
I would go to the police. They could fall under revenge porn.
call the police this sounds like revenge porn to me
[removed]
Have you admitted that to anyone? Because if you have you're essentially relying on his good will and you need to do what you can to preserve that. If you haven't then don't say you did. 
It has been edited
Not a great idea though, it’s either extortion as the other commenter says or it proves you’re happy for it to be published and the other matter up for dispute is the amount you want to be paid. 

Hard to say you never wanted it published at all if you leave a paper trail asking for payment.
[removed]
Maybe DMCA isn't the right thing I was thinking of.


However OP's ex did not have OP sign a release form. In doing so, they've violated multiple laws regarding the photography of genitalia and the use of OP's likeness.
Not necessarily. It's good practice but it's not law. 
Model release forms are only needed if it’s for “commercial” purposes only or if the photographs will be used to promote products, etc. Photographers do not  necessarily need model release forms for documentary work or for “artistic” work. Otherwise, any human who shows up in a photograph would need consent forms. 

In the United States, I can legally go out in the street and photograph people like street photography if I want to. Taking pictures on private property or in places where a reasonable amount of privacy is expected (restroom) is a much different story. 

With that being said, in this day and age you should probably get model consent forms or an ID of some kind before doing any work with nude models. 

NAL, former photographer who worked in a commercial capacity. In the case of OP, I think a cease and desist is probably the best outcome she can get with him voluntarily removing her photo from his portfolio and the gallery.

Well even if they don’t prosecute the investigation would likely scare him.

You could probably call the prosecutors office of whatever county he is in and ask them
You can report a crime at your local. They might not be the most helpful but sometimes they will be and can help facilitate conversation. 

If they aren't helpful you can contact over state, you don't need to travel physically (though eventually you may be asked to).

An internationally covered contest with multiple news outlets reporting on it. Making it very hard to escape the circulation of the picture.


Making 'with intent to harass, annoy or alarm' an easy argument to make.
3 police broke into my bedroom at 3am. Can I file a complaint and how?
I’m not sure if this is the right place for this but tonight I (24M) was on a second date with a nice girl (22F) who still lives with her mother. We ended up staying up late together and falling asleep for a little, that is until I woke up to my door flying open, 3 flashlights in my face and a voice yelling “LAPD!” I immediately get out of bed, still dazed, confused, half asleep, not even realizing that this woman is still in my bed. They ask and confirm my identity, ask if my date is in my room with me which I confirm, and then they tell me her mom is downstairs waiting for her because she got worried about her not answering her phone. I walk my date out to find 3 more police officers waiting for us, so 6 total. Not one word was spoken to me. Feels a bit extra for the situation especially given the reality of us just having fell asleep. I, as far as I’m concerned, have a squeaky clean record too. No reason for concern that I would’ve done something horrible to this woman. Can I report this at all? Was this legal? 
Do you live alone or with roommates?  Did they just break down the door or did someone let them in?
It might be worth digging into what the mother reported to get three cops to break into your home. This could help with any complaints and with finding out if this was even legal.
Police cannot search your home without a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances. They don’t appear to have had a warrant, which makes sense because there was no evidence of criminal activity. Neither you nor your roommate consented. A landlord cannot consent to the search unless they have retaken possession of the property, which doesn’t appear to have been the case. Exigent circumstances requires imminent threat of harm, escape, or destruction of evidence. None of that is present in your case. While you need to have a thorough conversation with a lawyer, it seems as if the police may have violated your 4th Amendment rights. I would definitely talk to a civil rights lawyer. Some criminal defense lawyers also take these cases. Good luck. BTW There are a couple other exceptions to a warrant requirement but they aren’t applicable (plain view, automobile search, search incident to arrest, etc.).
Get a civil rights attorney now so they can access their body camera footage and 911 call. That'll answer more questions than most are willing to already.

The mom could have exaggerated the situation yet police normally wont lockpick a door to gain entry. Invest in a surveillance cam system that is privacy based for your front door and any other sensitive areas.
[removed]
It sounds like their response was directly to what ever the mother said to the police when she called. They should be able to direct you to how to request a copy of the report at your local station/precinct.

As for filing a complaint you can do that however it doesn't really sound like much happened from a legal perspective on the police end. As for your apartment community that's entirely another matter and they should look into how the police gained nondestructive entry to your home, something the police might even tell you.

tl; dr I'd start by calling or visiting the local office/precinct for the LAPD and request to speak to the desk sargent on duty. Then I'd follow up with a complaint with your apartment complex's corporate (if they exist).

I live with a roommate, he did not let them in he didn’t even wake up (very soundproof walls and he’s a deep sleeper). They somehow managed to open the front door which was double locked without damaging it, I’m not sure how
Op, you should ask for the police report, this info should be on there I believe
The most likely scenario is the exigent circumstances exception.  Find out what the mom said by requesting the police report.
We don’t have any way of knowing re: exigent circumstances without knowing exactly what info LE had, especially from the mom. And if the mom gave false information to the cops because she was just being overprotective, then any legal recourse would be against her.

I disagree. The OP might not have civil damages to sue for, but entering without a warrant, waking someone up at 3am in their own bed without any reasonable cause sounds like multiple violations of laws and department policies. Not to mention, it's even putting the police at risk for no reason.

Did they show you a warrant or anything?   If it was locked and not damaged then someone had a key or someone let them in, I'd assume.  Is there a back door?
[removed]
Without hearing or seeing anything though, as OP and date were asleep, the police have no evidence to backup an exigent circumstance excuse. They need to perceive the exigent circumstance in the moment, simply being told of the existence of the circumstance without perceiving some aspect of it, I.e. hearing screams, smelling smoke, seeing the shadow of some body with a knife etc, is not enough to excuse the warrantless search. 

Granted there really is no recovery for warrantless search outside of having one’s criminal case dismissed. OP may have civil recovery options against the mom though

No warrant. No back door. I live in an apartment complex so my only guess would be that the complex security or a manager let them in

Which is all the more reason to follow up. This could easily have been a "swatting" incident with people getting killed.

But the police told the OP that the mother "got worried about her not answering her phone." If that was really the reason she gave, the raid was wildly inappropriate, and unnecessarily dangerous.
You could email your apartment manager and ask if a manager or security let them in, to get their side of the story in writing.
 I think you could file a complaint with the police and possibly talk to a civil rights attorney, but without any real damages I don't know if it would go anywhere.  Definitely pretty crazy though man, I might reconsider a third date.
[removed]
Definitely will be doing that
Okay I’ll look into that. The civil rights attorney not the third date. Thanks!

UPDATE: I stupidly let my mom borrow my car in Houston and now she's refusing to give it back and I'm stuck unable to work.
I followed your guy's advice to a t. Sent the demand letter and waited. The ten days ended yesterday but she still wouldn't return my car, so I went downtown to the HCPD HQ to report the vehicle as stolen. Was able to get her on the phone with the Sergeant who told her that once I decide to press charges, it becomes felony possession of a stolen vehicle/Unauthorized use of a vehicle and if she's caught driving it, or caught with it at her house she will be arrested and charged, and I would not have a say in the matter.  Once I sign that line, whatever happens next happens.  Long story short, that lit a fire under her ass and she left the car with my spare key in the glove box across the street. Of course, I requested an officer to meet me at the location just in case she tried to get belligerent or in fact had damaged my vehicle, which she didn't.  She's officially had my car since the 23rd of LAST month, but it's back in my possession now. She's put well over 2000 miles on it, and the maintenance light is on, but for now I'm glad to be done with this,and I want to thank all of you who either gave me good advice or gave me the metaphorical slap I needed.  As for my shop and getting there, one of my mechanics leant me his old beater so I could get to and from, so the shop is up and running and we're already up to our neck in jobs. Got seven satisfied customers and five others waiting on parts. Glad to say that everything worked out once I took a step back and analyzed everything.  
[deleted]
Man, I feel bad for people with shit parents.
So glad this worked out! Congratulations!
"Another happy landing."
I'm happy the algorithm surfaced thus update, read the original and was wondering how it turned out.

Glad it got sorted out.
Rekeying is a good idea. In addition, check for tracking devices such as Apple Air tags or other brand trackers.
That's awesome man! Good luck with the shop.
Happy for you, wish you all the success in the world.
I was just at the Mills last week and thought about this situation. Glad to see that there was a positive resolution. Best of luck with your blossoming business.
Glad this worked out the way it did. Wish it never had to happen but such is life. Good luck with your shop!!
That’s awesome! I hope you went NC with her now!!!
I think after hearing felony charges, mom's not going to want to risk getting arrested for actually stealing it in the future.
Easier/cheaper to install ignition cut out switch out of sight under the dash, won't start unless you flip the switch.
And it's not just felony charges. The Sergeant said that a felony arrest/stop means guns will be drawn and trained on the individual. 
Probably, but rekeying is a pretty straightforward best practice to follow, and one would think that doing so after having to threaten felony charges to get the property returned would be a no brainer.
In OP's shoes, mom would be getting the old keys as the next holiday/birthday gift. A little note inside about how since I can't trust she didn't make her own keys, here's the rest of the set.
Tiktok has stolen a video of my daughter and I playing. Text has been overlaid to make me look like a creep.
[ Removed by Reddit in response to a copyright notice. ]
You need to submit a DMCA directly to TikTok's legal team.  They have a very limited amount of time to take the videos down (the videos could stay up if the other person files a counter DMCA, at which point you could pursue them for damages for copyright infringement.) Do not use the forms available on Tiktok's website. You can fill out a DMCA yourself, you do not need an attorney for this.
Where was the video originally posted? Your social media/your child’s social media? I strongly suggest setting your social media accounts/children’s accounts to “private.” Especially as you’re continually dealing with the video being reposted and people finding your info/putting you in danger. General Internet safety, avoid putting your full name/children full name (school, hometown, and ages!) on any social media accounts. I’m sorry this is happening to you, how awful.
Has your daughter removed the original video? If you have to go the lawyer route this is one of the first things they are going to say to do. It sucks and none of this is your fault
TikTok didn’t know such thing, accounts on TikTok republish a video. There’s a legal difference. The answer is simply send DMCA takedown notices whenever this is found. You really not gonna be over identify the accounts it’s gonna be a waste of time. Get them taken down and move on.

I've been reporting and doing this over and over.

Videos keep getting uploaded on new accounts.

Like, if I take down "DramaTok2024" then "DramaTokMax24" appears and reuploads it.
I suspect my daughter (15) account.

As far as I can tell it is and always has been locked down to private.

She did have a flurry of suspicious login attempts and password resets back in June, July and August - so it's possible her account was hacked.
I've been reporting them over and over. They keep popping up again.

It's like whack-a-mole
Thanks. It's been rough.
[removed]
I didn't upload this to TikTok. I don't have a TikTok account.

My daughter (15) wanted to show me how it worked with a short video of me and my other younger daughter.

I think she didn't realise the video was public.
You've been filing a DMCA over and over or just reporting? They're not the same thing. DMCA = digital millennium copyright act.

Legally, it's not TikTok's problem that people are harassing you. It *is* TikTok's problem that people are violating you or your family's intellectual property rights by sharing a video you made without permission.

That may seem strange but the law is what it is and you should use it to your advantage. As the original comment said, look up how to send TikTok a DMCA request. Don't rely on TikTok's own reporting system.
You need to file a DMCA.
>I've been reporting them over and over. They keep popping up again.

>It's like whack-a-mole

The only legal avenue that exists outside contacting Tiktok to report them would be finding an attorney and suing the bad actors for defamation/false light. 

You mention in the OP that you are in Florida. [Here is a link](https://www.floridabar.org/public/lrs/) to the Florida Bar Association's attorney referral service. Use that site to find an attorney who is experienced in defamation law - they will know where to take it from there. 

Outside of legal help, the other avenue is trying to reclaim the false narrative. This subreddit has an official policy not to advise OPs to contact the media, so I cannot advise you to do so. There are SEO (search engine optimization) companies you could hire to try to bury the story, or you might see if there are other ways you could counteract the narrative by putting the truth out there. But definitely contact a lawyer first to figure out your legal options before taking this step.

Best of luck, OP.
When you report the video, are you reporting it under copyright infringement?
DCMA is a legal document sent to the legal team. It’s not in-app reporting. If DCMA does not work, you get a lawyer and make money in a civil suit.
What goes into the internet, stays on the internet unfortunately… it’s gonna be near impossible to do that. 

I’m really sorry this is happening to you.
Reporting and DMCA are not the same thing. Obviously, since they didn’t say report them.
[deleted]
[removed]
Sorry, I've already done that. I wasn't clear. Apologies.
[removed]
Yes.

I've also done DMCA route.
I keep filing new DMCA against new accounts when they get created.

It's the same video being reuploaded by different accounts. TikTok have told me, in email, that I must file a new DMCA every time it gets reuploaded.
I've done both. Sorry, I wasn't clear.
My daughter (15) who recorded the video used TikTok's video editing software.

Her account was private and locked down.

Suspicious attempts were made to log in and access her account in June, July, and August.

She is open and honest with me. I have seen that her account is not public.

I suspect her account may have been hacked.

Sounds like time for a lawyer. I would say it’s worth the cost due to potential risk to your safety. There may also be a company that provides a service that automatically finds and files DMCA reports on this video. Individually reporting videos isn’t feasible and this is a potentially life threatening issue (being swatted and dealing with police).
This isn't a situation of "Your daughter is hiding things!"

We have a very open and honest relationship. If she needs contraception we can talk about it. If she's having relationship issues we talk about it.

We know each others pass codes and dhare locations on Google Maps.
Do i need to call the cops right now?
I am out of town with a group of families that all have wrestling kids. We all share big air bnb’s and most times parents will send their kids with us even if they can’t. One of the 14 year olds has just come up to me and said that he cant sleep here tonight because he is uncomfortable and scared of one of the other dads who is pretty drunk because he just got in his bed and was tickling his feet and “wrestling” with him. What in the hell do i do? 
The dad in question is drunk currently passed out. 

4:37am add-on : Some of the other parents that are here are suggesting we just let it go.. main reason is bc it’ll ruin the whole weekend. And #2  they say this dad was so out of it he may of thought it was his own son (age 9) and he was just tickling and wrestling around with him in the least “inappropriate” way.

5:15am EDIT- Parents were called right before he broke this to me!! Parents don’t want the cops involved and don’t want to press charges.

5:18am EDIT- a report has been filed with Safesport, the governing body of minor athletes abuse and prevention 

FINAL EDIT - Cops were contacted early morning Friday and have launched an investigation. 
If the kid is scared to be around him, there might be more to it. At the VERY least call the parents and put them in control of the situation. Offer to call the cops if they think it's necessary.
Call the 14 year olds parents. Have the kid explain to their parents what the dad did that made them uncomfortable and then see what the parents want. 

You can call the cops, but what on earth would they do? Doesn’t sound like a crime was committed here unless I’m missing something.
Dude. Call the police now with absolutely no doubt.

1. He is drunk.  
2. he GOT INTO BED WITH A MINOR.  
3. He put his hands on said minor, while drunk, while in bed with them.

There is no discussion or doubt here. That should never have happened.  
If you don't know what the right thing to do, the cops will. So even if you have doubts, let them figure it out and just tell them what happened.  
There is absolutely no way you should be dealing with that on your own. That is extreme.

Screw the weekend. That will get worse from here if you do nothing.
Yes, you do need to call the cops. Creeps like this rely on the silence of other people to keep getting away with this. Blow this fucker's life up. Someone else could be too afraid to come forward alone.
Call cops now! That's grooming behavior. Take it from someone who decided not to call the cops on something like this, turned out the guy had a long line of victims. It's been over 10 years and I still am dealing with the guilt. CALL THE COPS! If that's all it was, they can decide that. But it's not your call
You should have immediately called the police, you've done the kid a disservice by not doing that. Don't let him down further and make the call now, and call the parents.
Yes. You need to call the cops right now

I just can’t stomach the thought of a drunk guy crawling into bed with/touching my sons.. what if they are to nervous to even say something or demand him to stop. Ahhh I hate this
I've been living with the guilt for over 10 years due to not calling the cops on something much less severe than less. And then hearing about the hundreds of victims.

Being a teacher makes it worse. He knows better. He's been trained better.

Just call the cops, let them figure it out 

It's not worth the risk to the thousands of children he has access to. 

CALL THE COPS NOW!!!
Not helpful man, just tell the guy he absolutely needs to call the cops NOW! we all need to make it as clear as possible that if he doesn't, he's responsible for any and all future victims of this Teacher/Coach/Pedophile

Some of the other parents that are here are suggesting we just sit on this bc 1 itll ruin the weekend. And 2  they say this dad was so out of it he thought it was his own son (age 9) and he was just tickling and wrestling around with him in the least “inappropriate” way.
To be honest when the minor was letting me know what happened he never for a fact  said he was being touched “inappropriately”.. thats why I haven’t been quick to make my call. All he said was that it made him uncomfortable and scared to be around him
[removed]
Agreed, you need to call the cops. Teachers are trained better than this. Remember, he's not only around children when he is in an air B&B with other parents...

For the love of god CALL THE COPS NOW! Don't WAIT,  CALL NOW.
My doctors office shared my pregnancy with my estranged father
As the title says… I just found out today that my primary physician’s office shared my private medical information with the one person I didn’t want knowing. I haven’t spoken to the man in years and I wanted this journey to be a fresh start in me healing from the hurt he’s caused. Now I feel like my peace has been ripped away from me. I plan on filing a HIPAA violation but don’t know if there is anything else I can do. 
The Texas state laws on privacy can be stiffer than HIPAA violations. 877-541-7905 is the number to file a privacy violation with Texas health and human services. They take this one very very seriously.
What is your location?  What were the circumstances that led to him knowing?
NAL, but you should confirm that he’s not on your authorized release of information list, and then also file a complaint of HIPAA violation with the Office for Civil Rights in your state if he isn’t.
[removed]
[removed]
You mentioned that your mother is on your authorized list, is she still in a relationship with your father?  Is it possible that she said something to him and that he's claiming it was the doctors office to avoid any blowback she would receive from you?

EDIT:  You say multiple family members were already aware and you've been posting about it on social media for months.  It seems like there are many avenues for this info to have reached him that don't involve the doctors office.
[removed]
Texas. Someone at the office said “congratulations on being a grandfather” at his latest check up.
He never has been. Only my mother
The other possibility was that he had OP listed as an authorized person so when they checked him in/out they would have seen OP’s name on his chart info. Not that it excuses it. Still a violation of HIPAA.

My mother and him have been divorced for over 5 years. She’s been my biggest supporter and has made it very clear to my brother and other family members that know of my pregnancy that my “father” is NOT allowed to know. My mom was the one who told me that he knew. My fathers sister in law (his brothers wife) called my mom to say they couldn’t attend my wedding but they send their congratulations for our exciting news. Mind you, we have not announced this pregnancy to anyone outside our immediate family.

reading is fundamental....
My boyfriend died & his family is stealing everything
My boyfriend died unexpectedly 2 months ago and left a will stating my son & I are to inherit his entire estate (biggest assets are his house, 5 cars, & 2 motorcycles). I have the only copy of the will, and a court clerk verified it to be legal and valid.  
  
He didn't have a relationship with his family due to an abusive childhood, but his parents don't believe he had a will and feel like they're entitled to everything.  
  
They've already gone to his house and removed all of the cars/bikes to store at his parents house. They've also taken his laptop and have been using my dead boyfriend's Facebook profile to start listing his smaller property items for sale (furniture, etc).

The probate hearing is scheduled for Aug 26th, and I was under the impression its illegal to touch anything or remove anything until someone has been assigned to inherit the estate. What are my legal options to get his vehicles back, and collect on anything they've already sold off?
NAL, get your lawyer involved ASAP. Once things are sold it's going to be a lot harder to recover them
Hi OP where are you located. DEFINITELY lawyer up as others have said. This is essential to protect yourself and your kid
You may be able to pursue charges once probate starts. They legally can't sell the property though without being on the deed. Usually if the will does not give power to sell, which it doesn't at least to them, you need court approval. Any deeds or bill of sales signed wouldn't be valid and they can have fraud charges. I would contact the court directly and submit the will while looking for an attorney. You WILL need one. Even if the will isn't valid everything would pass to your son and the court would need to appoint someone to manage it if we go by US laws.
Call the police. File charges against them for theft and trespassing. That stuff is literally yours, the house is yours. Those charges will stick if you have the will

Edit: Change the locks. If they do anything you can stick their asses with burglary too. Take screenshots of their ads. But most importantly get the cops involved.
You need a lawyer now
Who is the executor of his estate? Who handled the funeral and its expenses?
OP, I understand you don't want to hire a lawyer. Is there also a reason you don't want to go to the police or file a police report?
How did they remove the cars without keys? Im assuming they wouldn't have the spare sets due to no relationship
I don't think you appreciate how much of a fight you might be in store for.  

Your, presumably, young and healthy boyfriend suddenly died. He just so happened to make a will 3 months ago that leaves you his entire estate, worth at least hundreds of thousands of dollars. The will is some template he got off the internet, and was never given to/verified by an estate planning attorney. No one in his family knew about this. All of his stuff is multiple states away from where you live.  

His family is going to fight, tooth and nail, contesting the validity of that document. It might take years to sort out. If you expect to ever receive what you are rightfully owed (given the facts are accurate) then you really need to do whatever it takes to hire an attorney now.
Call the police. Report everything they took as stolen.
Get a lawyer.
Sorry for your loss. Have you notified them and told them to stop/return the items? You should save the text or record if you doing this
How do they have access to his house and cars?
What part of "call the police" are you struggling to understand?
If you need to hire a lawyer but don't have cash tell them about everything you are supposed to inherit. That might do.
Why don't you go and ask the court clerk? They are usually helpful, and can point you how to file an emergency ex parte with the judge to stop his family.
It's up to you to ask the court to take action. A lawyer will know how.
Call the cops, sell a vehicle, and hire a lawyer

He had moved in with me 6 months ago and was going to Airbnb his house when he died. Unfortunately his loss also left me with twice as many bills to pay so I haven't been able to afford hiring a lawyer. Will the court not do anything to tell them they aren't allowed to start taking shit?
Im in Florida, he died in Virginia - so thats where all the legal shit is taking place
I have screenshots of the Facebook ads, and screenshots of their texts saying they took the vehicles "for safe keeping." They threatened to charge me with tresspassing and theft if I didn't send them the titles I took, but I tried telling them that I used to live in the house, still receive mail there, so it's technically my residence and I cannot legally trespass or steal from my own house.
If the house, cars, bikes, are all still in the deceased boyfriends name it is going to be hard to report them stolen.  Also is there a mortgage on the home?  Some of this will require a death certificate or possibly a court order depending on location.  As it will be very hard to prove ownership.

OP needs to get a lawyer to advise them on what all they will need to do.  The lawyer can file all the proper paperwork and advise the best way to handle his estate.

OP make a detailed list of all items, include photographs and serial numbers.   This will help down the road.  You may or may not be able to get all the property back but they could be responsible for any property that they sold and have to reimburse you for it.

Who did the will?  Lawyers typically will do them not sure if it was done at a law firm but they might be able to give you some advice.
How this subreddit still exists is crazy to me.

Dragon, do you have any actual idea what you’re talking about or recommending?

If you’re an attorney and they rely on your advice you’ve essentially established an attorney-client relationship and you could be liable if they take any action based on your comments; if you’re not an attorney you’re engaging in the illegal practice of law.
The will states me as the executor. But his parents handled the funeral (which they banned me from)
They broke into the house and took the keys
I told them I'll drag this shit out until their grandkids qualify for Medicare because I'll die before I allow them to steal what he worked his entire life for AFTER their years of abuse
They broke in

The court has no knowledge of anything that has happened bc no one (aka you) has told them. That’s why you need to break the piggy bank and get an estates lawyer to help you with this ASAP.
You can't afford not to hire a lawyer, because not doing so will likely end up costing you way more and you can likely sell some of those assets afterwards to pay for the lawyer and any other bills, right? I assume this will be obvious to a lawyer as well, so sounds to me like you can afford one.
also NAL but in short, the court won’t/can’t tell them to do anything unless a lawyer tells them not to and you should move faster than your current hearing. 

check for local legal assistance programs, there are many offering free or reduced services. at the very least, a consultation call with one may be helpful and provide you insight with what the next step should be
The bills for his house will come out of his estate as will the costs for a solicitor.  Please get one as soon as possible and also notify his family about the will officially - through the solicitor. They will be liable for everything they have taken from the estate as it is common theft.
Attorneys sometimes can do probate and front costs up front, especially if they know there is a major asset can be sold and they can be paid their attorney's fees from that sale.  You would get a majority of the proceeds, obviously, but if an attorney sees a good chunk of equity present, they'll frequently take your case up in this manner.

You say there is a probate hearing on 8/26/24.  WHO FILED THIS PROBATE?  Is it the relatives?  You definitely need to lawyer up immediately if that is the case or you will lose everything.

Depending on what jurisdiction you are in, some more populous counties have a Public Administrator who can "take over" an estate for the benefit of the heirs, until if and when heirs appear.  You could give them a call and see if they could help, or immediately jump in, until you can get situated with a lawyer.
Also... I have the titles to all the vehicles. And they're valuable enough that no one would dare buy one without the title.
[deleted]
Is the property(real estate and vehicles) in Virginia as well?
Yeah, don’t listen to that noise. If you have his death certificate and the will you have all the power. Use the cops.
NAL consider changing the locks on the house.
Yes there is a mortgage on the house, but it's 80% paid off so it's got valuable amount of equity. All the vehicles are paid off. 

He typed the will up on his own, from one of those legal website templates.
A death cert and will is all she needs to prove ownership. She needs to press charges
So over here it’s basically in case of any unprecedented bills come up. They say ‘up to 6 months’ it’s at your disgression, however it might not be applicable in the USA. Who’s the executor?
[deleted]
He died in Virginia and I'm in Florida, so I'm having to fly up for the probate hearing. I reached out to one lawyer, but they wanted $500 for a one hour consult over the phone
You are forgetting the 6 counts of grand theft auto
They filed the first one on July 26th and cancelled it the day before. So I rescheduled for the upcoming one on Aug 26th
Lawyer. Now. For real. I get it money is tight but this is the time to break glass in case of emergency. Also I’m sorry for your loss.
They could part them out and then there'll be no vehicles. Please get a lawyer
[deleted]
The house, yes. The cars have been moved to his brothers house in Maryland (I don't have the address)
Cops can’t assign ownership of property, especially if there is a probate court date.  The other party can’t sell any of the vehicles or motorcycles without a title and the residence has a mortgage on it.
Did he have it notorized or was there witnesses when it was signed?  The probate court will have to show the will is true.  Additionally if he owes any creditors, including mortgage then they could be entitled to their share of the estate.  Did he place anything in a trust with you in it?   

Listing and photographes will be your best friend for smaller property additionally make sure to photograph serial and model numbers.

Having a lawyer is really going to help to get everything filed properly.
How can I obtain a death certificate? Who do I request it from?
If there is a date for probate court hearing she may not be able to file anything until after the court appoints her the owner of said property.   With many of these cases it is more of a civil then criminal case until there is a court order in place.   The fact that there is a probate case makes me believe that the other party possibly filed paperwork with the court.
You need to stop providing false legal advice.
In cases like these lawyers are 100% worth it. Do not wait
A lawyer could potentially be paid from the estate. This isn't something you can DIY.
No, they won’t. They will say “wow it sounds like you really need to get a lawyer to deal with this.”

The courts can make orders for people to do things, but that only happens when a case is brought before a judge - usually after serving the other side, preparing the necessary documents, and going through some procedural steps. That is what you should be hiring a lawyer to do for you. 

Unless the assets have no value, you can’t afford *not* to hire a lawyer. The alternative is just letting it all get stolen.
You're not familiar enough with the law, nor with the court system or etiquette. Chances are you're gonna fuck it up if you contact the court yourself.
Get a lawyer.
Depending on what state you're in, yes, they will and then some.
The Virginia Bar has a [lawyer consultation program](https://vlrs.community.lawyer/pages/faq#:~:text=The%20%2435.00%20pre%2Dpaid%20referral,representation%20by%20a%20VLRS%20lawyer) that costs $35 and gives you a half-hour consult with a lawyer in the area of your need. It’s very helpful; I used it with a specific question regarding my dad’s estate, got the answer, and didn’t need to pay more for a longer consultation or relationship with the lawyer.

I’m sorry about your loss.
I can appreciate the stresses your under at the moment. But seriously. Get a lawyer. What would you rather lose now. Afew 1000$ now or afew 100 000$. Talk to lawyers let them know your cash poor but your willing to sell the cars or whatever else so you can pay them
I don't think it can be reiterated strongly enough, lawyer, now, asap. I can understand how stressful and scary this whole situation is, you've just lost your partner and I offer my sincerest condolences, this should be a time of mourning and rest for you but unfortunately you've been chucked into the deep end and you've got to start kicking else you'll drown. Get that lawyer dear, it's worth every penny.
Oh man.  You are correct and that would be a really shitty outcome for OP.  They mention in another comment that the cars are valuable.
They're trying to sell off new aftermarket parts he hadn't installed yet, but I think they know the car is more valuable if its kept in one piece and drivable (It's a MKIV Toyota Supra, 2 Evo 8's, a 2g DSM, and a BMW S1000rr)
The lawyer will get paid out of the estate, so when you sell the assets, that will give you the money to pay the lawyer, assuming you are going to sell off the assets.
No but she CAN call them cops and tell them that they were trespassing and stole 6 cars and furniture, and with the texts and proof the cops would have a field day
They can’t assign it but they can see that the people who possess the cars are not the titled owners, can they not?
I never said they would. She needs them involved anyway.
Yes, he had 2 witnesses and it was notarized. 

He made the will about 3 months before he died, even though his death was completely out of nowhere. So I don't think he had time to put anything into a trust
A lawyer will be able to help you with all of this stuff.  You need to hire one yesterday or his family is going to end up with everything and there will be nothing you can do about it.

It shouldn't be that hard to find one willing to wait until the estate is settled for payment, that's a pretty normal thing for probate attorneys.
Whomever has the body. A funeral home
His family scheduled the first probate hearing and told me to attend if I wanted to fight them for my boyfriends assets. So I flew from Florida to Virginia just for the court to tell me a family member cancelled the hearing the day prior. So I rescheduled it, idk if they notified his family or not.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS, I'll utilize it immediately
His family banned me from the funeral and won't tell me what they did with his body
Husband caught our friend walking out of our daughters room while she was sleeping
My husband caught a close friend of ours coming out of our 4 year old daughter’s bedroom during a family get-together last night while she was sleeping. We thought he went inside to grab a drink or use the bathroom. My husband decided he needed to use the bathroom as well so was waiting, but he was taking a while so he went inside to check. That’s when he caught him leaving the room. 

When my husband demanded to know what he was doing in there, he was speechless and couldn’t give  an answer. We fortunately keep a nanny cam in her room so we were able to go back and see that he crept in into her room, touched her face, then walked back out (presumably to check if anyone was coming), and then went back inside and grabbed her hand. Thats when my husband started walking towards the room. He was in my kids room for no longer than 2 minutes and, luckily, my daughter had no idea what happened. 

There is no doubt in my mind that he was predating on my daughter and testing to see if she would wake up. My husband and brother-in-law immediately kicked him out of our home and he is permanently cut out of our lives.  We will be filing a police report tonight, but do we have enough to file a civil restraining order as well? 

I don’t think he’ll ever try to get access to my daughter again but I want to know if there are other options that we can pursue to make sure he never gets near her again, and also so that he doesn’t potentially get access to other kids. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you.
Can't give you exact info because I don't know your location, but I'm a police dispatcher. If this happened in my jurisdiction they'd take your statement, talk to him, note in the report that no offense occured. If you have the recordings submit those because it's evidence. You would not be able to get a restraining order but it's good to build a paper trail. I'd also privately talk to anyone else in your circle with kids.

You can make a complaint to the police if you like but what your former friend did is creepy but legal. You also won't be granted a civil restraining order against him. You  can limit his access to your child but you have no way of preventing him from coming into contact with other children.

>File the police report OP; laws will vary by jurisdiction

I don't know of any jurisdiction where touching a child's face or holding their hand is illegal or grounds for a restraining order, but fair enough.

OP, where are you located?

Documentation is still a good thing. If someone else comes to police with a bigger claim there is now history to back up what this guy is capable of.
Kicked out and given $7.30 after $1,000+ casino win. 

Hey all, so me and few buddies are driving back from Wyoming and after finding out it’s 18+ (we’re all 19) we decided to stop at a restaurant with some slots. 

I sit down, put $20 in, and get about 2 spins in before an employee walks up and ask for my ID, no problem, it’s Wyoming and I’m 19. She checks it’s, pretty extensively so I’m assuming she actually checks my ID, plus the Colorado ID  says “Under 21” right on it. Anyways, she looks at it, says “Thanks, have fun,” then checks my friends ID’s. 

Everything’s good and about 3 spins later I hit major jackpot for $1,097.26. The lady is still next to us and watching this unfold, we’re all excited and she looks happy for us and say they gotta handpay. 

Now, I’m at the desk, handing a different lady my ID, and she says “Are you only 19?” to which I gladly say “yeah”. She then starts telling me that this location is 21+ and that only some of there locations are 18+, which to be fair it did say on the website, just not which locations, which is why we went in to find out. We didn’t see any signs walking in and literally had our IDs checked by staff before winning. Anyways, she calls her boss who says to pay what’s left from what I put in out of my 20$, $7.30, instead of the 1,000$+.  Am I at fault or did I just get robbed?

UPDATE: After writing a very long and strongly worded letter to the place and their parent company, and informing them that I’d be contacting the Wyoming Gaming Commission and an attorney if we were unable to solve this problem directly today, I received a call from them today that they will be both banning me and paying me out! I’m so grateful for all the advice and PMs. Glad I didn’t have to escalate it further, but the fact they were able to do this in the first place was wild. Gonna have a real annoying 3 hour total ride back up to Wyoming to claim this though.  
If there is a governing gaming commission, you should try them first.  Not sure how it would work if theyre an indian casino
Make a complaint with the gaming department in wyoming.  They exist to solve these type of issues. Should not cost you anything.
If you legitimately weren't able to gamble there, I imagine they would have given you your full 20$ back,  to pretend it never happened. By keeping it, they acknowledge your ability to spend it.

Assuming this was not on a reservation, I would reach out to the state's gaming commission. If it's on a reservation, most tribes have their own. Best of luck.

Very unlikely any attorney is going to be interested unless there is some sort of statute that awards attorneys fees or some theory by which damages are greater than the ~$1,000 you didn’t receive.

A child drowned when I was at the lake.
I went to the lake recently with some friends, and while we were there, a child drowned. 

I responded to screams when I heard them and recovered his body from the bottom of the lake as fast as I could.

After getting his body, I performed CPR until he started breathing again.

He was sent to the hospital, but I do not believe he woke up.

My question is: Should I take any steps to protect myself legally? I did everything that I could to save him, but he was underwater for a long time. Can I be held liable if he doesn’t survive?

I’m located in Washington state, USA.

EDIT: I received a text today that said that the child is awake and sitting up and speaking. He seems to be doing well.
Rescuing a drowning individual and performing CPR on them falls under the protection of the Good Samaritan Act in Washington state. Basically, the law is in place to protect people from criminal liability in the event that their assistance contributes to the person’s further injury or death. The motivation for having Good Samaritan laws on the books is not only to encourage people to help others when they’re in need, but to protect them from a civil lawsuit. Good Samaritan laws won’t always stop someone from filing a civil lawsuit against you, but when you know the limits of what you can and can’t do, it will make it harder for the other person to prevail in their lawsuit. See Revised Code of Washington (RCW 4.24.300).
You're likely protected by Washington's Good Samaritan laws.

[https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/2900/goodsam.pdf](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/2900/goodsam.pdf)
You did a good thing that day.  Responded to an emergency, performed CPR, and resuscitated him.  Regardless of the outcome, you positioned him for the best chance for survival.  You are a hero!

The Good Samaritan law will protect you unless there was some sort of act of negligence on your part.  Based on your story I don't see any issues.
NAL but CPR certified. 

You are protected under the Good Samaritan law. You did what you could, and didn’t go outside your training  (aka excessive stuff like needle decompressions for example). 

The only exception is if you’re an on duty EMT or lifeguard, but you didn’t say you are. And even then, you reacted as any lifeguard should. 

You stepped in and did your part to do the best you can in a horrible situation. 
Thats all you can do. I highly recommend speaking with a therapist if it starts to get to you. 

Take some time to recover though, the adrenaline rush does knock you out for a bit..

Edit since this is getting a tiny bit of traction,

I’ve been through a similar situation (riptide, I was a lifeguard on vacation at the time and went to help), if you need someone to talk to who’s been through something similar, my DMs are open..
I definitely think you are protected under the Good Samaritan law however please speak to a therapist. Coping with things like this will sneak up on you. Mental health is not something to mess with.
[removed]
You should speak with a therapist. This may or may not haunt you, but I'm leaning on the former since you appear to be traumatized by the outcome despite your best effort to save the child.
Good Samaritan laws protect you as long as you didn't present yourself as something you're not. So as long as you didn't claim to be a doctor when you're not, you're legally safe.
Others have said it but I'll summarize.  You are protected via good samaritan laws.  In the absence of good samaritan laws, you are liable for negligence and liable to continue rescue efforts once you started.

It doesnt sound like you were negligent or that you stopped rescue efforts.

If you were negligent, I believe good samaritan laws give you an extra layer of protection sometimes, up to recklessness. (the scale is negligent -> reckless -> knowingly -> intentionally)  You wouldnt be reckless unless you were Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun giving medical aid.  A reckless rescue would be Dumber and dumber level asinine. 

You're good.

As a fellow Washington State resident who's done a few certifications, this is correct. You did the best you could with what you knew. You helped because you needed to, and you did not expect any form of compensation. I'm really sorry that you had to experience this. I think your ability to spring into action says a lot about you as a human being.
Okay, thank you.

I believe in Washington state, as long as the rescuer is not acting unreasonably, with gross negligence, or with wilful malice, they are still protected even if the attempted rescue leaves the victim in worse condition.  E.g., when trying to retrieve a child from a crumbling cliff ledge, they knock a rock loose that hits kid in the head.

No. You are not responsible for his death - legally or morally. Anyone telling you otherwise is talking out their ass, full stop. Thank you for trying; he was already dead when you found him and your actions gave him the best possible chance. I am so sorry you experienced this.
NAL. A medical professional working in an official capacity would be held to a different standard than a layperson acting in good faith. Unless you were grossly negligent in your delivery of CPR I don’t see how you would be in any way criminally liable. On top of this my states Good Samaritan law protects you from civil liability. As others have stated here your best bet would be to reference Washington state statutes to clear up any worries. As an EMT I commend you on your actions, you did much more than most bystanders.
I got sexually assaulted by a masseuse 
This literally happened like 20 minutes ago, and I'm kind of freaking out here and I don't know what to do. 
I'm in Houston, TX right now to work the Rodeo and my back has been killing me lately, so I decided to get a massage from Groupon. During my massage, it was super relaxing, felt great, but then he started getting lower and lower in the bottom region. I figured that was just a normal deep tissue massage because I had never gotten one before. Until he stuck his finger in me... I was in complete shock. I just froze. I didn't tell him to stop, nothing. I just kind of moved my leg to close it and then he stopped. I've never had anything like this happen to me before and I don't really know if this is something I can report, and tbh I don't really want to put my business out there. If anything I'm a little embarrassed, and don't want people to judge me. I'm putting this on here because yall don't know who I am, so this is completely anonymous. Advice?

Update: Small update, I filed a police report and they should be at my hotel any minute now. 
Update2: it's been two hours and the cops still haven't showed up.

Update 3: cops showed up. They came knocking at my door at 4:30am. Because I am a women and slightly paranoid, I did not answer the door, nor did I look in the peep hole (it was covered and I didn't wanna make any noise). But like are you serious? 4:30am?! That's insane. 

Update 4: I filed a report with the Texas licensing board. Will update after this. 
I used to be a prosecutor in my state and this is more common than you think (the fact pattern mirrors a case I personally prosecuted). Also, freezing is a common response of victims. You did nothing wrong. It’s not your fault. If he tried this with you, it’s likely not the first time. You may save others from the same assault by supporting the state so that the perpetrator is prosecuted. After you’re done with the police, take some time for self care and consider speaking to a psychologist/psychiatrist. 💕
As a massage therapist this is horrifying. File a police report, then contact the states licensing board. Give as detailed an account as possible to both parties. I am so sorry this happened to you.
[deleted]
I am so sorry you went through this. I may be totally off, but I am sensing a little self-judgement and recrimination about not doing anything in response. You experienced a freeze response, this is a literal bodily response to trauma that is impossible to override. It is our body’s self-protective mechanism. Please do not feel shame for it and it should not stop you from reporting this assault
There is “fight or flight” but there is also “freeze or appease”, which is an equally valid automatic response. Please don’t blame yourself.
You can use this site to file a complaint on his license. 
https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/mas/masfaq.htm#complaint

I'm so sorry, OP.
I know you’ve already reported to the police.

Please also report to the licensing board:  [https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/complaints/](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/complaints/) 

Also, let Groupon know. [https://www.groupon.com/faq/article/462](https://www.groupon.com/faq/article/462)
I am very close to someone who was assaulted in the same manner. It is possible that this is a repeat offense by the same attacker.
I’m sorry that happened to you.  No one is judging you.  I’ll judge the hell out of the asshole who assaulted you, but you’re good.  You have done nothing wrong and nothing to deserve what he did to you.  

Please file a report, and seek some counseling.   RAINN is a good place to start.  https://www.rainn.org/
Lawyer here (not admitted in Texas). This is criminal sexual assault. 
Call the cops they may have a test that can actually detect and prove that he digitally penetrated you without consent and that is a serious crime. Sorry this happened. Good luck.
I am so sorry this happened to you. 
INAL but this happened to someone I know. She sued their (the national massage chain)  asses off and has won. I would assume it isn’t his first/last time. 
I understand being embarrassed but I highly recommend filing a police report and moving forward with charges.
Wow. I’m so sorry. I saw your update that you filed a police report. Seriously, good for you! I know that was hard and it’s incredibly brave.
I'm sorry this happened to you. You can also make a report to your state's massage therapist licensing board.
contact police and reach out to the owner of the place, privately if you prefer…
 i own a spa that does facials and massages and i would file a report myself against said employee…. if this person isn’t fired by EOD and their license revoked this place shouldn’t be in business…
[removed]
Thank you for reporting. I live in Houston...this predator needs to be put away. Thank you for your bravery and reporting this monster.
[removed]
No one is judging you. I’m so sorry this happened to you.
The same kind of thing happened to me, but not as awful. I was so shaken up afterward that my husband went up to the massage place (major chain) and talked to management. I never saw that person again. I was so embarrassed at the time that I didn't want to talk to anyone about what happened, but I'm glad my husband was protective of me and went up there because that creepy masseuse probably would have done it again to someone else.
[removed]
File a police report ASAP, you are probably not the first person this horrible act was done to. Then SUE the shit out of the company.
There is no reason to go down there. None at all.
I got chills down my spine. I am so sorry this happened to you, my goodness. You need legal representation as well, they can request if there are any cameras in that room etc. and just sue the shit out of this place. 

other people may also come forward too. He is a monster.

This person MUST face consequences.

I also recommend hiring a therapist. You need to take care of your mental health. I am so so, sorry.
OMG that's horrible! I'm so so sorry that happened to you! (T \_ T)

I'm so glad you called the police!
Call the police and call the massage therapist licensing agency and file a complaint. It might be the city or the county and the state. Look on all of their websites to see if they license massage therapists, and report to all of them. Let them sort out which jurisdiction covers the spa you went to. I was the massage license agent in my jurisdiction for 12 years and we'd take that report very seriously.  Please report this therapist.
I am a massage therapist, this is NOT normal, and I am glad you are speaking up! I am sorry this happened to you, the therapist is completely at fault, no if ands or buts about it. It is NEVER okay to engage any client this way.
This is horrifying. I’m so sorry this happened to you. I hope he gets arrested.
Oh my goodness…. 

CALL THE POLICE!!!!!
First and foremost, I'm sorry this happened to you. I hope you're taking care of yourself in the meantime, and I hope you know that any emotions you're feeling are totally normal.

Next, I'm glad you filed a police report. Please report him to his employer also, if this was an employee of mine, I'd like to know so I could take appropriate action. 

This was sexual assault. Please know you are not overreacting. Please know you aren't alone, you aren't the only woman who has experienced SA from a masseuse. 

You did the right thing, and I'm so proud of you. If it's at all possible, please consider talking to someone to help you process as this situation unfolds. I'm so sorry.
Jfc.   I'm glad you filed the police report.  Absolutely ridiculous.  Who the actual hell does that.  On behalf of men I apologize.  Jfc.   I hope he goes to prison.
I’m sorry it happened to you. Glad you filed a report. This is not okay. :(
I don’t have any advice other than file a report which you have but I’m terribly sorry this happened to you.

You need to file a police report
I’m so sorry this happened to you. First of all, this is NOT your fault. Do NOT feel guilty for freezing up. It was such a scary situation. I hope you reported this and get some therapy. I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry this happened to you

No. My thought is will they even believe me or do anything about it? And do I have to go into the actual station? Or is there a number I can call? I really know nothing

OP says the person owns the place. Absolutely disgusting. I highly doubt its the first offense. People like this should have no place in civilized society.

Thank you. I appreciate your advice and kind words.

You can google the non emergency line for Houston PD. Call and tell them you’d like to file a report - at that point they may request that you come in to make the report. 

At the very least you should contact the owner of the business and report this employees behaviour. What he did was disgusting, and if he did it to you he will most likely do it to others until he gets caught, ie: until someone reports him.
More than likely, he’s done it before. That’s why he was so quick to do it to you. He may have a record. But if he doesn’t, start it. He should not get away with continuing to do that to people.
That is what someone who has been assaulted asks.. you have been assaulted. Call the police. There are probably more victims.
So for professional reasons, i won't reveal the name of my work place but I do work as a receptionist at a massage place, and depending if it falls with your state, there's protocols for sexual misconduct by therapists to their clients that can be done by the management and they will work with you for an investigation of what happened to you. I know you mentioned filing a report which is the first thing I would do, i would also see if you can ask management to talk to about the incident and they can help you alongside police to file an investigation for what happened. I'm sorry that you dealt with that and I hope you're able to get the situation resolved. I'm rooting for you
I’m so sorry.  There is nothing worse than being in such a vulnerable position and for someone to take advantage of you.  I’m proud of you for calling the police.  Like others have said, there’s probably more victims and this sicko needs to be shut down.
I’m very sorry this happened to you. Similar happened to me.  In that moment, you’re trying to figure out wtf is happening, trying to make the illogical logical. I froze not knowing what to do because also in compromising position.  Call a sexual assault helpline. I’m proud of you for filing a report! You can call the company and ask who he’s licensed by and report him to certification board so they can take away his license and won’t get job elsewhere.
Sending you gentle hugs, I cannot fathom how frightening that was. You did everything right, and are safe now. I hope he suffers the quickest of punitive punishment and peace for you.

Yea, I'll do that. And, it's his business. I think he's the only one that works there.
[removed]
Oh god, that’s terrible. I know you may feel scared or embarrassed but what happened is not your fault at all.  

If it were me I’d file a police report, blast his business online if he has listings anywhere, and maybe you can even report it to Groupon - hopefully they would take it seriously and ban him from their platform. Idk man, I’d go all out because what he did is sick. Fuck that guy. 

 Edit: Sorry I’m getting so mad but this sort of behavior infuriates me.
I'm thinking I might do that once I've let it sink it. Cus rn, like I said, I'm just embarrassed and don't really want people that know me know what I went through. Maybe once I talk to the police, I'll feel better about doing that. 
I actually tried to report it to Groupon, but they're making me jump through so many hoops
Former LMT here, please report this gross predator to the police
School made child do a “bra-lift”
My 7th grade daughter was taken to the principal’s office. Once there the principal told my daughter she had suspicions of her vaping. She had asked my daughter several questions one being “have you ever vaped?” My daughter answered yes. “Is your mother aware?” My daughter answered yes. (Yes I was aware that she had vaped in the past and no I was not allowing her to vape). “Have you ever vaped on school premises?” My daughter answered no. She had my daughter dump out her backpack and nothing was found. Then the principal (alone with my daughter) made my daughter do a bra lift and shake her bra to prove nothing was in there. 

My issues is that the school never notified me after the search. And I do not feel the bra lift was necessary and was illegal.

You may want to consult a lawyer before anything else. There are several articles about this same thing occurring at schools throughout the US. It fairly standard practice for LE. 

Most of the cases decided that the school officials didn't have enough of a reason to do it. They would need to be reasonable certain there was contraband hidden in the bra in order to legally conduct the search. 

In your case that's not extremely clear either way. A lawyer would be your best bet.
Consult a lawyer. The line between reasonable and unreasonable in this type of situation can be very fine and based on small details that a lawyer could talk through in more detail with you. You could also submit a complaint to the school board about the situation to potentially change the school's policy in the future
If nothing else, id complain to the school board.

I would not go to the school myself. I would have all future communication through a lawyer at this point if it were my daughter.

Get an attorney and take them to the next school board meeting.

Bra lift consisted of my child having to pull her bra away from her body, lean forward, and shake back and forth to see if she was hiding anything in her bra.
