Did you make this? I love it so much.
You'd think that Pattern, being interested in human behavior, would be all for it and Syl, being an honorspren, would be more prudish. The fact that it's exactly the opposite is pretty funny to me
Okay, of all the things I expected to see today, cheerleader Syl wasn't one of them.
If Brandon discovers what we are doing these days, he'll send us all to Damnation.
Not h\*nd h*lding. That’s too depraved, even for this subreddit.
Not Pattern being taped to the floor 😭
OMG, PATTERN PLASTERED ONTO THE FLOOR WITH TAPE DSIFJOIS  
(Your art is so beautiful)
I'd even had the thought of "I wonder what glyph(s) would go on a Syl cheer outfit?", great minds think alike
Being a submissive into bondage and ~~orgasm~~ mating denial is 100% Pattern's kink.
Damn, she bad as fuck
Pattern being packing-taped down. lol
Hey that's me!
Artist?
This crem deserves some chouta! You have 2 posts I love, gon!
Dallinar, in the corner, talking to himself about how important momentum is
Thank you for covering her safehand.
You know she'd make herself visible to others too
This is so cute. Syl with pigtails is something I didn't know I needed

source?
This is gold!

Or should I say… blue.
*annoyed buzzing*
Syl is just the best, guys.
My silly butt first read that as “Go, Go, Go! Bridge Burn!”

So now I’m thinking of the actual bridge saying “but I’m a bunch of sticks…”
Inspired by Brazillian Miku
My thought as well
Nope, I didn't make this. There was a very violent storm, and I fainted. When I came to, I found this on my iPad, and they told me to post it here.
Pattern is just silly, and Syl is just horny.
Reminder that Pattern isn't actually against it, it's just that Shallan asked him to be her chaperone in order for her meeting with Adolin to be "proper" and that's how he interpreted it. .
Pattern is not prudish, he just takes Shallan's assignment very serious.
Syl is also one of the most humanlike spren we’ve seen. So it would make sense she’s also the horniest
Nah bro. Honorsprens are all about bonding.
Well, that's one of the things with honor: everyone sees it as different. Syl was "imagined" by people that don't see sex as dishonorable. Brandon probably believes that it is (outside of marriage), but he's totally fine with writing characters that have different beliefs than him.

Pattern just followed Shallan's instructions very enthusiastically.
Syl, being an honorspren, hates cheating/adultery. Because that involves violating oaths. If nobody is cheating, it's binding two people together, however temporarily, so she's all for it
Glad to be of service
Yeah this got me feeling things
Send me to Damnation, and I will come back a father.
If he wants us to stop he could write faster so we're too busy reading to post silly things. 
He's already seen the horrors of people wondering about the utility of Investure in non-combat scenarios, [such as live Shardblades changing shape.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/d6x9g8/comment/f0w6oww/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

No, your art is beautiful. The way you draw your characters is way too cute.

It’s in Oathbringer.

I could be misremembering, but I thought it was while they were courting on the Shattered Plains. Been awhile since I read either.
It’s in Oathbringer.  Shallan hides the fact that she’s a lightweaver until the end of WoR, so Adolin didn’t know about Pattern until they were on the way to Urithiru
It’s finally Herf
What is herf precious?
Herf . . . Been a long time since anyone has called me by that name. . . Most just use Hoid. . .
This is good. Accurate. Needed.
HERF stands for Hoid Eats Rosharan Femboys, which is going to be Brandon's first foray into true NSFW fiction
I shouldn't be laughing so much at this

But after a week of 631 speculation, "herf" broke me
HERF HERF ITS FINALLY HEEERRRFFFFF
For some reason this picture has me convinced Sanderson has been slowly morphing into Jonathan Frakes.  On 6/31 the metamorphasis will be complete and Star Trek will become part of the Cosmere.
So excited for the 630 video.
Stormlight 5 is now *bing* 631% complete! Turns out the book is going to be 7,000 pages and releases tomorrow
6 episodes, 3 seasons, 1 movie
If Sanderson doesn't add a character named Herf in his next book I'm going to be a little upset  
Cremposting deserves it!
Gosh he’s graying. Someone get this man some immunity. We need him to keep writing
Herf.
A cremmy commerical!
Do. It. FOR.

HeRf
"You will be herf again."
The new leatherbound is gonna be $631
SA5?
On this day comes a savior, born to you in the land of Utah. Herf, son of someone idk.
It's herfing time
Finallv
He's going to announce he is retiring from writing
Just as the Backerkit page count down hit 6:31 to go it crashed with an application error
It's finallv herf, actually
Don't tell anyone, but I have already read the book after the one he's releasing today.
Anybody got a good one-armed Herfdazian joke?
“My name is Herf.

I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.

You may have heard of me.”
Can't spell Vorin without Vor(e)
Well now you’ve ruined the big reveal on 6.31
I heard he's gonna release it as "fanfic" under the nom de plume "Brandy_Sander_Sin."
cant wait
are there actually femboys on roshar? are there any femboy anywhere in the cosmere? i mean confirmed ones.
Just gonna throw this out: Scadrial and Naltis femboys >>> Roshar femboys
He can’t eat Dalinar, who would lead then?
We'll know it's almost time when he starts sitting backwards in chairs
It was actually a short clipped from the last episode of Intentionally Blank. The WoR leatherbound launch video is 631.
I'm pissed I missed the 420 video
Herf is going to have seasons?!
Hey, he earned those fair and square
I volunteer to give up my breath to the man
Just give him a casual Dawnshard.
I'm 32 and I've got some grey hairs. I don't hate how they look, though.
It’s just his beard. Hair is still looking good.
Already been announced. Seems to look like the SA leather bound.
He finished winds of winter.
Don’t
You are making me try to remember something . . . But it feels intentionally repressed.
That night, there were sixteen kinds of silence
They see me Vorin’, they haaatin’.
They see me Vorin’, they haaatin’.
Sanderson posted on R/Cosmere it’s 6:31 apparently in proper formatting.
Continue slandering Renarin like that and Dalinar will need another 1200 pages to deal with  what he'd do to you.
Oh you’re right. How embarrassing for me.

A man? Reading the way of kings? Heresy!
Oddly enough, I'm in the midst of a reread, so at this very moment I, too, am enjoying The Way of Kings.
HI ENJOYING THE WAY OF KINGS, IM DAD.
Is your father’s last name Kholin, by any chance?
Why is a man reading?
Incredibly deep opinion with several layers. Amazing take
[reminds me of Patrick Rothfuss' blurb](https://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2010/09/the-way-of-kings/)
We need to hit him with the ol' 600-page essay.
It reads like he got halfway through a haiku and gave up
Did he copy/paste the title? Lol

Absolute minimalist text
PoV: You asked the Highprince if he's heard any good stories recently
I have nothing to add to this conversation except to say that I made the upvotes go from 999 to 1000, and I feel rather good about that.
He capitalised the ‘The’ and lowercased the ‘of’ 

Only true radiants do that!!!
I disagree. As I read it in the past and am not currently reading it, I “enjoyed” the way of kings
This feels, somehow, passively aggressive
My Dad was the same way lol. I got him to tell me his favorite character. It was Kaladin. He related a lot to Kaladin. 

yes my dad has depression
Good Chouta
Your father-in-law is a king, and he likes his way of life.
I read this as the wank of kings
It was the best book I had ever read. At least, it was to my particular tastes. Upon reread it wasn’t as exciting though because Brando likes to have twists and turns and end chapters with minor cliffhangers.
Well said.
I would've personally added a 'really' before 'enjoying' but that's just me.
No, im loving it
Rereading. I too am enjoying The Way of Kings
This is literally my mom right now
Honestly, I think it’s more of a Renaldo moment.  

I can imagine a scene with Dalinar, Adolin, and Renard at the dinner table, Adolin jabbering about dueling or something. Dalinar grunts occasionally, his mind on the war.  

Adolin steps away from the table and there’s a lull in the conversation. Rupert finally speaks up. 

“Father?”

“Yes son?”

“I am enjoying *The Way of Kings.*”

Dalinar is silent for a moment, looking at his son.  Their eyes meet briefly, before Ronald glances away.  

“That’s wonderful -“ Dalinar checks his notes. “-Renarin”
Get your niece to read it to you after your brother's funeral! Really adds to the depth.
Woah he said enjoying, not reading. Surely his wife or niece or some woman is reading it to him
Yes, in fact, I just finished my reread and I, too, enjoyed The Way of Kings.
“Hi Dad, I’m Renarin.”
I read that line in Ferb's voice
*Ronald Kholin wore a red sweater on the day he was to attend Hogwarts.*
I just finished a reread and I was like “oh no I’ve already forgotten a character?? Who is Renaldo??” And I absolutely cackled by the time I got to Rupert. 😂👏
Still a troublesome behavior, and he should be cautious

*Subscript: I need to apologize for my husband, his Vorin beliefs have become far too strong since the Dalinar incident*
“Who?”
Renaldo is Ferb confirmed, does that make Adolin… Phineas? And Shallan is Isabella.
Subscript: This gave me a good laugh and smile!
Checks out
Kaladin is Perry the Platypus?
This is so canon
The Stormfather is Major Monogram. “The evil Odium is up to his old tricks. For reasons unknown to us he has created a massive army of crabs. Get out there and stop him.”
Moash: >!“And for my next plan, the Character Arc Ender… inator!”!<
Thanks… I read the in Monograms voice… xD
I’ve watched and rewatched Phineas and Ferb so so many times, especially recently with first the new(ish) movie and then the news of a season 5 coming out next year, and all the characters are so iconic, I love making false quotes for them 😂
shadesmar in my head
cross-posted from my tumblr because i felt cremposting needed to see it 
I mean it's just balls. Like literally balls. Small balls of marble that don't want to turn into fire.
The way I imagined shadesmar I was sure I’d go insane within hours. Black sun, no color in sight, only an ocean of beads you can’t drink or swim in? Nightmare fuel
“Wait i remember my friend on tumblr posting this a while ago.”

* checks profile *

HI RENARINES!!!!!
Yup. I'm not quite aphantasic, but I'm close.
I imagine it as a mix of both. Forbidden ball pit and ancient land full of wonder.
100% accurate.

https://preview.redd.it/hhieqz7lv7sd1.png?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52054f00697913fadf310ba9b8a2a9c43805760d
... Yeah, that's exactly it. I didn't even realize that "black with marbles" wasn't the full idea until now. Well done!
This is distressingly accurate.
the incredible shadesmar art by celine nauleau by the way!!!
I didn’t consent to you stealing my thoughts
https://preview.redd.it/0ejyvi2udasd1.jpeg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7351190d345a3765ce6a628323aa0a2f20b637cc

This is Shadesmar in my head, but remove the colors.
I just imagine one of those platlstic ball pits they have at children's play areas.  Only much bigger and darker.  With the spren as kids in costumes.
Yeah the Shadesmar plotlines are cool but the setting depresses the hell out of me, imagining a black sky with a tiny sun and the ground is made of obsidian and there’s a black ocean of glass beads and all the plants are glass too??? It just seems like hell. Or purgatory.
I did a painting of my interpretation of shadesmar about 8 years ago for my A-levels. I was gonna leave the sky black but my teacher said the black sky looked wack

Below is just a bit of it- the piece is over 2m long, and Reddit wouldn’t let me post the aspect ratio it would have been. Don’t worry about pattern doing some funky stuff with his hand, it was an art piece after all

https://preview.redd.it/6v3oq0geccsd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b4e6b825a03607e4a47658d25e5fbbc562105d
I have a vivid imagination and this is STILL all I can come up with.
No it’s just a huge ocean of marbles, that’s how it’s described…
No shade(smar) but I believe Mr. Sanderson have dropped the ball(s) on the whole place. Shattered planes, Urithiru and Roshar as a whole felt distinct as they introduced unique to them circumstances and challenges. Shadesmar's unique characteristics are a black sun that has zero influence on the behavior of characters, you can drown in it's " water" most of the time, spren behave either like regular animals or like regular humans and there are no storms or stormlight so it basically removes a unique exciting part of the setting. I can force myself to "see" it but there is no gravitas to the fantasy and it quickly goes back to just a territory characters have to cross.
For me it looks more like a retrowave world with the little pebbles sea yes, but land marked black with thin topology lines and a very faint sun
For some reason I just keep imagining everything white and blocky (other than the beads obviously) with no detail even though it's described as dark and has "shade" in the name.

Also, [RoW] >!Lasting Integrity!< is so hard to imagine. Every time it's on screen I feel like I'm using all my brainpower just to keep it from collapsing and turning into an incoherent imagination blob. Or blocks, I guess.
I'm glad I'm not the only one lol
![gif](giphy|gJqUDXCD6IWNq|downsized)

I always think of this when they are plucking balls out to see what they are.
OMG YES. I had no idea it was supposed to look like the one on the top
not the beads!!!!!!
sighs in aphantasia
My imagination for books is usually pretty good. I loved picturing the Emerald and the Crimson in Tress, and Yumi and the Nightmare Painter gave me such vivid images I ate nothing but ramen for two weeks. But Shadesmar looks pretty much exactly like that second picture for me. Well, not really, more dark purple. Just a bunch of straight obsidian slabs and a caviar-esque ocean in between.
Lmao exactly
It’s balls
It's like you're seeing into my very head.
Honestly same
You guys remember in Dune where we are introduced to Feyd-Rautha? I think of that + orbees EVERYWHERE
Shadesmar is basically a giant ball pit
I picture it as a crystal ball pit.

It also made me think of the behind scenes area from American Gods.
Shadesmar sounds way, way more weirder in my head.
Exactly the imagen I had when I first read it. Im so glad I'm not alone on this!
the spren towns are even worse, they look like a bunch of ugly lego buildings in my head
Oh my god, this is a step away from how I imagine it LOL
It took forever to train my brain to imagine the spheres as small enough. I think I managed it on my third reading of Way of Kings
I thought it was just me being dumb
Why is this so accurate 🤣
What I'm seeing: https://imgur.com/a/9fjJUHh
exactly how i imagine it btw
Bruh. Are you me!! Literally same. I am the worst at imagining complex worlds like that.
shadesmar is just dashcon
I assumed a ball pit TBH
Man we all are really just living the same life. I totally sympathize!
*Magnificent* balls
Shadesmar is just one giant ball pit.
I am a stick.
Goodness gracious, ~~great~~ balls ~~of fire~~
I just keep thinking of a chuck e cheese ball pit
Well there's obsidian too, but yeah mostly balls
Baller
Yeah, I thought the section in Oathbringer where the crew are stranded after Kholinar really undersold how terrifying their situation was. If they hadn't gotten lucky with that lighthouse, that would have basically been guaranteed death
Same, I need official art to help my unimaginative ass out.
ASH-SOKIA!!!! MY TUMBLR BUDDY!!!!!!!!!
Ahh the forgotten daughter of Dalinar: Renarines sister of Renarin.
I would say I'm almost completely unable to see things in my head (like its bad enough that i cant even picture an apple if i saw one and immediatelytried to imagine one lol). It sucks, especially when reading 😂 But yes, if I could, I would probably picture this in my head 😂
For me, I can see details perfectly but the whole picture horribly. The beads? Vivid in my head. The zoomed out image of shadesmar? What is that I only know beads and weird sun
Yeah im just imagining a shady ball pit

Better view of pattern. Painted him completely with a palette knife
except for all the solid obsidian land parts with glass plants. yeah.
Is it supposed to be "THIS CONTENT IS NOT AVAILABLE"? Because this is very funny to me right now.
Ikr, had to look up some art for this one.
Now that I think about it, Yumi really was exceptionally vivid.

!!!!!!!!!
Incredibly wholesome interaction, thank you for blessing my day with this.
A beautiful reunion
Reynalda
I assumed Renarines was a Space Marine Chapter
It's so hard! I think it makes me worse at observing things too. Like, because I can't keep a picture in my head of things I'm not actively looking at.
I promise that I'm not trying to offend you, but I'm having a very hard time understanding the point of reading fiction if you can't see things in your head. 

Like, I feel like that's the entire purpose of reading.
I love how this sub is more cautious with JJK spoilers than literally anything JJK related on social media
Real
😭😭😭
Bro is about to become a Knights Radiant.
I mean, the only way to harm sukuna was to strike at his soul, so...
It was the aliens in the crane machine from Toy Story. But this might be funnier
It was, and my absolute favorite Sanderson book because of it
Wait when did this turn into r/Mistborn?
Shadesmar is the almightys ballsack
I am a stick.
I am a stick.
I am a stick.
We are stick
Beautiful. I couldn’t stop watching.
Yup and until I saw it my brain used the exact descriptions of shadesmar for the first 3 books 😂

In my head it was basically all mostly flat obsidian landscapes with transparent glass shrubs and trees sparcely littered about. (Oathbringer forest confused me when I read it and had to adjust my image of shadesmar)

But now I can see it as a semi organic expression of the world we live in.
Ok but that looks something out of a a bad acid trip too. Not dissing the cover art! It's gorgeous... but hardly my go to pick to show some who is deeply struggling with picturing Shadesmar. The beads are barely visible and the sky is blue in the cover... which is not at all what's described

There's some fairly good fan art that does a better job in terms of giving good reference material to get a closer image to what is described
I'm not the only one! I thought that was just me (and my mom thought I was being dramatic lol). I'm pretty good at observing things in the moment, but if someone says "Oh hey did you see (specific thing)" then I'm like "I have never seen an object in my life" 😂😂
I think it shouldn't matter. If you do not have photographic memory people with Aphentasia are [similar](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34482017/) to normal people in terms of working memory. So seeing an image and describing what was in it after a few seconds. 

What they are much worse at is "picturing" life events. They could be [worse](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027722001809) at simulating past and future events.
I'm not the person you're replying to but I also have aphantasia and can't imagine more than a few lines in my head at a time, similar to stick figures. I still feel like I have an imagination though. And I still get enjoyment out of reading fiction. 

I describe it more as emotions or impressions, rather than images. I may not be able to imagine the characters faces or clothes, but I can imagine their voices and emotions. I can still empathize and relate. And with inanimate objects, I know the difference in cotton or silk and how they feel to touch. I can imagine how the clothes Bridge Four wore would feel different to a fine Havah even if I can't see it in my mind. Or the hardness of the stone on the shattered plains. I know what it feels like to walk on stone like that, and equate that feeling to what I'm reading.

It's also very hard to describe this to others who don't have aphantasia. When I told my partner, he almost got a little upset in trying to understand. He couldn't grasp how I could remember anything, like his face or my dog, if I can't see it in my mind.
Stories can still be interesting and fun without the imagined movie playing along beside it. 
You're fine! I actually really struggle with being able to read because of it. I just find these specific bools really fun to listen to and try to imagine (I also have dyslexia amd ADHD so I listen to the audio books). For some reason the audio books help me be able to "see" what's going on. I still have a hard time getting an image in my head but it does sem easier when it's being read to me vs trying to imagine it while all I'm seeing in front of me is letters. Hope this makes sense!

Editing to add: u/ThePixieTink has a really great reply that I definitely couldn't formulate into words myself lol. But it's pretty much exactly what happens to me, too.
It was all the agendas combined with the lobotomy. I was one of the folk, it was like shared madness as the chapters came out one after another after >!236!<. While I won't spoil it outside of that sub, I understand why others did.

If you aren't a fan of that one, you might like the [Bulgarian Concept Covers more](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rhythm_of_War/Covers)
Guess I've got to blame my subpar powers of observation on something else then, lol!
Same here. It’s like a small flashlight in the dark, or like ‘drawing’ with an led pen in the dark. The first thing fades away before you can get started drawing the next one. 

It doesn’t affect my reading. Or rather, it’s all I know. I picture individual characters or places but can’t picture a complex scene of them. Shadesmar is a sea of glass marbles and a bizarro sky, with bizarro natives. 

/r/aphantasia for any (literally) likeminded people who don’t know it.
This is such a good explanation! Thank you! I could never really put it into words, but this is perfectly described :)
I love a community that is tight lipped on its spoilers. One of my favorite games is over a decade old and still refers to the 7th party member you get as "Seven" because who it is is a spoiler.
Oooo thank you for showing these! And yes, I'm in agreement that the Bulgaria cover definitely does a better job it showing the alienish grey of Shadesmar and the sea of beads. Love that they even show the crystal trees. Sky is still a bit too colorful for what I always pictured tho

But changing the topic I love the Germany one. I assume that's supposed to be Thaylenah? That is awesome
Yes! A great way to describe it. I haven't thought of that analogy and it's so exact to what I can see.
I'm relieved to find more people like me!
Is that Killer 7? I never finished it, or played it more than 10 minutes (not because I didn't like it, but because I have ADHD and had too many games to play) but this is making me think of that lmao
Cool, it’s interesting to find that other can relate to the description. 🙌

It was only about a year ago that I realised that there a whole spectrum of ‘mental image’ abilities. I find it quite interesting, but I’ve seen a few posts from people feeling like they’re really missing out on something.
It's called Xenoblade Chronicles. Honest the fan base is usually pretty good about spoilers from the entire trilogy
Ah... Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
If Dalinar had WhatsApp (OC) 
Per popular request after Kaladin’s post yesteday, here’s Dalinar’s WhatsApp.
taravangian would probably send him memes on his dumb days
The Deleted User one is so good lmao
Great.

Now do Shallan. Or maybe Hoid. Yeah, Hoid would be *very* interesting
I like how he has texts from Kaladin and Adolin, but none from Renaldo.
Not Navani with the hand pics...
Sadeas: "Bitch"
this is the best one yet
And Renaldo is nowhere to be seen, just according to lore.
Dalinar bringing his phone to one of his scribes, who has to awkwardly explain Navani is sexting him
Where da Stormfather at? ‘You gotta see this vision’
Deleted user, fucking lol
Savage
Can you do Mistborn Era 1 characters? Want to show my wife.
Navani is the thirstiest and oldest women ever written, and I love her for it.
"Oh no, the glove fell off..."
Navani is such a tease
I am genuinely laughing at this, well done!
the last one is killing me 😭😭😭
Okay, Lift’s too would be pretty entertaining. 

Well… maybe it’d just be food stuff though..
Not eve being deleted 😭😭
More plz I love these 😅
Please, please keep making these
Of course he doesn't even text Renarin
I think the deleted user's should have been left unread, but otherwise I love this. Please do more.
Lets be real he’d send memes on his best days too.
I’m not sure who you’re talking about? My memory is cooked. A little bit hazy. 

Does anyone else smell smoke??
All it needs is an unread tag
Odium: “Fucking KILL YOURSELF”

Kelsier: “Fucking KILL YOURSELF”

Sigzil: “When are you coming back?”

Design: “I NEED massive cosine curves Hoid”
Shallan, Veil, and Radiant arguing
I don’t care who’s next, I just wish for these to keep being made eternally.
Hoid:  
\*text from obama\*: Hey, have you heard of this meme, hawk tuah? This girl's at...
Who?
-Unknown Number-

Hey Dad, have you seen Adoli...
Don’t do that. Dalinar loves his sons Adolin and Kala… um Raymond equally.
What a butchering of the Alethi language!
Right?! I genuinely giggled and blushed.
Oops
Can’t believe I missed Sadeas. That would’ve been great
Rolando*
Hey Dalinar can read now!
You can't do that Dalinar!
lmao evi
Sure I’ll do a mistborn one next. Who would you like to see?

UNITE THEM 👹
Vin: >!Did I just see you in the street?!<
Zellion: “Fucking KILL YOURSELF”

The 17th Shard: "Fucking KILL YOURSELF"
wait why would Kelsier write something like that? >!Ghostblood!< business? If yes, I still don't remember when >!the Ghostbloods!< clashed with Hoid/>!Cephandrius!<.
Shallan texting her own number
Shallan, Veil and Radiant having their own group chat would be gem
Remarlin
At this point Sadeas' last "bitch" text should be several years older than the rest, though.
What? Why did you type *shshshh*? Who are we talking about
Sazed would be hilarious, circa Book One would let you insert Kelsier. Circa book 2 would let you insert Elend and Tyndwile. Or focus on Marsh during Book One! That would be hilarious b/c you could see the characters talking shit about Kelsier to Marsh.
Kelsier or any of the crew would have so much potential interactions

Does Lirin just not care?
Literally just got past that scene in the surgeons room and it really seems like Lirin just does not get it. 

Even if you ignore the fact that he’s apparently okay with humanity being enslaved/exterminated by a malevolent god. He just doesn’t seem to get that Kaladin has been traumatized. 

Kaladin watched Tien die. 

If Lirin had seen that happen would be okay?
So I agree, Lirin just doesn't get it, but it's for completely different reasons. 


1) Lirin's a hardcore pacifist with a "violence begets violence" mindset. He view is that resistance only prolongs the suffering, and the better option is to keep your head down and avoid causing more pain for the group. He can't understand why people would want to make their lives harder when it's so unlikely to lead to change. 

2) Lirin knows pretty much nothing about Odium and how genocidal he is, his main experience is with the fused occupation where they acted pretty similar to the light eyes who were in charge. Think it might have been stated that they were more fair than the light eyes in some situations. In his experience, there's not a noticeable difference between the humans and singers being in charge.
Lirin is also traumatized by what happened. He thinks it’s his fault that he drew the ire of Rashone and caused Tien and Kal’s deaths. So now as a response he doesn’t stand up to the powerful but instead keeps his head down to work out of fear that his family will be taken from him again
Has anyone considered that lirin is also broken by Tien's death and Kaladin's no news for years.
I mean, both can be true. I think he is wrong but those two positions aren’t mutually exclusive
Lirin is also traumatized and is a human being who makes mistakes. mfs way too hard on a guy who just wants peace and makes mistakes imo
Lirin: My son is traumatized from war. I see how having to fight is breaking him. I gotta keep him away from the thing that broke him, he looks like he’s close to suicide. He’s given enough already and war has taken to much from him and our family 
The fandom: damn Lirin doesent care
I just want to add that the majority of my hate toward Lirin isn’t his actions towards/treatment of Kaladin - though I think they are callous and terrible - I can see how at least how he sees, pushing Kal away from war and fighting is a good thing. 

My issue with Lirin and why I despise him is bc he never once, ever, considers Hesina’s feelings after Kaladins return. He’s self-centered and egotistical, he pushes away their “returned from death” son bc *he* doesn’t like what Kaladins become. Shes lost just as much as Lirin, and even bore him another son, and he treats Hesina like a second thought. 

We don’t get much indication that they have a bad marriage, or at Lirin is, otherwise, a bad husband, but I can’t view him as a “morally grey charcter who sticks to his beliefs” when he downright ignores at best, or disregards at worse, Hesina’s feelings
People misunderstand Lirin he was already a hard-core pacifist in WoK but the events of that book proved to him that any resisting just hurts him and those close to him more, so he agrees that people should fight, just not anyone he knows or cares about
1) Lirin has *very* deep biases which are coloring his perception and limiting his awareness of things which don’t directly relate to those biases. Apple didn’t fall far from the tree (which I actually like; I think Brando did a good job on balancing the traits Kal shares with each of his parents).

2) as others have said, Lirin is dealing with a lot of the same trauma, as well as traumas of his own. And he’s, again, very similar to Kaladin, in that he’s a lot better at taking care of his patients than himself. So he’s stuffed a lot of his own hurt down deep, where it can’t interfere with his job—but also where he can’t access it in order to empathize with his son. 

3) they’re both stubborn as goats (or some analogous Rosharan thing), and not used to setting matters of disagreement aside for the purpose of peace. King Sad and Father Grouch are not used to compromising on their worldviews.
Lirin is also traumatized and broken in his own way
I don't think Lirin actually knows exactly what happened. He just knows Tien died and then Kaladin basically shut them out and then later presumed him dead too.

Lirin is a TOTAL pacifist. He believes there is NO reason to do harm. He knows Kal went through some shit, but he wants to help him by having him stop killing people and be a surgeon. Which to be fair is exactly what Kal needed. Lirin believes his son was MADE a monster by all this violence.

To make things worse, he blames himself for everything. Tien only died because he was drafted. He was only drafted because their local Lord took out petty revenge on them. He only did that because Lirin pushed back against him at every turn. If he'd just behaved and cowed tow Tien would never have died and Kal would be a world famous surgeon and never would have taken lives.

Kaladin KILLING someone in his surgery room just snapped something, Kal violated an ABSOLUTE and he just could not handle it. All this violence and war DID kill his son, and returned to them a monster. Kaladin isn't the only person traumatized. Remember. Lirin lost BOTH his children. In his mind, he lost one of them twice.

They both have a lot of issues, but that's part of the story. Working on healing.

Also Lirin doesn't even know who Odium is. All he knows is the Singers, and as far as he's concerned they're lighteyes, at worst. In some ways they're better than them. To him the occupation was just the same thing as Roshon taking over as their brightlord, and this time he wanted to behave and do things right, instead of spit in their faces and get his family hurt again.
Lirin is also traumatized by Tien's death. Lirin had to raise his sons while the Blackthorn set fire to the kingdom trying to keep everyone in line. In lirin's eyes there was nothing to be done to save Tien, Kaladin might as well have committed suicide by volunteering for the army. He has a very hard time seeing Kal's actions as heroic, since it keeps putting him in death's path.
I think you also have to consider that he just saw Kaladin kill someone right in front of him. We view the scene from Kaladin's POV, who in his mind was killing an enemy combattant and protecting his men. Kaladin is very much used to violence and we are accustomed to seeing him use it. What Lirin sees is his son attacking and killing someone, who  wasn't actively harming anybody, in cold blood.
Lirin just refused to acknowledge the time when Kal joined the army and everything that happened in between till his union with him at Urithiru. Lirin just treated Kal as the little kid that went to war and completely ignored his struggles and growth.
I think you are missing the fact that mental trauma is not a thing in Roshar. They literally just throw all the PTSD patient into a 'prison'/ arkham asylum.

The concept of treating mental illness/trauma is new to these ppl and Kalladin 'invented' support groups and treatments. He is literally the Inventor of Psychotherapy on Roshar.

Of course Lirin cant understand or even relate. Those concepts are unknown to him / he only understands them on the surface level.
Man, if a TV show gets made and we reach this scene, the internet discourse will be INSANE.
Could my father be just as traumatized by believing both his sons died in war and thinking himself proven right about violence?

No it's the author whose wrong.
I mean to be fair the way they treat mental health on Roshar is stick em in a small dark room and leave them there. Maybe Lirin just doesn't want that for Kal.
Lirin makes me more angry than even the tinkers did. How are you this stubbornly, deliberately blind to the world?
I think Lirin thinks Kaladin isn't feeling those emotions and that Kal is a monster because all he sees is just fighting as opposed to grieving. We as the reader knows Kaladin's journey but Lirin hasn't seen that. Lirin reunites with Kaladin in the middle of Kal's journey and from that point of view he sees war and fighting without the grief.  I think he finally sees that in RoWs final act.
It's like Rosharans have little to no understanding about psychology
Wasn't a point in the book that they didn't know how to deal with mental illnesses
Tbh I don’t think that they really have much understanding of mental illness entirely. I mean their solution for people with depression or any other issue was to lock them in a dark room for forever.
I wonder what the fandom’s take on the “Regal in the Surgery” scene would be if we’d been following Lirin and Hesina’s story instead of Kaladin and Syl?
I wonder if Lirin could swear the oaths of a windrunner as a pacifist
Could lirin be traumitized by years of watching gavilar's bloody unification wars, as a man who deeply wants to help and protect people?  


No, he's just a bitter old man who can't see killing is based
In a series about literally, magically empowering yourself to pick up the broken pieces of your life through the magic of friendship it really do be the parental gaslighting that hits home the most
Lirin is so god damn annoying, pacifist or not
This is pedantic as fuck, but Kal was only a slave for like a year and a half.
Kaladin did not watch Tien die, he simply found his shattered and broken corpse after the battle, knowing he had not been there to protect him. I would argue that's somewhat worse.
Storms yeah! Love me some Lirin slander.
Wasn't it like months?
Lirin sucks.  One of the worst characters in the series.
He's very frustrating. He's made up his mind that resisting is pointless, but as far as the story we see, he doesn't even do any resisting. The main thing leading to Kaladin and Tien being taken from him is Roshone's son dying on the table and Roshone blaming Lirin for it. He knew something would happen if he saved Roshone, and did it anyway. His non resistance directly resulted in his sons being taken. Even worse, I know if that mf could go back to that moment, knowing what would happen to his sons, he still wouldn't let Roshone die. That's how bitchmade he is.
I think the most frustrating thing is that Kal is the way he is because he tried to protect. Lirin refuses to acknowledge that Kal is doing his best to save the people he loves and refuses to accept any other point of view other than his own. Like maybe be a bit more understanding when your traumatized and potentially suicidal son reacts the way he was trained to react. How about we don’t ostracize a severely depressed dude who is barely an adult (isn’t he like 19 or 20). I know he’s traumatized and has a lot of guilt but don’t take out your frustration on your, again, severely traumatized and deeply depressed son who was literally enslaved and forced to do death runs. Sorry I got a little ranty at the end lol
Lirin is just an asshole.
Lirin is one of the VERY few not-so-well-written characters by Brando
Lirin is such an evil shithead. I was hoping Moash would kill him in RoW
"My son does not have depression! He just likes the dark!"

\- Lirin, probably
This is fun because some Indian freedom fighters hated Gandhi when, in the middle of a nation-wide non-violent protest, other freedom fighters firebombed a British police station and Gandhi called off the protest for it.

Lirin went full Gandhi. (civ version is a great bug but annoying)
Lirin also pretty obviously can see that war broke Kal. So at this point it would definitely be the most healthy for Kal to stay out of it.
Also Lirin has literally no concept of ‘trauma’ as a mental health thing. He even says that he just ships people off to the priests and assumes they do something about it, and that’s just for people with massive issues like brain injury or complete shell shock or whatever. His idea of medicine is physical only
Lirin doesn't know what a Hippocrates is but he still lives by it.
Lirin is super annoying, too bad he didn't pound sand instead of >!Teft!<, would have had the same effect for Kal but without the man tears I had to shed.

*I accept that there are characters I hate that will live, and characters I love that will die.*
So for 1., is that bc Lirin >!grew up as a skaa in the Final Empire before world hopping to Roshar!<
Ehh, he was a hardcore pacifist long before that. Like he was disappointed that Kal wanted to be a soldier when he was a kid
It is his fault he stole the spheres
I mean Lirin definitely has problems too but he does not accept Kal as he is and is not helping… like Kal has been through hell and is majorly depressed and Lirin refuses to truly listen to Kal and accept him for who he is
Then he should be more sympathetic towards his son who couldn't save his brother and then was forced to be a slave for years
I think we can all appreciate that he is trying to make peace and save lives, but he refuses to change his beliefs in any sort of way to the point that he is willing to ostracize his severely mentally ill son because he doesn’t agree with his methods. Dude needs to chill out and be more supportive to his potentially suicidal son
No no. I’m mad at him calling Kal a monster
Moash is just a dude who wants the pain to stop, you're way too hard on him. /s
Its not that he doesn't care, he does almost nothing to see the situation through Kal's point of view.
I think that Lirin does believe this way. He wants to protect kal. What the fandom hates is that he is a dick about it. Why pile on guilt and anger towards the son you’re trying to protect? Maybe show compassion and love while encouraging a change to chose to work as a surgeon.
> Lirin: My son is traumatized from war. I see how having to fight is breaking him. I gotta keep him away from the thing that broke him, he looks like he’s close to suicide. He’s given enough already and war has taken to much from him and our family. **Hey, maybe if I accuse him of being a monster and claim both my sons are dead that will help him feel better.**

>The fandom: damn Lirin doesent care

You left out some important details so I fixed it for you
I agree that Lirin was trying to help and cares but once kaladin disagrees his reaction is you are wrong and a monster
I’m currently just passed the part where he gets really mad about Kaladin killing a regal
I don’t think Lirin is morally grey. He’s a good man I think when it comes to his sense of moral but his stubbornness and narrow minded views have a bad impact on the people that love him. 

And yes, I honestly cannot believe how little he factors Hesina’s feelings into his thoughts. 

Granted Sanderson portrays Hesina a little detachedly.  I cannot understand why she’s not constantly doting on him.
Here here. They fight so much BECAUSE they are so similar
sorry lirin it only matters if youre the protaganist , apparently
OK, but calling him a monster though
I think it’s a little naive for Lirin to assume that an enemy soldier was just going to take his son’s friend and not harm him in any way.
Lirin didn't get to see the struggles and growth.
I can’t wait
Look he called Kal a monster which is pretty low behavior in my opinion.
The tinkers may be fools, but they are my kind of fools, because if everyone thought like them the world would be a better place.
I can see that. Using adhesion to reset bones, lashing to make it easier to move patients, shardblade to remove any blockages,  shard plate as a splint.
I mean there is other ways to protect, I would find it cool to see Lirin as windrunner medic.
Would be an interesting discourse for sure!
I can’t believe he’d call Kaladin a monster. Its just heart breaking
Lirin is to pacifism as PETA is to vegans.
That is storming pedantic
I only read way of kings back in April, but for some reason, I distinctly remember Tien seeing Kaladin on the battlefield and smiling before being cut down. Am I remembering things wrong?
Im actually not really mad at him for that. A doctor killing their patient is kind of deeply un likable
Yeah, turns out there's no 1 correct way to resist and passionate people are gonna be passionate.
> civ version is a great bug but annoying

In the interest of fighting misinformation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Gandhi note the first line:

> Nuclear Gandhi is a video game hoax

It's a fun story, and the concept of an ~~underflow~~ negative overflow exists so this is a useful idea to describe it, but there's very little practical way for the Nuclear Gandhi bug to exist as imagined. (at least pre Civ 5; at that point they started leaning into the rumor on purpose)
No he didn't. He's not resisting. He's acquiescing.
THESE WORDS ARE ACCEPTED
Think you got the redactions wrong, but I'm pretty sure Lirin isn't a world hopper. Either way, Era 1 is a few hundred years before Stormlight
this sub really needs more crack posting like this
Source: my ass
I mean… it was a good advice though. Imagine getting into Sadeas army and just die on Shattered Plains. And that’s assuming you get through Alethkar recruitment process of infighting for no reason. I too would try to convince my kid to be doctor instead if I lived in that country
No one is ever responsible for the actions of another person. Lirin is responsible for taking the spheres. He is not responsible for what Roshone chose to do to his sons.
I think that it is critically important to understand where Lirin's responsibility is, because I don't think that it's black and white at all.

And part of the problem is that their mores are _very_ different from those that we tend to follow.

One of the bigger concepts that took a very long time to take root is the idea that only the person who actually did a misdeed should be punished for that misdeed.

We do not support the _idea_ of collective punishment.  It's one thing to punish the person who stole something, it's something else entirely to punish that person's children.

On a very similar vein, we tend to believe in, or at least claim to believe in, proportional responses to misdeeds.

To make things worse, what _followed_ was directly against the mores and ideals of their culture as well.

As it stands, he was undeniably wrong to steal the spheres, but at the same time, blaming him for the death of one son and the supposed death of another is most decidedly uncalled for.

Now, there _are_ ways in which he would be more culpable for those things.  If he had thrown his sons under the bus for his own actions, _that_ would have been significantly different.

But as it stands?  Both Kal and Lirin are broken, but not only are they broken in different ways, Kal's broken largely hurts _himself_, while Lirin's broken hurts Kal.

But even though that does make us judge Lirin more harshly, that doesn't change how much of what happened due to the theft is Lirin's fault.

And if you want to extend his responsibility out from that, then Lirin's theft is responsible for the refounding of the Wind Runners.  Which, well, is ridiculous.
There is a huge difference between not listening and disagreeing. Lirin listens to his son but he does not agree with his methods. There is no miscommunication, only conflict.
Yeah but, of all the other bad things main characters have done because of their flaws, Lirin is one of the ones that get the most slack because of it. He's not perfect, not all of his actions are perfect, but no one else's are
He came around a little by the end of RoW, even if he does still disagree with Kal. It was the heat of the moment. Lirin has sworn an Oath, just as sacred as any Radiant’s to him but without the magic fairy. His beliefs are to him what the ideals are to Kaladin. I could not ask him to abandon those any more than I would ask a Radiant. 

Dude does need to chill out and be a better father. But he is trying imo, whether that is enough or not.
Damn, it's almost as if Kaladin killed a man right in front of him almost unprovoked (Teft would have been fine in the moment) and tensions were through the roof to begin with. Sorry he didn't respond in the most rational manner after witnessing a man be violently killed for the first time in his life.
I mean me too. That was absolutely not okay to do. But he is a human being who makes mistakes. Everybody sometimes hurts the ones they love. That’s life.
Do you not see the irony in asking "why does he not care if Kal is traumatized" while you simultaneously are not caring that Lirin is traumatized?
Fuck Moash
Double fuck Moash
>!They do reconcile at the end of the book!< People seem to forget that
Peak Dad
That's just Dad's
>Maybe show compassion and love while encouraging a change to chose to work as a surgeon.

What's he gonna do next? Cover his safehand and start reading? 

(/s, if it wasn't obvious )
People also tend to forget that Lirin too happens to be human and definetly traumatized
To be fair I think a major theme in Stormlight is that there is very little “black and white” in the world. Dalinar, Sadeus, Singers, Radiants, Humans as a whole, Adolin, Jasnah, storms even Lirin steals from the brightlord and Kaladin almost breaks his oaths. It really stresses the idea that everyone thinks they are the good guys - even on both sides of a conflict.
Yeah, we don't really get enough interactions between him and Hesina to get a clear view of their relationship
When you reject your own child and call them a monster your own trauma doesn't matter.
I'm not saying he was right. He was just having his own meltdown, after seeing Kal kill in the clinic with a surgeon's tool
People say stuff they don't mean or they wouldn't have normally said all the time, especially in highly traumatic or emotional times
I mean that's what happened right? Technically Teft would be alive if Kaladin had just let him go be among the other radiants
Shard-shunt, Shard-probe, Shard-Enema syringe
Yes you're right. He may not have been right there but he was close enough to see Tien smile and to see that it was a light eyed horseman who killed the three boys.
No you are right I was remembering wrong just flipped through my copy of the way of kings, it's in chapter 67, Words.
I know this not the place. But Gandhi never did jack shit but present a nice front for the moderate liberals in Britain to feel nice and bad about, MLK style. Pinning all the success on him is very purposefully and pointedly taking the spotlight away from anyone who actually fought for indrpendence
My favorite part of that article is the lengths everyone went through to find out if the bug exists without just playing the game.
Iirc, he tended to advance up the tech tree pretty quickly so he often was one of the first civs to get nukes which is what led to this misconception, combined with the fact that Ai in those games tend to be pretty Gung ho about using nukes if the other civ doesn't have them
As long as we're fighting misinformation here, that's not what underflow is. It's still considered integer overflow, even when it occurs in a negative direction.

Underflow occurs in floating point math, when a number becomes so small (approaching but not equal to zero) that it can't be represented in floating point format.
Huh strange
He did resist. Just not violently. He has repeatedly done things that the people I power didn't like. He harbors anyone that the Lighteyes or the Fused want to hurt, no matter if he agrees with those people or not, he keeps them hidden to prevent further harm. He repeatedly speaks against direct orders from whoever is in charge to tell them when they are wrong or leverages what little bargaining power he has to protect everyone that he can.

He is resisting. Just not as much as you would like.
RAFO.  Also, world hoppers.live a long time.
And when we see a certain someone chasing another world hopper around the purelake in TWoK, that definitely means nobody from era 1 Scadrial could show up in contemporary Roshar.  Oh wait...
Thanks, not sure why I got so many down votes.  This is r/cremposting after all.
Nope.  Not yours.  Mine.  I ain't touching that
What a wild take. This basically absolves everyone from any responsibility, ever.
o so you think their is no consequences to stealing? youre in lala land
I mean fair it’s not like he’s burned down any cities 👀
He’s like Dalinar that way. They are both broken and both self-righteous.
Cares more about a dead demon soldier than his son
WELL HE HURT ME
He called his son a monster
I get that, I'm talking about him up until that point though. Like he does start to change eventually, but it also took him a loooooong time to get there
Somehow I never got the memo that emotions are a feminine thing in Vorinism. That is to say, I get the sarcastic point you are trying to make, but I don't think it applies here.
Of course he’s human. 

Only a human being could make me this irritated
Im glad you said very little cause Odium is def evil lol
mfw I dont take watching a man be killed in front of me well
I mean maybe but if he’d let teft go an awful lot would’ve changed
The point is his demonstrations were pacifist. Which is why hes talked about. 

Nobody cares about the names of suicide bombers, or bombers during freedom fights, because theyre a dime a dozen and only remembered by their organization and their families. 

Almost like India isnt unique in its response/ actions or something. Humanity is simplistic.
Certainly not the first time I got a mnemonic wrong because I only half paid attention. I didn't get to the floating point definitions in my CS courses before I left, so TIL.
It'd be interesting to see Lirin and Jasnah interact. She's one of the few characters that relies on logic more than him
I'm all caught up, is this confirmed somewhere?
...forgot about him
What could you possibly mean? I specifically said that Lirin is responsible for taking the spheres.
Who said that? Thieves are responsible for their actions. However, the people who punish thieves are also responsible for their own actions.

Imagine a judge who is presiding over a first-time offender who stole food because they were starving. The judge decides to set the thief free. Is the thief responsible for their own freedom? No. The judge is. The judge decided. If the judge decides to levy the death penalty in the same scenario, is the thief responsible for the fact that they died? No. The judge decided, and the executioner carried out the action. The thief is responsible for stealing. They are not responsible for the choice of others in response.

I never said that punishments shouldn't be levied, only that the judge is responsible for their own decisions. The accused is not accountable for the choices that the judge makes.
Lirin has been honest about his visceral dislike of violence from the word go. He tried to handle the situation in a manner that didn't escalate tensions and with the death of the soldier (which I'll point out is not a Fused, so we can drag the fact that it's a slave revolt in if we want to) occurring right in his clinic, Kaladin endanger all of them including Oroden. The fact that they were in the care of Leshwi and Venli was an amazing stroke of luck.

For the books Lirin has turned as much of a blind eye as much as he could stomach. He may have openly disagreed with Kaladin's decision to be a soldier, but they were still pretty fucking cordial for the year between OB and RoW.

Kaladin's mental health excuses every fuck up he may have ~~(like locking up as Elhokar was killed)~~, but Lirin can't get any because he said a mean word :(. I love Kaladin to death but Lirin isn't anywhere close to being the person people think he is. The situation in question was fucked up all around, but he is not the bad guy in it.
Me too😔
I am sensing something personal here. Am I in error?
Idk, Venli had me pretty irritated too lol.
Moash is an Awakened pile of shit and he is worse so your theory is flawed.
Yeah but is Todium pure evil? Odium is Divine hatred so it’ll likely always manifest as evil, but with a highly emotional Vessel, is he *just bad* or are there more layers to it. I mean I could go on listing examples of people we are ment to view as morally grey. I think short of Odium, specifically the Shard, the entire story stresses a grey morality
I know my boy. I’m not disagreeing with anyone, or making any point of Sanderson or abt global politics as a whole. I saw Gandhi, and I apologize but I had to elaborate - as clockwork as misspelling their and theyre to a Redditor
Bhagat Singh is very well known still and we remember all our freedom fighters whether they fought with violence or nonviolence to free India.
India itself absolutely remembers more freedom fighters than just Ghandi.
You didn't miss much, if I'm being honest. That's my only real tidbit about floating point numbers. Super interesting how it happens (the exponent bits overflow if your decimal gets too long), but very little practical use for that knowledge, unless you're in academia or something.
I don’t think Lirin is particularly logical and Jasnah would’ve looked for a way to murder all the fused in the tower
More like a buddy cop adventure where Lirin and Kelsier team up. Non violent resistance meets hyperviolent resistance.
Yes, from that WoB from when b$ was cornered in the bathroom of a KFC in Nebraska.

No they're pulling it straight out of their ass
The source is that he made it the fuck up.
Nope, but it isn't confirmed not to be true anywhere, so all we can do is read and find out.
He took the spheres, yes. This was the catalyzing action that began the sequence of events that led to his son's death. No, he's not *directly* responsible for Tien's death. He does, however, bear some responsibility for it.

If I smack Amaram across his smug face, and then he sends me off to join Sadeas' bridge crews, am I blameless for this result?
Do you even remember what you wrote? I said lirin is responsible bc he stole. You said no one is ever responsible for what other people do to them. You are absolving him of responsibility. He should have used better foresight.
Sorry I must’ve misunderstood you but did you really just equivocate a father calling his son a murderous monster to “a mean word”
Yes I have a good relationship with my dad and if he called me a monster it would destroy me
Just had to stop and say I love your profile picture.
And yet, I would legit have to Google that name.
Well sure, but how many of the Irish freedom fighters does India know? 

At the end of the day no matter what people have to conform to something. Who's something and how it's done is just a matter of perspective in terms of whether or not it's appropriate or built on bloodshed, but perspective over time means you can start to forget the bloodshed. More immediate changes have more bloodshed. 

But people like Lirin have always existed. Technology changes, but the reasons for war, the results of war, and the opinions on it remain the same.
Ehh, we see most of his worldviews are based off of logic when he and Kal are arguing about violence being necessary in RoW. 

>and Jasnah would’ve looked for a way to murder all the fused in the tower

Exactly, she'd completely disagree with him and likely be able to back it up
Apparently there's a theory he is based on one thing he said... But that's one hell of a long shot
This is the same nonsense that abusers use against the abused. "You made me hit you." No. I made you angry. You hitting me was *entirely* your fault. You could have done something else, and I am not to blame for your violence.

If you smack Amaram, you are responsible for smacking Amaram. If he chooses to penalize you, then he is responsible for your penalty. This is why penalties should have rational reasons behind them. They must accomplish something good. Penalties levied merely for retribution are pointless.

You are merely hiding behind the facade of the punishment seeming reasonable. Try making the punishment disproportionate to the event that caused it, and you'll probably agree with me. For example, if I walk into a store during normal business hours and someone there decides to shoot me for that reason, is it my fault that I got shot? I walked into the store, right? So, according to your premise, the shooter is not to blame. I am. I walked into the store.

Under my premise, I am only responsible for having walked into a store with the intent to buy a snack. I do not deserve to get shot for that. The shooter is responsible for the shooting.

People who levy punishments are responsible for the punishments that they levy. If they wield that agency responsibly, then there is no problem. However, it does not take away their agency and assign their actions to the accused.
The post that I replied to said that Lirin is responsible for what happened to his sons. He is not. Roshone is.

Lirin is solely responsible for his theft.
Yes.
That's propaganda's doing.
Americans seem to want to misunderstand their own civil rights heroes. It makes sense that only those who don’t threaten the establishment are promoted.

I’m sure you know started the American civil war, but I don’t. That’s part of American history but not Indian history.
I'm actually not against the idea that Lirin might be a worldhopper. He's so different from the other Alethi I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't Rosharan. I am however, against touting unconfirmed theories as fact.
I think your arguments need tightening up. You smack someone, there's a reasonable expectation something else will happen- you get hit back, or someone arrests you. Is it the police officer's fault you got arrested? The judge's that you do community service? Sure, the person smacking you back is making that choice but you aren't completely blameless in the effect your actions have on those you do them to

Walking into a store and getting shot is a completely different thing- that is not a reasonably expected consequence
There's a difference between who's 'fault' or guilt it is and blame for foreseeable consequences.

It's the unlocked car problem. Obviously, stealing is wrong. It's the moral fault of the thief and and the consequential fault of the person who didn't lock their car.

In the instance of you and the store, you don't bear consequential fault because you couldn't foresee it.

Now, if the store has gunshots coming from it and you heard then and chose to go in anyway, then it's consequentially your fault.

If you get attacked by a bear when hiking and don't bring an bearspray or defend yourself properly, it's morally not your fault. It's your consequential fault.
Wow. I'm not reading that.

Edit: A lot of air sick lowlanders here that didn't read it either but assume it was a good argument, I see. Very good crem.
Well alrighty then
No, it's really not. 

I live in the States, and I don't know the names of a single one of our bombers including the Unabomber. 

I also don't know the names of any of the Irish bombers for the ira. 

I served in Afghanistan and was in the military for 6 years and I don't know nor do I care to know the names of any of the suicide bombers who fought against the forces I was with. 

It's not propaganda it's perspective.

Edit: Martyrdom though IS done FOR propaganda. Per the definition of propaganda.

Edit 2: some people idolize war heroes with massive body counts of kills, others idolize war heroes who refuse to touch a weapon and only administered medical aid. Yet others will idolize people who have never touched a battlefield or been involved with war but instead have created some kind of innovation. 

Who you idolize is who you remember.

Edit 3: And by that I mean if you perceive someone as being an example of a particular cause or group, then you are idolizing them in regard to that group. You're turning them into some kind of figurehead some symbol of meaning, whether or not you actually agree with the meaning or were victimized by their actions.
Believe it or not America started the American civil war
Who started it? No i dont know because i dont care. What it was about matters more than the people. 

Just like I think statues are pointless since they inspire like... 1/10k people. Thats a waste of money and space.
I used an unreasonable consequence to demonstrate my thought process. Yes, it is the police officer's fault that he/she arrested me. That is a decision that he/she made. The same goes for the judge. The judge decided to levy a penalty and then chose the penalty. Those decisions are their fault.

I am only to blame for smacking someone. I am not to blame for the actions of others.

Allow me to try a different analogy. There is a man who owns a gun shop. A customer comes in and says sincerely that she wants to buy a gun to go deer hunting. The owner checks, and she has no criminal record. He sells her a gun. She uses it to murder someone. I think we both agree that the store owner did nothing wrong.

However, what if we flip the statement and the result? The woman comes in and says sincerely that she wants to buy a gun in order to murder someone. The store owner checks and finds out that she has no criminal record. He sells her the gun. She uses it to go hunting and never harms anyone. I think we both agree that the store owner did something wrong.

If the woman comes to buy the gun for hunting, goes hunting, and then uses the deer to feed the homeless, is the gun owner also morally responsible for the homeless being fed? I don't think that he is.

I think that the woman is entirely responsible for her own actions and the man, his. The man is responsible only for the sale of the gun. He is not responsible for what the woman does with it. If he sells the gun knowing that she intends to hurt innocent people, then he has done wrong, even if she never follows through on her intent. He is not to blame for her actions. Only his own.
I would argue that the concept of "consequential fault" as you have described is often arbitrary. It is trivial to show that you can arrive at wildly different answers to the same scenario.

Why did the thief steal my car? Because I owned a car. Therefore, I should not have owned a car.

Why did the thief steal my car? Because he learned how to hotwire a car on YouTube. Therefore, YouTube is responsible.

Why did the thief steal my car? Because the neighbor wasn't watching. Therefore, it's my neighbor's fault.

I also believe that you arbitrarily stopped at the first question. There is no logical reason that you must stop there. We could just keep asking "why" and getting different answers in an endless rabbit hole that leads to the origin of the universe.

However, humans tend to stop on anything that is actionable in the future, which can be helpful. What is far less helpful is then assigning blame to the past. It is not my fault that the thief stole my car. Even if I left my car unlocked. I should consider taking the action of locking my car in the future, but realistically, I might just wind up with a missing car and some glass fragments after the thief broke my window. Or the thief might have learned how to pick or bypass my car lock so locking would have been useless anyway. Or any number of other things could have occurred.

People should protect themselves from likely events in ways that are reasonable and effective. Protecting yourself from unlikely events in ways that are unreasonable or ineffective is often just security theater, like signing your bill at a restaurant. The best thing is to perform a risk assessment while weighing the likelihood, the probable damage, and the cost/effectiveness of the attempted prevention. To be perfectly honest, most people could spend their lives having never locked their car once and still not see any significant loss.

It's absolutely fine if you don't want to read my reply. I have no misconception that me writing something means that other people must read it.

However... you are on a subreddit based on the Cosmere. The people here are *far* more likely to be willing to read a long post like mine than the average person. Your assumption that other people didn't read the post, and further, that the post isn't worthy of the reactions that it has garnered is frankly ridiculous. Very good crem! Keep up the good work!
But should you not protect yourself from reasonable events against others committing immoral actions?

Do you have responsibility to protect your interests? 

And if you fail on that responsibility, is it rational to feel guilty?

Kaladin's father knowingly took a huge risk by stealing. He thought he would be punished alone if caught but the consequences were more dire than he predicted. He knows that lighteyes are incredibly punishing to darkeyes, yet took that risk.

So thus, he feels it's his fault because he was actively calculating those events and risks instead of believing "it's all Roshones fault".
I have ADHD and can ramble a lot, especially when I care about something. So I see and hear responses like that all the time. "Too long, won't read" is unfortunately common.

However, I can understand where they are coming from. Sometimes, people just aren't in the mood to engage with something, and that's okay. If the thing that they don't want to engage with is something that I care about... that's unfortunate, but I try not to make a big deal out of it.
Wild that all of you are fans of SLA and yet think personal responsibility is a myth.
> The people here are far more likely to be willing to read a long post like mine than the average person.

We like to read long books written by a well established and trusted author. The two are not the same.
I thought I could handle the wiki.  I could not 
The guy who tossed Wax a medallion was Wit?  Oh god I’m still in the shallow end, aren’t I?
All you need to know is that his investiture is stored in the balls.
Hoid's just this guy, ya know?
So is Hoid the *real* main character of the Cosmere? In an odd,  side-character story of way?
Always another secret
only 6 mistborn books? those are rookie numbers you gotta get those numbers up.

(but in all seriousness there are 3 in era 1, 4 in era 2. and secret history runs parallel to era 1. there is also alomancer jak as a short story but I dont really count that one)
Can’t wait for the hoid book that explains everything and puts all the books in a timeline and just ties up the whole thing super neatly.
hoid is somehow everywhere important, collecting all the abilities  
its like he died and got sent back in time for a second chance like a manwha
He was also in the first Mistborn books *and* in Warbreaker.
Me years ago after reading Era 1, Elantris, Warbreaker, and Way of Kings:

Surely if I carefully use the Coppermind just for information on characters and events I already know, I won’t get spoiled.

*looks up Nightblood*
You are here to strongly young bull.
I've read the entire cosmere (minus wobs) and I still barely understand Hoid. All I do know is that originally he was going to be much greater than he is now
But then where does he store his pee?
No wonder jasnah is in a relationship with him
Of all the Cosmerians, Hoid is the hoopiest frood.

A guy who always knows where his towel is.
Hey, you sass that ~~Ford Prefect~~ Hoid? Now *there's* a hoopy frood - he always knows where his towel is.\


No, seriously, Hoid will fit into Hitchhiker's perfectly. 
Hoid is probably the most influential character of the Cosmere but he's not really the main character. He's playing a game that we only very barely understand, he's also collecting forms of investiture like Pokemon.
Hoid is not a self-insert of B$, but he also kinda is. Hoid is based on Sanderson's first D&D character.

In terms of the story, Hoid has access to Fortune, which let's him know where he is needed. Not what he's needed for, or why, just location. Which allows Hoid to be a bit of a codified Deus Ex Machina. Allowing B$ to do cool things like yeeting Wax off a boat and allowing him not to drown.
Yes. He's eventually getting his own prequel trilogy, and he's supposed to be a main character in the final Mistborn trilogy. Which means the cosmere both begins and ends with Hoid, and he'll likely have more lines than any other character in the end.
He will be the main character of a Mistborn Era, but for now he's just a really interesting side character.
I believe, he's the (in universe) author of all the books actually. But that's just a theory so far
There's also the short story about Kelsier's training, The Eleventh Metal.
Dragonsteel, it's called Dragonsteel
I’m not sure how effective a timeline would be given that the settings are taking place in different star systems, potentially in different arms, or possibly on opposing edges of the Cosmere’s galaxy from one another.
wait where i forgor
He’s also in Elantris
Thanks to the Dawnshard he no longer has to pee
His what?
Spiritual Realm.
She’s Ace. Their relationship is more intellectual (mostly).
This is the second Hitchhiker’s reference I’ve seen today.  Must be a good day.
Yeah but like Red, not like Ash...
Nah, most influential character is Rayse
Like a cosmere-scale Axies
He’s an arcanist whose current goal is to ensure Odium doesn’t destroy everything
Is that from the words of sando?
Hoid was Sandi’s DMPC when he was DMing early on. Which makes sense cause Hoid sure does work that way! Lol
Na they are all fairly close
In mistborn vin talks to him as an informant during the siege of the last cache city
I just read warbreaker but i dont recall hoid being in it tbh
Each Dawnshard relates to a specific Command that is fundamental to the cosmere.

Hoid held the Dawnshard of Peen't
His sphere pouch
She says Hoid likes to fuck and that she is willing to indulge him despite not liking it
ie actually collecting lol (ash has had like what? 10 Pokemon actually caught?)
Maybe. We're still not sure how involved in the Shattering Hoid was, or what exactly he did during the post-Shattering years before the events of White Sand. At the very least, he carried a Dawnshard, founded the Worldbringers and Worldsingers, and collected a number of valuable items, pieces of information, and forms of investiture

As far as modern cosmere goes, you're probably right about Rayse, with Bavadin close behind. There's actually a case to be made for Kelsier as the most influential mortal in the Cosmere currently; same as with Hoid it's hard to tell exactly how much he's done with the Ghostbloods to date
My man T is gonna go for the high score though.
Most influential character is Stick. Nothing anybody says will convince me otherwise. 
he never said that Hoid is a self-insert, but the rest is true, He was born as a D&D character from him, and he first made him as a character that he imagined was in all the books he read, imagined how would that play out, etc

edit: I am almost certain that there´s a WOB about that, but i dont have the link rn
He is the guy Lightsong summons to tell Siri about the history of the Godkings
She doesn't actually talk to him in Fadrex. She was going to meet him and then got an uneasy feeling when she saw him. He does talk to Kelsier in Book 1 in the same disguise.
my bad i remembered the mistborn one but, thought the comment was referring to the first book (final empire), i dont remember warbreaker too but i havent read it in a while and dont really remember it
I just checked and hilariously, out of "em-all" he has only caught 85, and has owned at verios points only 105
I feel like Kelsier can’t just match THOUSANDS of years of life tbh
How stick-like of you.
Not sure about the D&D part, but the idea of Hoid coming before any other part of the cosmere as an imagined character across all stories is in Arcanum Unbounded.
I don't read those because I like trying to use the context of the cosmere to figure out what is going on.   I remember Brando talking about imagining being a background character in different books and what that would be like in an introduction or post script or something.  I used to (still) do the same thing when I read the wheel of time.
He's in Final Empire as well, he supplies Kel with weapons
He's the dude playing cards playing with dust
…yet.
IIRC he wasn’t Brandon’s PC, but an NPC who made fun of the PCs when he was DM.
See you in a 2000 years then
Maybe he‘ll be the protagonist in the last books, we‘ll see

Meowwwwwww… Lies
Why would it be nsfw?
Does this mean Gavilstar will come back to life? Or was he not recognised by sprenclan?

OMG, the crossover! 😵‍💫
r/dalinargetthefire
His take on it is basically "yeah this could 100% happen if Kaladin wasn't a prude" and tbh I love that
His take on it was that it wasn’t possible because Kal doesn’t swing that way
Exposed Safepaw
No, no. Szeth-kit-kit-Meowlano killed him all 9 times in the prologue.
The Oathblade of Omens. It grants Storms beyond Storms.
Now I can imagine warriors covered in Shardpelt fighting each other with Shardclaws under a moonlit sky…
Saying prudishness is the issue also implies that sexuality is not the issue, since that would be a bigger initial barrier.
So he did not deny that Adolin swings that way?
No he said it was because of prudishness. He didn’t say sexuality was an issue.
Ah. That would be nsfv then
Kalastorm killed Szeth-kit-kit-Meowlano, so therefore in book 5 he’ll become kalastar and face off against his greatest enemy Traumastar after travelling around world. It all makes sense now!
I kinda want this fanart/fanfic now… 🫠

I just finished Era 2 of Mistborn. Loved it. However, I am confused by all the stick references in the Stormlight fandom.
I just started The Way of Kings, hopefully I'll understand it soon? ....Go sticks!....?
I am stick.
What are you talking about? Did you seriously miss the part in The Final Empire where Kelsier spanks Sazed repeatedly with a stick for being a naughty little Terrisman? You gotta go re-read it then, that was the best part.
Roshar peasants don't even have trains yet, fuck them.
Rafo
Oh my sweet summer child.

It's good you finished Era 2 before SA, though. Pay attention to the little details in character descriptions, you may be shocked by what you notice 😜
If I'm not mistaken the stick doesn't even appear in the interlude now. Basically, in Stormlight we have part 1 through 5 in the book, and between every part we have interludes of secondary characters living through the current events in the world. One of these interludes in words of radiance was planned to be about a stick thinking "I am a stick" repeatedly until it thinks "Am I fire?" And then just goes back to "I am a stick". It was removed in the final version but it's available to read in the dragonsteel website.
I want to say this meme is fire, but...
You’ll get it eventually. There was an April fools passage that released that everyone is referencing. But it’s also featured in the actual books for a scene that you will come across eventually.

More than that, RAFO!
Unfortunately, to comprehend the true majesty of the Stick, you'll need to wait until Words of Radiance
I’m a stick!

![gif](giphy|3o6fIY80HLB2vOGibu)
I am a stick.
Yes, if you keep reading SA, you will understand the stick references. Whether you ultimately enjoy the references yourself or find them annoying comes down to personal preference.

"I am a stick" "But you could be fire" is to SA kind of like what "It's a trap!" is to Star Wars
"Who needs rustin' magic when you've got a gun?" \*Shoots stick\*
Props for the HIMYM meme.
Lol yes.
It appears early in Words of Radiance, have fun reading
Yes
Just know that a particular stick is the most willful being in the Cosmere.
Gonna make one about how you don’t know what crem is next?
It's the least funny, most over used meme this sub has. So you're not missing much.
Don't worry. There isn't much to understand about the stick references.
Crem is a rosharan thing you pleb
But you could be fire
Tbh that’s the only part I remember
I believe, Lord Kelsier, that this is not entirely appropriate. Discipline and verbal reprimand are historically effective to enact change, however. There are stories of religions built entirely upon this foundation. You may like to hear of them, I think.

I've already picked up on a description of the ghostblood symbol on the people who Shalon's father knew.

I'm listening to the audiobook, and anytime the male narrator makes the women have a remotely husky voice I assume that it is Me Laan.
Brandon released it as a "preview chapter" on april fools day.  Afaik he never intended it to actually end up in the book.
https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/words-of-radiance-deleted-interlude-stick

It never thinks "Am I fire" and it was never planned for the book (just April fools shenanigans) however there is a single existential "I am a stick?" moment
This is good crem
Huh.
I thought it's from the start of WoR where shaken
Shallan tries soulcasring a stick into fire and it insists on "I am stick"

Eh, I wouldn't call it an airship even. It's literally hauled into the air by chulls, with fabrials to redirect the direction they're pulling.  Basically, it flies the exact same way a little kid playing with a toy airplane does.
They sure do heist a train in that one.

Damn, I just realized that "finishing Era 2 before starting Stormlight Archive" now means having read *The Lost Metal* before having read any Stormlight books. Your reading experience is going to be very different than what mine was.
Nice!

“Ten mugs go into the dishwasher”
…he whispered, “and nine shatter. Did that washing cycle forge the one that remained? No, Amaram. All the washer did was identify the mug that would not break.
I'm crying this is so good

Also as a PSA for those who are finding out from this post: Do not wash, handwash, or drink from your mug. Dragonsteel has been sending out recall/refund emails about them.
I chuckled, take my upboat.
Nine mugs out of ten... shattered like plains? You should consider changing the dishwasher. Or fighting it to fulfill the Vengeance Pact.
“Ten socks go into the washing machine. But only nine came out. What happened to the other sock? Nobody knows. It disappeared.”
Be funny if there’s reports of all the mugs breaking and pealing etc except the stoneward mug which doesn’t break ever 😂

That's hilarious but fuck you
This is the best Crempost I've seen yet. Kudos!
Can I add my name to the group of people wanting to buy a set of the bad mugs for cheap? I just wanna put them on a shelf.

Thank you!
All my sadness went into this crem and I forgot to put context
Do not wash, drink, hand wash, eat, consume, acquire investiture, or make a nice cup of tea.
Eh, put a sticker on the bottom reminding yourself never to use it for food and just use it as a pencil cup
No one is going to toss them. They’ll be rare, and people will sell these deadly killer mugs on ebay
Bridge 4?
Sadly I have a stoneward mug and while I haven't put it through the dishwasher my cursory inspection makes me think it would fail that test...
Considering they’re foiled, if you did machine wash them, they would lose their metallic parts
I am not :D
It’s got metallic foil, it was never going to be dishwasher safe
Sure, they’re decorative, but one of them needs to be washed daily. Otherwise it ends up being the filthiest thing on your shelf.

What else would you expect from a Dustbringer?
No, Dragonsteel literally just sent out a recall notice; the mugs are not safe to use
Your pain, Dranalore. Give this crem your pain.
For some reason, this comment is what tipped me over the edge. Crem-gold mate
Yeah if it were me I'd just keep it on a shelf and not use it. Maybe with a little do not use placard to warn off guests.
Storms, man! True. This one would just be constantly full of dust... if it gathers the dust in the entire room and concentrates it in the mug then they are underselling it, it's clearly a fabrial. Come to think of it if you have to filter the crem out of the other mugs before you can drink from them, that is lore accurate too
Ope, missed that memo lol
I still want a set for display purposes
I mean that’s what I did with my Tress cup. I wouldnt have used those for drinking at all. The stuff I buy from the store is always for display or to be worn. I enjoy the quality of the merch so much
The Birth of Jasnah Kholin
What am I doing with my life…
I find it odd I've seen a lot of jasnah simps but never navani simps
[The Queen Never Cry Origin](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/queen-never-cry)
Legend has it that she denounced the existence of the almighty just three days later.
That sounds more like Gavilar. Navani worked hard and went through labor, then Gavilar just walks in from another room “Storm it, a girl?” Leans down to Jasnah while Navani is recovering “You look are only good to marry off”

Jasnah “well it seems there is no God”

This will be the first Jasnah Flashback in Stormlight 10
This is good crem, gancho! You now have [7 choutas](https://www.reddit.com/r/cremposting/comments/1gyuv5v/chouta_standings/) for your efforts!
Navani:  I never said that 

Jasnah:  It’s called a metaphor
Beautiful

jasnah locked in and hasn't locked out for the rest of her days
i hate this stupid meme but unfortunately this one got me
Navani would never say that to her daughter
Who put eye liner and lipstick on that newborn?

THIS IS TAKING ME OUTTTT HAHAHAHHAHA
Is this a reference to Parasyte? There's a literal scene like this, if so great.

So called Milf lover when an actual milf shows up.
If Navani Kholin has a million simps, then I am one of them. If Navani Kholin has ten simps, then I am one of them. If Navani Kholin has only one simp, then that is me. If Navani Kholin has no simps, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Navani Kholin, then I am against the world.
I think we get shaded by Dalinar's stormwagon's droolers
Appreciators of strong, intelligent, older women simp differently. A lot of the time because they're busy simping for the woman they already have in their life.
Between Raboniel and Dalinar, they fear what her *canon* simps might do
I like Navani a lot more than Jasnah. Her PoV about Dalinar are really sweet, and it's nice to see how much she enjoys fabrial research.

It's probably just because I'm sleepy right now, but... I really can't think of how to describe Jasnah's personality. Has she had a PoV where we can see what's going on in her mind? The only words I can think of to describe her are "competent" and "blunt", neither of which are real personality traits.
Navani would be my actual choice. But Jasna is hot
NAGILFI 4 LYFE
If I was a simp, it'd be for Navani. She's actually a great partner, if you got a tight ass and are named Dalinar Kholin

Excuse you she's a Gilf
So, your simphood goes on hold when you worldhop out of Earth? That's like A. Stick becoming Fire after Shallan has left the beach. For shame, gancho, for shame.
I came here to post this and it seems I have been out-simped.  Life before death, Radiant.
Valid
There’s the scene from OB with her and Renarin during the Sanderlanche, and that scene from RoW during a battle. I would say she’s a rather steadfast person, but kinda like Shallan in that she also has times where she’s out of her depth and breaks a little (such as when she was trying to fight purely with Shards during the battle but eventually loses her restraint as she begins to be overwhelmed and uses Radiant abilities to win). She’s also emotionally reserved, leading to her bluntness and capacity for logic, but it also leads her to be extremely pragmatic and unable to empathize with people, only really sympathizing  with them.
When she’s with Wit and he’s trying to seduce her physically we get a lot of insight I think.
I think Jasnah is incredibly boring. She's too competent, while also seemingly above the need for human emotions (with the exception of some scenes in RoW, I actually like her there). I also find that the story bends over backwards to make her appear more intelligent than she is. On the other hand, Navani feels like a person. She struggles with things beyond "woe is me, why won't everybody listen to me and all of our problems would be solved!"
> Has she had a PoV where we can see what's going on in her mind

I would swear I've read one of the prologues from her PoV
From dalinars description, jasnah got her looks from her mother.
I love you too.

And I would love you even more if you could tell me who the artist of the Navani and Raboniel art you post in the other comment.

Ain't nothing wrong with being a woman, gancho. Some of my relatives are women.
Jasnah is constantly making mistakes. She let a 17/18 year old sheltered country bumpkin rob her. She was nearly assassinated on the winds pleasure. She was so stubborn that she fight with only her shards that she ignored the fact she was a storming radiant , which killed many of her own troops. She was convinced that parshman were void bringers. She’s useless at the visual arts.

Thanks, gancho!
See thats the old Jasnah attitude about the visual arts! Shallan showed her how important they are and Jasnah apologized for being such a chull about it. 

Shallan literally mapped the whole shattered plains using her pattern recognition and artistic talents. She single handedly gave the Alethi army the biggest tactical advantage since the start of the war. 

Your hatred and passion for one of the most practical feminine arts is very lowly of you. I feel like you think Amaran is as honorable as he thinks is.
I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm saying you went above and beyond the usual practice of reserving the real shocking crime at the very end. Normally it'd be something like baby kicking or puppy eating, but you really laid Jasnah low with that one.

Alright this one made me bust a laughspren
“This is Voices with Venli! And now we’re on the air with Rlain—Rlain, what do you have for us?”

“I just want to know if we’ve considered working *with* these people, and maybe using a less ominous term than *VOIDBRINGER*—“

“Another shell-less apologist, no thanks!” 

*Intense squealing is psychic feedback*
I laughed out loud, so my wife asked me what I read. I read it to her. She has never read the series. Her face made me laugh even MORE.
“The thing I love about my raycon wireless headphones is that they help drown out the dying cries of bridgemen with their active noise cancelation. And the all-day battery means I can listen to music for a whole plateau assault”
This one of the more creative crem yet.
Did you know that the song Radioactive has nothing to do with Aharietiam? The lyrics writer was a Shin man, and the song is about waking up in a new world after losing his faith in Stone Shamanism.
"My name is Shallan and welcome to Shattered Plain Songs. Tonight with me I have a very special bridgem- I mean guest. He's flown all the way across the Highstorm to get here. You know him, you love him, I love him, the one and only Highmarshal Radiant Kaladin Stormface. Welcome to the show."

"Thanks for having me."

"So, Kal. If you were stuck in a chasm with me, for the rest of your life, what track would you bring with you so we never got bored?"

"Ummm..."

"Kaladin is a little shy."

"For our listeners who don't know. Our guest tonight is a bonded radiant, and has brought along the lovely Syl to join him. And in full human form today. Are you alright?"

"Why wouldn't I be."

"Well, you're just looking quite blue is all."

*The sounds of awkward coughing, and someone far in the distance managing the sound levels laughing is heard.*

"So, Kaladin. What would you bring?" 

"I brought my favourite song. I am a fan of rocks, so I thought it would be a good fit. Also, it reminds me of a time I saved your life."

"What?" 

*Your Welcome by Dwayne Johnson starts playing.*

This is extremely canon aligned to the level of sarcams  kaladin is currently comfortable using towards his friends.

Like. This is not to much sarcams (he is not on Shallans level yet) and not to little (like he was before).
This fits absolutely perfect to the current canon.

It's okay, just means you're not Vorin like those bloodthirsty Alethi.  Perfectly reasonable!
same sex relationships dles nlt seem to be very controversial on roshar so it could still work!
I wonder if “who reads the spanreed communications in your relationship” is the equivalent microagression on Roshar as “who wears the pants”.

I just spent three full minutes explaining the concept of the safe hand to my wife because this made me snort out loud.
I haven’t fully worked out my custom pricing tiers yet, but I am currently thinking ballpark $150 for a book this size with cheaper materials (just cheaper on the aesthetic, I use quality structural materials for all books), and then more for premium materials. My ready to ship rebinds go for $100-$150 depending on materials and size just to give you a frame of reference. I’ll definitely be posting on all my social media when I’m ready to start selling customs! It’s probably going to be a few months though
😂😂 amazing!! Your Dalinar reskin is one of my favorite cosmemes
I thought it was the time the community brought up shard dildos
That doesn’t sound very safe
Oh, that I didn't remember! I was thinking of the time someone asked him about a possible threesome Kaladon/Adolin/Shallan and he started his answer with "you people". I can't find that though, don't even remember where it was.
How long does this take you? This honestly seems priced too low to me
Saving this post and comment so that one day I will have this masterpiece in my hands 😂
Thank you! It’s definitely taken on a life of its own at this point, I love it
I just looked that up, that was the one he responded to with “sigh”
The sound of that poor spren's screaming just muffled over and over...
there were several "you people". i think the shardildos also elicited that response
actually not one of his "you people"s! 

https://preview.redd.it/ilvdvxl07b2e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a684fd1e62b1667d109220c3707778c2456a81d6
It depends on how much work I have to put in the text block itself. An easy block I can get rebound in 8-10 hours. One that has something complicated to deal with (paper texture, glue type and amount, damage, etc) takes longer. Other things can increase the time too, like if I’m customizing the endpapers instead of store bought cardstock. This book took about 15 hours, but that was because I spent a ton of extra time on the silhouette and sanding the edges so the glyphs would come out super crisp. 

It’s definitely not comparable to my 9-5 so I’d love to be able to charge more; unfortunately there are quite a few shops on Etsy selling rebinds (and I don’t want to handle my own taxes and shipping fees) so I have to stay competitive with their pricing. I prefer to sell sets so I can batch the steps together and get a little more return for my time. I could go on a whole rant about how Amazon/temu/shein are ruining small business but I wouldn’t be saying anything no one hasn’t heard before so I’ll just leave it at that 😂
Well, to make a sharddildo you would need a living, consenting radiant spren. So if they're screaming, it's in a good way.
just gotta bond a freaky spren
No, the sharddildo made him sigh. Here:

Storms, I was so sure that one was a "you people"!

I have worse memory than an unbonded spren.
Eehhhhh...Veil, probably, more than Shallan...

Or maybe they're both into it then Radiant shows up and is like "WHAT IN DAMNATION???"
not unless you choose that moment to break the bond.

Why does everyone hate Moash? I'm halfway through Elantris.
we are frequently outcremmed, and it is frankly embarrasing
Dude hasn't even reached the second main character fakeout yet
Page three.  Of the PROLOGUE.

PAGE THREE.

OF.  THE.  *PROLOGUE?!*

My partner is now laughing at me for my reaction IRL after reading that.  Honestly can't tell of that's a troll or not, because I've actually met people that mind-numbingly dense before.
Why is kaladin sad? Did I miss something?

(I'm at his first pov)
Like I get it, the prologues are difficult the first read through, but asking “does the book even answer any of these questions?” in the prologue is…something.
I've gotten as far as "Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, wore white..." and I'm already confused.

Where is he going in white? What is he going to do while wearing white? Why did he choose that particular color? I sure hope he's not a wedding guest, that's a major no-no.

Most importantly, is it after Labor Day when he is wearing white??

I need answers. Please no spoilers, but I don't understand what is going on. I'm not sure I can keep reading if the whole book is like this.
Dude never read a high fantasy book in his life.
I felt the same way when a friend told me he stopped reading Dune on the Gom Jabbar scene because it “didn’t explain anything, just threw out random terms”.

The Gom Jabbar is defined in the same paragraph as it is introduced.

"Have you never read a book before? You read it and information is revealed."
Someone's been hanging out in r/fantasy I see
Had a friend who dropped Wheel of Time after reading the prologue.

He said it was too confusing...

I explained to him that he doesn't have to worry about the prologue, it's not important. Just keep reading.

"Well, now I don't wanna read a book where chapters are unimportant" Dude...... just read the damn book.

Anyway that was 3 years ago he has not touched the book ever since. I've accepted that I walk this Earth alone, no friends want to give my fav books a try.

Another friend just watched Dune and REALLY loves it and its lore (He won't shut up about it)... I'm thinking perhaps I could indoctrinate him into Stormlight.
If I have to tell one more "convince me it's actually good" poster that no one is making them read it, I'm going to scream.
When i first read about spren popping outta the ground i was like wtf.
Oh wait till he finds out about spren.
Great meme, Gon!
The screenshot isn't somebody hating on the books though. Just ... someone who needs to develop their reading experience, with a large side of cringe.

Frankly, the subreddits are far too defensive of criticism in my opinion. The books aren't "perfect" and authentic, non-troll criticism makes for good discussion. But most of the time when anybody says something the least bit negative they get downvoted to pieces. It's obnoxious.
That's something I never understood. I'm not a huge fan of Rothfuss (mostly I can't stand Kvothe). I don't hang out in NOTE forums complaining. I just simply won't read anymore books from Rothfuss!
I'm almost certain that some percentage of them are AI bots who scrape the subreddits data and generate posts that will generate engagement.

Also, people are fucking dumb.
I have been feeling good lately, so can you point me to some such posts to get my blood boiling?
That can’t be a real post
What do you mean? This is the main sub
Tbf I was confused about what parshmen and parshendi were for a long time lol, same for chulls. But I dont think its the books fault
Yep, I posted one of these on the main sub, probably about half a year ago now or so (could be much longer actually). I was about halfway through the first Stormlight book, and I followed the people's advice; I stopped reading it. This sub keeps appearing, and I dont understand any of it and I think you are all insane, but it's almost enough to make me want to read the books. I loved the Skyward series, if that's any consolation.
As someone who grew up reading fantasy I occasionally have to remind myself that the average person getting into fantasy for the first time is NOT used to entire world building elements being mysteries until the author decides to explain them.

Idk if that's the case there, but a new fantasy reader might see 'Parshendi' without explanation and not realize the genre trope of 'this is a mystery I'll figure out eventually or need to piece together myself' and instead think 'is the author bad and forgot to explain it? Did I miss a prequel? This is dumb'
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
"Does the book even answer any of these questions?" Bro this series has four books, what do you think??😭
I guess no one directly tells you "It's okay to not have all the answers immediately - sometimes the author/director wants to cultivate a mystery for the reader/viewer and wants them to wonder and ask questions, which will be paid out later or explained through context"     
      
...but I feel like everyone else got it...
Maybe try page 4, it will help?
TBCH it was only midway through oathbringer I fell into groove in the series
Ok I’m not a Sanderson fan (I have a lot of respect for him though), and even I think this is stupid.
The most important chapter is the next one
That has to be a troll. Page 3 of the prologue? Has this person never read a prologue before?
Well to be honest "Way of Kings" doesn'T answer any fundamental questions for me in the first two thirds. After that i didn't read any further.

  
Does it get better?
Is it the Stormlight Archive without a little confusion though? 🤣
Those have to be crem spillings, there's no way this is real.
Oof. The restraint of that 'alright bro'.
“I can’t stand (insert female character) chapters I skip them!”

Every damn time lol
Tbh I thought the parshendi were just people with big black eyes before the I found out there were bug/crab people. 
Which prologue? The prologue to the prologue? The Prelude? Or the Prologue?
He didn't even mention what prologue.
Because prople will say "you didn't finish the book, you can't said it's bad"
Moashaod.
The amount of air I just expelled from my nose. Great work!
He killed a Seon that we all liked!
Who is Adonalsium, and how is Hoid connected to them? I’m on the first page of Goodnight Moon.
This is one of those jokes I want to share with someone, but the problem is no one I know in real life has ready any cosmere books besides Mistborn, so it would just be really confusing.
😂😂😂
I dont know, he's so cool he even get a set of shards from kaladin!
To be honest it did make me be weary of him from the start.
We must step up our game. For Adonalsium!
What is the Poe's Law for Cosmere?
Not even the first one!
"I am five chapters in, I have already figured out the entire plot of the book by guessing it. Should I continue reading it?"
Of course it's a fucking troll. Neither Parshendi, nor gemstones have even been mentioned by page 3 of the prologue.
Hey everyone, does this book ever explain what The Way Of Kings is? Just for reference I've picked the book up at Indigo Books and have looked at the cover a little
page THREE.
Page three of which prologue? OOP needs to be more specific.
It's surprising those people even read at all or even know how to read.
"I'v only read 3 pages and I don't know whats going on"
Why is Kaladin sad? Did I miss something?

(I'm in the middle of RoW)
Sometimes I want to gatekeep these people. I never do, and never will, but there are times where I get a sense of ennui about it and just want to scorch the earth. Then I find another person so excited about the books like what I felt when I first read them, just the sense of wonder and happiness, that’s what I crave.
I love confusing prologue. Like in Eye of the World where you're witnessing a world shaking event happen with damn near no context. It makes me excited to discover the significance of what happened and the history of the world.
it’s like this dude’s only ever read encyclopedias before
I'll be honest... The first time I started reading Stormlight I couldn't get through the prologue and abandoned it for a long time.
He's attending a horror comedy musical, and will be sitting in the splatter zone.
He's going to kill a king and wearing white because his masters commanded it.
>dude never read a ~~high fantasy~~ book in his life

FTFY
I quit reading WoK because it never explained what color Szeth was wearing!
Imagine them trying to read malazan.
Ugh I hate watching movies with people like that. I guarantee the person in the tweet continued to do the same thing like a dozen more times throughout the entire movie
noooooo you don’t understand if *they* don’t like the book *nobody* is allowed to like it
Yeah spren are weird.
That’s completely fair. I’ve seen a ton of comments to the effect of “these books are perfect and nobody can ever write anything better and they have zero flaws whatsoever”. That kind of worship sets my teeth on edge, honestly.

The screenshot and the meme aren’t meant to be related as much as two different types of posts that I see too often and am irked by too often, lmao
Literally just browse mainsub. Every other post is like this
Honestly I think this is one of the strong points. It avoids giving lengthy exposition every time something new is introduced, and let's the reader draw conclusions and make connections. Imo it actually makes it a whole lot easier to remember everything about the world.

Like if you had a chapter where chulls are introduced and it goes into detail about them, then the rest of the story just mentions them by name, you're less likely to remember much of the initial information. Whereas if chulls are mentioned earlier and described later, it creates more of a lasting connection in your mind because now you're remembering parts of the story where chulls were mentioned and filling in that information.

Learning is a lot more effective if you learn a little, then a while later you review it and learn a little more, then later you review again.
if you ever decide to get back into Sanderson's Cosmere books (Mistborn, Warbreaker, Elantris, Stormlight Archive) I would absolutley recommend *NOT* starting with Stormlight. They are the largest and most ambitious of all the different series and while totally fine to be read standalone, can be a lot for anyone not used to his style of world building. Even just tangential knowledge of the universe from other books can help a lot since I think Sanderson tends to barrel ahead a bit more in these since there is just so much meat and plot.

The sparseness of detailed explanations of minor things is actually sort of acknowledved addressed in the second book in the series by someone who has traveled a great deal and remarks to a main character how people just accept those everyday things as axiomatic and universal, without understanding so much as even the *names* of those things. The example is axe hounds, which of course they know what an axe is but what exactly is a hound? since this world has almost no animal life that isn't arthropoid or shelled in order to survive high storms.  I won't say more because the reason for that is actually a *big* spoiler. 

Skyward was relatively simple world building compared to anything in the cosmere but is also good to get used to him. I would also recommend The Reckoners series of you liked Skyward. Mistborn  era 1 (The Final Empire/Mistborn, The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages) are a much more accessible fantasy setting IMO and the books aren't nearly as big of a read if you feel like taking a break in between.
I blame fucking Harry Potter and such YA for this shit. They're world building is essentially "here's a pile of exposition with a page of a things introduction, or at the first opportunity a character has to mention it unless it's a main mystery of the story" or else the just go "because it's magic and magical things happen for magical reasons so just don't worry about it. This takes place adjacent or right in the middle of the real world but doesn't effect it because I don't want to write about that."
It's almost a ketek!
Teoft
really good book, but it’s above my level. i’m not sure on how to get better at reading, though. 
Relatable. And they all look at me reeeaaal weird when I try to explain how starvin' awesome the cosmere is.

(in Lift's voice a la Kate Reading)
((while picturing the red yarn conspiracy theories board crazy eyes meme))
What the hell is an Adonalsium?
For Odium!
For Kelsier!
Yeah, I'm aware that a significant portion of these must be trolls, but it is still fun to poke fun.
Well, given the fact they're talking about Parshendi and gemstones, they must be reading the actual prologue with Szeth son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, who wore white on the day he was to kill the king. So they made it past the prelude.
I know a guy that looks at the Wikipedia page every time a character is introduced.
I accidentally got spoiled on how Kaladin is Shallan's brother, and clearly all of the drama and tension hinges on not knowing that yet. Is it even worth reading when I already know the only big twist? (plz no spoilers)
I remember that post on main stormlight sub. Good grief. 
You might be thinking of the prelude. The prologue is with Szeth.
I think its the book
No. This will be explained in book ten.
😭no because this is legit me
See that's what of the big things I'm worried about if the Cosmere gets a big movie/show adaptation. I don't want to gatekeep new people who discover the Cosmere that way, but also I don't want the community to be changed and diluted by a bunch of new fans who are completely unfamiliar with everything.
That's a nice word, ennui, I like it.
I agree now but they’re definitely an acquired taste — the first time I read TWOK I definitely struggled in the first half. I soldiered on because I’d loved the Mistborn trilogy and my partner had already read TWOK and told me it was worth it.

I think our current culture is so obsessed with having *everything* explained to them (lest they get a cinemasins ding for it) that you have to train yourself to, as I call it, “let yourself be dumb for a bit” with series like SLA, WoT, and from what I’ve heard Malazan.

Still, when I struggled it was more “oh boy I’m gonna have to get used to this” not “lol do these questions even get answered??”
That’s the thing that really hooked me on Stormlight within the first few pages while I was a little bit so-so on Mistborn. I immediately had a hundred questions in my head about basically everything and wanted them all answered so badly.
Sounds like you would love The Malazan Book of the Fallen. The confusion never stops.
The Broken Earth prologue had me hooked instantly with no actual concept of WTF was happening.
I said no spoilers! Now the whole book is ruined, thank you very much. 😡😡😡
Is this a Lateral reference?
Don't be silly, that can't be it.
Books set in the real world generally don't have terms you don't know and can't look up in a dictionary. The average reader is also familiar with the world those books are set in and won't get confused about a character using a "light switch" to make a weird glass-and-metal contraption called "lamp" emit light.    
On the other hand, very few people have real-life experience with surgebinding or witnessed a highstorm.
TECHNICALLY he wore all of them.
I haven’t read it, is nothing ever explained? How do you have memories of ice? I just read the titles of the books and that one stuck out to me.
I do have very low tolerance for people who are just hate-reading. XD
Well it would be weird if Kaladin started explaining to Dalinar what a cremling is, I agree
Yeah, Skyward was much more easy to digest. Is Reckoners by Sanderson or just a similar style? Thanks for the reply, I probably got more out of this than I did from my post 😂
I can ABSOLUTELY confirm this. My first jaunt into the cosmere was the first few chapters of TWoK. I put the book down because I was confused after the two main character fakeouts. I read Warbreaker then because I heard it was a bit easier… I was hooked after like ten pages. Fast forward two months and I was back to being knee deep in Stormlight lmao
Adonalsium deeze nuts
All I know is they will remember our plight eventually
I think it's on the periodic table
Something that’s potentially dead.
I'm om page 7 of ASoIAF do they explain who that is soon?
Adolin’s metals
We found him!
I try not to downvote your every comment, but this one tested my resolve.
Every time I reread TWoK I forget the Prelude exists. "Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, wore white on the day he was to kill a king" is so entrenched in my head as being the first line of the book I'm always surprised when I have to read the Prelude before I get to it.
Oh come on if he wanted to be like that he could *at least* look at the coppermind instead
"mmmh, this guy looks intresting..." \*checks the coppermind\* wait, they DIE in book 3!???!?!?, who could have ever predicted that!
I do that sometimes for book series where I don't care about spoilers like Wheel of Time. It helps me keep track of the thousands of characters that some book series like to introduce.
That is honestly fucking wild, how long has he had mental illness?
He has looked into the chasm and jumped
*laughs in Skywalker*
I died first before realizing it's crem.

It's a good crem
What's a prelude if not a prologue to prologue?
I learned it from TV, not school….
Cinemasins are clowns anyway
😂 I've heard a lot about it and am dying to read it but I'm already caught up in way too many series. I should be done with Wheel Of Time in a few months now and after Wind and truth I'll need another gargantuan series to fill the void in my heart so I might get to it then.
That did remind me of it recently, but I have actually seen the evil dead musical before.
Dude stop trying to out us, you'll ruin the mission
I don't know if this is a joke or not, but I'll give a sincere reply. 

Malazan does not have info dumps to explain concepts. The story does exposition mostly in dialogues or during action scenes, and you still might have only vague idea of what something actually is. Reading Malazan is like piecing together a huge puzzle. Not every thing will make sense, you have to trust the author that eventually, in the course of 10 books you'll get it somewhat. Malazan is much well appreciated during the re-read.
Yeah that's the issue with exposition in stories. It's generally not natural for people to notice mundane details about their lives, so any attempt to describe those details to the reader pulls them out of the story.
Yes it's also Sanderson. It's a complete trilogy, a little bit YA like Skyward. the main books are about the same size as Skyward. There's a small novella that take place between 1 and 2 but it's totally optional and just gives more detail to events summarized in the 2nd. There is also 4th book called Lux that just takes place in the same world but is different characters (honestly it's much darker and has an ominous ambiguous ending that kinda kills the closure of the main series so read at your own risk, lol).

The basic idea is what if people started getting super powers, but they always become villains? It is very much in the vein of The Boys (don't know how much influence Sanderson got from there) but less edgy and the villains don't even try to hide their corrupt ways, they just rule their own pockets of humanity with an iron fist.
Should we tell the Beconites?
I read that part just today lmao
That's Adonalisium, which is a typo that I would expect to see way more often than I actually do. Apparently I'm the only one who thinks there's an "I" there.
Strange as I try to upvote your comments. Guess I am just the better person. 
Well, that’s because the prologue is the first part of The Way of Kings. The prelude is the prologue to the series as a whole. And chapter 1 is a prologue to “Kaladin is a sad boi”.
“Kalak rounded a rocky stone ridge and stumbled to a stop before the body of a dying thunderclast.”
There’s the wheel of time compendium app that lets you put in your current book and give you spoiler free reminders of things
Usually I’m like “to each your own” but good god this hurts as someone who really enjoyed reading that series blind.
And he PUSHED
When you think about it chapter 1 is a prologue so that means that the prologue is the prelude making the prelude a prologue to the prelude.
Oh absolutely! But we’re still feeling the CinemaSins Effect in broader culture, I think.
It was partially a joke in that I have not read the books. I did read the titles though.
I should start Malazan again. I got to where there was... a puppet guy? in a crate of some sort? and then there was an entirely separate plotline and some wolves or something. 

It's been a long time and I don't think I got far in the first book.
[TSM]>!(They already know)!<
No, that's Aluminium. A-Donalisium is the name for one of Trump's multi-tangential sentences.
Just because you may be the better person, doesn’t mean your worship is correct.

Hey, gon, is this you Sazed?
wait I did this too but I never spoiled myself from doing this. I would just google the name and read the first line of something and I would remember who they were. You don't have to read the whole wiki on them.

GIB MY BOI HIS EEPY SLEEPIES I BEG!!!
umm akshually ☝️

Kaladin/Mental Health
Brando loves giving his main characters insomnia
Hope you all have splendiferous days! :)
No, the *real* ship is Kaladin/Moash
it's a ship because we know it'll never happen
It's good that Kaladin doesn't have access to pewter dragging
Why did I read the last one as Kaladin/Sheep
Kaladin is Vessel confirmed?
Kaladin's best ship is with therapy
Jasnah/Shallan >:3c

Edit: we'll add an extra /Wit for terrible measure
Kaladin/Jasnah... some on? Nobody? All right...
My brother in Tanavast, what do you think the sleep is there for :)
This filth should not be allowed on here
We sure it’s not him projecting?
Wind and truth epilogue but it's just Kaladin and Moash making out sloppy style for 30 pages
do not say evil words like these.
Odium please take this pain from me
This but unironically
Same
You're secretly part Welsh?
Merely a piece of the mental health puzzle, goncho.
Too much sleep can be as much a symptom as too little sleep
Sleep is only one partner in the mental health polycule
nah, brandon dosen't physically need sleep anymore, he's past that.
He is compounding bronze
"I know you can't see me Moash, but I want you to **feel** the wetness of my oaths" 
  
*nuts all over Moash's back*
Somehow I didn't think that's an issue for him
Either that, or he found a way to make the Lopen's cousins write his books.
I’m pretty sure he’s a spren. That man is pure investiture

Lmao bring it on
Jesus Christ. This is a better love story than half of what's in Brandon's books. I believe you two will find each other!
no messages? what is fantasy football without trash talk?
Go dalinar!
Unite them.
Change your name to @heyDalinarMyRedditHandleIsShard0fOdium
If it's meant to be it'll be

Can you keep changing your team name and use that to communicate?
I love how those two people were able to connect via the comments on the subreddit.

Remember People, WE ARENT A CULT, EVEN THOUGH WE LOOK LIKE ONE!!!
Reminds me of getting absolutely destroyed in a game by someone named adolin kholin. I couldn’t even be mad lmao at least he was living up to his name
Playing fantasy sports outside of your friends? That sounds like much less fun
OMG, this just reminded me! Back in original CoD:Black Ops days I used to play with a guy whose gamer tag was "mat cauthon" and it wasn't until years later that I read the series _The Wheel of Time_ and recognized the name. Haven't seen him online ever since then and just wish I got to tell him how much I love that character!
A contest of your selected champions it will be, then!
I met a Dalinar Kholin while playing crucible in Destiny 2 a few years ago. I messaged him and we still play together from time to time
Imagine this is how the ending to wind and truth is decided lol
Odium can't send messages. The Oathpact is still holding!

Anything other than Yumi. That romance slaps
There’s no arranged marriage. 0/10
Oh I found him alright, this is actually how Brandon wrote the contest sorry for the spoilers.
They in fact have toxin each other.
Well their connection is obviously weak. Team Odium just need to spike them
Que sera sera
That’s a good idea! Can change it to “Hello SA Enthusiast!” I’m sure that won’t be misinterpreted…

Fr tho, good idea. Will have to change it to “Bondsmiths Blow” or something when I play him next
If you play for a long time, you eventually just start accumulating leagues. I am in a couple different leagues where when I started I knew a couple people in it, but now only know like one other guy. Same goes for a work league that was originally everybody in the same office, but now only has two of us from the original office.
It worked that way in Galactic Football lol

It was a solid meh
Thank you. No one understand my desire to be forced to marry someone due to extenuating circumstances
Yeah, maybe don't do the first one
Fuck I shouldn’t have clicked that

Not sure why I did; I haven’t even quite finished RoW so away is completely spoilers (the spoiler is completely expected though so)
Don't you guys discredit warbreaker
https://preview.redd.it/0jf1dq4v733e1.jpeg?width=420&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e56f00613ff0b2c0cf10da57e3664cedcb43827
...only to then promptly fall in love with the exact person I am forced to marry. How lucky and fortunate. That could have gone a lot worse.
The second could use workshopping as well - maybe "Blow the Bondsmith" would convey your feelings better
Trust me when I say that spoiler specifically xould have been a LOT more spoilery
Honestly as someone who HAS read through RoW, I’m not sure what specifically this is referring to anyway. You’re probably fine.
Wax and Steris erasure
And Tress was super cute y’all! (Tho if we are referring to Elantris then….)
Actually yeah you know what, that relationship surprised the hell out of me
Lol. I may reread it at some point, but all his covid books were meh to me. I think stormlight 4 was so bad to me that its biased everything else
Now that I think about it... if I had a nickel for every time that happened, I would have (starts counting) three (reads reply), no four nickels. Which is more than one usually gets.
Honest to God, most of his romance's erasure. Outside of Elantris I don't think he wrote an underwhelming romance.
Elantris being his first book, it makes sense that it wasn't done amazingly well, TBH.
Even more no? Elantris, Mistborn Era 2, Stormlight and Warbreaker at least
Zane
Come on, now. I love Sando's books, but let's not get carried away.
Ik I’m so proud of his amazing growth!! It makes me really proud
Elantris doesn’t count, the marriage is arranged by the two people getting married
Oh yeah. I forgot. 
I don't really and never have read as a romantic plot. The actual decision being made is weather or not Vin deserves Elend, not weather or not Vin loves Zane.
Fair, but a lot of people read it as a love triangle and that’s why it’s the most disliked part of pretty much anything Sanderson

There's a WoB where someone asked if the Planet of Sel is now technically the vessel for both Dominion and Devotion, and Brandon responded something like "some people would say yes, some people would say no, but it's more a matter of semantics"

In other words, Sel counts, too. Kinda.
Harmony has twice the power as the others...and only a fraction of the skill in how to use it. 

Harmony is 6'8" packed with muscle and never fought in his life against Autonomy, who's 4'11" who's a jujutsu champion, special forces krav maga.
I dunno. He sounds like he’s about to name himself after a communication app.
My brother in Adonalsium Sazed and barely do anything because he is a double shard.

Your comment made me realize how much I would love to see Ruin develop a slightly new Intent and become Humiliation (Social Ruin) with a heavy interest in battle rap and Photoshop.
this joke is made even funnier when you realize that the Elantrian shards died the weirdest way
What would Harmoniun even do when burned?
Turns out combining two diametrically-opposed Intents into one being without the other fourteen pieces of the original being it came from to regulate its functions results in some instability. Whoops!
Could you cover harmonium in another metal then burn?

I always saw it as each shard has infinite power, the number of shard is how much of it you can draw on at once. 

I heard it explained that each single shard has a firehose. Sazed has 2, but they're pointed at each other.

Wait I have no idea we knew how the selish shards died?
my best guess is turn you into a full Feruchemist
I wonder if you could coat it with another metal to keep it from touching water, and still be able to burn it after swallowing.
Stick the other 14 into Sazed then boom, new Andonalsium but this time it’s Sazed
I thought Ruin and Preservation were separate from the sixteen shards of Adonalsium?
That’s a huge risk to take since you’re operating under the assumption that you personally can burn it to begin with, and do so before it blows up your insides.

All allomancers in Era 2 are mistings not Mistborn, so there’s no assurance you’d have the capability to burn harmonium.
Bro harmony or whatever he calls himself today can barely decide howich he wants to traumatize his servants, I think I'll be fine.

>!Odium killed them, then shoved the remains into the Cognitive Realm, which is why selish magic is location based!<
Oh, right
It might be considered an alloy for the purposes of allomancy. Or you would have to burn the coating first, which would expose Harmonium and boom.
Honestly, I kind of assume that's where it's going.
No, they are two of the Sixteen. 
But can’t all ppl burn atium and lesarium and the other god metals?
Didn't work for me :(
>!Bro tried hiding the bodies once and stopped giving a shit right after!<
Oh yeah, I hadn't got how it connected. It makes sense now tho. Thanks!
I am really curious as to what Selish's version of Shadesmar looks like.
yeah idk what they're on about
Lerasium yes but atium no, there were atium mistings in era 1, but the other mistings couldn't use it, for other god metals we don't know or BS hasn't decided yet
>!I believe he started burning the bodies after that, not exactly easy to stuff two conflicting gods into a closet !<  
  
>!Harmony is suffering the effects of trying to control the power of two opposites, imagine the rampant power of Ruin and Preservation forced to conflict eternally, whatever poor sap near that is having a very not fun time!<
>!I've always imagined "blasted wasteland with a sun in the middle"!<
It looks like an neverending plasma thunderstorm, [apparently](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/171/#e8241).
Apparently all that Investiture creates huge plasma storms in Shadesmar which makes traversing that part very dangerous. But if you know what you are doing you can collect some pure Dor. That part of Shadesmar is reffered to as the Expanse of the Densities on the Rosharan Shadesmar map. This investiture has somewhat Invested the whole planet and gave it a level of self awareness, but we don't know what that level is.
I kinda get what they mean, we’ve only seen lesarium and atium be burned(to my knowledge) it could be by coincidence you can burn both of them and maybe none of the others can be burned.
Mr Brando Sando made a retcon, all atium in era 1 is an alloy containing electrum. [Here](https://www.17thshard.com/forums/topic/113111-atium-retcon-and-the-lost-metal/)
yeah but also like, sanderson has said that he wants god metals to be burned by everyone, thats why he retconed era one atium
Oh really? I was gonna say, I thought atium could only be burned by Mistborn or mistings of atium (which would be damn near impossible to determine). Then what does a non-misting get out of burning atium?
He retconned it, making era 1 atium an alloy with a little electrum to explain it. Everyone can burn atium and see atium shadows.
See, I didn’t know that before making that comment.  I assumed Lerasium was the exception, I wasn’t implying Harmonium was the exception.
I believe I have seen people saying that pure atium is far more powerful then the electrum alloy we have seen in Era 1, but we don't know what it does yet
Why doesn’t Kaladin just stop being a slave?
I’m like 25 chapters into Way of Kings and I’m honestly just confused. Kaladin is literally told from day one that a) he’s getting paid wages, b) he’s supporting the army and maximizing shareholder value, and c) he can stop being a slave if he works for long enough. Then he IMMEDIATELY starts fighting back against this system? He could just do his work, pull himself up by his bootstraps, and pay off his slave debt and he’d literally be free to do whatever he wants. But instead, he tries to impede the process as much as possible, ultimately hurting Sadeas’s bottom line.

Why is he seen as a good guy? What the fuck kind of book is this?
Had me until “maximizing shareholder value” Lmaoo
I thought this was just the regular Stormlight sub for a second, and I was about to fucking lose it, but then I realized this is cremposting.  Well done, sir.  Well done lmao
Nd also why tf is Shallan making stupid plans like stealing a magical object which she's not sure is a good plan? She could just open a gofundme? Open commissions for her drawings? Or an onlyhands account if she's really that desparate? Smh
Equally, why did Kelsier rebel against the Final Empire? He should've led a protest and bake sale in front of Kredik Shaw instead of killing all those innocent slavers!
Why doesn’t he also just stop being depressed? It’s not hard.
Slave Kal didn't have boots to pull the straps of
Ho-ly shit.

This is some Shard-tier Cremposting, OP.

Magnificently done!
That's how the fanfiction *Odium Shrugged* plays out.
-sees cremposting- oh thank God I was about to throw hands
"I will work for those who do not work for themselves"
The Way of Kings, a capitalist reading.
You see, he's currently a slave to evil masters so fighting against the system is good. Once they are replaced with holy Kholins (true believers in supply side Almighty) he rises to the top so now only an evil villain can fight against status quo (he wears black so he is a bad person).
Kaladin just isn't sigma enough. Seriously, all he does is lounge around like a wretch and cry about "muh fee fee's" and "depression" (whatever that is), rather than invest in himself like a true high-value man. Rather than putting in the work and grinding, he'd much rather cry about how haaaaaard his darkeyed life's been to a glowing leaf. Pathetic. Speaking of high-value men, it's remarkable how he's in the company of real men like Sadeas and Amaram, and he just doesn't capitalize on the opportunity whatsoever. Has he ever heard of mentorship? His entire life's been handed to him on a silver platter, but nah; Sorry guys! I'm just *soooooooo* depressed! I bet he's a socialist.  


Anyways I'm gonna go vomit now.
I was confused throught scared until i saw what subreddit it is. You scared me sir.
If Elon Musk read SLA
Remind me of Shallan in OB to Kaladin: at least my slaves were deserters, your bridgemen just stand around letting people fling arrows at them
He'd pull himself up by his bootstraps, but a red haired, light eyed woman took his boots.
Why doesn’t he just stop being oppressed? Is he fucking stupid?
Is he stupid?
Oh, you’d probably like *Kings of the Way* by Terry Goodkind
I see where you're going. Kaladin lacked the will to continue fighting against the system, but Moash did what was necessary. Excellent point.
Can't lift yourself up by your bootstraps when you don't have boots.

... until Shallan steals them, I guess
Halfway through your post I was mentally preparing to write a two-paragraph comment on why that is the stupidest take I've ever seen someone have from a book. Then I saw the sub. Well done, very well done
😖😖😖
Brother... This is the way... Of kings... You know the destination... And the journey.... Do you know the words?
Also Kaladin could have invested his spheres in war bonds or financial institutions, compounded his interest, and gotten free almost twice as fast. Really he should just follow THE LAW and work within the system to gain his freedom.
Ugh, if only, right? Storms, if everybody just listened to High Prince Sadeas, Alethi society would flourish. But for some reason everyone's just still sucking off Demented Dalinar, like some crazy person who loses his mind during a high storm is someone to be respected. Please!
Right? Maybe if he didn't buy the latest Syl model and spent less on the ingredients for Rocks soup he'd get ahead
Once he becomes a Windrunner, he actually can pull himself up by his bootstraps.

You do realize that Sadeas is the bad guy right? I mean the bridge crews are purposely not given armour or shields so they can be used as human shields for the soldiers. Also, the whole “pay your way out of slavery” thing is explicitly stated to be a sham. Yes, the bridgemen get paid but they don’t make even close to a livable wage and most of them freaking die.
Edit: holy shit I took this post way to seriously, sorry about that
Obviously he wants to be dominated by daddy Dalinar. His BDSM fetish won’t let him leave.
Hi Shallan! Why don't you just make sure he puts some of his wages aside to buy his freedom?
Can we please not.

>pull himself up by his bootstraps

Probably the only one that can actaully pull himself up by his bootstraps.
Because he's an emo snowflake who's best friend is a fucking fairy.  What did you expect?
You are just asking the real questions
Also dont forget he gets free immediately after 100 bridgeruns, he doesnt even need hoard his money to pay his debt. He could bring it back into the economy to hard working darkeyes via prostitutes and drugs
>pull himself up by his bootstraps

He can’t, Shallan stole them :(
In that arc Kal is basically Your 9-5 dude who just can't take it anymore and all he wants is a cold beer and hot stew with some friends.



At least he doesn't have to pay rent. Imagine the sadness

What he *really* should be doing is learning how to build bridges in his spare time so he has a marketable skill when he works his way up the Alethi military ladder and leaves his entry level position (bridgeperson)

Don’t worry. His arc is all about learning to stop living for himself and to start living for shareholder value.

So he does the honorable thing and forgoes his avacado toast so he can raise enough money for Mr.Kholin in his time of need!<
Absolutely, why can't he just appreciate all the hard work Sadeas is putting in to make Alethkar stronger?
Lmao!  Dude!  I got so freaking mad reading this 🤣🤣.  I thought it was a legit post until I saw another comment haha. Very well done!
If Sadeas makes money, that trickles down to his employees and their families. Kaladin is basically jeopardizing the livelihoods of all of Alethkar because he’s too LAZY to work
"maximizing shardholder value"
And he’d be maximizing his Bridgeholder value through trickle down gem-anomics. It’s really so obvious when you think about it.

Wait, people assume the main subs before the shit posting subs? I usually have the problem the other way around.
I mean, just today there was a question in r/stormlight_archive about whether the whole series is pro-slavery propaganda.
I’m fairly certain that this is making fun of a real post on r/Stormlight_Archive that claimed that Kaladin is pro slavery
At first I thought it was cremposting and the body was just going to be "is he stupid?" Then I opened it up and was like "oh this is a real post" and then I realized that it was, in fact, cremposting.

You get it. I’m all for creating change, but why did he have to do it so violently? There’s a time and a place for peaceful protest. Did they even try doing a sit-in or a march?
He should have tried not being half skaa
Also, everything from God is good by definition, and the Lord Ruler is their god. Because he rebelled against the Lord Ruler, Kelsier must therefore be evil.
DONT GOOGLE WHAT THE LORD RULER DOES TO PEACEFUL PROTESTERS
Right? He should just do some more katas. Endorphins make people happy, and happy people can just choose not to be depressed! He's constantly outside getting fresh air and jogging on those bridge runs, he should be overjoyed. This proves he is choosing to be unhappy.

Honestly I've seen some really, really, really bad Stormlight hot takes.

People have said Shallans experience with DID is overblown...

I don't consider myself an expert, but...

As someone who grew up around relatives who had DID, has dated people with DID, and been friendly with people who had DID, though admittedly has never had the condition and still holds the perspective of an outsider. Shallans experiences are certainly played for dramatic character moments, which in and of itself will never amount to a true and authentic portrayal of any mental condition. I also feel as if Shallan is blessed to have only two stable alters. (I've known people with as high as 7 and low as 4). That being said, there is exactly one DID experience that I have heard from everyone I've known who experiences it, that Shallan doesn't display. And it's the feeling of the effected individual looking at their hands and feeling as if they belong to someone else.

You can induce this experience in yourself through drugs that have a Dissociative effect, though I don't recommend taking these kinds of drugs lightly. All drugs are stronger than you, kids. Respect them.

The rest of Shallans experiences float pretty comfortably in the baseline of what many people I've known with the condition expect. The big outlier for me is that when Veil leaves Shallan doesn't grieve. If the alternates are aware of each other, generally you expect there to be feelings of mourning associated with that alternate leaving. Some have even described it as feeling like a relative died.

I've also seen people say Kaladins experiences with Depression are overblown.

Now, I do consider myself a first-hand expert on depression. Kaladins' experiences are within expectations, though once again, played for character moments. Not realistic, overcoming depression is generally a more ponderous, slow, and boring experience than would make for exciting fiction.

I have been clinically depressed since I was very small. My first suicide attempt was probably when I was around 6 years old, maybe 7. I tried to hang myself from the top bunk with a necktie i stole from my father. I think it's pretty safe to say my depression is more severe than Kaladins. I am very happy that there are people who don't know what that feels like, to have a compulsion to end your life at such a young age.

And the thing is, there's no real trauma that caused it. I've always been that way. There's trauma that made it worse, but no inciting incident. There's easy days, there's hard days, there's middling days.

I'm not telling a joke, I'm not being sarcastic, I'm not saying "Oh, must be fucking nice", if you feel as if Kaladins experiences are over the top in terms of depression, I'm happy for you.  I find it especially real how he clings to something that causes a break in the bad days and falls apart when it doesn't work out.

My favorite bad Stormlight hot take, though? It's gotta be the one I find actually funny. Whenever I see someone say the eye colour based caste system is racist.

My brother in Tanavast. Alethi Lighteyes can't be racist to Alethi Darkeyes. They're both Alethi. To use a real world parallell, it's like saying the Samurai caste were racist to the peasant caste, they're both Japnese.

And in a lot of ways the Samurai were worse than the Lighteyes. At least when a lighteyes murders some peasants the king sends him off somewhere he can't do much more harm. In a lot of time periods there were just no laws for a Japanese peasant for what a Samurai could do to you. Just raw cold blooded murder in the street and nobody got punished.

It's got nothing to do with race. It's classist.

And it's always someone with like Elsecaller in their username. Child of Honour, if Jasnah caught you thinking like that she'd shackle your ankle to Wit and order him to shout "Undertext!" every time you said or did anything.

I do forgive because I can kind of tell from the writing style that it mostly comes from... younger(?) fans, and sometimes fans who I believe are ESL.
How do you read the Stormlight Archive and think "ah yes, this book is pro-slavery"???
when they said that Kaladin seemed to be pro-slavery lmfao 😭😭

YOU CANNOT HAVE MY GAINS!
Yeah man, well... it was a lot to write but i didnt get to my main point.

Wherever fiction is talked about, you'll find young people saying it's overblown. Reality is often overblown compared to fiction.

I see people in the worldbuilding subreddit talking about "Oh I can't have this army be 3500 soldiers that's two much for an early medieval economy." Yet you look in history at the wars between Alexander's successor kingdom's and you have like... phalanxes 100 men deep and nearly 1000 across, and that's the side that lost.

Fiction must feel real, reality doesn't care how we feel about it.

So fuck it, at this point i dont care if a writer does worldbuilding like Elder Scrolls, have shit so ridiculous fans assume it's not canon because they didn't play earlier games ago where a big plot point was a mech fueled by the heart of a dead God that warped reality so bad when it was last turned on that 3 of the worlds most powerful men had their identities shuffled and combined, and the time before that an entire race just disappeared and probably became the mechs armour, and the race of atheists are only atheists because they view it as offensive that any pathetic God creature could be superior to their inventions, ignoring every reason real life people adopt atheism.

I see people saying Shallans DID is too much to be believable. I say these people need to go out and live more, meet people with the disorder. Experience will adjust their opinion.

A movie like Split is where DID becomes unbelievable, not simply because The Beast actually gains superpowers  when that personality takes over, but because of the sheer number of alternates. 24 distinct alternates? That's significantly more than double what my aunt had, (7) and from research I know that about 10 is what you should expect from the average person living with from the disorder.
It's discrimination, but it's not based on ethnicity. It's not racism.
It's classism.
> If that's not racism, I don't know what is.

Admitting you have a problem is the first step
>If that's not racism I don't know what is.

You are correct. You don't know what racism is, you're confusing an arbitrary social categorisation based on phenotype with an arbitrary closed social stratification system.

Like I can think of a thousand ways to say this, but that's the funniest one to me.

Like "my parents were in this social group and I inherited their position"

"That's racist."

Like if you can't see why that reaction is hilarious I got nothing for you, friend.
Some more excerpts from the series:

"I am not a windspren, Kaladin. I am moneyspren, spirit of value."

.

"What is the value of a share?" Dalinar asked

"The Theylins say a share is worth three broams"

"And what do you say?"

Kaladin's father's words came to mind "A share is potentially priceless."

"So today you bought two thousand priceless shares, and all I had to repay you with was a single priceless worker's life. I call that a good deal."

.

"I will protect shareholders who cannot protect themselves, especially at the expense of consumers." - the third ideal of the Debtrunners

.

"YOU CANNOT HAVE MY MONEY. If my profits fall, they shall rise each time in a better market."
Cash before debt. Stocks before customers. Portfolios before pancakes?
You and the person I originally replied to should research Apartheid, the white people in Southern Africa were all of a higher class. It’s still racism.
It's not racist, because it isn't about race or skin color. It's not classism, because it's not any more about class than any other social or prejudicial hierarchy (they're all classist). It's eye-ist, because eye color is the only distinguishing feature. Darkeyes aren't discriminated against because they're peasants and poor, they're discriminated against because they have brown eyes.

This is a made-up fantasy world, where discrimination occurs based on an intentionally meaningless facial feature. You don't have to prove how perfectly analogous it is to the real world, and everyone else isn't wrong for disagreeing with you. It doesn't align with the real world perfectly (although if I had to submit my opinion on closest analogue, it seems pretty similar to the racism surrounding the Rwandan genocide).

Between racism and classism, eye-ism is probably closer to racism, because it's all based around exhibition of an inborn trait. If one parent was a rich lighteyes, but the child is born with brown eyes, they're still darkeyes. Under classism, it's possible to raise one's station by getting filthy rich, marrying up, or just straight lying about one's heritage. It's nearly impossible to change your skin color, by contrast. Of course, in the SA, it is possible to change one's eye color, another key difference from our world.
>"I will protect shareholders who cannot protect themselves, especially at the expense of consumers." - the third ideal of the Debtrunners

I feel like that is more akin to the second ideal.

Third ideal might be:

"I will protect even my workers, so long as it is financially incentivized."
Well the Cosmere is full of investment after all
The hardest dollar to make isnt the first dollar. No. It's the next dollar. Always the next dollar.
A higher class and also a different race. The class part makes it classism, the race part that makes it racism. The two aren't mutually exclusive. The lighteyes and darkeyes aren't different enough to be defined as separate races, so it's purely classism.
The confidence
You make good points, I think we should just leave it at that and be done.
Hm. Some good points, *but*

>Between racism and classism, eye-ism is probably closer to racism, because it's all based around exhibition of an inborn trait.

Would you call the Spartan practice of killing children with genetic abnormalities racist, or close to racism? It was also based around exhibition of an inborn trait.
That analysis works until you consider Nahn and Dahn. Literal asaigned at birth social strata. A caste system.
Ah, you're right - my bad. I don't have the books in front of my to pull quotes from. (I lent them to my poor friend because I thought they might teach him how to not be poor).
Is that not just... how the Alethi define race? Genuine question, that's how I've always thought about it but I don't know how academics actually categorize this stuff.
That's fair
Fantastic idea. Have a wonderful day everyone!
Racism and caste systems are not exclusive. It can be both.
I guess we don't really know how the Alethi define race but in general race is defined as a group of common ancestry, distinguished from others by physical characteristics. Shared cultural characteristics may also be considered sometimes. I would argue that since all Alethi have a shared ancestry, there is only a single differing physical characteristic and their overall culture is not any different than what would be usually expected of a class-based system. 

In addition, the lighteyes and darkeyes is a purely cultural separation, though an Alethi and Shin have vastly different physical characteristics, not just one, and separate ancestry altogether.
That’s basically it.  They just have two races, lighteyes and darkeyes.  They just use eye color as the dividing line, rather than skin color.
This is correct. However people treat it as of the Alethi are victims of racism perpetrated by other Alethi.

To me, this is about as funny as when a video game ragdoll glitches out in a way that makes it look like it's trying to dance its way back to life.
Fair enough, by that definition probably not. Usually I just hear it used essentially for skin color regardless of any other traits, so eye color seemed to me like a clear enough analogy to count it as their society's version.
Generally one race doesn't "become" another and have the carrot of becoming that race dangled in front of them in hopes they'll fight more bravely.

Over time, you can see ethnic groups categorised together, though the culture of the United States resists this with certain people throwing a bunch of fractions at you when they talk about their background. 

However in the rest of the world, most people categorise European background as all being one thing, with the assumption in places like Australia that you're the descendent of an Irish or English criminal, whatever, doesn't matter you're "White".

The best example of this would be Germany. They're not claiming separate ethnic identities like "Prussian" and haven't since a little after Germany unified, despite having differing cultures within Germany. North Germans and South Germans have very different ideas about Oktoberfest for instance, but they'll both be considered German.

Though this is a consequence of people realising that most of the things we attribute to race actually being cultural and culture is not plastic to the environment, it will change if you just leave it alone.

You're flaring your copium
I wonder if polygamy is legal on roshar
No, no no no. Let him cook. Hopefully, it will end like berserk if Griffith and Guts weren't a bunch of cowards (I'm addicted to copium flaring!)
Lmao, I gotta start using this phrase
**Copium** [Cp]

**Allomancy** - Burning Copium makes unbelievable things believable. Flaring Copium enhances this even further by giving you a confidence boost, making almost anything seem possible.

**Feruchemy** - Copium affects your mind’s natural affinity to believing in facts and evidence. Storing Copium into your Copiummind makes you less likely to believe things, i.e. more skeptical. Using up Copium makes you more gullible and delusional.

**Hemalurgy** - Steals a target’s believability. Wearing a Copium spike enhances your charisma and make other people more likely to believe you.
We are talking about Highprince Adolin Kholin, cousin to the king, and Kaladin motherfucking Stormblessed here. They could make it legal.
Shallan being a polygamy by herself
honestly if there is a bond and oaths involved i bet it'll be just fine and dandy
Be careful, there’s not much Copium left after Cope was splintered by Odium
With all those traumas that ship sailed long ago
I doubt the church would be happy about it. But vorinism can go suck an egg.
What are you?
Bit of a Truthwatcher myself imo, the gentleman's Ravenclaw
Dalinar: You're Lift, right?

Lift: Yes.

D: And your order?

L: More food.

D: I meant your order of Knights Radiant.
Slytherin 
Dustbringer 

I feel like i have to reaffirm that I’m not evil
In case anyone wants the official quiz: 


https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/official-knights-radiant-order-quiz
I’m a Windrunner - which I’m kind of torn on. I feel like Windrunner is like how everyone wants to be a Gryffindor or like how all the little boys like red 🤷🏻‍♂️

I’m house Ravenclaw though so I feel like maybe the elsecaller would have been more in line with that house? I DO like blue though….
Hufflepuff Edgedancer.

Don’t be mean to me. I *will* cry.
Hufflepuff/Truthwatcher

There is no escape
Slytherin/Lightweaver

I do a bit of lying
Bondsmith Badger.
Gryffindor / Elsecaller.

What can I say, I'm an overachiever
https://preview.redd.it/u5nhzy363o1e1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a97e93320aae24ca832c07bcbe8c0b4897e84e1a

I feel like this is actually pretty accurate. Happy to see Windrunner as runner up.

Ravenclaw Willshaper it is, that's certainly better than it could be
Skybreaker
Gryffindor Windrunner. On a different note, the Knights Radiant quiz has to be the best I've ever seen one set up, because it uses sliders to adjust your agree/disagree rather than the standard 3 or 5 buttons (i.e. Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
I took the quiz after I finished TWOK and about a quarter way through WOR. I knew I would try and skew my results based on my favorite character as the series went on so I wanted to get my Order "unbiased".

Anyway, I ended up with Edgedancer. Then I met Lift. And then I realized I would have ended up with Edgedancer regardless because I adore Lift as a character.

Hufflepuff btw
Life before death.

Strength before weakness.

Brandon Sanderson before She-who-must-not-be-named.

(Also Lightweaver / Ravenclaw here)
Reminds me of Harry Potter fans fecidng which Wood they want for their wand vd Mistborn fans deciding which metal their spikes should be.
Ravenclaw edgedancer here
Ravenclaw/ Willshaper👀
Edgedancer who likes snacks... So just an edge dancer I guess.
A Dustpuff over here.
I'm a Truthwatcher Ravenclaw. My husband is an Elsecaller Slytherin. I think that makes me a stereotypical nerd and him a stereotypical asshole.
Graduated from Ravenclaw to Elsecaller Academy.
Slytherin/ Truthwatcher.  But like 1% dif on elsecaller.
Hufflepu….au fuck
Last time I checked I was ravenclaw and lightweaver
Willshaper Hufflepuff! Let me be free!
Stoneward hufflepuff
Ravenclaw/Edgedancer
Joining the Edgedancer/Hufflepuff crew, lol.
Gryffindor and edgedancer/windrunner. It was tied haha
Official quiz gave me Windrunner at 73% and Edgedancer at 69%, which honestly really, really fits for me lmao
Skybreaker/Ravenclaw. Stay in school, follow the rules!
Ravenclaw and Truthwatcher, a see a pattern here...  mmmmmm delicious...
Hufflepuff lightweaver. Hogwarts houses be overrated rn tho ngl. I did love harry potter but now it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
I mean hogwarts houses were always lame but

Slytherin Lightweaver. Does that make me an assassin or something?
I'm a law Major so sky breaker
Slythering, Skybreaker :D
Willshaper Slytherin
Even better: Which house of Rnaghts Godant are youm
Hufflepuff Windrunner
As a chemist I can pretty confidently say I’m a Truthwatcher.
Gryffindor Lightweaver. Huh weird, I'm not \*that\* much of a troublemaker.
Ravenclaw + Truthwatcher... Ravenwatcher?
Willshaper, and been a bit but Ravenclaw if I remember right.
Hufflepuff/Edgedancer
Ravenclaw Windrunner.
Bondsmiths unite 💪
Lightweaver I have severe mental health problems
Ravenclaw / Elsecaller
Edgedancer Badger
Hufflepuff/dustbringer

Yeah I KNOW. I already know
Lightweaver or Dustbringer. A weird dilemma, I know.
Gryffindor/Truthwatcher here...im a sucker for those quiz/tests
Hufflepuff + Windrunner

Windpuff?
I had a perfect tie between Windrunner and Edgedancer when I took the test last.
Hufflepuff/Windrunner

An asshole
Halfway through WoR and I got Edgedancer. Don’t even know what that means yet, but reading what the website said and knowing that I get Hufflepuff everytime I take these types of quizzes… I’m assuming I’ve landed myself in Cosmere’s Hufflepuff?
I keep getting Windrunner but I don't think I'm that good of a person.

The irony isnt lost on me
Slytherin/Elsecaller
Ravenclaw/Skybreaker here.
Slytherin/ Willshaper or Elsecaller.

I've done the quiz several times and I either get Willshaper with Elsecaller second or the reverse.
Is that like some offbrand of the Rnaghts Godant?
I'm a Ravenclaw Windrunner. Lol I've done both.

Willshaper and Stoneward are close runnerups.
Truthwatcher gang
Ravenclaw Truthwatcher. I just really like to understand things.
Edgedancer, Bondsmiths, and Windrunners are consistently my top three results, and it's very close.
Hufflepuff - Truthwatcher

I feel like they could have similar values
Took it two times about a month apart, got Edgedancer both times.

Time to go open a soup kitchen or something.
I got Lightweaver, which I'm okay with. It's funny, though, because I've been trying to live my life by the Windrunner ideals before I ever even read the books.
Windrunner. 

(And Ravenclaw)
Elsecaller! What did Brandon end up with when he took it?
Windrunner forever
Lightweaver. Hands down. Lies and illusions, breaking through illusory self-perceptions, artistic skill, and travel between the planes. I love it. Plus my Spren would be a beautiful moving spirograph, and I love spirographs.
Elsecaller on the Quiz though I feel Lightweaver Fits me Best. (Elsecaller was 1% higher)

And Slitherin.
Elsecaller/Ravenclaw combo
Slytherin/truthwatcher 
im not really sure what this combo is but it feels... Wrong?
It's been a little while since I took the quiz but I had an even split between Windrunner and Edgedahufflepufim a hufflepuff for sure. Given that Kaladin and Lift are my favorite characters I couldn't be happier!
Hufflepuff/Windrunner
I think that tracks ! Even though the first guess for Windrunner would be Gryffondor. I think Hufflepuff fits better
Ravenclaw Lightweaver.
Why not both? Both series are great. I'm a slytherin and a windrunner.
Ravenclaw/Truthwatcher 

I like me some books.
Gryffindor Truthwatcher
Slytherin Truthwatcher
Ravenclaw/Elsecaller

Good grief I’m a walking stereotype, aren’t I?
Apparently I am a windrunner / willshaper. Never taken the hogwarts house quiz. 
I'm a windrunner and gryffindor.
I didn't even make it up, I took both the quizzes!  I'm literally the perfect character.
Where my Slytherin Stonewards at?
Ravenclaw Truthwatcher.

Yes I'm a very stereotypical geek.
Ravenclaw/Lightweaver
Willshaper. I’ve take the quiz a dozen times always trying to be as truthful as possible and it’s always Willshaper. I’m usually disappointed because I don’t really like Venli who seems to be the Willshaper representation.
I'm ravenclaw and truthwatcher
Truthwatcher
Slytherin/truthwatcher/elsecaller/lightweaver. I havrnt decided yet and all three are 1% apart. If i go off the highest its truthwatcher
Willshaper thru and thru #freedom #america 🦅🦅🦅🎆🎆🎆🎆🇺🇸🇺🇸
Oh and slytherin ig but hufflepuff works just as well
I’m a cliche Gryffindor/Windrunner 🙃
One thing I like about using Radiant Orders as a personality quiz is that “not a Radiant” is also an answer. Someone who is not capable of even the first ideal.
Windrunner. Every time I answer the quiz I get windrunner as my top and then edgedancer followed by truthwatcher which feels pretty on brand for me.

I used to get Gryffindor when I was younger but nowadays I'm firmly in the Ravenclaw camp.
Truthwatcher, which just barely edged out Windrunner, and Gryffindor(Sp?)

Truthwatcher feels right, despite me not being the most battle-specific Radiant Order.
Ravenclaw Willshaper seems to be an uncommon combo around here.
Edgedancer > Truthwatcher > Windrunner were all above 60%!
Ravenclaw Windrunner here 🫡 

I’m blue da ba dee
Hufflerunner
I’ve taken that quiz like 5 times now across the years. My top results are *always* Truthwatcher 77% and Elsecaller 76%. It’s a tough choice between the two of them, but I think I lean more Elsecaller. Though I have to admit that it may be because I like Jasnah so much. I love Renarin but I feel like I can only relate with his shyness. Well, that and, assuming the rumor is true, >!that he’s gay.!<
According to the recent official test, I am a Truthwatcher.
Hufflepuff / Elsecaller 

I’m not sure what that means
Definitely not a lightweaver
Hufflepuff Edgedancer
I got ~75% each Willshaper, Stonewarden, Windrunner. I'm exactly the personality type described under Willshaper, I believe personal agency is a fundamental human right at least. But fuck if the Stonewarden's focus on dependability doesn't resonate to the bone. I never chose to be reliable, I just love being there for people. But when shit hits the fan, I'm such a cliché Windrunner. I lie to myself all the time that I'm a survivor first, that I wouldn't risk my life to save just anyone. But every time danger happens near me, my body just moves and my brain runs scenarios and I'm Dealing With It. 

I definitely would enjoy being a Windrunner the most though. Fuck rocks and wormholes I wanna fly and walk on walls
Gryffindor/Edgedancer, my Texan ass is going to need to practice some ice skating.
I'm a Hufflepuff Edgedancer
I'm, like, 30% Edgedancer, 40% Lightweaver, and 40% Truthwatcher based on a whole "take the test 100 times and see what happens" thing I did.\
I also happen to be a Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw based on another experiment I did.


Screw it, I'm a nice, friendly bookworm that's able to lie
Sorry, I don't do astrology
Ravenclaw/elsecaller
I guess it makes sense
Hufflepuff windrunner...
With all my heart I believe this would actually be a thing if Brandon and JK swapped their times of writing their greatest books.
Windrunner & Gryffindor here✋️I thought I was just a basic bitch at first but then I realised that as long as I did the quizzes in earnest and I agree with the results, it doesn't matter what anyone else chose. I'll be me, even if it's cliché.

I do like red and blue tho. Which is fun, seeing as I am the son of a fireman and a fire performer myself.

My dream superpower is to fly.
ravenclaw windrunner; I took the house quiz a very long time ago, so that may be inaccurate
Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff, Windrunner/Elsecaller.
I'm an elsecaller, I even plan on tattoing it someday, but the sorting hat and houses are so much better.
Sky breaker who says Harry potty should only be read by people being tortured on Braise (audiobooks listener sorry for wrong spelling)
For the first time in my life I'm ashamed to be part off this fandom.
For the first time in my life I'm ashamed to be part of this fandom
Three Winderunners, two elsecallers, a skybreaker with two spren, and a large Peakspren. To go.
And I said more food, Hot Butt
Are you though
You're not evil, you're just *ambitious* and *willing to take risks*
That's what someone evil would say. 

But tbf, someone evil might also declare their evilness. 

Schrodinger's evil slytherin/dustbringer.
Slytherin Bondsmith. It’s quite the combo.
Edge so strong you cant even dance on it
Gryffindor Windrunner

I’d like to reaffirm that I AM evil though
Slytherins are not born evil, they are made evil by Hogwarts. The sorting hat is lie, the houses are always kinda equally sized. 
You try not become evil when you are put down in the wet and moldy dungeon and told you are not the smart, brave or caring ones…
Slytherin Lighweaver here. Apparently I’m just a lying prick lol
I would definitely steer clear of Nightblood.
Nah you are only half evil friend
Hufflepuff Lightweaver. Yup, I'm just a side-quest character ha
I never took it because I want to be a Lightweaver and I was afraid the quiz would give me a different result. But then I realized, that’s exactly what a Lightweaver would do. I still haven’t taken it but I felt vindicated upon that realization lol
Willshaper.

I'm ok with this one. I finally agree with an online quiz I got now.

**EDIT** I told my friend what I said and they responded "So what you're saying is you don't believe you you should be defined by what an online quiz says... That's pretty Willshaper" and now I feel like a stereotype.
Thanks 🙏
I got Willshaper & Lightweaver tied for the best match. Anybody ever bonded 2 spren?
Next time someone asks what my sign is: 

"Willshaper"
STONEWARD. I MUST FORTIFY THIS POSITION.
After playing around with sliders for a few minutes I got equal truth watcher and sky breaker. Checks out tbh.
...Bondsmith

I will unite them.

You could be like Sigzil! A scholarly Windrunner.

Windrunner and literally anything else but Gryffindor is automatically more interesting lol
I’m also a Windrunner, but, I’m more like a Teft style Windrunner. Not because i think it’s cool, more because I try every day to not hate myself.
I'm a Ravenclaw and flip back and forth between Windrunner and Elsecaller, so you're not alone. Those two orders are like 85-90% for me and flip depending on the day lol
I’m in the exact same boat. When I got Windrunner I took the test again making my answers more extreme this time and all it did was say I’m more Windrunner lol. I also got ravenclaw in the Pottermore quiz.
I'm solidly in Ravenclaw and when I took the Radiant quiz I did end up with Elsecaller, so I guess I'm kind of consistent. My next highest was actually Willshaper, which I can see in myself.
I also got Hufflepuff Edgedancer lol
Ravenclaw/Elsecaller

The cooler ✨intellectuals✨
Hey same, nice to see (although with how many Truthwatchers I always see in the main Stormlight subreddit this is probably not an uncommon combination)
Raven-puff Truthwatcher. Edgedancer was my #2.
Helga Hufflepuff would have been an Edgedancer.
Ravenclaw Truthwatcher here. Also Pathian.
🤝
Rocking that golden/yellow colour scheme
Bondsmith badger doesn't give a fuck!
Gryffindor / Elsecaller,   Gotta do it ALL and be the best.
Huh I would have thought Ravenclaw paired well with Elsecaller, but that’s probably because I’d be that.
Aha! I was wondering where my fellow Ravenclaw - Willshapers were!
Where did you take this quiz? :o
As a fellow Skybreaker, underrated answer for sure.

We have nice things because of law, order, structure, etc.

Could we do better with all this? Yes. But the answer is not blow it all up, that will make things worse in the short term, and maybe worse in the long term.
Totally agree - great quiz!
Lift is so much fun - I always enjoy when we get to see her POV!
Hey, I’m a Lightweaver/Ravenclaw too!
Same! I'm also a Lightweaver/Ravenclaw.
Same!
The wood was just based on your birthday / Celtic tree calendar
I think we may win for least amount of “screen”time
Heeey me too!!
You and Lift would either vibe or compete for snacks. It's a dangerous friendship. 
That's an interesting combo. We've got the power of friendship, hard work, snacks, and finding stuff, and then combine that with the virtues of Dustbringer, which I'm not too familiar with. Is it about taking things apart, deconstructing, and figuring stuff out in the rough and ready way?
Same - chaotic happy teacher.
had to scroll so far to find another Stoneward, nice that's there's some representation
Using knowledge to help the downtrodden. Nice.
Let's see if I can guess the popular pairings...



Ravenclaw- Truthwatcher, Elsecaller, 


Griffindor- Windrunner, Skybreaker, 


Hufflepuff- Stoneward, Edgedancer, 


Slytherin- Lightweaver, Dustbringer, 


I don't know how to place Bondsmith and Willshaper. What do Willshapers focus on?
I'm a Hufflepuff Lightweaver too apparently.
Me too. And we’re very happy about it.
Maybe you help Gryffindors find their potential. 
Truthclaw!
There are so few of us
It's not that weird actually.
I dunno. It kinda fits? Deconstruct someone, take inventory of their life, and build them back up using their true potential. I can see it.
He was either a Bondsmith or an Elsecaller, dependant on mood, both very much fit
How very Cedric like 😊
Tis but a joke
All you had to do was follow the damn Codes, DK!
Skybreaker machine broke. 
Would you like a Taln instead? 100% beef and never breaks.
The start of this felt like the start of a joke, like "Three Windrunners, two elsecallers and a skybreaker walk into a bar...."

Anyone with the creative chops to actually finish the joke?
Just... stay away from any talking swords.
The absolute lack of ANY redeeming qualities among the entire cast of Slytherin was a real miss opportunity in HP. Like, seriously, you aren't beating the "evil house" allegation when literally only a single Slytherin in the story (Slughorn) is not a complete reprobate (and even he's still casually racist).
I have Slytherin Windrunner.  Although I have Skybreaker only 5% away.
In case it makes you feel better Sanderson himself mentioned that if you disagree with the quiz results you’re probably more correct because you know yourself better than 20 questions lol. 

So if you think you are an order then you are.
It's pretty funny, i took it, got windrunner, and my friend refused to believe i got windrunner legitimately, so he took it and answered qyestion based on how he thought i would answer, and it was windrunner, then he tried to take it for me and answer in such a way that it wouldn't be a windrunner. Still got windrunner
Same
Yes but that's spoilers.
I got that too
I’d be pumped to be a Sigzil! Thanks for making my day!
Hufflepuff is literally described by the hat itself as the house that takes everyone who isn't interesting enough to be in the other 3 houses.
You’ve got this! And just like Teft, I’m sure there is more good to you that you are giving yourself credit for. Journey before destination and strength before weakness my friend!
We would be in the same squad 🫡
LOL - I may have retaken the quiz as well! 😂
Same exact thing for me! My husband is a gryffindor Windrunner and daughter is a hufflepuff lightweaver!
Ravenclaw Truthwatcher for me, although I do tend to get torn between Truthwatcher and Elsecaller.
Same!!
Truthpuffs unite!
Edgedancer was tied for my second too
Raven Truthwatcher assemble!! Though my second was Elsecaller
Unite or be badgered.
Absolutely.
Right here buddy
Raises hand
> https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/official-knights-radiant-order-quiz
Lift is such a strange character for me because I love seeing her from other’s POVs, but her own POV annoys me for like the first few pages until I re-acclimate to it.
Yup, that’s me to a T! A friendly tinkerer
I didn't see any and I had to represent.   As far as surges go, they aren't really what I would choose, but oaths, oh yeah. That's me.

I just got the glyph tattooed on my forearm a couple weeks ago.
Mmm i'm agree on most, but I feel conflicted about Skybreakers, idk i don't think they're particularly brave for Gryffindor. I can see Stoneward as Gryffindor though. 

Willshapers focus on freedom, could be Hufflepuff or Gryffindor. Bondsmith focus on connection, it's a tricky one, I think depending the spren they bond could be a different house. Stormfather could Slytherin because inside the radiant they held a position of leadership, the sibling could be Ravenclaw, though it could be Navani's influence on them, the nightwatcher currently is imposible to know
Skybreakers usually aren’t griffindor. Slytherin or Ravenclaw.
Unexpected donkey kong
Ok but it's going to be a Lightweaver joke. Here goes:
  
  
Three Windrunners, two Elsecallers and a Skybreaker walk into a bar. It was invisible.
But I would \*LOVE\* to destroy some Evil today.
This seemed more of a systemic issue than she ever made it out to be in the books. A whole magical society with one overtly propagandistic government-controlled news source; one school with its own concerning ties to elements within the government that want to brainwash children; one prison where they allow universally-feared creatures to feed on inmates's souls despite clear problems with their criminal trials and no sign that this treatment lowers recidivism rates; and a disdain for non-magical people buried just under the surface, waiting for one of the many openly xenophobic plutocrats to form an evil army and kick off a genocide.

Dolores Umbridge was a senior official at the ministry of magic who managed to form an entire anti-muggle government agency with almost no pushback. Most of those people weren't even death eaters; they were just regular wizards who were fine with committing atrocities. And those people didn't go away after Voldemort was defeated; they just went back to working in the government. The same happened in the Fantastic Beasts movies, when Grindelwald was defeated. All the wizards who were about to help him commit atrocities just kinda walk away and pretend nothing happened.

If anything, it's amazing only ~1/4 of their students end up in the "evil" house. With the terrible society they've been raised in, I would think that number would be higher.
The password to their dorm was PUREBLOOD, like…cmon bruh
Ahem...

Andromeda.
“Probably” is key though. There was that one guy in the WoR epigraphs that really wanted to be a Lightweaver but just wasn’t a fit for it.
Huh, I didn't get a perfect tie, but I also scored high on both. I wonder if there's correlations between certain orders? Like, if you score high with one, you're likely to also score high on another specific one.
I don't know how far you've read, but I sure wouldn't.
Same, elsecaller was my second highest behind truthwatcher and I've always been a ravenclaw
There are dozens of us. 😁
Isn’t uniting more of a Bondsmith’s thing?
https://preview.redd.it/ngvchrifjq1e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04d4c8a1370a9d9cbed2107cd41eb5bac8fe4480

Thank you! This was cool!
Ah! It's the "let's take a look under the hood" mindset.
Yeah, most orders can line up with 2+ houses. Heck, I found a Hufflepuff Dustbringer in this comment section.
Sir, this is a chouta stand

Edit: forgot which fandom I was currently in.
Recidivism is somewhat irrelevant, I don't think anyone actually gets let out of wizard prison. They either escape or they just die eventually.
I suppose that’s a way to look at it. But I think if anyone actually sits down and does some self reflection they’ll be more accurate than anything else.  

Also in fun spirit, it’s fun to just pick. Though it would be fun to have a psychologist actually analyze me and tell me which order they think I belong too
Wait, which epigraph?
[removed]
What an odd combination haha
Seems like cross polinating your fandoms is contagious, gancho.
Penhito, the only acceptable use of chouta in a sentence is to praise it!
Heavy on the escape. That place is like Arkham Asylum.

But also "tortured until you die" being the only punishment available for every crime seems like the hallmark of an evil society.
Chapter 12

> Malchin was stymied, for though he was inferior to none in the arts of war, he was not suitable for the Lightweavers; he wished for his oaths to be elementary and straightforward, and yet their spren were liberal, as to our comprehension, in definitions pertaining to this matter; the process included speaking truths as an approach to a threshold of self-awareness that Malchin could never attain.
