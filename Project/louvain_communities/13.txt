Blake Lively shares new picture with Taylor from Beyoncé’s Renaissance premiere in London with a funny caption
They look so gorgeous 🥹
it's okay taylor & beyonce you'll make it too someday<3
[removed]
Kinda amazing that Taylor takes a pic with the fictional Gossip Girl, only to get in a fight with the real life Gossip Girl a few hours later.
the caption.. yup that's definitely ryan reynolds' wife lol
I love this friendship; Taylor’s made clear that Blake and Ryan are two of her closest friends and have stood by her throughout the years. I’m so glad she has people who can not only understand what she’s going through re: fame but also stand by her and be sources of comfort and trust ❤️

Also, my god, they’re so beautiful!!!
I like that it’s heartfelt and silly at the same time
This feels like a reclaiming of the 1989 Tay who got poked at for having a girl group of friends. Love that for them!
One of the comments :

Spotted

Serene Van Der Woodson and Taylor Swift at Queen Beyoncé’s party. Uh oh B. Looks like S has a new bff. 

Xoxo,

Gossip Girl
Oh my god did Blake Lively just put Taylor Swift and Beyoncé on the map????😳😳😳 That's so generous of her! 😍🤗🤗🤗 #queenbehavior #picksupcrownyoudroppedthis #LivelyLover #ImatotalBlakeynoshame #newalbumwhen??
Petition for Ryan and Travis to recreate this picture. It'll break the internet if they do it.
Never really occurred to me just how long Taylor’s fingers are until this photo for whatever reason
Blake saying the quiet part out loud. Beyoncé and Taylor showing up at each other’s premieres is a masterpiece of PR - more hype for each of them, and a way to focus the conversation on something other than pitting them against each other
They are both insanely beautiful and I want to be like them when I grow up! 🤩
Awww, I actually liked this one more than the previous. Such a sweet photo and message. Blake has always been funny, looking forward to her response if R&T accept the challenge to recreate.
I love this! They both look stunning.
Lol her caption. I love Blake so much 🤣
🥵🥵🥵
Blake and Ryan are so funny lol
So gorgeous! Hair envy for both of them 😍
>> “neither of you have to be threatened by my pop stardom. There’s room for us all.”

I wasn’t expecting that at all. I love her sense of humour.
I'm sorry, but all I can think is " yup. I'm definitely bi."
Aww this is so cute! I love you we have a sweet picture along with Taylor's sexy one.
Beautiful
Real queens fix each other’s crowns.
Too much 🔥 for one pic.
Lmaooooo this is actually very funny 🤣
Ah.. to be Blake’s left hand in this photo
She has always been very funny
Beautiful positive and funny message from & for such lovely people…🫶✨

As a follow up, here’s Ryan’s IG story 😂 read the caption
This is some shit I would say 😂
This gives « I got you babe » vibes
2 beautiful strong women! Hurray!
Preach 🫶💜
I was getting a little eye roll-y and then, bam 😂😂😂😂😂
LOOOOL I love her for this.
Lol I love her haha
Welcoming this era of women supporting women!
Omg, loveeeee
Gorgeous!
I cleaned this one up and cropped it tighter.

Ryan Reynolds millennial ass humor
>All this to say

Anybody else expecting something… different?
She got any friends that aren't practically supermodels? It's cool but I'm just seeing hot girls that only hang with hot girls.
No shade, but Taylor’s new teeth make her a little unrecognizable in the pic…
I don't get the joke...
hilarious
💞💞💞🌺🌺😘😘😘🔥🔥🍷🍷🍑🍑🌹🌹🎇🌠🏆🏆🍰🍷🍷😋🫦👄💋💋
All I see is Glenn Close.
That’s what happens when you have Ryan Reynolds as your husband.
I smelled the gaylors coming-
I especially appreciate this caption because I remember a long time ago Blake was quoted as saying some unnecessarily mean things about Paris Hilton. It was something like "stop comparing me to her. I don't drink and party and I DON'T like sex tapes." Whatever your feelings are on Paris Hilton, I think we can all agree those comments from Blake weren't necessary. I'm glad Blake can share that she was brought up to believe she was in competition with all of them and she wants to show younger generations it doesn't have to be that way.
Deadpool in for a 2 piece
Why aren't they in prison yet? Scary such dangerous people can walk free just because they're rich.
Welcome to the stage, Blake “wedding at a slave plantation” Lively 🥰🥰🥰
She got some big ass hands
Yah. It's called being a bro. Men have known about this for a millennium
Both are like 6.5/10 on a good day.
Beyoncé... 

Taylor...

Blake... 

Icons.
This is so good 😂😂
This is why she & reynolds are still together lmao
this is the funniest shit in the tay universe lol
Where is Ryan? 😁🙃❤️
lol of course Beyonce and Taylor Swift are not threatened by Blake Lively’s pop stardom.  Why would they be?
Wow they are really close
I love Blake and Ryan, if their kids inherit the humor, I hope I’m around for it.
They do.  So beautiful and their friendship is so awesome and adorable
I feel like they’re about to blow up!
Who's Taylor Swift anyways?
Queen Serena taking in her flock as always 

For real though since like 2008 I’ve wanted to be these three women (and like honestly Beyoncé since 1999) lololol. This is my god damn Roman Empire / the last great American dynasty
I adore her.  I've liked her since Gossip Girl.  I remember an old interview with like Colbert or someone where she said her best Saturday would be staying at home playing Guitar Hero and that's my people 😂
….my drug is my Blakey I’ll be using for the rest of my liiiifeeeeee WOOOooooOooooahhhhHhhhHhhHhh
LOL omg
I keep forgetting blake lively isn't famous for just being awesome lol
I'm so stupid, because I thought somehow Taylor Swift and Kristen Bell had gotten in a fight. 

Honestly, let's not call Deuxmoi "the real life Gossip Girl". She would love that. At best, she's the real life creepy teacher from the reboot.
Get in a fight? I'm sorry I think I'm out of the loop
Dan was Gossip Girl 🙃
Insane
Serena wasn’t gossip girl
We call that a full circle 😂
Well, to be fair, Blake wasn't Gossip Girl, but their friendship is still really cool
Best thing to come out of Green Lantern.
I have the flu and serious brain fog right now so I read the last sentence ten times trying figure out what Blake was saying and not getting it was a joke. Thank you for making it more clear for me in my time of need. 😭😂
Interviews where he talks about her are always so positive. They give each other crap but he talks about how funny she is and how happy they are.
My immediate thought 😂
I was about to Say 😂 Reynolds coded
Yup. The same wife he married at a slave plantation 😍
Yes I was surprised to hear they were like the first people to hear when she has new music!
Their friendship seems so warm, like the kind of comfy and loving hug-making friendship you sometimes have with someone.
when/how did her and blake become friends?
Also rewriting the narrative of the events that snowballed into the whole Reputation era. What kayne did that night was a physical representation of what society does to women, when he pitted Beyoncé against Taylor over that award
I will never not read this in Kristen Bell’s voice
With Ryan with a pained look on his face cause he’s got the big yeti on his lap lol
Ryan just posted an edit with the faces swapped for him and Travis on his IG story.
This is all I want now
Well, do I have some news for you...
https://preview.redd.it/7uq6fz47g64c1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=769d6dbdf548328bd4005bb801892763e5f7bea0
I think the angle makes them look a bit longer but they're basically her legs in hand form
As a fellow alien finger girly (tho not nearly as tall as Taylor), I appreciate the representation lol 👽✨
[deleted]
piano fingers :)
lol the fact you made me go check mine!
Perfect for guitar playing!
Damn bro look at those boogerhooks
they both spend a lot of money on being beautiful... particularly in this picture.  They didn't do their own makeup!
You know they will!
Love her to bits hahah
I’m very straight but these two together? 🥵🥵🥵
Same though.
Basically me since seeing vigilante shit.
Most people in the entertainment industry are practically supermodels
She said that Beyoncé and Taylor, the queens of music, don’t have to worry about Blake’s (fake) pop career.
"Neither of you need to feel threatened by my pop stardom"
pls look up the word “joke” in the dictionary, it will be helpful here
Blake’s going to put them on the map!
As up-and-coming as Tribeca.
ikr ew
An up and coming country singer.
Jason  Kelce's brother's girlfriend, or so I've heard.
sad that she had to name drop queen blake's kids to hype up her songs but we stan a generous queen!
Love that reference lol
Honestly, Beyonce since 1997 when I saw her swinging on that swing in the "No, No, No" video, lmao.
[deleted]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy!
Same 

I didn't watch gossip girl and first saw her in simple favor bc I was looking for Anna Kendrick movies
Omg I literally knew Blake before teardrops even came out. Sisterhood of the traveling pants!!!
SAME HAHAHA
The drama with DeuxMoi - Tree responded to the account that the statements that Taylor and Joe had a marriage ceremony were untrue.
Her publicist (?) Called out DeuxMoi for posting bs blinds about Taylor being married to Joe Alwen and one of her songs hinting at her having a miscarriage.
Search tree Paine deux moi in the sub and you’ll see everythiiiiiiing
Deuxmoi
I realized that in hindsight, but decided not to edit in a spoiler.
Eh she was at some point lol
I did not know they met on The Green Lantern. That was an absolute turkey!
[removed]
What, you didn't like the train?
I'll consider it a win.
True. I think the fandom was surprised when she said that during folklore because people knew they were friends but didn’t know they’re this close.
They were both in Australia at the same time. Taylor for touring during 1989 and Blake for filming a movie I believe. They hung out then and became friends.
I did not know that was Kristen Bell 😭
This cracked me up, thanks!
Same. I should have played the piano with my long ass fingers lol
I suppose it’s less noticeable when her fingers are curled in some way
*Anchors
And?
REAL I always think that if I didn’t already know I was bi, that choreography would’ve been my awakening.
Oh, LOL...I missed that the first time. I got woken up by gunfire earlier and I'm still kinda groggy 😂
[deleted]
i wrote “lol” didn’t I?
Love a housewives reference. Worlds collide
No I think her name is Becky
That was a decade ago and they’ve since apologized for it. What more you want?
DONT BLAME ME DONT BLAME ME FOR WHAT YOU MADE ME DO 🐍
This thread has taught me that more people need to watch Age of Adaline.
She was so good in that and the just hasn't done much since.
Sister hood of the traveling pants checking in
Yes! She was a standout star in the Sisterhood movies!
3rd grade me was crushing hard on her in Accepted
Not me thinking you meant Kristen Bell
Didn't know about it, thanks
Eh it finished over ten years ago
Hahaha it’s the funniest thing about that movie too because it wasn’t a good movie
Blake is SMOKIN HOT in GL. Yikes.
comparing how you look ot how they look in glamour photos is not necessarily a good idea.
omg stay safe bestie
Gunfire!!???
I hope you didn’t hurt yourself reaching for this absolutely deranged take 😂
Not Ashley?
Its on my watch list, but I think I need to be in the mood for it tbh cause it seems like it has the potential to be an emotional movie?
Seconded to that. That’s how I discovered Blake and has been crushing on her beauty ever since
[deleted]
Wow I am very old lol
Same💀😅

(Edit: so much so that I was about to google Taylor Swift and Kristen Bell drama lol)
Not me thinking they meant Penn Badgley
\+1
DM also posted speculation that Taylor had a secret miscarriage and that's why she and Joe broke up, which is frankly a disgusting thing to speculate about. I suspect that was the thing Tree and Taylor really took offense to.
DAN?!? (I have never seen the show)
I think it took Ryan Reynolds like 8 years to watch Green Lantern himself because it was that bad. 

And when he finally did, he told everyone he was going to watch it and was going to tweet about how bad it really was in real time. Lol
It’s hilarious how both the movie and the rollercoaster that came out around the same time both sucked
The reactions to that photo range from hilarious (wanting Travis and Ryan Reynolds to re-create it) to very weird indeed (suggesting Taylor and mother-of-four Blake are dating).
Putting other women down on a post about women empowerment is not a good look.
[deleted]
It wasn't aimed at my apartment, clearly, LOL
Yeah, welcome to Texas on a Friday night 😂
Jessica’s sister? Oh yea. She’s got the new artist Grammy in the bag.
No it’s Becky
Yeah, being in the mood for it and liking that genre of film would both make for a better experience.

And while it is emotional, I wouldn't say it's heavy.
Hasn't stopped Ryan
.... you seriously think tom cruise is jumping off planes and riding motorcycles off cliffs for mission impossible 24 because he needs the money?
DM also said it was suspicious that Tree used the phrase 'pain and trauma' when that was in the past and illuded to Ana's death in Brasil being too current to use to words. Also created a blind accusing Jason Kelce of cheating on his wife with ig models during away games. Both of which are wtf levels of fuckery.
That was my suspicion too, but they used the screenshot of the first post so as not to call attention to/amplify speculation about the more horrifying one

DM has something missing inside to talk about people the way she does I swear
Same. DM and the media has speculated before about the ceremony and that didn’t pissed Tree but I think she crossed the line with the miscarriage thing and that pissed Taylor to react and maybe something also happened behind the scenes that made Taylor pissed to Joe again (if the blind about him dating has truth in any semblance).
Lmao yeah it made approximately 0 sense
Ryan just did it in his ig stories! Lmao I can imagine him swapping Taylor's and Blake's faces by his and Travis' in some Photoworks only to create more chaos!
i'm not putting them down!  they look great!  but comparing yourself to how people glamour photos is not healthy... enjoy the photos, but don't worry about being that beautiful.
How do you know that a normal person isn’t going to look the same as a rich celebrity with a team of professionals to do their hair and makeup and tens of thousands of dollars of jewelry and clothing photographed professionally? C’mon….
Wow...that's nuts but I'm so glad you're safe! 😁
Glad you are safe! Hope no one got hurt, scary stuff!
One of my favorite movies, if not the most favorite! Never get tired of re-watching it! Can you recommend similar movies (genre, mood, esthetic like elegant romance with some drama/spice)? If it won't trouble you too much....
[deleted]
I have seen it. My eyes! My eyes!
Thanks 😃
Thanks, I'm good. It was actually kinda funny because there were a couple people blasting music in the parking lot, but they cut that shit off quick 😂
Sure, I love movies. Here's a list that came to mind:

---

The Age of Innocence

In the Mood for Love (if you don't mind subtitles)

Meet Joe Black

Pride and Prejudice (2005)

The English Patient

Closer

The Notebook

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button

---

Before Sunrise (and its sequels, Before Sunset and Before Midnight)

Phantom Thread

Shakespeare in Love

Blue is the Warmest Color (FxF romance, some people might find the sex scenes a bit much)

Titanic

Blue Valentine (not elegant; more raw and depressing tbh, but one of the best romances I've seen)

Casablanca

Four Weddings and a Funeral

---

Arrival (sci-fi movie, but there is a bit of romance and Amy Adams' character reminds me of Adaline for some reason)

My Sassy Girl (Korean version with subtitles, more of a rom/com but with a hint of fantasy)

About Time (similar to My Sassy Girl, a bit of a rom/com but the fantasy element is more prevalent)

---


The first group has ones that I think are perfect for someone that likes Age of Adaline. The next ones are others that came to mind in case you get through the first ones or have seen them already. The last 3 I don't think fit *too* well, but I like them and they came to mind, so why not.

And if you're looking for a series, Outlander and Bridgerton come to mind.

> If it won't trouble you too much....

One of my favorite genres; it was fun thinking about it!
actors don't just make movies because they want money... many have more than they'll ever need already... they do it because they are actors... that's their art. 

saying an actor doesn't need to make movies is asinine. 

you said that. 

that's how it connected.
The image is burned into my brain fr
Thank you very much! Out of these I watched: Meet Joe Black, The Notebook, Titanic, Four weddings and a funeral and Benj. Button (not in full). So the rest I saved and will check out. Thanks❣️
[deleted]
lmao!!!!!

fucking hilarious
I bet whoever invited Hopsin to this party regretted it
"You'll love Marcus, he's super chill."
absolutely terrorizing the hoes
Underrated post 🤣
This actually the funniest shit I seen all morning
"Man I hate rap"
good skateboarder too. got to meet him at my local park. nice dude
Regardless of how corny his lyrical content and persona is, always found him to be a seriously talented rapper
Lmao imagine just chilling at a party and this dude starts spitting at you “you don’t even deserve a brain gimme it” and smacks your face.
What happened?
Pleaaaase don’t invite Hopsin again bro. Remember what he said to the hoes last time? “You’re cock thirsty. You’re nasty and probably got herpes”
"You dont draw, you dont play ball, you literally do nothing at all!"
Man when I was like 13 I thought hopsin was like the dopest shit 

I mean some respect to him, he gave me some stuff I enjoyed at a time in my life and he’s talented to a degree, but I don’t think I could listen to an ill mind these days from start to finish
Yeah they weren’t trying to hear any of that 😂
This was the last good ones from I'll mind series
I'll admit it, I think he has some solid songs, and he has some songs that are just hilariously bad. His kinda recent song Your House was a pretty good song about domestic violence...but then he has shit like that song about asian massage parlors -_-.

Some of his older stuff is also solid, technically speaking he does know what he is doing...he just doesn't stick the landing many times.

He needs like a dude next to him that says "nah don't do that"...not a yes man, a No man.
He was a Hella Buzzzzz Killington at that party
AND WHEN THEY LEAVE YOU, YOU JUST CRY AND CRY
He probably was an unexpected plus one
Was it a party? or smoking pot, playing magic the gathering and watching a 25 year old 13”?
😆 well done 👏
LMAO
told em to keep their pots and pans in the kitchen
amazing track.
Bro makes music that’s deep when ur 11
Lmao. What the hell is he even doing these days after that dumpster fire that was FV. Atleast Jarren moved on to jiggas label. Benton much better now that he’s not that same gimmick anymore
IMO Hopsin is a top 5 rapper of our generation. If he drops another banger album he could end up with GOAT status. I feel like jcole and Kendrick need to humbly ask hopsin for some features so they can catch up
FUCK YO COUCH!
I fuckin cackled
Used to love ill mind of hopsin, banger songs man
Or it changed their life forever, for the better 🥲
I bet anyone who ever invited hopsin to a party regretted it
“Why do black people gotta be the only ones who can’t evolve”

Weird take
I’m here, so open up the door for me
I mean I liked the song……. But I also wouldn’t have been at the party.
the first white black rapper before logic
My hopsin phase was crazy when i was 13, i still listen to his raw album occasionally but thats about it
Great. He’s an hour into telling us how twisted he is and the weed is wearing off.
I never liked Hopsin. And I definitely hate that song.
Hop is so cringe to me
Its crazy this man has a fanbase
Yeah probably cuz his music is trash and he's corny as hell
Hopsin goofy as fuck. I’d spit on him if given the opportunity.
Is this a game ?
This some quality content
Lmao
🤣🤣🤣
I NEED that beavis and butthead tapestry. Where do you get one?
But I thought he had no time for fun
This shit is funny asf
I swear.
Lmao I used to love this song
This album goes hard though
I used to love this guy as a teen.
Best scaring the hoes rapper moment ever-

Cudi was hanging out with Selena doing a livestream and he all of a sudden starts talking about some guy who got killed by police 

Selena just goes “oh…I…I don’t like that…”

Fuckin Cudi lmao
This made me crack up hard
But if the shoe fits wear it
Saying "fuck school" and dropping out like a miscarriage
Dude is, or at least was really good at skating. I remember watching him play S.K.A.T.E with kids while on tour and beating everyone there.
Nollie tre flippin on the block, straight cruisin
One of the cleanest switch hard flips I've ever seen.
He definitely has the technical ability, it’s just always been up to the quality of his writing
I know I’m the only one but I don’t mind him or his lyrics. I know they come off heavy handed but I’m a fan of anyone speaking counter culture espcially in my hip hop for obvious reasons.  Even if I dont fully agree  I just like anything fresh and not chasing trends with bonus points that make me ask questions. 

This is my OPINION, I know the downvotes are coming but I’m not trying to sell anyone on hopsin. He’s not on my top ten or anything like that, I just don’t hate him like most of reddit.


Edit: I will critique his hooks tho. Dude might do better if he had someone on his inner circle that could help direct him on a better approach then what he’s laying down. But even that I relate back when I’d write bars the hook always got me.
So many talented guys over the years can write some bars, I mean Jada and canibus, some of those old rhythm slayers cats the list goes on…
Writing good lines and listenable songs are a major part of being talented as a rapper.
Hopsin is "corny" but isn't the outrage he caused the essence of hip-hop?
He probably goes to party and tries to spread Christianity then breaks down and becomes an atheist halfway through the party and then leaves the party a Muslim only to text you from church the next morning
In 2023 since everyone is so trigger happy, Hopsin would have probably got shot in the head.
The song is Ill Mind of Hopsin 5


He basically just lays into everyone whose whole life revolves around partying. The music video is at a party with all these people
He's not wrong though
I liked 7 but it probably could have been a stand alone.
8 is the goat
8 trumps all of them imo
I wonder to who though? He seemed to genuinely hate everyone in that room despite still going to the party lol.
I was really impressed by Ill Mind 5 when I was a 15 year old who couldn’t get laid and only listened to maybe 3 other rappers. I think that’s the target audience for Hopsin
True and real
He seems to be partially retired these days. He'll drop a single every 2-3 months for an extra cash injection into his bank account and then goes back to travelling and enjoying life.
I think the reason he doesn't get too many features is because he started by dissing just about everyone. Would love to see it though. Hopsin was part of my introduction to rap and I got lots of love for the stuff he's been putting out from time to time
If what he said in a lot of his songs is true he didnt go to many parties
Ok
So is Jay Z but plenty of people still buy his garbage "music." 🤷🏼‍♀️
Spencer’s ?
One of my favourite comedy podcasts coined the term “kid Cudi-ing” for when they derail the podcast with a serious or dark topic.

ie “Not to Kid Cudi the podcast but my doctor texted me saying I might be going blind due to liquid build up in my eye”
For millennials+ that's Selena Gomez not Selena Quintanilla who went by the mononym "Selena." Kid Cudi isn't old enough to have been hanging with Selena but the name on its own only looks like one person to anyone over 30.
I’ve become a freak of nature all the kids stare at.
and if it doesn't then y'all will swallow the truth grin and bare it
I'm embarrassed
If only his ego let him work other producers and had singers sing his hooks.
To add to your point - It’s tough to create art when your strength as an artist is in the realm of the technical.
8 is my favorite.
Ill mind 5 is the first track of Hopsin's I'd ever heard. I was hooked from that point and went back and listen to us earlier stuff.

That said, I'm "Team 7" as well.
don’t forget 4
Probably the black dude. He came at him last, that dude was his ride hoke but Hopsin couldn't help himself
Truth hurts lol.
okay
Honestly can't hate, shit sounds like a nice life.
Holy shit kid forreal compared hopsin to hov....

If u don't getcho goofy ass tf outa here
Wait a minute - Spencer's is still around? Or, did I just wake up in 1985?
Lmao did they create that term specifically from that video or just in general?
Telling somebody they're going blind via reading format would be fucked up lol.
which podcast?
Timeliness are way too far apart for Cudi to be throwing Selena off game.
Millennials are ppl born from '81 to '96. I ain't met another one that wasn't aware of both. 

Plus, it's 2023. We got access to more shit now than ever. Guessing knowledge based on age is void at this point
I am 27 and thought that lol but like you said . Majority of people my age and under have no idea Selena Selena ever existed
Even though I knew it had to be Selena Gomez, I kept thinking of Selena of the 90's.  I'm 41 and Hispanic. I'm glad you brought this up.
Who walk around bumping RAW with the shit blaring
& i’m ashamed i’ve played a part in this devilish game
[deleted]
That’s gotta be the main reason so many good artists aren’t great.  Their ego is getting in their way.
It has nothing to do with ego.  He just wants to keep his music completely self produced.  Any nothing wrong with that.
That'd be an awkward car ride back.

"......"

"......"

"......"

"Hey bro I know I tore apart your entire lifestyle but we're cool right? Also can we hit up the Sonic drive through"
Cool
Right wish I could be really good at work for a day. Then just bounce lol
They are still around
Yeah from that video haha
TMG - Cody Ko and Noel Miller
I said that but nobody over thirty sees "Selena" alone and thinks of anyone else.
All the latinas do
Fr? I think she been gaining popularity among our generation recently, I been seeing hella Selena shirts
Making your common sense perish
STFU and enjoy the moment bro
That was almost Wutang up to a point in the earlier years, Rza wanted it to be all I the family but as time went on he had to start letting other producers produce music for the crew on singles and even whole albums and do guest collabs (Mary j, Mariah Carey, etc) and it took them all to a whole new level of success. It made them more mainstream and gain wider audiences.

You gotta be great at what you do to be super successfully, but you gotta let go a little bit to work with other great people if you want to become iconic. It’s all about expanding into new bigger audiences and tapping into other sounds, it sets you apart.
Nice
That’s hilarious what pod
Yeen wrong. I'm 32 and it took a second but I was like "ooo the Disney one"
What? I'm 40 and know the difference.
RIP Selena 💕
They're $7 at Walmart.
but i aint takin the full blame cus most of you chubs runnin around here aint ever had strict parents
[removed]
TMG - Cody Ko and Noel Miller’s podcast
And at 32, guess what that makes you? A millennial.  Which means selena gomez was suppose to come in mind apparently lol
Y'all arrogant af thinking you speak for everyone. I shared a clarification *for people who need it.* If you don't, good for you. This is why I muted this sub.
Oh. Damn.

Fair enough. Weirdos on social media think they have carte blanche to say whatever and just shit on people even for positive things, so trolling them back like this is fair game.

wtf I’m in love with Osimhen now
Actually hilarious response
I was expecting just a noose but this is better lmao.
Damn, if he’s posting shit like this he’s probably on Reddit too…
WTF, lmaoo, this is top tier shitposting 🤣. I hope he doesn't get in trouble for this, considering  who he is
Lmao. I approve this.

Idiots on twitter should be put down a notch.
2012 internet is back baby, I’m here for it
I love him
LOOOOOOOOOOOL get rekt m8
Unhinged but funny as fuck.
Pro players being dumb frogposters smh
Game's back
He used to post a lot of memes on his IG story before he moved to Napoli (or after his first season I think?) so this isn't surprising 😭
Lmao perfect response
Lmao that's actually hilarious
I completely understand
I don't get it. Can someone please explain?
Too good 😂

HOLY

Can someone explain?

Imagine being that Twitter rando and getting a notification for Victor Osimhen telling you to Game End yourself. I wouldn't know how to react.
kinda weird to get mad at the coconut video then post stuff like this.
SIGN HIM 'TETA what a mad lad   


(but actually, wtf???? lmao)
Bro what 💀💀💀
incredible
Napoli's social media team vindicated, this is just everyday normality in the club
Aint no fuckin way a top professional footballer just told a random twitter user to kill themselves.
I’m old. What does this mean?
No fucking way this is real 😭💀

Edit: I just checked on twitter, holy shit it’s real 💀
Based Victor
Incredible jerk oshimen. Bravo
Incredibly based
Someone forgot to switch to their burner account
Napoli admin has been giving him meme lessons
I don't have any proof, but I can with full confidence say that osimhen is a 4chan user.
kids a true poster respect
Based asf
cooked his ass
Holy based
Imagine if Messi did it to Ronaldo fans who go berserk with conspiracy theories whenever he wins a trophy or an award ... That would break the internet 😂
Lmao
Hide this from americans, they'll accuse him for being a neo nazi
At least we know that if he comes to Chelsea and does the typical Chelsea striker thing, he can handle the haters well.
The game:

Gone ❌

Not gone ✅
Fuck that’s funny
Insanely based

Aaaaahh.... 😂😂... Take me back to 2012 when shit posting was an occurrence...
The result of letting Victor cook
lmao man just pepe'd him, hope he doesn't get in trouble, we need more pro player shitposters
Osimhen definitely posts on r/soccercirclejerk
To be honest, love the shitpost lol
Fucking amazing hahaha
That is hilarious
Based
Nigerians posting pepe shitposts always gets me cracking up. I love it lmfao
Lmao
Lmao after being a crybaby over a stupid Tiktok I didn't expect him to do social media.
game is back
Someone cooked here…
GAME'S SO BACK
He'll probably get in trouble, but as has been said, more people should respond like this, makes things more interesting.
Oh fuck, I like him even more
i mean it‘s funny but the fact he was upset about tiktoks a couple of months ago makes him look like a bitch tbh
This is the funniest shit I've seen all week. Had to do a double check just to see if it was real because this is SENDING me. Games back.
I think I'm too old for this sub because I don't find this funny at all. He's supposed to be a role model, not an edgy teen on 4chan.
Lmao that's actually funny af
Thats hilarious
He's a terminally-online r*tard just like us
Boehly will send him a blank check. 

Although he probably would have done that anyway
Do you guys think he had that saved on his phone the whole time?
Cooked
Let him cook
Victor Osimhen aka John Ruth the hangman
Game is so back
Games back
I hope Arteta signs him.
Based Osimhen
Weirdest part is that the person who commented wasn’t even being an asshole, just didn’t agree with osimhen.
This is football ‘eritage
Fucking based
Chad move
I guess people can tell footballers the same thing now? As long as it’s not racist this sub will find it funny.
Holy based
games not gone
Game’s not gone lads
I just wanna see if I'm wrong; My interpretation was that he was saying the comments like that make him so sad he wants to hang himself.

Every single comment here seems to indicate he was telling the user to kill themselves. I don't know which idea I find funnier.
Get him to Arsenal, online fans would have meltdowns every week😭😭
Lmao cope
💀💀 Osimhen is savage
Osimhen's inner jerker finally came out
Wtf is wrong with him?
Bro got Pepe the Frog'd
S tier shitposting
Football banter  is back baby
Cannot stay composed because I laugh at this, manage to stop, remember it and lose control. He used a Pepe. No text just Pepe. Never seen that Pepe before. In tears.
Ngl I did not find this funny one bit, that’s probably a teenager replying, not that telling grown people to kill themselves is ok but there gotta be a better response than that man.
Chan’s back
When the Pepeshimen (as in Pepe aka the frog from the noose image + Oshimen) fights back against other opinions lol.

Dude is crayz lol
This is crazy for a pro athlete 😂😂😂

That’s right
If Maguire replied like to this to some people that were extremely harsh on him I would've understand. Some people think they can say anything with no consequences.
He's got a new fan.
Now this is a proper response. 🤣
Fucking pepe
Haha nice
😭😭😭
no way
Bro not Pepe lmao
I thought this was a shit post by some random fan account or just something r/soccercirclejerk made up.
More like Victor Basedmhen

We need more Victors like him
Haha that is awesome
He literally told him to ropemaxx
He about to get suspended
Except hakimi didn't carry Morocco alone. Ounahi had a huge part in it as well for example. The whole team played well.
This man is a fucking legend.
My striker
The famous WC simi finals.
He's unhinged!

Someone elidumb it for me please.
But if someone makes him a coconut he starts to cry like a little bit*** . Footballers are the biggests snowflakes.
That’s a bit… out of pocket
Boehly, this man right here
a pepe no less, man with taste
Based and i'm a Hakimi fan
He probably have more than 1500+ Pepe the Frog meme collection on his phone
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
he definitely has some rare pepes
The game’s not gone.
I genuinely have tears in my eyes. this is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.
nigerians are A+ shitposters hes not even the biggest shitposter named Victor from the country. Victor Boniface will score a brace than roast your team in pidgin on twitter.
Man probably has a hard drive stacked with rare Pepes
Rooney could never
A celebrity telling someone to kill themselfs using Pepe the Frog on Twitter... I thought this was something of the past HAHAHA
I hope he doesn’t get in trouble for this because it’s fucking hilarious
I remember when my telegram stickers were just variations of pepe. Suicidal pepe, kys pepe, pervy pepe, horny pepe, raging pepe, the lot lol.
Web's not gone
Pepe is a 2016 thing. 2012 had troll face etc
Based af
People are getting overly excited over this for some reason. If we ever needed proof that this sub is full of children (and adults with the mind of a child who are stuck in 2012 or whatever year they think is the "proper" year) this thread is it. 

All these "lmao" and "lol shitposting" and "based" comments are real cringe. 

But of course, when you're the target then it's not shitposting anymore. Shitposting is only cool when you can laugh from the outside so just imagine I there's a Pepe with a noose in my comment then you'll love it!
/b/ictor Osimhen
I wonder if he even goes to /b/
Average /sp/ lurker.
Homie is def on r/greentext lol. Telling a random person on twitter to kill themselves is wild even for just a normal person.
Im here for it. Let me see some personality not all these media trained robots afraid to ruffle some feathers.
can i get context
Football is back, baby
I fucking love this guy
This is why MMA content is clear of any other sport

Imagine a top level footballer doing a press conference like Sean Strickland lmao
This sub constantly calls for punishments, assault charges, season-long bans and reds for dissent. You really think they’d be able to handle this?
[best i could do](https://ibb.co/HzS7Sqv)
you should hang yourself... NOW!!
[He couldn't care less.](https://x.com/victorosimhen9/status/1736507795933958228?s=20)
im an even bigger fan now goddamn
There’s a non-zero chance that Osimhen has a collection of rare Pepes on his phone
I've always found it funny that the footballer Pepe looks like the meme Pepe
I don’t think the guy he was responding to was particularly rude or unkind though, it was a pretty tame tweet
I remember the stock photo memes of the guy in various noose poses. It's borderline renaissance art.

Sorry if it triggers anyone my humor is *bad*
Every player on earth internally: 😩based
waow (basedbasedbadedbasedbased)
I need to see Osimhen’s rare Pepe collection
I don't think he would've been offended if the meme was not posted by Napoli's official account
For Osimhen it's simply called life
Absolutely kek indeed
Kektor Basedhen
Could be anyone
he's telling a random guy on twitter to kill himself
Not really
Pepe the frog means something else in Nigeria. It's basically like the wojak
Hes telling the guy to kill himself
He’d probably be arrested for this in England.
Definitely more interesting, but doesnt mean that pros should tell people to go kill themselves
He grew up in Nigeria, this is a very Nigerian response that everyone including his role models would approve of. Not everyone has to be white western and politically correct
They have twitter blue. They were trolling for engagement.
He's opening the coat and pointing to it like a salesman, as if he's offering it to you. That's why I think it's the second one.
Definitely the 2nd one to me 😂😂
Okay mr fun police
Dude the guy is an ass, he posted the coconut video in response. I don't think he was doing it in good faith 

https://twitter.com/MISTERMARKI/status/1736520986034352484?t=rAq7CaujMW0VCRkFH-atKA&s=19
why would he cry if he won the award tho?
Game's just beginning
When you're 12 years old this is really funny yeah.....
Yeah public figure with tons of followers telling someone to kill themselves,fucking hilarious
you should watch some family guy then!
There's a reason Nigerians make up a lot of football twitter. Shitposting and engagement bait is something Nigerians have figured out.
I've been obsessively reading Nairaland, the largest English-language Nigeria-focused forum in the world, for a few weeks. The banter is next-level. All gas, no brakes, 100% of the time.
This is only tangentially related but I like making people aware that it exists:

https://www.bbc.com/pidgin
Also, regarding football, Nigerians generate an extreme amount of web traffic. When I was working for Goal, Nigeria was the second-highest traffic generator over the course of 4 years. Nigeria-based web traffic was at similar levels at another news publication where I worked and covered international football.
>nigerians are A+ shitposters

Can confirm and not just online. Nigerian banter is super underrated, I'm yet to meet a nigerian or someone of nigerian descent who isn't fun to be around
>Victor Boniface will score a brace than roast your team in pidgin on twitter.

Glad to hear it, I hope he ends up in the EPL one day because of being a cracking player and rampant shitposter.
Even on Facebook, Nigerians always churn out hilarious comments.
As a Nigerian, I can attest to that lol. The hardship we face here has caused us to evolve a very unique sense of humor😂😂😂
That’s how it is in Nigeria. We are unfiltered
It makes sense why so many fake escorts and mail order bride scams are done by Nigerians.
Shut up u egg. I won’t tell you again.
We needed someone to take us back to the good old days
I hope he does, that would only elevate the stakes of the joke 

-Why you got suspended mate?

-Some cunt on twitter tested me, so I shitposted a Pepe implying he should off himself

-based…
Haha ye same, “were” ofc 😇
I think he meant back when the internet was more unhinged
Depends on which part of the internet really. In 4chan Pepe was a thing in early 2010's, while trollface was common since at least 2007
Lmao that’s when mainstream media found it. In other words at the end of it’s life cycle.
You take that back, Pepe is timeless
That's the general public timeline, old man.
I would love it, that would be pretty funny
Lighten up, Carl.
100% he makes "So, it happened AGAIN" /mug/ threads.
everytime I read Messoy it makes me laugh, im sorry
Not really crazy to see on twitter.
One of us! One of us!
He’s just like me
Ye that sub twitsted my humor
https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/16tbvqj/the_original_video_posted_by_napoli_about_victor/?rdt=54608


Napoli posted this on their official tiktok
games not gone
The MMA audience is just different and different things are expected because they are going out and literally fighting each other, and the audience will let them get away with saying anything basically. Sean is so dislikable to me but people like him because he just “speaks his mind.”
MMA promotion, at least as done in the ufc, is the opposite extreme in the worst way sometimes. A lot of guys adopting forced personalities, beefs, and behaviors because they want to engage audiences
Guys like Colby and Sean are a cancer to the sport. But footballers are too censored
Nah. Half of that shit is so obviously forced/fake. When something off the cuff happens in football at least you know it's real.
I do not give a fuck about this sub.
fuck yeah I love this
Lmao he's now Raiden from Mortal Kombat.
perfect LMAO
It’s.. *beautiful*!!
this is peak
LMAO
Unless it’s a TikTok post
Non zero implies it’s low, I’d say it’s an almost certainty
That was actually where the inspiration came from, after one became famous and a recognizable personality to millions around the world, there was a dedicated and curated effort put in to make Pepe rise to popularity by making him look like the frog..
Which is why Oshimen's response is so funny lmao
This is what's wrong with social media though. He replied directly to Osimhen just to say that, even if its tame its just a twat thing to do.

Pre-social media its like if you won an award at work, were pretty proud of yourself and some random guy you've never heard of knocks on your door to tell you that Gary from accounts deserved it more. You'd probably just justifiably tell him to do one.
You don’t think it’s rude for someone to reply the greatest achievement you’ve ever had saying someone else deserves it? 

It’s equivalent to someone replying your wedding photos saying your wife could’ve done better
In nigeria, we're big fans of those pepe frog memes. We call them "comrade memes" for some reason.
You ain't tricking us with that Barcelona flair Victor we know it's you
good old days when telling someone to kill themselves on the internet was a show of endearment
Fr?! I completely interpreted that as "oh, I guess I'm gonna go hang (kill) myself". Like massive embarrassment.
Oh my. That's pretty nasty.
the offensive part is the noose. pepe is basically like wojak everywhere.
How does that change anything
Thank you.
Your own no go spoil
I’m sorry but I’m just picturing a door-to-door salesmen trying to convince people to buy nooses now.

“So how long have you been in the market for a noose?”
That's why it's funny. Not telling people to kill themselves is the first thing you learn when you become a public figure with tons of followers.
it’s funny because it’s unexpected…
Hilarious
it is
Womp Womp
This but unironically
If he had directly said that it wouldn't be. But doing it with the forg meme is different
🤓☝️
I literally had family and family friends that have committed suicide or attempted, and I’m telling you this is funny. Now be quiet.
I apologize for this person, we will deal with this matter internally.
You must be fun at parties
You're the reason why there is more and more snowflakes on the internet that find any  dark or edgy jokes offensive, get a grip mate.
Exactly! You get it
Typical Arsenal fan smh
.. to further cement his belief about this post?
i genuinely love it they can turn the most mundane moments into shitposts, nothing is sacred, nothing is serious.
Comrade, na wavulence i dey focus on now
they have invaded twitter, facebook and instagram, you have to scroll the lenght of a football field to find a post related comment, everywhere it's only WONDERFUL WALAUCE talking about some bait stuff and trolling
I find what you say offensive, I don't think they bait people, I'm still waiting for the money that Nigerian prince promised me years ago, as soon as his account is unfrozen thanks to the cash I sent him, I will be rich and you will be looking like an idiot.
Yeh any footie page i have in fb the comments seems to be 90% Nigerians.

If you make a remark about a Nigerian footballer or say something bad, God help you
Seem to have an inordinate amount of time on their hands to shitpost online, Twitter is inundated with them.
That guy in Nigeria who makes funny Instagram vids advertising stuff - did an ad where he is getting stuffed into a trunk by government officers, but still just wants to promote this app to you

Edgy and funny as hell
[deleted]
I mean, they're the OG Nigerian Prince
Nairaland can make 4chan seem tame sometimes with the level of insanity on there
I was so utterly confused when I came across BBC in pidgin for the first time, I thought my computer had some sort of virus
> For one one family house for Bethlehem, for di occupied West Bank, Yazen Alhasnat bin dey sidon next to im mama as im dey rub sleep comot from im eyes.

>Dem release di 17-year-old from prison di night before, nearly five months afta dem bin arrest am for one 4am Israeli military raid on dia house.

>Yazen bin dey under "administrative detention" - one security policy wey don dey for long time now, wey dem inherit from di British.

>Dis policy allow di kontri of Israel to put pipo for prison indefinitely witout charge, and witout presenting any evidence against dem.

>"Dem get one secret file," Yazen say. "Dem no go eva tell you wetin dey inside."

That was an... interesting read. This is actually super cool
“I bin ghost but am begin chase am back wen she bone me”

Sounds like something I’d say in the smokers area of a pub after one too many pints
What the hell is that language
Out of curiosity which country was first?
My Nigerian coworker watches more football than anyone I know. And it's everything, from top leagues to a lot of women's football and even Youtube streams of youth tournaments. Crazy, crazy man.
2011 Wayne Rooney all over again
U need picking up in the morning?
Her?
I still hope he doesn't get in trouble, but your comment did make me laugh.
send some for me
Reddit used to be full of crazy anything goes subs, and a lot less politics and censorship in general, I miss those days
The internet is 100% more unhinged today than it was back then
So he enjoys the finer things in life, I see.
Nerman is better lol.
Damn glad I don’t use twitter that often lol.
I like him because except for the stuff about killing people I pretty much speak the same way lmao

The funniest shit is when for some reason I act polite once in a while, my friends look at me like I'm not even same person

I try not to be disrespectful to people who don't deserve it though, especially if I don't know them personally
People encouraging this behaviour like someone’s murdered father wasn’t just mocked at an MMA press conference.

Meanwhile Sean Strickland literally assaulted another fighter in the crowd this weekend lol..
Stickland isnt too bad he can be a dick but has good moments and is true to himself. Colby is just pure cancer and putting on a character with pre written bullshit he cant back up
Colby's is rehearsed  far right propoganda, it's not funny or entertaining.

Sean at least is funny but from what we've just seen yesterday it shows that he can't take it as well as he gives it which is pretty sad.
>Guys like Colby and Sean are a cancer to the sport

But they aren't censored which is great.
Between fighters like Colby and Strickland, and Dana himself, I find it very hard to follow the sport anymore. I used to watch every card, now I probably watch 10 fights a year.
Agree about Colby, but Sean is entertaining af 

My personal favourites are Kevin Holland and Derrick Lewis though
If this sub thinks, I disagree. If this sub speaks, I ignore. If this sub fails, I'm happy. If the world is against this sub, I am the world. If this sub has 7 billion fans, I am none of them. If this sub has no haters, it's because I no longer exist.
based
Then why are you here? And why care about what some dude says on social media?

Your comments really show the average age of people in this sub. Just a lot of teenagers who think they're edgy.
He def consulted with the elder gods about the Napoli tiktok 🤣
Especially when Gary from accounts isn't even the stand-out contributor to the company's success and it should be Amrabat from Operations or Bono from legal.
It would obviously be very rude to say it to his face.

But even with Ops point, it is different online. The guy didn’t even address Osimhen directly in the tweet and obviously had no idea he would even see it.

I’m not saying the guy was being nice, but It’s really no different then any of us stating our opinions on this forum.
You sure it's not you?
He's offering you a noose like someone would offer you something to buy from his coat.
The Pepe meme has become very popular among Nigerian (maybe west African) twitter users recently too. Victor Osimhen is a real poster.
It's quite clearly a joke.
Pepe is not used as a racist symbol in Nigeria was my point
Yeah but why is your sense of humour like that, it’s not really funny it’s humorous. But it shouldn’t make you laugh tho right…
Its funny in every aspect
Yeah fam noone asked
Revoke his Arsenal card
Don't talk shit about Family Guy.
The problem is that they can make shitposts and similar into something very serious and sacred, they often played the racism card even when it's not there just for interactions
>nothing is sacred, nothing is serious

~~Assassin's~~ Shitposter's Creed
It's a reflection of their government, it takes nothing serious either except corruption and looting, their disposition is bound to rub off on their citizens.
Pain went straight to manchester
33% unemployment rate will do that to a mf
Gotta get that engagement for $5 Elon payout
Most top Nigerian shitposters are from the diaspora
What do you mean?
English but better
It's supposed to be a simplified English I believe, key word being supposed to be.
The UK. No surprises there.
2011 Rooney was peak Twitter account. Everyone was figuring out this new Twitter thing and Rooney was out there insulting egg accounts, messaging Rio Ferdinand on his timeline if he wanted to get picked up in the morning, and threatening fans with violence. Nothing before or since will come close
Rio mate
Unhinged as in the fun "everyone messing around" way, not unhinged as in actually "fucking mentally ill psychotic cult" way
They mean back when celebs and professional athletes handled their own social media account and weren't afraid to shit post and risk bad PR.
Is it? Maybe I'm just old but it all seems so sterile now. There are like 3 heavily moderated websites instead of hundreds of wild, mostly unfiltered forums.
Back then it was goofy unhinged, and weird dark unhinged. Now it's "legitimately threatening the security of the world" unhinged.
Just the other day some bluecheck (aka verified idiot) commend about how vaccine is the cause of Luton's captain collapse.
If you speak the same way as Sean you must be a pretty massive dickhead.
I think Sean is type to boast about how he has no filter but when someone throws it at him he can’t handle it. Personally I don’t like the guy
Calling people slurs or joking about being able to rape another fighter isn't really funny tbf
Kevin Holland's Instagram is my morning news, dude is hilarious on there
https://twitter.com/victorosimhen9/status/1736507795933958228?s=46
Then why are you here?
This forum is very different to Twitter. How can you claim that he didn’t know Osimhen would see it when replying his personal account?
Bundesliga flair, hmmmm...

Always fancied a move to Germany eh, Vic?
Obviously, still pretty gross to suggest someone kill themselves, joke or not.
Ahh get you, I had forgot that pepe was used as a racist symbol, but I think that was just a 4chan troll
tbf i think theyre laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation not osimhens joke
I'm telling mom you laughed at something humorous
You’re removing context entirely. Is he responding to someone tweeting suicidal thoughts? No. Nowhere close to that. That’s why it’s still acceptably funny
What happened to people's sense of humor
Bro you think it's humorous? What the fuck is wrong with you?

Damn they weren't kidding when they said you need to put an /s up on everything lol
Nobody asked you either dawg and you still decided to complain🤣
Simply isn’t true, most Nigerians are against pulling the race card. You’re probably just racist and got called out for it. Stop making shit up
Naah. Nigerians are the least likely to play the racism card in any interaction.
LoL 
You definitely know nothing about Nigerians, you just wanted to sound stupid as usual.
get off the internet lil bro
You're just talking shit tbh.
I don't actually understand what it is, a sort of English dialect?
English 3.0
It's not really simplified English, Pigdin languages are like meeting in the middle of two languages to aid communication between groups with neither having to fully learn the other to work effectively. It's kind of developed naturally into its own dialect now though.
Man was ahead of his time
Leg.
Basically less corporate.
shut up u egg
Should have just posted a Pepe with a syringe in his coat
Nowadays, blue check just means they pay $8 a month.
Never said I wasn't
That happened last night at the event lol. 

Strickland is interesting because he’s a piece of shit, but he’s a product of severe childhood trauma and is aware of that to some degree. He’s realized he’s a product of shadows on the cave wall, so to speak. 

He’s still a piece of shit tho.
Personally i like the guy
Because that is not the norm.

When you tweet a celeb do you ever actually think they will see it, let alone respond to it? Maybe back in the early days of twitter, but no one should reasonably expect that today.
Nowadays it's probably different, but back in the day saying this on the internet was pretty much a common insult. Not to be taken literally, basically as serious as "fuck off".

Can't imagine a pro footballer tweeting it though lmao
You don't know young people
> but I think that was just a 4chan troll

A place famously known for being incredibly antiracist
i’m laughing at both
They wanted to get upset
You are in r/soccer, good sir. Almost a second r/politics subreddit, so you know how it goes.
What a soft little cupcake you are
Yeah man. This isn't heckin wholesome chungus Redditorino humour. Osimhen is using white supremacist symbols and is dog whistling his support for Nazism and eugenics. I'm drafting a strongly worded email to De Laurentiis right now. *Tips fedora*
I aint telling people to be quite over the internet like a bitch
I'm sure the Nigerians out there really appreciate you defending their honour on social media mate.
You know nothing about twitter
A pidgin /ˈpɪdʒɪn/, or pidgin language, is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups of people that do not have a language in common: typically, its vocabulary and grammar are limited and often drawn from several languages. It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups). Linguists do not typically consider pidgins as full or complete languages.  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin)
Aided, simplified, tomato tomato
lol was just gonna reply above, now the unhinged internet is focus group-tested and corporatized.
I'm genuinely still amazed that

1) Elon decided to make verification a paywall and originally expected noone to abuse this

2) So many ordinary people actually use twitter enough to think an 8 quid a month subscription is worth it on that shithole app
that's not what happened lmao DDP said fight me right here so sean said okay and fought him
Strickland did that to DDP because of what DDP said about his father beating him as a kid

EDIT: Some of you have misunderstood, I'm not justifying Strickland's actions.
The amount of times someone told me to kill myself while playing CS..
It’s still pretty common.
Might have been common but doesn't make it right.

When I was a kid, saying "That's gay/retarded" was really common. Thankfully most of us grew out of it.
Fair. I hardly knew young people when I was a young people. 😂
More politicians should tweet like this too.
Arsenal fan innit
What a soft little cupcake you are.
I’m a Nigerian and I can vividly tell you that we don’t really give much fuck about racism & we barely even talk about it, even though we can shitpost all day.
LoL 
I only just deleted my twitter account few days ago, coz the app is now bombarded with loads of fakery and it feels as if everyone just want to over analyze things and also sound dumb at the same time.
Interesting
Not really though, because it's not simplified English. It's a creole of English, other older regional creoles, Igbos and even some Portuguese with a simplified grammar system. It's reductive to call it simplified English, because it isn't.

Simplified English is called American English.
To the first point - I loved how some people bought the subscription with names of some pharma company and Raytheon and managed to actually hurt company's stock with their tweets.
It was mainly to reduce the amount of bots, and it worked to some extent.
> I think Sean is type to boast about how he has no filter but when someone throws it at him he can’t handle it. Personally I don’t like the guy
Never played CS, but I wonder how it compares to League. That game was the global hub of toxicity I think
it's fine, I think social media has made people more vile but idk
Not all of us but some people have different experiences I guess. For example, if I know someone who lost someone important to suicide and I know that they’re not okay with it, I’m not gonna joke about it. But this guy is just going out in the open and getting mad about it. Your triggers are your responsibility innit.
I definitely seen Nigerians talk about racism online when there wasn’t any
You can shitpost about it and also not care. They are probably laughing while making these accusations 🤣
By that you mean people have too many opinions that differ from yours, and you have to be the smartest person in any room so you just can't keep up anymore
I've not even had my breakfast yet mate cmon
post of the year
ayoo
Yeah, now some people are buying Twitter Blue for the bots so they look legit. Elon didn't manage to stop bots but he managed to monetarize them
Are you joking? 90% of the blue check marks I see are literally spam-bot, impression farming accounts that reply to a tweet with completely irrelevant things. I’ve blocked hundreds upon hundreds of them already.
I once saw a guy in League tell someone else to 'go 0/1 irl'
Never played either, but I did play the OG MW2…
I lost my best friend to himself and I’m not triggered innit
Wow 
You must have some sort of filters on that shows those sort of comments, mind if you can share a link to some of those comments please 🙏
LoL racism is the least thing most Nigerians would shitpost or even talk about, you can change your twitter/X location to Nigeria and you’ll be surprised with the way we throw banters and shitpost about bad governance, football, poverty and other things affecting the country, haven’t came across anyone shitposting about racism in Nigeria, unless someone is confusing Nigerians with Black Americans
LoL
You assumed and over analyzed.

This is what happens when you try to sound intelligent and all knowing, but you still ended up sounding stupid 😁.
Got this in the mail today
My wife and I are Pennsylvania voters. We got this in the mail today addressed to her. 

It's funny because she stopped listening after Red and I, a 36-year-old dude, am the Swiftie in the household. 😂 

So I'll take that friendship bracelet! Thanks, Swifties For Kamala! 
I just got "paint the town blue" as a political reference in Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince. Genius.
If anyone in this thread has friends who aren’t sure if they will make it to the polls due to lack of transportation here are some resources:

Please vote. A teenage girl just died from a miscarriage in Texas. No one would help her and she suffered for hours with sepsis and died. Vote for our lives!
Okay, so I guess I can't edit my post but I should have made it clear that her and I are both voting for Kamala Harris. I am also a poll observer for the first half of the day.

We got this, Swifties. I really do believe we are about to turn the page on this ugly chapter of history. 🤞
I got one as a Pennsylvania voter too! The attention to detail was *chef’s kiss.” 
💙💙💙
I’m just so in awe of the fans who’ve organized this whole effort. Virtual rallies, a merch collection, raising hundreds of thousands, and now sending out mailers in battleground states?? really really cool of them

Sending love to all my American Swifties. Here’s hoping the only orange in your life is that damn door. Stay safe, stay fearless 🫶🏼
Voting begins in a few hours, swifties vote!!!! Especially swifties in swing states, VOTE!!!!!!! We can't let Tr*mp win

Also Collin Alred  is running for the senate in Texas against Ted Cruz, vote for Collin Texas swifties

Hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!
Gross.
How do I get on the mailing list? 💙🩵💜
Please contact your friends, help them get to the polls. Vote blue down the ballot at every election
Australian. Thinking of all the American Swifties on this very important day for democracy, women’s rights, LGBTQIA, human rights in general, climate action and less conflicts in the world. In other words, please vote for Kamala 💙 and support others to vote as well.
Love this
I got one last week too! Signed up for my bracelet immediately- hopefully it comes today! 💙
God how do you get these???
Wait you can register same day in some states? I’m guessing only the strong blue ones.
Aaaahaha🤣😂🤣
Hey how did this go for you?
I wish I got this junk mail. Lol. I live in a RED area of my city and just get a bunch of crap from a lady very similar to Majorie Taylor Greene 🤢🤮

I’ve done what I can and I hope our county goes more blue than ever this election!
this is ridiculous
“Not authorized by Taylor Swift”…..
Ain't no way American democracy is based on people who vote because their favorite celebrity told them to 💀
This post is making me so happy.
MAGA!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Coping with today by watching the Era’s Tour movie! Comfort watch time!
Vote, baby! It's all you!
It's so different from what Sabrina did. She's actually playing the game instead of just telling people to vote wisely. She's knows that if Kamala wins Pennsylvania, she'll likely win. And since Taylor's from Pennsylvania, considering how much power she has currently, something like this could sway the whole election. Even without her telling Pennsylvania specifically to vote for Kamala, just the fact that she was born in Reading, thus making it a more pro-Taylor state (same thing with Nashville, KC, and NYC), could help Kamala win.
Well two races down.
Oh man I want one!! I don’t live in a swing state so maybe that’s why
So cool you’re a  swiftie swifties are the best
Is this from Taylor’s team?
Save it. Political memorabilia can be worth something later.
How'd this turn out for ya? ;)
Stereotyping any group of people isn't morally ethical either. Just because someone is conservative, independent, or liberal does not identify that person as a whole, it's a political leaning or choice not the only layer to said person.  If people would stop hating or judging people on political differences and find humanity in each other it'd be a different world, potentially a much better one.
I feel offended that I didn't get one😩. I love one town over from her hometown.
I WANT ONE! But im in Ohio 😩
I love this!!! 💙
Oh man! I want to receive this in the mail 😭
Ugh, why can I get cute mail? All I ever see staring back at me in the mailbox is an orange butthole.
LET'S GOOOOOO!!! Everyone vote and bring a friend!
I love this so much and I am jealous lol
How did you get this? I would’ve loved this! 💗 Swiftie and Kamala supporter! 💙
I just wish they would encourage people to do research and vote because it’s who THEY want to vote for, not just vote blind because your favorite celebrity votes a certain way. We all need to become educated and think for ourselves. That’s how we secure a safe future 💙
This is actually so cringe.
I love that Swifties for Kamala are out there doing their thing. I hope Taylor is supporting them in some big way behind the scenes. I feel a little silly, but I'm actually quite sad that Taylor didn't do anything in PA last night or even do a specific post for getting out the vote since PA is soooo important. And especially with her tour being essentially over so it wouldn't really impact her concerts in terms of safety.  I'll get over it but I'm definitely sad and surprised others don't feel the same way.

Well now my feelings are hurt because I didn’t get one.
I love this so much I’m sobbing 😭 💙
This is adorable sir!
I wore my friendship bracelets when I voted earlier today!
I GOT ONE TOOOOO!! 🥰🥰
Love this  💙
please, if you are eligible to vote in pennsylvania, please vote blue. Pennsylvania is such a major advantage and we NEED pennsylvania to stay blue
I'M A 36 YEAR OLD SWIFTIE DUDE IN PA TOO.

I feel slighted by the lack of friendship bracelet.
This is really cool 💙
Swiftie for Trump here!!
Vote for Trump
Vote trump!
I think celebrities should stay out of politics. I love Taylor but I don’t get how she or anyone else can vote for Kamala.
What a con
Ewwwww
Shut down the borders. Vote for you lives Trump

Miss Americana is about (the election in) 2016, all wrapped up in a highschool metaphor. It's about her disappearimg because of #taylorswiftisoverparty and why she didn't interact with the election and support Hilary.
I never related the two until I read your comment, I just thought she meant paint the town blue as an emotional sense, like making everyone sad.
Another one that I got recently: in Only The Young, “their hands are stained with red” is possibly a political reference.
My city is also offering free bus rides to polling locations. 

Your city might be offering something similar, so check your local papers!
What’s truly tragic is that Neveah’s family (and herself) were right-wing, anti-choice. Her mother told an interviewer she didn’t understand why medical professionals wouldn’t “help the miscarriage along.” She now has to live with the knowledge for the rest of her life that the anti-choice policies she supported were directly responsible for the death of her daughter. That kind of pain I wouldn’t wish on anyone.
And Kate Cox had to flee Texas to avoid the same fate.
Could you share the article you’re referring to? If it’s this one below, which happened last year. I’ve seen stories from 2021 as well, but they are just now being circulated. Also, in my opinion that’s potentially a medical malpractice suit.

I think it’s important that everyone remembers to practice critical thinking and do personal research as well.

https://www.texastribune.org/2024/11/01/nevaeh-crain-death-texas-abortion-ban-emtala/
On one hand I am really excited. On the other hand I am absolutely terrified.
I'm European, an enemy of the state of Russia (along with my entire family), and I'm sitting here shitting a brick over what Putin will do if the octogenerian orange condom reject is re-elected Thank you for voting and for trying to right the world 🇺🇸💛💙🇪🇺
Remember Johnson already said he won't certify the election if Harris wins, so let's vote blue down ballot so he can be unseated Jan 3 before Jan 6!

🎶 down ballot voting for the Dems Fuck it if we're stuck with him 🎶
I can't imagine the alternative!


Thank you for your service.  The way Trump and his supporters have treated poll workers is just another thing on a long list of reprehensible behavior. 

Americans are going to vote for a man that behaves in a way that they wouldn't find acceptable for their children to!

Does it make anyyyy sense people??
Turns out you didn’t “got this” 😞
Right? The "blink of a crinkling eye" is my favorite.
Ty. ❤️
Me too! Wearing the bracelet today! 💙
And in 3 months!
Artist attracts the fans that reflect them.  If you’re kind, your fans will be kind.  Taylor is smart, business savvy and creative—that’s exactly what Swifties for Harris are bringing to the table.
Oh we are. And it sure isn't for Mango Mussolini.
Brilliant comment 🫶🏼💙🦋
Yessss vote for Collin to keep the senate blue!!
In her case I think it helps to be a woman in her early 30s in a swing state. 😂 She has been absolutely bombarded with Harris mailers for about 4 months. I rarely get any. 

Go to Swifties4Kamala.com and see if you can get that free bracelet!
SAME 😭
fans coordinated this though, it’s not from taylor’s team.
When one candidate wants to end democracy and begin a dictatorship, a safe future is only possible under a president Kamala Harris.
SFT all the way. ❤️❤️
Kamala will not win luckily lol
You 👏🏼 need 👏🏼 to 👏🏼 calm 👏🏼 down!
You do realize you're on the Taylor Swift subreddit, right?

Clearly you're not reading the room, but then again reading the room is not a skill that many Trump supporters possess.
Undocumented immigrants paid $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes, $6.4 billion in Medicare taxes, and $1.8 billion in unemployment insurance taxes in 2022 alone. Our elderly Americans are dependent on immigrants to pay for these social services!
Like we tried to do a few months ago when we had a bipartisanship bill ready to pass, but then Trump called all his little cult members and told them not to pass it so he could run on this? Yeah, blame the Democrats not the Republican who's running for president who put a stop to it.
We know exactly what we’re voting for and what we’re against.
We're voting for Kamala Harris, we know exactly why we're doing it, and I can cite my top 5 policies if you'd like to hear them.
One candidate plans to disband the department of education. As a parent of a child with an IEP, it’s easy to make this decision based on policy.
Any candidate that supports calling Puerto Rico “an island of garbage” is never getting my vote. Just because *you* don’t understand it doesn’t mean the rest of us don’t.
All that really matters right now is which side is pro-abortion and pro-LGBTQ, and we know which side that is.
One side keeps hacking at women’s rights and one side doesn’t!
Yet you've written that you like trump. Seems like you don't know any policy about your candidate, or you're a pos?
So her opinion matters less because she’s Taylor swift? That doesn’t seem fair.

I hear BDILH as a political anthem in some ways, too. My friend is running for office rn in our state and if she wins tonight, I’m layering that song over her congratulatory video lol
The song is pretty layered and brilliant. While on the surface it reads as just a song about a high school relationship, there’s lots of lyrics suggesting it’s political, including the following line to that lyric they said which is “**voted** most likely to run away with you”.

There’s lots of others suggesting this like, “American glory faded before me [..] I saw the scoreboard, and ran for my life”, “my team is losing, battered and bruising / I see the high fives between all the bad guys / Leave with my head hung, you are the only one who seems to care / American stories burning before me”, etc. 

I wont write out all the lyrics of course, but I’d say every line in the song when you view it this way feels about being judged by the political opposition and fighting against them with the person you love no matter the odds. Especially since this song is the title to the documentary she released at the time which was mainly about her decision to be open about her views, and the fact this release was after Trump’s win.
Only The Young is 10000% a political song telling young people to vote. She talks about it in the documentary 😻
I’m sorry how do you not get that the whole song is political?
It’s tragic. So many people are so misinformed and many people do not understand abortion is healthcare. This is not something that the government should have any control over.
I have little respect for Conservatives in this country, they lack understanding and empathy. 

Often only able to fathom something until they have to endure it on a personal level.

Anti-gay until their son happens to be gay,  anti-abortion until their daughter needs one.  


Get some perspective!!!!!!!

They miss the entire premise of the Bible, and I wish them all to hell. Honestly.
As a nurse who has watched sepsis set in, you need to act fast. I’m just in absolute tears thinking about this poor girl suffering and no one helping her. It’s unconscionable. She had a right to live. We cannot let him win.
Amanda Zurawski too.

The day we take the Bible out of politics, is the day we can get a better government. In fact 72% Americans are against religion having any influence in politics and law making.
And Amber Thurman died of sepsis from a preventable issue in Georgia.
Try to practice some critical thinking to understand that this happening last year doesn’t change the impact from the story. This could happen again to a teenager today and people want to change that.
i’m not american but i’m currently dating an 🇺🇸 person and trying to get as many people in our circle as possible to vote. you guys got this 🫶🏻
I'm currently in Germany seeing my wife's family and friends. It's really a big issue here! People will be watching the vote count as if it were the World Cup.

The implications are enormous! A Trump 2.0 presidency means:

....Ukraine falls. Taiwan falls. Russia takes Moldova, Estonia, etc. Energy prices & inflation spike. The global stock market plummets. Medicare and Social Security are destroyed. Taxes on the middle class and tax breaks for the ultra wealthy. Women's & race rights removed. Court appointees purposely stacked in his favor. War in Middle East.....all this in YEAR ONE!....YEAR 4, HE'LL TRY TO BECOME A DICTATOR...with Civil War imminent beginning with California/West Coast/East Coast banding together.
Same here. Putin will grab the whole of Europe.
They should not be allowed to have the job if they are going to refuse to do it, especially just because they didn’t get their way.  it’s insane.
"Gray November" is kind of a deep cut too!
Mango Mussolini is a new one on me. I shall add it to my collection. 😀
I don’t think there’s a way to get a bracelet lol

Edit: I looked on the website is why I said this. I wanted to try to get one 😭
I don’t see it on there?
man i’m all of these and i didn’t get one 😭 i’m jealous
Oh
I never said I was against Harris. I’m just saying instead of encouraging people to vote blind they need to advertise why her policies are the best!
Calm down for what? They’re not even upset buddy..
It’s so weird how your not allowed to voice your own opinion without getting attacked for it lol, which is everything that Taylor stands against.
Yes I’m a swiftie been to many concerts. Not all Swifties vote Harris. That’s the point to let other Swifties come out and know that’s it’s ok to vote Trump. We need to stop funding others wars.
Shhhh, they don’t like realising that the American economy needs the undocumented population to keep the country going. It doesn’t suit their racist narrative.
Dismantling education is their endgame. After all, he "loves the poorly educated".
100% this. 💙

Also the grandchild of a Japanese immigrant. 💙

And of course a woman. 💙
💯
I'm not saying that her opinion matters less , I'm saying that she'll receive a lot of backlash and that people will accuse her of using her power to make people vote for Kamala and influence them . I never said that her opinion matters less or anything, any celebrity who will do this will receive backlash , but people love to hate Taylor so she'll receive a lot of backlash than any other celebrity. If Kamala wins all the trump supporters will say that Taylor voted for her fans and that her cult did the same and spread hate towards her and the swifties.

- BDILH could mean "But Daddy I Love Him", a track from *THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT* (2024) by Taylor Swift.

So glad I'm not the only one who thinks BDILH could have political layers as well!
It was meant to be an allegory for the Metoo movement and subsequent counter-movement meant to mock it.
Wow, I did think it was a bit weird that she described the other high school team as "the bad guys", and that she seemed to be writing about high school sports in the first place. This makes a lot more sense.
I do. I meant to reference that single line. Miss Americana is also political and I was replying to that.
[deleted]
Yes. The lack of empathy and compassion for their fellow human being is the most frustrating for me. **It shouldn’t have to happen to you for it to matter to you**.
I’m trying really hard to think of how to word this response. I’m saying this with a boatload of compassion.

These broad generalizations you’ve made are not going to open anyone’s heart or mind to your perspective, which I think is your end goal. And I think compassion and a desire for others to live life well are a key part of Taylor’s worldview. Yes, Karma. But also, Innocent.

All I can say is that I see you, I hear you, and I am sending you a big internet hug because it sounds like you need it. But there are many things everyone in the world disagrees on, and if we aren’t coming forward built on a premise of desiring to understand and learn, to share and consider, we will not grow as people.

If you’re sincerely wishing them to hell, there isn’t room for discourse.

I hope you realize there - statistically - are conservative Swifties. You sound super smart and passionate, and I’m sure these qualities have served you well in life, but reading your comments online it comes across very harsh and isolating. And if that’s your intent - then that’s okay, too.
I completely agree. He created so many senseless tragedies to score cheap political points. It's horrifying, and he is about to face the backlash for that decision. Even Kentucky voted for reproductive freedom when given the chance.
And the other 28% apparently never read the Constitution.
I totally overlooked that and it is actually my favorite. .
As someone who loves mangoes, can we please go with a less delicious option. Something yucky equalling his yuckyness? 🤣
We got a QR code, but it looks like it is specific to her and can only be claimed by a PA voter. I hoped the website would work for other people, but maybe not?
If Trump wins there will be no future elections. 

Treating this election like it’s normal and should be based on policy is naive.
I find it funny that your comment is about making sure it’s safe for Swifties to “come out” in support of Trump, when the man you’re voting for will make your country less safe for people to come out.
100%. It’s disgusting to see how many young people are influenced simply by others online instead of doing their own research. If they do research and still want to vote for Kamala, fine. But to vote that way simply because of the internet/their fave celebrity and actively hate on others who don’t align is wildly - ironically - close-minded and hateful.
A lot of celebrities have and always will receive back lash from the media even if they vote for either side. It’s just how the media makes it out to be.
But the real question here is who cares? I don’t care what they think. You shouldn’t either. Their opinions are based in bigotry, which renders them irrelevant.

"The Only Moral Abortion Is My Abortion," is a must read. 

The Right has been so disingenuous about late term abortions for far too long.   Women that have to experience an abortion in the third trimester wanted their baby,  might have a name and a Nursery.  Now these women are dying in Red states.

Any pre-menopausal female that votes for Trump is a moron.  I'm really hoping the majority of us are smarter than that.
Yes,  that's my intent.  I don't believe a Trump supporter to have a heart to open.  They are lost souls. And I'm not Taylor Swift,  I don't need them to buy my records or concert tickets. 

So, I don't give a f u c k. 

If you are a Trump supporter you have no moral compass.  I'm ashamed of those 74 million people, and I wish them perspective. Unfortunately,  the only way they will gain it is by enduring pain first-hand. 

Let a Trump supporter get his unconscious and bleeding out wife, along with their 9 mos old in a car to rush her to the ER like Ryan Hamilton. Denied medical care 3x. Completely preventable scenario that now has caused immense trauma to that baby and couple!  All because of Trump and his Supreme Court.

You are damn right. I AM MAD, because I have a lot of empathy.  We are playing with people's lives!!  This isn't something to sugarcoat.  

The cult members are not going to be swayed. I've spent this election cycle educating first time voters.  This is their future we are playing with here.  Sorry to offend non Trumpers out there, but this is the reality that the pos created.
It is absolutely infuriating how limited the American memory is, and why these people can't seem to understand why we had Roe in the first place!

Young women and girls were dyinggggg pre-Roe.  They were so desperate to end a pregnancy that they risked their lives with dirty clothes hangars and back alley abortions.

To think anyone in the 21st century finds it acceptable to go back. The Conservative Right values the life of pea-sized fetus over a living, breathing woman. It just proves misogyny is alive and well in the United States of America.

Ironic that the man that was losing A MILLION AMERICANS A DAY to Covid when he left office pretends to care about LIFE.  He cares about himself and that is all. 

God help us all if we lose tonight!
According to a survey 27% adults want America to be a Christian nation, so that checks out.
Many did. They don’t care… :/
Mung bean Mussolini, hahaha.
You need to calm down, you’re being too loud
I voted for Harris. Calm down. My main point was that we should not be using celebrities to persuade people and should instead be encouraging them to think for themselves. Too many people I have heard tell me “oh I didn’t do enough research on the candidates and since I can’t make an informed decision I’m just not voting.” How many votes do you think are lost that way? We need to encourage everyone becoming politically active for their own futures sake so we have a better chance.
Lmao - Trump was already in office for 4 years. Please tell me how exactly he turned the US into a dictatorship, and explain to me how we’re voting right now if there are no elections after he holds office?
I know right! I love leaving Easter Eggs. 1 Timothy 1:10. Cheers! ❤️
100% agree. the so-called “tolerant left” is extremely hateful when someone has a differing opinion.
“yeah I was going to vote Trump, but then Taylor swift told me not to so I switched to Harris” -said no one ever
[removed]
Careful now, the side chanting this also says the word "fight" is a blatant call to violence used by insurrectionist. 

If there was no double standards, they'd have no standards at all.
Still what happened to her was tragic and should’ve never happened.
All pretty sure it looks like Biden/Trump has used her death penalty of times in rallies
Absolutely. I read and referenced it back in high school for an APUSH class debate on abortion rights. 

I was assigned the Pro-Choice side and the research I did (and subsequently discovering [“The Only Moral Abortion is My Abortion” article](https://joycearthur.com/abortion/the-only-moral-abortion-is-my-abortion/) in the process) caused me to realize that not only was I pro-choice, but that I was also pro-abortion. That women not only should have the legal ability to decide for themselves, but that the medical procedure should be easily, readily, and legally accessible for anyone who needs it just like any other medical procedure. ([This short article explains the verbiage differential.)](https://www.wholewomanshealthalliance.org/why-we-all-need-to-be-pro-abortion/)
His agenda and those he plans to add to his cabinet are not the same as they were in 2016, he isn’t even running with the same VP. Project 2025 is specifically about his actions once taking office in 2025, and becoming dictator then.
While I’m not part of the LGBTQIA+ community and have no business speaking on their behalf, I think this is the one time I can.

Go. To. Hell.
hey there! as a Christian I would ask that you don’t quote the Bible when your comment history is filled with soft porn from the Hooters subreddit. instead, it might be worthwhile to read the book you’re quoting, I’d suggest starting with Matthew 7:3-5. hope this helps!
I’m pretty middle (as tbh most people probably are), and I’ve had *so many* good conversations with Republican friends, discussing our beliefs and differences - but Democrat friends? I don’t dare bring up *anything* political up, even if I think we’d agree. It turns hateful so quickly.
Don’t be obtuse:
“I wasn’t sure who I wanted to vote for, then Taylor endorsed Kamala and the discourse on the r/TaylorSwift subreddit made it seem like I’d be a terrible person for voting any other way, so now I’m voting Kamala”

Think of how impressionable and easily swayed by peer-pressure the average person is… then realize that 49% of the population is even more impressionable than that. The discourse *should be* “educate yourself on issues important to you and vote accordingly” **never** “vote for x candidate or else you’re the scum of the earth”

The political climate is obscene, the media is dividing us, and people are letting it happen.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anafaguy/2024/03/18/laken-rileys-father-says-hes-angry-politicians-are-using-tragedy-for-votes/

Yes, her father has asked that her death not be used by either side.
“no guys seriously even though he already ruled the country for 4 years, THIS time it’s serious!! we’re all going to camps according to this document that isn’t actually a part of his agenda whatsoever!”
Trump has literally nothing to do with Project 2025 but go on, blindly believe what the internet tells you.
You need to calm down 😂
Hi fellow Christian. He has risen indeed. 

Hooters employees women and brings awareness to breast cancer. The 2025 Calendar donates to breast cancer research. Additionally, I’m doing my part to help fund college educational. Yeah Sermon on the Mount is awesome read!
yeah me too. last election i voted for biden, this time i voted for trump. i’m not really partial to any political party, i just go with whoever i think is a better fit and whose policies i agree with more. 

any conversation i have with a republican, they’re willing to hear you out and have a friendly debate, but democrats literally do not wanna hear ANYTHING other than what they believe. it’s really ironic that they’re supposed to be “tolerant”
When one candidate supports saying that Puerto Rico is an “island of garbage” and the other doesn’t I think it makes the choice very clear.

Just like all of his SCOTUS picks swore under oath they would not overturn Roe v Wade! The dems were sooooo crazy for saying that would happen. It’s not like they LIED UNDER-OATH and then immediately overturned 50+ years of settled law… oh wait that’s exactly what happened.
For real… I’ll take the “risk” to actually be able to afford a semi-decent way of life again
His name is in the document over 300 times and he has promised one of the creators of the document a position in his cabinet. You’re the one blindly refuting facts in favor of word of a known liar.
Thank you for your advice. You’re absolutely right. I do need to calm down instead of communicating with a shit-stain’s supporter. I hope you have a *lovely* day 💙
Great comeback. 100% the election should hinge on a single statement. /s
Right! I'm aware both sides have, and both need to stop. I'm saying her family has asked that they not do that, so I was responding to your original comment telling people to say her name.
We could all make what we think are “ideal plans” for the next candidate- we could even name them 300 times in the document! Doesn’t mean that named person aligns or will put into action our plan… be fr.

IShowSpeed foul on Kaka. Yellow card given 
Apolgoies for the horrendous quality

doing this to a retired Kaká is a sin
He’s definitely going to injure somebody. Legends like Kaka having to put up with this shit during a charity match is kinda ridiculous
Nah you can’t be doing that to actual Kaká that’s fucked up
What timeline is this?
the sooner he stops getting invited to these things plus awards the better
Someone should just 2 foot him. It's a charity match, no repercussions
still can't believe R9 let him hold his Ballon d'Or in his house
Why even give attention to this clown.
Has to be a red
If he fucking MAD?!???
What's the point of the slide tackle? Kaka is facing away from him, and he had to race back from up front and get out of position for a yellow card (should even be a red). And it's KAKA, who the hell slide tackles a 40 year old Kaka with studs up? Who does he think he is, Sergio Busquets? Absolute clown, he's gonna injure someone.

EDIT: And this was a charity match... It's not that serious, not the world cup final
Can we please stop promoting this clown?
Fuck this guy.
That’s not even funny or banter, you do that in football you’re off, you do that in Sunday league you’re getting knocked out. Little cunt
Imagine telling someone from 20/30 years ago that you can become rich and popular just by acting like an idiot and barking like a dog.
This entire post feels like a very bad fever dream
Imagine having the honor of playing with Kaka and having no clue who he is and doing this to him..
That’s a red, the daft twat.
No seriously, why is this kid at these events?
r/iamatotalpieceofshit
Imagine being Kaka and going to a friendly charity match and getting tackled this way with an stupid foul, this kind of BS would make me quit playing in this kind of matches, I would go encourage give some kind of speech or something but imagine getting injured from this kind of tackle just because some stupid dude can’t control himself.
Bellend
This little cunt shouldn't get given the time of day by anybody with half a brain. Let alone in a football subreddit.
That boy aint right
What's worse for me is that he is arguing the yellow saying he went for the ball, and didn't even apologize to Kaká
Who the fck is this clown?? Doing that on a charity match....wtf
As if poor Kaka hasn‘t suffered enough injuries in his career
Why does our society give this man 23 million subscribers on YouTube?
Why is this dude even famous, acts like a child and has main character syndrome or something,uses Ronaldo for publicity, still gets invited to football events
The day he becomes irrelevant cannot come soon enough.
who is this random and why the fk is he slide tackling a balon d'or?
Who is that guy?
This guy got to be on the same pitch with Kaka is an absolute joke by itself.
why do we platform entitled brats.

How can he do that to a legend of the game, that so so direspectful.
Probably a red in any normal match but I’m sure they kept him on so they can sub him.

Like wtf you doing your 19 years old in a charity match and that’s a living legend you just went in on.
A slide tackle from behind to a man who isn't as fit as he used to be

Someone call Ramos. Two can play at that game.
I can’t stand this guy. I hate that he is a “celebrity” everything about him is fake.
What the fuck happened to football ? Has it fallen off so bad that clowns like these are getting invited to every event ? It's just disrespectful to the legendary players to be sharing the pitch with these clowns. Like holy he could have seriously injured him.
Fuck this guy. Why is he there. Wat a strange world
Can he get banned? Or can the players just walk? He's such a petulant child and has no clue how dangerous his actions can be both on and off the field.
Of all the people to do that too. You do it to a 40 year old legend whose whole legend revolves around the fact that he was one of the best players ever whose career was cut short by injury. Who even by the time he left AC Milan and only the halfway point of his career really, never achieved his peak again due to injury. And you slide tackle him from behind in a charity match. Show me how quickly you can speed on off to hell
That time he did in the Sidemen Charity Match it was all jokes & banter.   
But doing the same to "Ricardo Kaka" I mean have some RESPECT   
Kaka earned it by being a hardworking pro footballer. All speed does is bark💀
Bro he could’ve snapped his leg. I hate our society. A clown gets to play with Kaka and does this. KAKA!!! Fuck
For the record I think this is stupid, yeah it's a charity game but if his foot is planted there...

Also speed is just a bellend in general, not the character the person
Why not give him a red and get him off the pitch?
He's right to be annoyed at the ref.



That should have been red.
Clown.
The human shitpost strikes again
Never understood why this guy got so popular. Always found him annoying.
Who is this clown and why is he allowed on the pitch? He could've seriously injured kaka with that bullshit, it's clear that this guy has no idea what he is doing, should've been sent off.
Imagine being a ballon d’or winner, rocking up to a charity game to have some fun and you nearly get your ankle broken by some skinny bitch who screams at children for a living.
Invite Roy Keane and Vinnie Jones next time please
This happens when you let some dumb American influencer who thinks he has learnt to play football in the last 2 months.
Red card
Thats basicly a red card right there. I mean if you look at him running up all that way, going in from behind in the middle of nowhere only to hit the ankle... fuck that dude whoever that is.
That's red
Should've been a straight red
Should have been red
I have no idea who this clown is but still hate him and this timeline.
Someday this prick will be treated accordingly in one of these events (likely from someone who isn't a YouTuber so that they aren't concerned about his audience) and he'll hopefully tone down this "character"
Fucking shit for brains little cunt, what a sad world. That there’s enough little wankers out there that like him, to have given him this platform is utterly depressing
I can’t believe this guy is sharing the pitch with Kaka, even if it is a casual match it still doesn’t make sense. 

it’s also worth noting that this was all possible because he said “sewy” in a freaking stream lmfaoooo
That’s actually cuntish. Not because it’s Kaka but because if anyone does that sort of shit they are a cunt.
He got up after the tackle and thought it was good. He thought going studs first into the back of Kaka's leg and missing the ball completely was a good tackle.
Even though I despise Speed for so many reasons, I’m starting to find the level of football terrrorism he’s permitted to partake in pretty funny. This guy is basically a nobody and he keeps getting invited to these things, only to two-foot players in charity matches and troll world class managers like Wenger. This sport has become so absurd that someone like him would be involved on any level with literal legends of this game. 

If anyone wants to be mad about this, they should be more mad at whoever is inviting him to these events and making a laughing stock of them.
On a charity game playing like this Fuck that kid whoever he is.
this kid is such a dumb cunt, so annoying
Wtf this guy studs up on a legend in a charity match and then complained the yellow too. 

Damn this is pathetic as well because isn’t one of his bits being a huge fan of the sport? And he gets to play with some goats and treats em like this?
Thought this was r/soccer not r/ImTheMainCharacter
Hes easily one of the most unlikable social media persons out there. He's gonna get his ass handed to him one day like 69 got beaten up in some bathroom. He's racist, rude, and scams his followers. And has no respect for the game. Imagine going studs first from behind during a charity match on kaka, one of the most likeable footballers ever. Stupid fuck.
Somebody call Junior Baiano
Should’ve given red card
Ban him from this sub
Who fouled Kaka? 

What a cunt.
Literally anything to gather the spotlight.
Prick
I’m tired of this guy
What a shitshow this youtuber is.
Not sure why this asshole is so popular amongst young football fans... He is obnoxious af, sucks at playing, and shows zero respect or knowledge about the game.
Why do they keep inviting this POS?
This kid is annoying af, why are legends around this guy ?
I knew he was brain dead but now i believe that he never had a brain at all the way he slided in.
I hate this prick. Very annoying. Also its a charity match against legends, who the fucks going in for tackles like that!
I can't fault him for the way he's made a name for himself and even somehow managed to attend the Ballon D'or event, but my God he's an insufferable c\*nt.
That kid is a fucking scumbag
Stupid fuck. Stop inviting him from now. Kaka's career is already over.
This dude is a huge piece of shit
Wtf is that, this piece of shit always doing the most stupid thing possible, can’t believe there are people that follow him
Why is this lunatic IShowSpeed allowed on the field?
fuck this guy
I swear these influencer’s have too much ego , they are allowed to do anything 
That is so disgraceful …
That's a straight red tbh
That should have been red straight away, what a fking jerk
Then the idiot got up and started walking away like he just sacked an NFL quarterback.
If only this dude played hockey instead.  A yellow would be the least of his worries after a play like that.
Maaan, fuck this guy! Not sure how this dude is famous and well-liked. 

Fuck. This. Guy.
Why are they letting idiots like that play with legends? Smh
Not even funny. This is one of the greatest players of all time. Retried. He can seriously injure him. 
This new generation humor is just stupid already
This has to be a simulation.
He is not funny anymore. I know some will find it funny anyways but you have to understand that he is not a professional footballer and as a result this type of slides can be actually harmful to the opponent if not done right.
This mf is a piece of shit anyone thinks he is cool  need to see a doctor
Who is this person?? How dare he do that to Kaká?
Idiot
Why is people inviting this clown to ANYTHING?
Get these pieces of shit out of sports. To have him even playing in the same game as kaka is disrespectful as fuck.
From behind, studs up, that’s a red
Straight red
Should have been a red
This guy is such a attention seeking piece of shit, and no, it's not just because of this tackle
Imagine a legend like Kaka now has to suffer this. This is truly the worst timeline.
God I hate this cunt
Fuck him, can't stand Speed
If he can’t understand basic safety rules he shouldn’t be playing in charity matches with legends of the game.
Man, I wish this sub stops posting about Speed. Why the hell is he even famous.
This guy is gonna live a miserable life once he becomes 30+ years old. It’s gonna be like ten times the lameness that those once a year reality tv stars live once the money comes in and he realises no one cares about him.
Surprised he didn't get Red, I'd change it to Red after seeing his little tantrums....
Fucking idiot. This made me angry and i didnt even watch a single game of Kaka back in the day, i just know he is a legend.
He doesn’t know the game…that’s what happens when you invite an athletic guy that doesn’t know
I’m from the US, not a huge soccer fan, but even I can say, this sport is way too dangerous to have out of control amateurs playing. Basketball, Football, Baseball, no problem, there’s not much you can do as an amateur to really hurt someone. I played travel soccer growing up, you can seriously injure someone playing like an asshole.
When will someone punch the kid in the face? 

Cunt needs a reality check.
Clown. And even bigger clowns following this guy.
This guy’s face I just want to punch OMG!!!
More Americans ruining the game.
[deleted]
Call me old fashioned but this toolbag is what is wrong with society today. Acting like a complete dickhead and obviously has no respect for Kaka or anyone with actual football talent. It’s a fucking charity match that you should have no business even playing in buddy. If his foot was planted he probably hurts him badly.
Horror tackle, more like IShowStuds
r/iamthemaincharacter
Almost ended his career my fella
Who is Ishowspeed?
companies must be desperate to keeping inviting this guy. I only hear bad things about him.
all he had to do was just apologize and show some compassion and all would be fine, nothing wrong with attempting a slide tackle and missing it, but acting like that's not a foul and just turning your back and walking away is a cunt move.
The smooth, stylish way he absolutely fucked that up is crazy
The internet makes the most unhinged lunatics famous and then acts all surprised lol
Needs a Teddy Sheringham style buckling
How this guy is semi famous is beyond me he’s a clown and this is disrespectful to one of the greats. Very careless. I know he lives for clicks and laughs but this is just reckless
Yellow!?!?! Thats at least 3 games is this guy fucking nuta
Why is he everywhere? Who looks at him and thinks "He's a good person to get the views in?"

Oh God, he's getting the views, isn't he.
He's never playing in one of these again. Can't believe anyone finds this guy interesting at all.
Should have given him a red card right there. You could tell Kaka was irritated.
Fucking thrash. Just because you are online famous does not mean you can do this for clout. Morals and principles are still part of being a human being. Just don’t be an asshole….
They have to let this lunatic stop playing with legends. Could have really hurt Kaka’ there for literally no reason
Guess he’s not getting another invite anytime soon.


On a side note, I wonder if he could get away doing that to a hardnut like Vinnie Jones
Hell no man. You don’t do that to kaka. This is some BE
Wait what the fuck, in a charity game? With that protest afterwards? Is this real?
Kaka! Always a gentleman. What an awesome human being. Don't promote the other guy.
Thankfully Kaka hadn't planted his foot on the ground or this would have been much worse
Google search was def my friend after reading this.
disgusting. this f\*cker does this move all the time and thinks that is interesting. He deserves a punch in the face instead of all the hype he got.
What a cunt
He is a fucking idiot. Let’s leave it at that
why do they invite someone who has absolutely no ball knowledge. like everyone knows how to do a fair tackle in a charity match. if you ever played football you know how to slide without going for the foot. you know the timings. its an easy going game and this guy goes full contact
an internet troll playing with soccer legend

now i have seen everything 

social media has ruined any credibility and any idiot can become famous

sad
Disgusting tackle, that was before I even knew it was a charity match.  Sorry to be uneducated but who is that animal?
That is a red card lmao… what kind of ref is that ?
Bro got some nerve doing that 💀
wait speed is on a soccer team now
This is a red card
Happens when you make mindless people celebrities.
Thank god kakas leg was in the air because it would end terrible
How did we get to a point where a fucking "youtube influencer" who plays FIFA all day is playing a charity match with former football legends?
People are mad mad, kinda funny how you guys keep promoting him tho
I’m a Liverpool fan

But if you told me Ramos could two foot this asshole tomorrow I’ll pay for his flight
Why do people even like this degenerate?
I fucking hate this guy
Why is this looser on the pitch tho?Why is he in this charity match?How did he contribute to football to be on the same grass as one of the greatest players of all time , Kaka !? …. ohhh wait a minute, he barks for views/money … makes sense now !
Fuck this stupid ass clown.
This is a clear red card. That ref is bad.
You can’t invite him to one of these events ever again. You just can’t. There’s plenty of famous people to fill a pitch. You don’t need this clown.
imo that's a red any time of the day.

From behind, full speed, hits player first.
deserves prison time tbh
He is very lucky Kaka had no weight on that foot at the time of impact, and it could freely move through the air and flip him to the ground. That way his whole body kind of took the shock. If the tackle was half a second later, when his foot would be planted on the ground, he could have done a lot of damage. I hope somebody slaps up this dude pretty soon.
Proper cunt move to do it in a charity match too.
Doing this to an active Kaká is a sin
The worst part is that he probably doesn’t know who Kaká is
Straight to jail.
But the children keep giving him clout, they probably don't even know who Kaka is
Should have to taste Pepe, Alves, Costa or even Paulinho Santos for the portuguese special so he wont do shit like this ever again
I fucking hate this guy and I have no idea why he is popular
Kaka is 40+, his mind probably still thinks in terms of how things were in the pre-influencer age and he doesn't expect this moronic shit. Probably will think twice before doing another charity match.
wtf is this dude even doing, and he had the audacity to protest the yellow?
If I was Kaka and new speed was also invited to whatever I was, I would decline for that reason.
Thank god his foot wasn’t planted
For sure, why play when a gobshite like that is looking for a headline or a meme of your busted leg.
To anyone. That's the kind of shit that would start fights at any level of the game, and actually dangerous.
He's an idiot what did you expect lmao.

The fact he even gets invited to stuff like this is sad.
I don’t know why I find ‘actual Kaka’ so funny, but I do. 


As opposed to ‘impostor Kaka’, whose legs you’re welcome to break.
This shit pisses me off so bad hahaha. You know how badly millions of kids would love to get on the pitch with Kaka. Zero respect for a legend. Sad to see.
That’s exactly why he did it. For the clout.

How this guy is relevant to anyone over 14 is beyond me.
Does he even know that Kaka belongs to Jesus?
He has zero clue who Kaka is.
How this clown is not banned from the internet is beyond me
Kaka such a gent. This guy didn’t even apologize. Charity game and he does this..! wtf!! Idiota al 1000%
Went off like he'd made a worldie tackle, I have difficulty believing he didn't know.

Even so his reaction to being booked was a bit off. This isn't ~~FIFA~~ EAFC, lad. You could actually hurt someone.
What about not actual kaka? Fair game?
the worst one
A guy who wasnt even born when Kaka was already in his prime risking injury of said legend. That timeline 
Someone delete this save and do a hard reset please
Best comment in a threat full of missed opportunities
Isn't that the guy that pulled out his wiener during a live Twitch stream? He didn't got cancelled? Too bad...
Well this is a charity match and I'm sure some of his followers will donate... But yeah, someone has to tell him before the match starts that it's not that serious...
Unfortunately the organisers of things like this don't care what the people they invite are actually like. They only care that they get traction online and have huge audiences within the demographic they want.
Pulling shit like this is literally his career
Who is that?
sergio ramos and pepe should recieve the honor of 2-foot tackling ishowspeed
I volunteer as tribute
That’s what I was wondering. Where is the pay back? Any one with two brain cells can see what a dangerous play that is and I’d be first to volunteer to give that clown a forearm shiver to the back of the head.
If I ever play in one of these (which I won’t) the first thing I would do is twat that cunt Speed
Kaka seems too nice to do a revenge 2 foot.
Not only that but he is know by almost every pro football player born in the 2000s and he travels around the world because he had some funny reactions to FNAF jumpscares
R9 is just too cool as a person.
what does this have to do with this though? 😭☠️(ik im gonna get the downvote of doom)
I hate that he didn't handle the Ballon D'Or with care. Even knocked it against the shelf.
I want to say without sounding ignorant or dumb, but wouldn’t be surprised if Ronaldo got some incentives from letting
Him do so 💰
Exactly. He's literally just obnoxious and has multiple racist incidents. 

Fuck him
Kids

No self-respecting football fan likes this douche. He’s painful.
Yup. I get that it is a charity event but cant have him on the field doing shit like that. Take him off the pitch.
Without a doubt it’s a red. 

I would have walked off if I was Kaka. That’s studs to the outside of an ankle. Extremely dangerous.
Thing is nobody wants to give a red card at a charity game, so a yellow card is the most severe it gets most times. Obviously if he does it again he's off but it dampens the spirit of a charity match to do that. He's a little turd though so if anyone's going to get sent off in a game like that, it's him. He probably doesn't give a shit about any charity this is meant to be helping he just wants to show legends he's better than them.
Scrolled to far to find someone actually saying this was a red card. Was starting to think if it was only me thinking he should've been sent off.
Straight red. Studs up and from behind. See ya, bozo
That tackle is so fucking insane, Kaka couldve been very seriously injured especially seeing he probably isnt as fit as he used to be
Really hope someone done him in after this.

Deserves a little payback.

Get Lee Cattermole on the pitch.
It should have been red. No excuses for that behavior.
If he actually played normally it wouldnt get him views. This is the same dude that is only popular because he barks on stream and says Ronaldo name weird.

He probably didnt even have an intention to win the ball with that tackle
[deleted]
it’s what he does. in the first ever charity match he played he made a reckless slide tackle like 30 seconds into the game
he doesnt know anything about the sport and is only here because he's popular with kids
I’d be surprised if he even knows who Kaka is
Man if “accidentally” flashing his dick on stream to his audience of mostly children didn’t stop him I don’t think anything will.
Good luck limiting millions of his under 18 fans from watching him
I was gonna say in Sunday league tackles like that start a brawl.
Been that way for more than 30 years mate
There is one tiktok girl who makes the sound of popcorn and uses a hair straightener to pop it. The world is crazy.
Yeah not like steve-o and johnny knoxville were famous 25 years ago for having snakes bite their cocks or whatever
Because he will attract views from the demographic that the organisers want.
seriously, if kaka hadn't just had his foot up because he passed the ball he would have definitely had a serious injury .. i think speed is too much of a moron to actually know why what he did was wrong and dangerous
yeah, completely horrific scenes. Issue is, I've seen him two-foot other players too (KSI is not a footballer but he was playing football in a charity match). Risking a potentially life-changing injury for some extra clicks has got to be a symptom of psychopathy. Dude earns enough money, he can also get views by barking at people or I dont know farting in their faces or whatever his fans like. But actually risking a life-changing injury multiple times is so horrific.   
People still promote him cause so many people only care about the money.
It's part of the "joke"
its more f\*\*\*ed up that he did to Kaka, one of the nicest football players (active and/or retired) ever!!
People like this have been made famous for decades. It's nothing new.
If you're ever unsure why someone on the Internet is famous...it's because of 8-12 year olds.
Won the ballon d'or in 2008
Big streamer/youtuber/influencer/idiot
Sewey
Some dickhead who got famous for saying stuff loudly.
The guy that got his meat exposed
And drogba too, the guy who was apart of unstoppable Chelsea in mid 2000’s
Honestly would have walked off if I was Kaka, or would have personally escorted the kid off the field if I was another player who regards Kaka the way I do.
This calls for Nigel De Jong.
Anybody got Julian Dicks number?  Or Stuart Pearce?
I ask this question so many times. The kid makes a nuisance of himself every time he is around professionals.
Tbf it's not the same doing it to a 40-year-old lol
Like if I was on a pitch with these dudes my biggest concern by far would be don't fuckin hurt someone lol, stay on your feet. 

The whole influencer / internet personality culture is so selfish. It's breeding a generation of people who are completely shameless.
Your sentence is not sentencing
I choose ramos/pepe to do this job
This guy's playing football you're on reddit realistically who's gonna win?
Not just because it's against a legend, it's a fucking disgusting tackle. If Kaka has his weight down his lower leg becomes two pieces, it's awful. 

I get this is Speed's whole thing, being an agro maniac for entertainment, but this is straight up dangerous.
Yep, thats an ankle breaker if the foot was planted with weight.
Kind of looked like it was about to be eduardo da silva injury
For me it's baffling that Speed didn't even bother apologizing or giving a fuck about Kaka's condition after the challenge..
On brand for Ishowspeed then. Guy is one big walking cunt
Guy famous for being a massive cunt behaves like a massive cunt. Who could have guessed such a thing would happen?
no way speed could catch a active Kaká
Or like that time Gabby Agbonlahor tackled that member of One Direction so hard he threw up
Would enjoy seeing him get Pepe'd. Or get a taste of Ramos. Or both.
He play FIFA and yell loud

Like KSI but even KSI had respect for the game or something
He's loud and acts stupid so kids with super low attention span because they're from the scrolling generation think that is entertaining.
Because he won the world cup with Brazil, the champions league with Milan and much more.
Lots of kids in the world with unlimited access to social media and internet. 

A sane adult wouldn't find him entertaining
Because kids think loud = funny and he is indeed very loud
i don’t understand the entire concept of streamers. they’re worse than influencers in my opinion. they started off playing video games but now they just do basically anything (and sometimes nothing and i’m not exaggerating. this dude has literally had streams of him just sleeping) and people hype it up.
That's how I feel about every streamer and YouTuber. I am old lol
So many of the modern popular influencers/streamers are incredibly insufferable, and are as far from being good role models as possible.
Kids love him. His audience is not older than 17.
Loud = funny. Worked for Tyler1 in league too and many others.
I didn’t consider that. If I was a 40 or 50 yo legend I’d be looking at that and thinking “no thanks mate”. I’d sit the next one out if there’s going to be twats like that out there.
It's all part of the shtick, no doubt the fans of his that saw all that think that shit is hilarious
Reacting like that to everything is basically all he does 24/7.
Mate I'd never heard of that guy before this thread so I'm pretty sure a 41 yo like Kaka has no idea who the fuck that is
Yeah this is an actual piece of shit move
[deleted]
and Kaka is such a chill guy that he just sat there thinking 'Jesus, I thank you for not making me a bitch such as this guy'
Was lucky Kaka started swinging his leg to kick the ball just before contact or it could have ended badly
That's a straight red all day. Amazing he only got a yellow.
That's actually a red. Studs up high.  
Lucky the foot wasn't planted. Imagine being Kaka playing in a for fun charity game and getting your foot broken by a stupid kid.
These are situations in which I wish we could turn on hockey rules for a few minutes. Let the enforcers do their thing.
Who is he?
Not only that, he's pretty universally loved outside of Reddit. I don't understand people that feel a need to look at this kind of guy, like he's a hero
Tbf there is like 7 different Kaka’s (albeit none of the others even come close to “actual kaka”) who played football professionally
Of course he does. Don't fall for his act
have you tried contacting the internet police?
Never should've killed that gorilla

The thing is this is his “character” he’s playing up to his fans when he does things like this (diving in two footed and then arguing as if it was a fine challenge) and that will likely lead to more donations.

The issue is though, he could have seriously hurt Kaka here… That’s a horrible challenge, you can’t throw your body around like that. He’ll seriously injure someone if he carries on doing stuff like this
follower's mothers*
> Well this is a charity match

Well... it's a sports washing event masquerading as a charity match.
Until someone who was invited to the event gets injured because of this piece of shit and then no one wants to attend anymore
>I'm sure some of his followers will donate...

Unlikely. I don't think anyone above the age of 12 follows this annoying prick.
Yeah those 11 year olds can afford to donate for sure
Will they donate? His followers are 12 yr olds with no money
It’ll be like an Inazuma Eleven power kick, but the leg-breaking version.
Those two they can chop heads on the field and will only get a yellow card. How ? I don't know. neither you or the referees know either
Plus scamming his own fans, don't forget
I’m so curious to know about Speed’s racist incidents now. What did he do?
And yet Ronaldo fans still exist 🤷‍♂️

(Mostly tongue in cheek... mostly)
If he legs get planted he could’ve easily broke his ankle. Luckily kaka raised his leg to control to ball
I’ve seen younger players get serious ankle injuries from these tackles , absolutely ludicrous that he would do this in a charity match
I’d love to see Roy Keane just come on to the field to break Speed’s legs like he did to Haaland tbh
"He probably didnt even have an intention to win the ball with that tackle"

Yeah that was what I was thinking, hugely reckless challenge, studs up and nowhere near the ball, just took Kaka out. Absolute joke of a tackle.
He also got famous because he made a rape threat live on twitch
He absolutely did not have any intention of winning the ball lmao
People asking whats the point, as they give him free publicity...hmm
Why is he invited then?! Seriously? We need to stop giving these kinds of idiots fame
To a degree but it's pretty hard to argue against the fact that social media has significantly lowered the bar.
She isn't doing dumb shit like this at least lol.
To be fair, most of the jackass stuff was doing stuff to themselves or each other not random people or celebrities in a charity match.
Are you really comparing Jackass to this guy? Jesus...
I didn’t know it was 8-12 year olds who voted trump (a rapist) into office
2007*
If he is actually influencing anyone that makes me worried for humanity
Isnt his entire football fame because he said Ronaldos name in a weird american way
Forget escorting, I might have thrown hands at that clown.
On a sunday League game this idiot would get a fist in his face. Unbelievable unnecessary
I’m looking forward to the cunt mistiming it one match and someone stamping on his chest. I have no idea how he’s ‘famous’, just an aggy little prick.
Is this guy an ass? I have never heard of him beyond this haha
Spud couldn't catch a flying shit out the arse of an active Kaka.
Ex Doncaster Rovers player Louis Tomlinson
KSI at least watched football and played it since he was a kid. This guy just farmed it for fame.
KSI was genuinely a football fan and knew the game enough to be a FIFA/football content creator. Also even though he yelled a lot I thought some of his stuff was genuinely funny beyond loud = funny (which might just be because I watched him when I was young though)
He's a total fucking idiot. The worst kind of social media doughnut. I'm not sure why football organisations are pandering to the berk.
I saw a video where KSI played sunday league years ago. He was a solid defensive midfielder and made good tackles.
He actually doesn't even like football and didn't know anything about it, someone asked him which footballer he likes during his fortnite stream and he said "crister ronaldu suuuii" and that's how his football arc started.
KSI is not even on the same level, he is actually respectable.
It’s one thing entirely for Speed to do this exact tackle to KSI last summer in the sidemen charity match. Something else entirely to do this to a retired legendary pro like Kaka. Hopefully Speed is never invited back to these things
Don't love the screamy act but KSI and the Sidemen seem sound in general. Some of them are proper decent Sunday league players too like Miniminter or Tobi.

Speed is just a cunt
Wow. Really not giving him credit for his success. Have you even heard him bark before??
KSI AFAIK is a real arsenal fan since he was a kid, he genuinely loves the sport. I can't say the same about Speed.
KSI was genuinely funny though back in his early FIFA days. Ishowspeed on the other hand...
Scrolling generation 💀
How do those kids with super low attention spans watch his streams for hours man 😂 I barely lasted 5 minutes before saying this isn’t for me honestly
Crushed man united!
This. His gimmick is being outrageous and over the top. I keep thinking about a video during the WC 2022 where one of his staff ("entourage") told him something of the sorts "OK, so we're going to tell you now that Cr7 is not playing" and speed's reaction is "we're live \*pointing to the camera\* \*pause while figuring out what to do\* but BRO WHAT?? CR7 IS NOT PLAYING??" (or something of the sorts, this is all from memory) 

It's all an act. He's not the stupid one for selling it, we are for buying it

Edit: formatting. Why the f does the reddit app still thinks it's 2010 and when I type an asterisk, it assumes that I don't want to type an asterisk but italic the text??
Dude is an actual piece of shit so this should surprise no one
Well he surely seems like an insufferable piece of shit so it's on par
He is a piece of shit.... So it is kinda fitting.
Why is anybody surprised by this, kid is an absolute disease
On brand for this idiot then because that's exactly what he is.
It's because he has done it in Sidemen charity matches and they're all youngish and take it with humour and expect it, I don't think he appreciates this setting if very different
[deleted]
Yeah, but I assure you that his first instinct was to be pissed off, lmao, it's human and physical violence draws something very visceral. He just understands that it is only a kid and a friendly game.
Twitch streamer and clout chaser
Speed is an interesting phenomenon where that guy went from "being canceled for an internet rape threat" to meeting Ronaldo and being an arguably noted attendant at WC. 

Take that what you will. Motherfucker waa so outrageous that he got a career out of it.
I didn't know who this trash is before today and apparently he has 20+ million subscribers in spite of being an immature misogynist and racist.

This world sucks.
Too many kids with unvetted access to social media from an early age. They're exposed to all these scammers and vapid influencers that poison their minds with terrible values and dumbing them down in pursuit of making some money. It's honestly really sad.
Oh yeah? Name one.
people always say this, but he is constantly looking foolish. Nobody is that good of an actor. He's a moron.
I doubt that he has no football knowledge or capability and only started it for clout, it's not like he watched it anywhere near that time
[The world is stranger than fiction](https://i.insider.com/57b21c27dd089566768b4672?width=1200&format=jpeg)
The thing is, he can stay in character while minding everybody else’s safety. This looks specially bad because this moron tackled from behind, with velocity, like he was intentionally going for Kaka’s foot.
There's a difference between staying in character and being dangerous. Like he could have legit fucked Kaka up here. If this guy (never heard of him before this thread) wants to be a douche and argue with the ref, fine, but everyone knows you don't slide tackle from behind, let alone with studs up.

I'll use Tyler1 (one of the only twitch 'personalities' I know of) as an example. The dude is a rage machine, but he doesn't scream at people and try to hit them when they do those streamer matches at League of Legends tournaments (at least as far as I'm aware, I don't follow him either so I probably wouldn’t know if he did).
IShowSpeed is at fault but it would be fucking mental (and I think very likely) that the organisers didn’t tell this kid who and HOW not to tackle
How brain damaged you have to be to be fan of this clown
>Plus scamming his own fans

Dunno why but i end up hearing this shit about almost 80-85% of YouTubers/Social media stars who get viral all of a sudden.

I
that Metaverse? he got away with that because he threw them under the bus and its owners were even bigger pieces of shit
Are you even an online celebrity at this point if you haven't scammed your own fans?
He's had an incident or two with asians. Google will probably give you more accurate info than my summarization :)
Yup, this comment string should be top. Clear red. And that clear red should lead to this single berry never being invited to these things again.


-edit-
Single berry works. But I meant dingle .
Honestly, this little shit deserves it more than Haaland Sr. Ever did
I'd bet money that it was intentional. Even if it's not, I don't see how this isn't a red for it being dangerous. It's a double footed tackle, at a high speed, and from behind. 



If this happened in an actual game, it wouldn't be strange for a fight to break out.
Yeah, on one hand I resent it because it's stupid and on the other hand I resent it because I absolutely could've uploaded videos of myself being a cunt on FIFA back in 2011
Not his name but what ronaldo yells during his celebration
yes he barely knows anything about the game lmao
sewey
Yes. His whole schtick is being a loud, angry, obnoxious arsehole, which unfortunately seems to appeal to a lot of young boys. And probably encourages them to behave like little twats too.

Aside from that, he has a history of making misogynistic comments and went on a show where 'influencers' would be paired up for dates and ended up threatening to rape the woman he got matched with. Oh, and he was caught being racist towards a Japanese football fan.

He also has history of doing this exact same kind of foul in previous charity matches.

Just an all-round cunt, and a corrosive influence on his young viewers. It's fucking insane that he keeps falling upwards after each scandal, and is being enabled and promoted like this.
This isn't even about football, it's about basic respect, disgusting
Three years ago this guy asked on his stream 

“How is soccer played and who should I stan?” 

People said Ronaldo. He started yelling “ Christianuu Ronaldouuuu” on streams and got famous. The world is a fucked up place tbh
I wasn't a big fan of KSI but I'm sure he wasn't/isn't nearly as obnoxious
If you look at football twitter as being full of people who don’t like or watch football and just want to troll and and be smug.
He didn’t start screaming until he made his “welcome to BEAST” videos. Before that he was just a disgruntled Arsenal fan that would make videos with legitimate criticisms on FIFA and EA
Eh if you watch his stuff with the Sidemen these days he's still pretty fucking funny
Haha yah I remember always watching Ksi’s content from around 14 years ago he was genuinely funny as it appeared from when I was a lot younger, i miss those days and his videos alot from back then
He was like one of the OG FIFA YouTubers as well.
They want the kids he brings 💀
Yeah eventhough i have issues with the guy, KSI is a genuine football fan and as a player, would be better than 99.9% of youtubers who didnt play professionally. Definitely cant question he likes the game and has decent ball knowledge.
They are pretty much men at this point though 😂 most of them are married and Ethan even has a kid
The guy is right the majority of his fanbase are under 13 years old just go look at his fanbase comments under any video speed has up on YouTube you can tell they are toddler aged children from how they write and the stupid shit they say lol
Favorite ever UCL goal is his vs United in the final of i wanna say 2007?
I'm a Barcelona fan but that Kaká goal had me cheering like a proper Milan ultra lol.

And yeah fuck speed.
Reddit has always used markup
[removed]
It didn't surprise me at all. Nor did the reaction.
Not sure it’s so much that as it is he’s genuinely oblivious
lol dude I’m the same age as all those dudes and if someone went studs up into me like that I’d fight on the spot. There’s no way those guys would be cool with a tackle like this
This is absolutely it. I've been in casual pickup games with people who have never really played the sport, and they attempt tackles like this because they've seen it on TV or when playing FIFA. They see it as a normal, acceptable part of the game no worse than a common foul. And they're confused when people get mad they just tried to break someone's leg.
Most likely the kind of people that hang around him for hand-outs are telling him he made a good tackle, and he dropped the "you shouldn't do that" crowd a while ago.
The people who continue to invite him to these charity matches are the real dumbasses. 
Exactly.. on Kaka's mind its probably "this kid doesnt know what hes doing"
Thanks. 

I fail to understand why this person is playing football with Kaka
Twitch streamer and dick rider.
And racist, don't forget that one.
You tube actually
Pretty sure **even** Twitch banned his shit.
Unfortunately, the state of our world is such that rape is glorified by a significant proportion of the population.
Kaka
Kaka.
Also Kaka
If i remember correctly, there's also a kaka
Don’t forget Kaka
pretending to be an idiot is one of the easiest roles you can play. i mean i wouldn't be surprised if he's genuinely pretty dumb/ignorant but he's 100% playing it up for the camera.
There are people out there who have literally made millions for making an ass out of themselves for views because people are dumb enough to not ignore the obvious act.
Youre a moron if you dont think he’s playing up lol
bush did harambe?
"It's just a prank bro" vibes from this guy.
From all accounts T1 is a really genuinely nice guy irl/at events, he just has the persona he has to keep up on stream lol
Not really, it's common sense not to jump into someone else like that, doesn't matter if it's Kaka or someone else
[deleted]
You're saying you don't enjoy watching a streamer who screams the entire time???
Not damaged, just not developed, his fandom consists of children.
This is why I only follow history battle channels on YouTube. But even then 50% of them are fascist so that's annoying.
I mean even you were a minor internet celeb on the liverpool sub reddit with your when i'm liverpool vids hahah
He is taking about his first viral video. A fan will ask him what is his favourite football team. He will say cristopher Ronaldo. That video went viral. So he made liking Ronaldo as his identity and even met ronaldo
Yeesh. I am surprised this guy gets invited to these matches. I can’t imagine any of these retired legends want to get their leg snapped by some little twat with anger issues.
Only athletes know not to hurt someone. People at my office are always trying to break my leg.
He's running the same schtick with Cricket now smh
Exactly he doesn't even care about football he just does this crap for views
Apart from the video where he goes around motor boating girls and the other where he humps random people.
KSI also wasn’t a massive misogynist and racist

Edit: turns out they both massive pricks
*Chris Hansen would like to know your location*
I know that, but there's having him there and then there's completely pandering to it. He should have been fucked off that pitch immediately after that.
Closest thing I can think of is Gvardiol fucking with him. Shit video but you get the point of how much of a jackass this guy is:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihjtbYXZV4A
He’s very aggressive in his mannerisms, I think most people just want to nope out.
Cause he’s not worth it and people know it’s his persona that makes him money. I think he lost himself too much in that tackle.
Yep, never got taught accountability and now with the wealth he’s accumulated, he never will learn.
So he is a piece of shit with no self awareness 
He was scamming his fans and there was a video of him acknowledging that.
I think they might understand it's not normal or acceptable in normal football, but have the mindset of "lol it's a charity match, watch me do something outrageous" without actually considering the damage it can do. Like they are running at the goalkeeper on FIFA and pressing X for the lols.
Such people are despicable, they should understand that a professional player has trained everyday to make sure his intent is to go for the ball and not break someones leg, an untrained noobie will definitely cause a long term injury.
P.S. My colleague has permanent knee damage from a slide tackle he faced, he cant use stairs or sprint anymore, he only uses his legs to walk slowly.
Because poorly raised 13 years-old think that being loud and rude is peak humour
He is unfortunately extremely popular with youths
Kaka is one of the most talented players in history, this clown doesn't deserve to share the same pitch with him.
A convicted rapist is running for president
And Kaká
And the Belgian legend La Kaka
He does play it up, but I think he's also the real deal
I've heard the same. Apparently he was kind of a dick when he was younger, but once he hit his early-mid 20s he mellowed out a ton.
As a former child, I don't think that's a good excuse
Even children should have higher standards
Lots of cunts
Ima be real here, i know a lot of adults who see speed as “their guy”. Like actually being invested and dick riding him.

Bizarre
Nikocado Avocado ftw\s
Tell me about it. I like military history but I run into way too many nazis along the way
Hah, I should've built my media empire when I had the chance. Love that people still bring those videos up though.
Oh yeah i got confused cuz he didn’t mispronounce Ronaldo he mispronounced Cristiano as Christian lmao
Same, and we don't even play sports.
And he will gain more followers. This is the world we live in today unfortunately.

I do appreciate youtubers and “influencers” that post good content. But his content is absolutely trash and somehow he draws a big audience.

On tiktok and instagram I had to click “not interested” 50 times before I could get rid of him.
"VAI-RAT COE-LEE" every fucking time an Indian shows up
No need to rewrite history lol he used to make rape jokes and racist jokes all the time
His biggest meme was rape face and he regularly made racist jokes about black people. There's a reason he distanced himself from his past a while ago.
Half of KSI's personality was actually being very racist towards Black people in his early fifa days.
Oh, he was pretty misogynistic or at least crossed the line often. The guy literally was describing how he wants to fuck his friend's (Casper Lee's) sister infront of him.
This is just a blatant lie lmao, KSIs entire career was founded on the edgy fifa guy
I knew this was coming the second I said that FML man 💀😭
Almost as cringe as that Nike hairstyle next to him
There was also the time he went to a favela and they pranked him

https://youtube.com/shorts/99bNRkSNeGs?si=OhpOi8L1CUYE5pUl
He was full on sprinting from at least 25m behind Kaka, the intent was fully clear from the beginning of the clip
the only thing worse than an asshole is a stupid asshole
That makes it worse lmao
Most times when I see this happen, it's not malicious just extremely dumb. They don't realize how dangerous it is
But organisers don’t need to drop to the level of who 13 year old think is popular! Especially when they can’t even donate.
just like every generation of 13 year olds before them
Fuckin yutes,  man.  When will they learn.
The country is doomed
When it comes to internet things kids are super super easy to manipulate, their logic goes something like loud noises/bright colors = funny and entertaining = can do no wrong
r/TheHound
hey man an 8 year old who likes speed is not a cunt it’s just a kid
May I have a link to those videos please?
Can't stand the guy but it's honestly a bit fucked up lmao
I didn’t say he wasn’t an idiot
He’s absolutely well aware of what he’s doing. From the mispronunciations, playing dumb about obvious shit, and this kind of crap. Dude’s willful, purposeful,  ignorance is making him millions and it’s gross af.

But then you see clips of how his PoS mom treated him when he first started streaming, before his meteoric rise, and you feel sympathy.
Views mean sponsors will pay the organisers
It’s a cuntlet well on its way to becoming a full grown cunt
The fact that this is getting downvoted is peak Reddit
Why can't children be cunts? I knew several at my school. Being a shitty human being doesn't suddenly happen at 18.
Y not both
I genuinely don't have one hahaha, think I have them on an old hard drive
and then I see this tackle on a ballon d'or winner, and that sympathy vanishes into thin fucking air
I haven’t heard too much about his mum. Can u tell me more?
I don't  know that part, what happened with his mother?
> Being a bad human being doesn't suddenly happen at 18.

I mean in the same vein being a good human doesn’t happen when you hop out the womb. 

I think it’s generally accepted that kids are shitheads, but after seeing at least 80% of the human population act like cunts in their youth you kind of become desensitized to it and just hope they grow out of it

The 'degrading' conversations between Real Madrid youth players about the sex video they made with minors have been revealed
In a shocking scandal involving Real Madrid's youth team, a leaked video and private chats have surfaced, shedding light on the disturbing behavior of several young players. The conversations, which include crude and demeaning language, expose a toxic culture among some of the club's promising talents.
From el Confidencial: https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2024-09-02/chat-canteranos-madrid-video-sexual-menor_3952363/

The Guardia Civil arrested several players from the Real Madrid youth academy a year ago. They are accused of participating in an orgy with an underage girl and another young woman whom they filmed without their consent. They then disseminated the videos ‘massively’. The investigators proceeded to dump their mobile phones and have recovered a multitude of conversations between those involved and other footballers from the club's youth teams. ‘The worst thing is that she was 16’, “but what bitches”, “they must be sluts”, “gypsy whore”. These are comments that are dedicated to the girls in their WhatsApp groups and even boast of having beaten them: ‘You are not aware of the blows (sic) that we hit’ ‘with the ass and face red as tomatoes’.

El Confidencial has had access to the reports of the Guardia Civil on the content of the phones sent to a court in the province of Las Palmas, where the events took place. They are being investigated for an alleged offence of revealing secrets and child pornography, punishable by up to five years in prison. The Guardia Civil concludes that they knew that one of the girls was a minor.

Also that, as this newspaper revealed, they received a tip-off that they were being investigated, which allowed them to delete evidence from their phones days before their arrest at the Valdebebas sports complex. The videos of the orgy have not surfaced, although stills and conversations in which they and their colleagues discuss the images have surfaced.

The consensual sexual encounter took place on 15 June last year. The four players were on holiday in the Canary Islands and met the two girls. They met at a beach club near the beach and booked a private cabin for which they paid 150 euros. Inside, three of them had sex with the girls. The girls realised that they had passed each other a mobile phone and when they had finished, they reproached them for having recorded them. They denied it, but lied. 

 They filmed them and shared several videos among friends and locker room mates. Weeks later, the minor found out that the images were circulating and filed a complaint. The Guardia Civil has established as a time reference the chats between 15 June when the events took place and the following three days.

The most enthusiastic when it came to sharing their sexual encounter was the investigated Juan Rodríguez Lima. There were many forwards and conversations found on his Iphone 14 Pro Max. The first image was sent to a group called ‘Whatever Ferrán wants’ in which there were 12 participants. There they are already talking about how Juan Rodríguez is getting a ‘blow job’. One of the participants focuses on the girl with derogatory comments: ‘What a slut’, ‘give it to her hard there’, ‘gypsy whore’, ‘where did you get those’. 

The ‘cabritinhas’ chat

‘What sluts they are’, says Juan Rodríguez himself, who warns the participants that “you can't tell, just watch”, “this is epic”, “such bitches”. Another of the detainees, Ferrán Ruiz, takes part in the conversation and exclaims ‘long live football’, ‘paradise, gentlemen’. At the time of the events, the players were aged between 20 and 21. The girls were 16 and 18 years old. The messages show how Juan Rodríguez (now a Tarazona player) boasts that one of the women is underage. He commented on this after sharing the images of the orgy in another chat called ‘cabritinhas’. In this WhatsApp group there were 13 other people.

‘If the worst thing is that she was 16 (years old) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA’, wrote Juan Rodriguez before explicitly detailing what the sexual act consisted of with some expressions that this newspaper has declined to reproduce. In the reports there are photos that were not deleted or that the Guardia Civil has managed to recover in which the players are seen with the girls and a hand slapping a buttock. In the chat room ‘cabritinhas’ one of the participants comments that ‘there is one that looks like a tomato’. Juan Rodríguez explains the reason: ‘From the slaps’. 

Extract from another of the conversations detected by the Guardia Civil. EC

On the same day of the events, Juan Rodríguez had another conversation, this time in private, with a contact called Andrés, to whom he again pointed out the age of one of the girls: ‘If I tell you her age, you'll freak out. HAHAHAHAHA. For what a slut she was. But don't say anything. His interlocutor replied that he was confident that she was of age: ‘2005 I hope’. However, the Madrid youth player boasted again that the girl he had recorded without his permission and about whom they were commenting on the sexual images ‘wasn't even 17. What a devil’. Juan Rodríguez also commented with this friend on the beatings of the girls: ‘It's just that the beating we gave her was abysmal’, ‘Me whipping her, whipping her’.
‘Me always without rubber’.

This footballer highlighted for the third time the minority of age in another conversation with a contact called ‘Golf Lima Terraza Brit’: ‘If I tell you the age, you cry. 06 (2006, the year of birth)’. In addition, Juan Rodríguez confessed that they had not used a condom: ‘I always use no rubber’. Although without leaving the jocular tone and the laughter, his interlocutor expressed his misgivings about what he had done: ‘Are you cool with that, I'm not cool with that’, ‘Bro, without a condom, with everyone, bua... bro, that would give me a hard time’, ‘But 06, bad vibe’. In the same conversation, the player's friend wonders ‘why are girls so dirty?

The images were shared again in another chat, in this case with five participants, called ‘Canariasic’ in which all the detainees were present. They commented on the recorded images of the sexual encounter they had had hours earlier: ‘This girl aint sleeping today’, “We've left a tattoo on her ass [from the slaps]”, “JAJAJAJAJA bro”, “She needed aloe vera”, “everywhere”, “talcum powder”.

Andrés García is another of those investigated and, according to his phone, he also shared the videos. He did so, for example, with a friend called Ángel, to whom he sent some images and the comment ‘Viva el fútbol’, which they use on several occasions. He sent him ‘a preview’ of the recording and promised to show it to him in its entirety at a later date. As in the previous cases, the interlocutor also reacted with vexatious comments about the girls: ‘They must be pigs...’. The player also received congratulations from another friend called Izan to whom he sent the sexual content: ‘You've fulfilled my dream, you son of a bitch’. The Real Madrid player consoled him: ‘Next one with you, little brother’. 

The third participant in the orgy was Ferrán Ruiz (now in the Girona reserve team) and the Guardia Civil found on his mobile phone that he also shared the videos. In his case, he sent them to a friend called Lara. Laughing, the girl told him that they were ‘pigs’. ‘What a filth, I'll kill you’, “I have no words, I'm freaking out”, “At what point do you start thinking about recording when you're like this hahahahahaha”, “I'm busting my ass”. 


 On the same day, 15 June, when the events took place, this other Madrid player sent the images to a chat room called ‘3 Queridas’. He shares it with two girls who also reacted with laughter and astonishment to the video sent to them by the footballer: ‘I'm freaking out’, ‘Surreal’, ‘I haven't seen anything heavier than this’. That same night, Ferrán Ruiz shared the video with a fourth woman to whom he described the violence used against the complainants in the private cabana at the beach club.

‘It is that you are not aware - he wrote to her - of the blows (sic) that we hit. She came out unable to walk, with her ass and face as red as tomatoes’. ‘What a beating (sic), bro’, she replied without reproaching the footballer's comments or what could be seen in the images: “What a couple of enjoyment”, “poor thing hahahahahah”. However, the player asked her not to say anything: ‘You, shut up hahahaha’.

The work of accessing the content of the phones has been carried out by specialists from the Cybercrime department of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Guardia Civil. The dump was carried out at the headquarters of the General Directorate of the Armed Institute in Madrid. The information was sent to the Juzgado de Instrucción number 3 of San Bartolomé de Tirajana (Las Palmas), which received a total of 8 hard disks with all the information.

In its conclusions, the Guardia Civil says that ‘it has been possible to verify that the sexual encounter with the underage victim and her companion was not only recorded’, but that those investigated ‘went so far as to affirm that this material would have been shared massively by Juan Rodríguez among his friends and companions’.
The details were pretty disgusting to read in autotranslate, I can’t imagine how much worse it is with a proper translation.
For the Americans who are confused, 16 is legal age in Spain, and most of Europe.

The issue is filming and sharing, mainly because while 16 is legal for intercourse it is underage for pornographic participation.

So not only did they film and distribute it without the girls' consent, they also broke the law for including a 16 year old in amateur porn.
**Person 1:** Dude dude.

**Person 2:** Some bitches. If I told you the age. You'll be mad. Ahahahahahah. For how dirty she was.

**Person 1:** 2005 I hope.

**Person 2:** She wasn't even 17 years old. What a devil.

🤮🤮🤮
People self snitching will never not astound me, and unfortunately the depths of people's mistreatment of other human beings for their own amusement will never surprise me.
Good riddance. OP, el Confidencial had a better article that named them
Long live football, bro what?
As someone who spent time in youth systems of multiple clubs in multiple countries in the '00s, I'm sad to say this is not that uncommon but now they text it instead of saying it in the locker room... it's disgusting but common, and the power dynamic makes it even worse.
You seriously think im going through all those cookies in spanish and then registering to read it anyway?
This is so fucked up
Real Madrid having someone in the police who tipped them off about the investigation  which led to players deleting files doesn’t surprise me in the slightest.
Ban them from ever setting foot on a pitch again. These bastards believe that they can do whatever they want  because they are professional footballers. Time to end that privilege. 


Also I hope that the guy who bragged about never using condoms gets a nasty little STD that accompanies him for the rest of his life. 
Yeah they should be banned. The Greenwood saga has already taught us that people don't care if the footballers are rapists, only their ability matters. It's time for some people to set a precedent by giving them a ban.
The “long live football” line is ominous as hell. They know they can get away with it because footballers always do.. Fuck Mason Greenwood
These fuckers should be banned for life or ban for good 15/20 years

They will realise that what they did was no joke
This is fucked up  man
Gross. Can’t really think of anything to say. Just fucking gross.
If it's football that's enabling them take it away from them and throw them on the street to beg for food. Finish their lives and set an example.
Can someone please translate this into English
What a terrible day to have reading comprehension. I hate the fucking world
[deleted]
Good thing they have great role models, like Benzema and Ronaldo, to look up to…
From that one screen cap:
> Player 1: You've fulfilled my dream, you son of a bitch

> Player 2: At what point do you start thinking about recording when you're like this hahahaha

> Player 1: I'm laughing my ass off

Well kids, your football dreams may be over.
Is it really that hard to not fuck a minor. Or at the bare fucking minimum not brag about like a fucking moron.
This it the most disgusting thing I’ve read in my life.
The worst thing about this is them bragging about **beating** these teenage girls. How sadistic and sick do you have to be to boast about beating someone during sex.
Benzema left a legacy in Madrid
What a sick trio, glad they got rid of them, but they will not be sadly in prison for this.
Send them to jail!
This is absolutely disgusting. Shameful behavior of the players and everyone involved who were involved in the distribution of the horrific videos. Anyone in involved in this child abuse ring should be rotting in prison for the rest of their lives.
Absolute criminal. Jail them all for life.
There's literally not a single mention of this on Marca or As
Put the cunts in prison.
this shit pisses me off so much I hope they go to prison instead of Saudi Arabia where they make millions.
Disgusting
They did this shit when they were nobodies!!! Can you imagine how much worse it'd be if these pieces of shit had star status or were sought after academy talents that are making a name for themselves and pushing for the 1st team?

Hit them with the most severe sentence you can get from this disgusting behaviour and make them an example for others to know this shit doesn't fly!
Not surprising, toxic club is made up of toxic ppl
Not gonna lie, I’m surprised this came to light. Madrid owns the media.
Honest question, wouldn’t the youth players be minors too?
Jeeeeeesus
Marseille have entered the chat
I've never felt as ashamed of my club as I do at this moment 🤮😡
These kids are treated like gods from such a young age, and they think they get to treat others like garbage? Can’t wait for them to get their education from FAFO University.     

Hockey Canada’s youth development culture is learning these same lessons. Hope we finally see some real change.
throw the books at those devils
Who are these mfs, why have they not been publicly named?
This is disgusting, goodness me
Viva El futbol? Now they'll have to kiss it goodbye.
Prepare for Negeira case to make a reappearance tommorow
Saudi league is in good hands
Awful for the girls to have experienced especially the minor
Doing it is another evil but the amount of times they felt such joy mentioning her age from their filthy mouths is atrocious. Fuck them, I hope they rot in jail forever and I hope someone does to them all the things they were proud about doing to that poor girl.
Crazy part is that Real Madrid received a tip of the team being investigated so they tried to delete the evidence
To clarify 16 is legal for sex in spain, but not for distribution of images/video.
i’m seeing some people acting surprised like this isn’t just your usual disgusting misogyny. stuff like is incredibly normalized everywhere, not surprising  that in this particular case it’s a footballing academy- rape culture is pervasive globally.
give them life
It’s almost like we shouldn’t be treating these kid prospects like superstars at such a young age.
I truly hate this world more and more every day
Incoming rapists going to Marseille next year.
Well that was a lot worse than the title made it seem, which was already bad
And these are the people we share a city with…
This is what happens when you turn your academy into a nepo baby feeding ground.
When you worship someone, don't be surprised when they think you are beneath them.
What a surprise. Footballers being footballers.
I see anything jeopardizing Real Madrid, I upvote.
This is, unfortunately, the future we've chosen.  We now have generations of young men raised on 24hr HD streaming pornography, and it's completely warped their minds and deranged their behavior.  These ones got caught as they're in the media spotlight, but this issue is a societal one, and it's not going to go away.
It took a year for this to come out and on day 2 of international break so it will be completely swept under the rug by the time league football comes back.

Perez is working double overtime on his PR machine.
Real players sleeping with underage girls? This is Madrid heritage.
is that a moghreb tetouan flair?
Perez will do his best to give them immunity and bribe the law as usual. Future benzemas in the making
Isn’t it a shock whose previous two star strikers were both rapists and they did nothing, has a culture of not respecting women amongst its players? Disgusting club
I'm confused


The age of consent in Spain is 16 and the girls were 16 and 18


Disgusting behaviour but not with underaged
Wait wasn't there a similar scandal 2 years ago or am I going crazy?
Humanity's probably doomed. I probably blame the internet. Although probably this same stuff happened 30 years ago as well. Some kind of toxic male culture, probably, probably...
Fuck me. Rotten club.
Wow
rot

 Goq
With just that screenshot... yikes

Disgusting. Hopefully they will be punished and not have a career.
I'm sorry, the WHAT
Spanish football can't catch a fucking break with these scandals man. We had just moved from Tebas excusing Greenwood and the whole Rubiales fiasco, and now we have this.
Why isn't this being labelled a rape case when it clearly is.

Nothing less than extreme punishment for these lowlifes.
Funny how this club reveals itself and its culture from time to time. Either way, people will forget this in a day or two…


Edit: The clubs last 2/3 ballon dor winners were rapists and pedos. I’m still downvoted. Just a normal reddit npc hivemind occurrence.
Stone them to death
I just assume this happens all the time
Estos chavales son unos tolilis.

What the fuck is Ferran Ruiz doing in our club? What a stain.

Those guys should not play football again.
they are not real madrid players for us anymore 

they don't deserve to be in this club 

poor generation 💔
If these were Barcelona players it would be all over the news
>the worst thing is that I was 16

that **she** was 16
> wrote Juan Rodriguez before explicitly detailing what the sexual act consisted of with some expressions that this newspaper has declined to reproduce

Props to the newspaper for the classiest possible way to go about that
If anyone spots glaring mistakes tell me and i'll do my best to edit it. DeepL is not the best
Wow man, that’s insane. Also that one dude who shared it to multiple girls who all laughed, weirdos.
Being a Real Madrid academy player means you would have been sought after as a footballer throughout your career no matter where you go. These players basically threw their futures away.
What the fuck. Bunch of weird little creeps.
"It is that you are not aware - he wrote to her - of the blows (sic) that we hit. He came out unable to walk, with his ass and face as red as tomatoes’. ‘What a beating (sic), bro’, she replied without reproaching the footballer's comments or what could be seen in the images: “What a couple of enjoyment”, “poor thing hahahahahah”. However, the player asked her not to say anything: ‘You, shut up hahahaha’."

Should probably be "she" rather than "he" in this bit
Golf Lima Terraza Brit is based as hell. It can be really hard to disagree with your friends, but being so forward in calling them out is admirable.
> In the same conversation, the player's friend wonders ‘why are girls so dirty?

Amazing level of self-awareness
> "I hope this groupchat message finds you well.

> I am writing to all of you today to inform you that I, a legal adult, have had sexual relations with a minor. I have also recorded myself having these sexual relations with said minor. These recordings are very explicit, and could well be described as "pornography", the minor, on account of her age, may colloquially be called a "child", and this act of sending these recordings could be described as "distributing".

> I want it to be clear that I am intensely proud of myself for creating and distributing these pieces of child pornography. These actions bring me much joy, let there be no doubt, should these messages ever find themselves read in front of, for example, a tribunal.

> I must cut this act of extreme self-incrimination short, as I have to spread this evidence of me being a sex offender to as many people as possible.

> Best,

> Juan Rodriguez Lima"
disgusting disgusting disgusting. it is so clear that they see football as the vehicle that allows them to be predators and protects them. football needs to change. we can't allow this scum to feel safe as predators and rapists
I can't even begin to describe how unbelievably disgusting all of this is
Scum bag kids get what's coming to them. Good

Scum bag kids get what's coming to them. Good

> The videos of the orgy have not surfaced

Wouldn't it be illegal to share them seeing as the girls were underage?
God I feel sick to my stomach
What also stuck out was in the description it say how the players involved are more or less still on teams and have some involvement in their dream career, living a near consequence free existence after inflicting unspeakable damage to the young girls. They themselves joke about how the girls won't be right after this, in between laughing it off and calling them names of course. I don't know what awaits them judicially and/or karmically but it will be nothing in contrast to the hell the girls have to live with.
not to defend this behavior, because it is disgusting, but it isn’t as bad with a proper translation. still gross and demeaning, but based on what i read in another comment that sounds like auto translate, it comes out worse because auto translate doesn’t understand most slang.
This is pretty much the same in most of America.  Age of consent is a state law so it varies by state, but videoing a minor in a sex act, even if you're a minor, is illegal by federal law.
16 is the legal age for 60% of America.
So what will they be charged with?
That’s good info. These people deserved to have the books thrown at them.
''Long live football" 🫠
Person 1 seems to have a moral compass at least.
😕
16 is legal, it's the recording that's the issue on this
Consenting age is 15-16 I think so...
"They're not confessing, they're bragging"
Rap snitches telling on their business
It's all hubris and ego.  Ego is always the reason these idiots get caught.
Hey, don't tell anyone while I tell everyone!
Can you imagine how many similar things like this got swept under the rug or completely ignored because the perpetrators are just smart enough to not expose themselves?

Then there's the problem where only 5% of rape cases are reported to police, and only 3% of that 5% made it to court. Yet there are so many here who'd quickly defend suspects saying they are innocent until proven guilty.
Love it. It doesn't get much better than a criminal making it really easy for the police by exposing themselves this way.
This is what people who don’t expect consequences do. Let’s hope they weren’t  right

Football has given them fame and money, so access to a world of debauchery. And they love it.
I don't know if it ever made it to the general news but in Madrid youth prospects from different teams would pool money together to rent a nice house and use it to take girls there
I played American football at a high level from 2007-2010 and I'm sad to say that reading this didnt surprise me at all. I have heard conversations about the exact same shit in the locker room many times before. So many times I saw a woman with a teammate knowing that she thought there was a chance they could be something, while simultaneously knowing that he saw her as nothing more than a sex toy. Many times these women would bounce from player to player multiple times before they finally realized what was happening.
Not in the same arena but worked in a tool hire shop for a while with a friend. There was a young lad working with a big utility contractor who went off to Wales for work. He came in bragging about getting sucked off by an underage girl in exchange for ciggies and filming it, he didn't think there was anything wrong with is, he was roundly lambasted by the chaps in the shop one of the owners had a daughter about the same age at the time.

think the youngers are cooked already, whatever the arena.
Not only in football, showbiz in general is notorious for this. So many rappers want minors provided for them or their entourage after concert.
Or hell, just in groups of young men in general.

I was 18/19 a decade ago when there prevalence of sending nudes, filming stuff on phones, etc, was only really just starting to make it into people's sexual practice.

I remember one time a mate of mine came back from a big night out in Newcastle and told me one particular twat from our school had his phone out in the club showing everyone nudes of a girl a lot of us where friends with at the time.

Always some abysmal, insecure, empathyless lads doing this stupid shit at that age. And beyond as well, obviously, but especially as young men.
Yup, there’s a reason I made 0 friends when I was in the academy systems and when I moved to NA to play college football it was the same. It sucks but in most sports, the average prospect is an illiterate piece of shit.
I am pretty sure this mentality is prevalent in other top clubs and countries too. Any place where young boys grow up together is likely to have many boys with messed up thinking.
Rugby too. Played for many teams and there was always an element of it. Someone even snuck in to my room and filmed me with a swedish girl on tour when I was ~18, got to come home to Dads/Mens team players in the clubhouse who'd already been sent it coming over to "congratulate" me in one way or another.
it's not nice I'll tell you that

>u/flyingbird2345: Suggests consequences for rich/famous/high status people  
Society: haha u wot m8
I am confused about the Greenwood/Partey comparisons and the "rapists" discourse in this thread in general. There appears to be nothing to suggest that these girls were raped? The article even specifically states that it was consensual. 

The issue here is that they filmed it and it's an issue because 1) they did not agree to being filmed 2) one of them was not 18 so they were effectively creating CP even though the minor was 16 which is the age of consent where this took place.

I absolutely consider these guys to be vile and they should be banned and face the legal repercussions of what they did. But they were never accused of rape.

Edit: Maybe a point of the confusion is the alleged "beating"? I'm interpreting that as slaps, which could be consensual. I'm not seeing anything alleging that they were literally beating them up. At that point the encounter would obviously not be consensual, but the article does describe it as consensual.
never going to happen
Greenwood/Partey 👀
Why are you talking about a football ban if you want them to realize that just throw them in jail. A year or two would accomplish a lot more than a ban imo.
At least some months jail time, counseling, damage repair, and community service. But most probably are well connected, and won't happen.
[deleted]
Too much money to be made, same reason this is tolerated in lots of environments. Plus yeah, a lot of powerful men really don’t care about women (adult or minor) anyway.
They're basically boasting they physically abused the girls ("we hit them until their faces and butts were deep red..."), that they were minors, that they never used condoms...
What ended up happening to the World Juniors r*pists? Haven’t heard about it in a while …
Oopsie, don't u dare to put a bad light on so called "legends" in here 🤭
They’ll follow in the footsteps of the esteemed Sadio Mane and groom a 15 year old into an arranged marriage before she finishes school
Pls brag, so that we can arrest you
Best he can offer is document it and incriminate himself further while involving others. I think sending the images and videos also puts the [uninvolved] recepients at risk. Unforgivable behavior.
They aren’t minors though since age of consent in Spain is 16. It isn’t America.
Well apparently it’s legal to actually fuck then because age of consent is 16 there, but the big no no is recording them so the porno part is illegal
but..but..all Youtube stars are doing it!

PS: Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with people
Ooof you are in for a wild ride if you have been this sheltered so far. Good luck 
It's like something you'd hear from the type of young guys that worship that Andrew Tate fuckwit.
It's what they see in Porn, beating and spitting. It's disgusting. If one guys tries that shit with me he will get kicked in the nuts!
Idk if people say this as a meme or serious at this point but Benzema never had sex with a minor knowingly
It’s like you people meme yourselves into inventing a whole different narrative because how do these things get upvoted
Marca and AS are propaganda outlets for Real Madrid. They'll publish it once it gets more traction.
They were 20 and 21 and the girls were 18 and 16
>At the time of the events, the players were aged between 20 and 21.
Maybe they were in the reserves but not minors. They gloated about the age of the girls.
None of them are below the age of consent in spain i think, i guess the bigger crime is sharing it without consent more than anything
even if they would be(they are not), making and distributing the videos is the crime here
https://x.com/fonsiloaiza/status/1830653601360101796?s=46&t=GfJq0YEbg46mdITwxrQtaA
Also, is it implied that when this happened?
Ah yes let's blame the girls that were recorded and video shared without consent. 
What are you talking about? It was all over spanish media last year.
it's illegal to film child porn
Back in the "good old" days girls that age used to get fucking married off to creeps like that without them having any say in it. Forget 30 years ago, this has sadly always been the case- we just lived in more blissful ignorance of it until it happened to someone we knew and loved.
Internet has brought the worst out in most people
RemindMe! 2 days
Tf does this have to do with the club?
The club kicked them out when they learned about it.

I think Dani Alves is still a Barca legend though 🤔
you're a fucking idiot with 0 comprehension
idiots are everywhere, nothing to do with Real, could have been any club...
Some of us will remember

Eventually things might rebalance
Edited, thanks.
Why do these Spanish frat type guys speak like they’re in the 17th century lol
Well in our country its legal to do everything since 15 so 16 is not that bad tbh.
After what they **did** reproduce, it does make you wonder
In the third to last paragraph it says “HE was unable to walk, with HIS ass and face red”. I believe they meant the girl not the man?
Is it possible to translate the few text messages in the middle that are still in Spanish? Thanks for posting the article
Nobody’s ever showed me any child porn, thank the gods, but there’s plenty of fucked up shit some moron at worked leaned over and showed me that I’ve chuckled at just to get through the interaction and get on with my life. I’m sure I’d be horrified if someone used that to connect me with something.  Not sure if that means I’m wrong for not shutting shit down I disagree with or if we shouldn’t read much into the messages if the underage angle wasn’t discussed.
Don’t immediately discount that laughter is a perfectly natural reaction to discomfort. Many people alleviate awkward or uncomfortable, even _bad_ situations, by laughing.

Could be they were laughing with him, but it probably isn’t wise to automatically assume that. Most of us don’t know how we’d react to receiving videos or information like that.
The sad thing is that if they were good enough, they would still get picked up. Plenty of footballers have gotten away with disgusting stuffs.
Yes, like the rapist Mason Greenwood, quite rightly never played professional football again...
Yeah, poor them.
I don’t know man. Don’t these guys get off pretty lightly all the time?
Greenwood.
Considering Mason Greenwood exists they'll find Thier feet somewhere
Doubt that given the treatment of Mendy/Greenwood.
As if the whitening hadn't already begun and Papa Flo isn't making sure these guys face absolutely no repercussions as long as they can bring any potential PR damage to Real Madrid. Haven't noticed how none of these articles mention Raúl Asencio, Ferrán Ruiz, Juan Rodríguez or Andrés García?
Potentially leading to an environment that promotes these worst kinds of behaviours
i don't really think that's true at all. there's thousands of real madrid canteranos who hang up their boots without ever playing a first division game in their life. ferran ruiz, who is the most "relevant" player from this story is only at Girona B now and he's 21 years old. the amount of players who make it is tiny, even at real madrid.
They ruined a young girls life, who the fuck cares about these predators.


Stop with this BS about "too bad for the predators... They were so talented at kicking a ball, too bad they threw their life away"
 
It's completely inappropriate. Literally, who the fuck cares about these dudes. THEY TOOK AWAY THAT GIRLS LIFE. She will never be the same, absolutely never
I wish that was the case, they probably didn't because these teams won't give a shit, in fact most of them are thinking it will save them money as they can pay them less wages/lower transfer fees to get them if/when they get out of jail (if being, if they get jail time).
Stop diminishing what they did by calling them weird. They're monsters
No doubt man
Age of consent for filming is different from age of consent for the acts. This is still very illegal before the fact they distributed it without consent
Fairly certain that in this context they mean underage for pornography/recorded sex.
I believe the issue is not the orgy or any sexual activity. It’s the filming and distribution of the act. Without consent. And the bigger issue is the production and distribution of child pornography
That’s not how it works. In germany the age of consent is 14. But there are restrictions against 21 year olds having sex with 14 year olds. Idk the specifics of it but Spain definitely has some protections against exploitations of minors.
The way the football world accepted Greenwood has this as a consequence. I don't doubt it'll happen again.
Real Madrid didn’t do shit about Benzema15, didn’t do shit about Ronaldo’s rape case other than sell him, didn’t do shit about Pepe assaulting another player, Mourinho eyepoking Villanova as a coward. They don’t post pride stuff in the Middle East accounts. 

They’re doing what they always do which is to ignore it until it goes away.
“karmically” - that is nice and I want to believe. But look at Trump and others. Where is karma?
[deleted]
but it is 18 in the most populated states of America too plus a lot of states is only 16 by consent not authority so even in many states this would still be illegal because it is outside of "authority", see too many Americans calling people pedos for relations with a 16 year old, while kinda creepy and slimy it isn't illegal or makes someone a pedo.
In California it is statutory rape for a 17 year old to have sex with their partner to celebrate their 18th birthday.
distribution of underage porn, distributing porn without consent (revenge porn) and also filming without the girls consent.
That and "Paradise, gentleman" was incredibly revealing.
It’s a reflection of what youth football culture is in many cases. Especially in Spain. But I imagine it’s the same around Europe. Guys coming up playing in big clubs academies especially think they are gods, to a level you wouldn’t believe. I have seen it myself when I was growing up. And the worst part is, many of them become professionals and highly regarded and idolized ones too.
Because under 18s can't do porn or whathaveyou?
My favorite line from the movie.
Sitting in the court be their own star witness
Sit in the court, be their own star witness.

It doesn’t help when you have a corrupt police officer who tipped them off about the investigation too.
That, or you are able to maintain an affable persona with incredible connections within the industry. I’m talking about Jimmy Savile.
Posted, you could put the other link instead of this one and use the deepl translation
Not every player is like this, but it does attract a certain breed of freak. Accountability for football players who act like freaks off the pitch has been an issue for a while.
Most do
I spent a summer tournament in San Sebastian and this happened with a bunch of the players of some of the clubs, all our clubs were on camp there that week.

Some players were also partying and drinking after their teams lost, even though we were all under age, the managers knew and did nothing.
Stuff like this is preety common pro sports person use to do this all the time, it has become very less in the recent years because of internet and stuff but back in the days, it was very common.

Not minors obviously
That's normal in many parts of the world though, I'm in Colombia and renting a nice house in the nature for a weekend to invite girls with your friends is normal.
A bunch of teenagers got together and rented an Airbnb to throw a party? Oh the horror
I don't see why that's a problem? The girls choose to go there cos they want to say they've slept with a footballer and to have loads of money spent on them.

Of course, if stuff happens like in this story then it's heinous; but the girls aren't forced to go to these nice houses at the end of the day...
Was about to say, shit like this is pretty universal in environments where toxic masculinity reigns supreme. Maybe not the underage part, but definitely seeing women as objects, which most likely also means you’ll care far less about people being underage because you barely see them as people.

But yeah, you’ll see the same shit in highly competitive business environments, or groups of frat boys, or anything like that. Solving this shit requires us to take a hard look at our culture and ask questions a lot of people really don’t want answered.
Do you really think those girls don’t know since the beginning what is happening? They are having sex with boys that share the same lock room but for some reason they are victims.
> Many times these women would bounce from player to player multiple times before they finally realized what was happening.

Tbh, those type of women only get close those athletes for the potential money and fame, and they are only with those girls for sex. In a way, they kinda deserve each other.
The girls are making the decision to do this at the end of the day. They want to say they have slept with these athletes and have loads of money spent on them.

Really can't have been that bad for them if they bounced from player to player... They obviously knew what was happening if they did it multiple times with the players' teammates.
I’m sorry that was your experience. Just don’t go around saying that the average prospect is less decent than the average person- people are already susceptible to believing that BS because of jealousy. The average prospect is a flawed ( we all are)  but decent person, like the average non prospect.
It all starts with teasing and joking and, unless you have very present parents or mentors, its easy to fall into that.
After 3x30sec non-skipable ads, what a shit website
In the translated comment from MrViskman https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/1HHbdzmXI8
What gives me hope is that these players aren't international superstars yet and teams don't depend on them. So consequences are more likely. 


And for the guy who refuses to wear condoms, STDs will most likely be a consequence and that's some nice karma. 
Depends of how good at football they are. As sad as this is…..
>greenwoods case wasn't so bad

It was worse than this lol. He raped her and beat her. The reason he got out was because of how money hungry the woman's family was.
These guys don't have enough talent to get away with what Partey and Greenwood did. Talent protects you, but if you're just another player clubs aren't going to go out on a limb for you.
Spaniards are not Latinos though.
It's bad enough the main guy somehow had enough self-awareness to know he was abusing a minor and apparently relished in that fact, but to brag about it repeatedly to several people-even other women-it is beyond fucked up. These guys need to be banned and locked away for a long time.
Please tell me that the girls atleast giving them consent for sex
Don't you understand, they're famous so they get away with it. These kids should have waited until they had won some trophies before fucking minors
Casually forgets about own legend, Dani Alves himself
[deleted]
People keep saying this.  Age of consent in America is a state law.  Many states are 16.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States
They're still minors if spain also has 18 as the marker for adulthood like most european nations.

Age of consent isn't the same as being an adult.
Still, if I was 21 years old I wouldn’t even think about fucking someone who was 16.
In most of America you can still fuck a 16 year old.
When it comes to recording and distributing footage they very much are minors.
They are minors that can agree to consent within the law. They can have consexual sex, but sharing sexual videos of them is considered CP.
I don’t know if people are getting worse at hiding their bad sides or if this is becoming more common in general. Either way, it’s a disappointing world we live in these days.
Guy is dragged through the mud for internet points.
Also, people always talk about Benzema but never mention Ribery
Correct me if I’m wrong but this story already had some traction last year when it broke right?
[deleted]
The much bigger crime is not sleeping with them nor sharing without their consent , it is producing and distributing child porn
Guy to the right looking like Andrew Tate.
i think it is written it happened on june 15 1 year ago
I think the point is we worship footballers and we shouldn't act surprised when they commit crimes like this because we treat them like gods (aka above the law).

They're human beings and we should hold them accountable, not worship them the way we do.

He is not attacking the victims I think
I didn't take that as victim blaming. Those on pedestals, particularly from a young age, seem to get delusions of grandeur.
Yes, take my words out of context for your agenda.
He's not saying that ffs

What he's saying is when people start to idolize others, those idols will have power over them

Can be little power like footballer, can be a lot like populist
Take a moment to understand what OP is saying before jumping to conclusions 
Two things can be true at once you know.
You’re fucking insane mate
Ah ok I get it now, didn't realise they filmed it
If I covered for him would I not be a piece of shit? You think the club didn’t know? The naivety of some people.
Mate, let's not pretend here, this was revealed on September 2023 and no player was kicked out until now, there's also one that is still unnamed and could potentially still be playing with your team.
Do you still worship your legends Benzema and Ronaldo? Dani Alves is certainly not…
This actually happens further down in the paragraphs too. Caused some confusion for me.
Thanks for your work. Holy shit that was terrible. These guys are fucked.
Because the translation is bad.
You mean as in the formality that it has when translated to English? If that’s what you mean, Spanish when translated sounds incredibly formal and official in English compared to what it sounds like in Spanish. My AP Spanish teacher explained it better than I can, sadly.
Yes deepl has those issues
I got you, thanks for pointing that out
Idk about that man. Someone showed me like a stupid fucked up meme or whatever i might chuckle just to get him to shut up. But if he showed me a sex tape he made with a young looking person I'd be at least reporting it to someone at some point. They're basically co workers here, even just showing porn could be considered a form of sexual harassment 
That’s true I won’t disagree that it could be that, but I will respond with the fact it’s all over text so it’s not immediate uncontrolled reactions etc. so they had some time to think and write back what they wanted.
We use laughter in real life as a natural reaction to discomfort, not in chats. If I find something inappropriate, I would either message the person privately or ignore it if I am not confident.
Even if he/she was a close member of my family i would instantly cut contacts with the piece of shit I'll only maybe hold back on reporting him to authorities if he genuinely promised not to do it again.
Yes, one of the players involved, Ferran Ruiz, is already [at](https://www.transfermarkt.us/ferran-ruiz/profil/spieler/668210) Girona
Just look at Mason Greenwood
Boateng. There are reports that imply that he bullied his GF into suicide (making her sign a one-sided NDA and then starting a campaign through the Bild-"newspaper" against her after they split up, opening her up to harassments without any chance to fight his (wrong) claims) and is still fighting the previous one in court for allegations of physical abuse - still gets contract after contract since Bayern dropped him

With how much money those players have they get the best lawyers, always have some guys making sure nothing sticks with them if they misbehave - unless they are caught red-handed I think it's almost impossible to prove anything
I’m sure De Zerbi would welcome them with open arms
Not just current footballers either. In the Netherlands the most popular football pundit is an ex-player named Johan Derksen (he wasn’t that good, only famous for the punditry) and a couple years ago he felt like it would be a funny story to tell (on national tv) about the time he and his mates stuck a candle inside an unconscious woman’s vagina at a party when they were still players. The entire audience proceeded to laugh and his show is still up and one of the most popular in Dutch television. 

Take the lack of consequences and the audience reception in mind when you think about how many times this type of shit happens and the victim decides that it’s just not worth it to report. (And maybe, reflect on if they’re right.)

Also just want to note that the fact that this happened and everyone was ok with it in the way they were, means it probably hasn’t just happened before but it happens quite often. And the fact that nearly all of those guys didn’t see consequences and now *do* play professionally.
And Thomas Partey
Partey still starts for Arsenal
Sad part about that is he is only playing because of how good he is. Some of these youth players who aren't that good likely will be finished.
And Partey. And Ronaldo. 
He is still playing pro ball.
That was not my intention at all. Stop telling me what to do.
Yeah u wont see this on “el chiringuito”
No clubs post pride stuff in the Middle Eastern accounts. Being gay is illegal there, which of course is wrong, but it is still illegal so of course no teams will post that on those accounts...
This isn't just a Real Madrid issue
> didn’t do shit about Pepe assaulting another player, Mourinho eyepoking Villanova as a coward.

The fact that you used these two as examples next to the other two, *much more* serious crimes tells a lot about you, because you've just shown that you don't seem to care all that much about the sexual abuse and mistreatment of women as long as you can use them as excuses to fling your shit at a rival's team.

Just in case it needs to be clarified: I hope the players that did this shit rot in prison for a long time, and I'm very disappointed with my club for protecting them instead of condemning them. But just because I don't approve at all of my club's actions doesn't mean I can't find your opportunistic and slimy-ass comments any less appalling.
> In Maryland its 16, but only for people up to 20.

nope

https://www.peoples-law.org/age-consent
This is not accurate.
Most states also have exceptions based on age difference. If the people in question are within 2 or 3 years (again, depending on state) of each other in age, then it is also legal.
New York is 17.
Wasn't this the issue with Maradona when he was in Cuba?
okay but that's not realistically enforced
In California they also have no minimum age to get married. So a 50 year old Hollywood producer can get married to a 15 year old if the parents consent.
Not if their famous though. Then that 17yr old can bang anyone
 /s
Aren’t there any Romeo and Juliet laws?
Don't think they will go to jail or anything, I just hope they don't play professional football again and btw how old were the youth players?
Yall are very naive to think footballers don’t do this type of stuff
What are you referring to? Not finding anything for “Paradise Gentlemen” or “Long Live Futbol” when searching online
what?
Which movie?
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah I’m right here
Do you see the perpetrator
It *might* not have been corruption for money (note: I've not read into it), they *might* have been a Madrid fan 'looking out for his club'.

Not that, if that were the case, it'd make it better. If anything that'd be worse, which is rare when corruption is being to blame is the other potential reason for a crime.
Your comment with the other article got removed for some reason. Can’t find it anywhere, even via your profile.

Edit: it’s back now. Weird.
Underage drinking is pretty common in Spain, unfortunately. I remember getting into adult clubs at 14 when I would visit in the summer (this was even before my growth spurt).
Then there is James Milner, family man, Tee total and still going strong.
You hit the nail on the head there. And there will always be girls/women attracted to those types and to their draws (fame, money, power, popularity etc). Some will understand they dynamic, and are sufficiently okay with it, many will not and are simply being taken advantage of. Add in the power of social media, especially with young people who are trying to figure themselves out, and scum like Andrew Tate getting worryingly large and attentive audiences...?  Sadly I think it'll get worse before it gets better. 

The only thing that might change is a reduction in recording and sharing as self-preservation gets taught by clubs looking to protect their assets. Idiocy and lust, with a side-serving of greed and pride, will prevail often though.
> Do you really think those girls don’t know since the beginning what is happening?

In some ways yes, in others no.

It was definitely a bit of a two way street. There is no doubt in my mind most of them just wanted the social status of being with one of the players on school team. Sometimes it was blatantly obvious that she wouldnt have given the guy she was with the time of day if he wasnt on the team, and I think a lot of times my teammates knew this as well, which was why they viewed these women the way they did.

But, at least at the beginning, what I dont think they knew was that for the vast majority of them there was never a chance they found a committed relationship, which is what I think most were after. It shocked me how long it took many of them to realize they were forever the hookup, never the girlfriend. And in the time it took them to realize this some would do essentially anything for a chance at the relationship status they were seeking, up to and including gang bangs like we see in this situation. It was always so awkward seeing them around campus in a relationship with some guy not on the team after they finally gave up trying to get with someone on the team. Knowing that this new guy was almost certainly clueless about them being passed around like a sex toy just a few weeks before.
Yeah in situations like that I have a really hard time viewing the women as victims, they were trying to use what they had to gain what they wanted and realized at the end of the day that the men they wanted were higher value than themselves, then they want sympathy.
Honestly greenwood’s is one of the worst cases he’s a scumbag. Probably going to continue to have a good career too cause he’s rich and actually good at football the cunt.
He harassed her, violated the restraining order during the Covid lockdown iirc and knocked her up. All with the complicity of her dad.
Oh, I’m right with you on this.
It appears to be the case. The complaint is solely about filming and distributing the act without consent. The violent acts described make me doubt if at some point the consent wasn't revoked but that doesn't seem to be part of the complaints.
He isn't a legend to me. Because he is a rapist. And he actually got his treatment, where Benzema and CR7 got away with their disgusting behaviour.
Our 'legend' didn't get away with it
No one glorifies Alves after everyone knew what he did, but that isn't the case for Ronaldo and Benzema.
lmao no one supports Dani Alves anymore. 
He was a legend when he played. He didn’t rape anymore then. He was a fantastic player and even offered Abidal his liver when he was sick with cancer. 

You repped your rapist when they were playing and continue to do so. The issue with Ronaldo wasn’t that he played for Real Madrid - the issue is that he’s a fucking self admitted rapist and your fan base had zero problems with that because he was scoring goals for you. 

You have zero moral ground to stand on. It’s like when you do lgbt stuff and then you ‘forget’ to post it on Arabic accounts.
Alves's rape case happened after he left the club while your most famous attacking trio consisted of a rapist and a child fucker so maybe the two are a tad bit different, don't you think
Grow up and stop putting “but” in these types of sentences. Bigger than football. All three of these men are despicable
He got jailed, yours is worshipped by everyone. Plus Alves is no one’s legend anymore.
Typically that only applies if the other person is under the age of 18 as well, right?
Yes, but that doesn’t apply for consent laws unless you’re in a position of power over the person under 18.
This is my thing, as a guy in his early 20s getting with a high schooler is just so weird to me, even if the law allows it.
They're just getting worse at hiding. Older generations would have bragged with words, now they share the videos.
You're not wrong. The story was out last year or so. Both papers wrote about it I think.
I mean no, 16 is the legal age of consent in many countries, and I don't think anyone uses "paedo" in reference to someone attracted to woman over the age of 16, even if it is icky.




What they did, said, and shared was immoral enough, we don't need to start stretching to add other things.
The age of consent is 16 in Spain.
You really should look up what pedophilia means.
This is how I read it too: If society raises someone on a pedestal above them, they will see themselves as above the rules of that society.
They literally kicked them out last year lol.

& who you calling rapists right above? Benzema & Modriç?
That fucked me up in Spanish class. "I was" is the same as "he/she was," and you need to use context clues to figure it out
Ok that make sense
Makes sense I understand what you mean, good to know lol
I’d agree.  I think seeing any porn I’d probably just say something like, “come on man don’t show me shit like that.”
Ask any woman you’ve ever known how they handle men who make them uncomfortable or feel threatened.

One of the most common tactics is appeasement. Play along, laugh along, do whatever you need to until you’re away or safe.

It’s pointless to immediately judge these teenager girls or young women for, what, not doing the perfect response to the situation?
Once again: most of us have no idea how we’d react in a situation like that.

It’s very easy to say you know exactly how you’d react to your son being a criminal, when you’re sitting on the internet, far removed from that reality, and likely without even having a son.

We all have an idea of how we’d like to react. Very few of us actually know. It’s pointless to act like you’re morally superior to people who actually have to deal with the very difficult situations, particularly when it’s in all likelihood a teenage girl being suddenly confronted with the evidence her friend is a sexual abuser.
Well I hope they tell him to fuck off then
David Goodwillie comes to mind too, picked up by Clyde and Raith Rovers and still playing now in the Scottish lower divisions.
[deleted]
and Zouma...wrong pussy but still kinda the same
or ronaldo
Or Giuntoli.
Agreed.

It is slightly further along the spectrum of he said/she said than the Greenwood one, but I certainly don't want to support him in any way.
What is happening with Partey?

Is he getting charged?

Or has it been dropped?

Seems like it’s been talked about for ages.
Thank the gods cristiano is not a celebrated legend to many, hey?
He does. He shouldn't.

It is slightly further along the spectrum of he said/she said than the Greenwood one, but I certainly don't want to support him in any way.
>Some of these youth players who aren't that good likely will be finished.

Yes, good.
I know. Because the world is completely fucking ridiculous.
Has anything like the information around this Madrid youth scandal come out about Partey?
Barca literally does it 


The whole point of pride months is that poeple are being killed or being jailed and committ suicide for being different around the world so what the fucking point if you are too scared to post anything in the language that those countries speak?
lmao Barcelona does all the time and receives abuse for it
No one claimed that though? This is a thread about Real Madrid so the person you’re replying to is on-topic.
No, but they’re the club that it’s happening at and they e shown time and again that they don’t handle these cases properly.
Or maybe I care about both sexual and physical assault?
But nice try trying to deflect the fact that your club has zero backbone when it comes to handling g assault cases.
That’s crazy so you can have intercourse with a 16 plus year old and you’re fine as long as they don’t claim rape
17.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States
Or you can be a Hollywood director in his 40s who drugs and rapes a 13-year-old and they'll give you a standing ovation at the Academy Awards.
Not in California
No they play for Real. They will potentially go out on loan, make fake apologies then come back and be the next "stars of tomorrow" because they can kick a fucking ball.
Pretty sure most obscenely wealthy people do some sort of fucked up shit, between drugs, minor abuse they might as well be twirling their msutaches
You have misunderstood the comment, and been a little patronising there. 
  
I believe that comment is revealing of the mindset these youngsters have, one they would never, ever publicly reveal. And yes, it is prevalent. Nobody has said otherwise in this thread. 
  
As it happens, I work with semi-pro and professional footballers on a daily basis, so I am more familiar than most as to what they can be like and what they get up to.
In the translated quotes of the text messages. That’s what the players were saying.
It's an issue because recording someone under 18 is illegal?
The Big Short

Fuck around, get the whole la fabrica sent up for years
Get the whole label sent up for years
What a great song!
Yeah. IM RIGHT HERE
YEAH I'M RIGHT HERE
Yeah they’re a dirty cop. Really disappointing to see when this isn’t even for the benefit of money, but an immoral case such as this when videos of minors are being widespread which could have/have had serious consequences to the sanity of those young people, considering the social media age we live in, that cop instead of being on the right side of justice prefers to aid his cronies and help cover this up
If it happens again please do tell me and i'll contact the mods so they keep it up because it might be triggering automod
Underage drinking is common everywhere where alcool is idiolized
There are a lot of professional athletes who are tee total, but I suspect that in high level athletes it's more prevelent in those doing individual rather than team sports.
There was hope once, but he just needed one decent transfer and to play well and he was going to be set (albeit still with many clubs that'd not touch him). And sadly he's got that.
Exactly. And they have the gall to say it was not so bad. Pathetic. Sadly he is a good player, and people will forget what he did.
*knocked her up
No it is general. You are talking about Romeo and Juliet laws which concern having sex with people under age of consent
It depends on the state, but generally speaking, no. 

Having reached the age of consent by definition means you can consent to sex with people of any age (teachers and legal guardians being exceptions).

What you are thinking of is close-in-age exemptions, also known as Romeo and Juliet laws, which apply specifically to people below the age of consent, but who are close in age (can also apply when one person is below the age of consent and the other is above it, but they are still close in age).

But if the actual age of consent is 16, as it is in much of the US, then it is flat out legal to have sex with a 16 year old.

Most of the US actually has the age set at 16 or 17. It is the exception for it to be 18, but because it's 18 in California, Hollywood movies have made people think it's 18 everywhere.
Even 18 (age of consent in my country) is like a child to me and I’m 22. How can anyone go below that is crazy to me.
Yep, world was even more fucked up back in the day, most people just didnt know, now its just easier to find out.
In that regard, yes. For example, it took decades for Gary Glitter's and Jimmy Savile's crimes to come to light. Fucks sake Savile died before he was exposed and his victims were silenced in one way or other for all those decades he was alive for.
>they received a tip-off that they were being investigated, which allowed them to delete evidence from their phones days before their arrest at the Valdebebas sports complex.

Chances are, someone from the club with contacts in the police was told and alerted them.
I think he meant his idol, not Real Madrid legends
I was is "yo fui", he/she was is "el/ella fue" how are they similar? Who taught you Spanish?
There are plenty of women out there that enable abuse towards and demean other women. I understand where you’re coming from, but those messages didn’t scream appeasement from them.
Men do it too.
[deleted]
you are correct that laughing is a natural reaction in the form of overcompensation to an uncomfortable event, but no need to play the "you don't know how you will react until you are in that position" card. you can predict with high confidence how someone with a strong sense of justice will react compared to someone with a lower sense of justice. if you cant predict how your friends will react to certain events then you either don't know them or lack social iq.

That is just a lame excuse. its fine to admit that people will prioritize self-preservation over their sense of justice, but it is also fair to point that out as an outsider that you disagree with their actions.


what we actually don't know, what she did outside of that chat after receiving those messages. this would be a better indicator of what kind of person she is. she could have played along on the outside, but distanced herself in non-confrontional ways.
[deleted]
Greenwood's career definitely took a big hit, and these kids aren't as talented as he was. They won't face nearly the consequences they should, but it's safe to say they've hurt their career meaningfully.
It's not even close wtf?
What happened with Kurt Zouma?
With Partey it's a he said/she said/she said/she said/she said/she said situation.
Apparently he leaves on a free next summer, Arsenal couldn’t find a buyer. Which is mad because he starts for them
He can’t be charged because it happened out of UK and the laws were not in place to charge him. If it happened 10 days later, they would have a case against him.
No, the partey situation is much less clear.
[removed]
This is how it works, yes. In most of the world it is 16 and half of USA.
Yes, corrected. mb
Wild
The wealthy are doing it and getting away with it, however don't for a second think it's not sickos that you'd think were regular folks like the rest of us that enjoy the same acts
equating recreational drugs with child rape lol
Cant make those comments and bot tell us
Gotcha. Thanks for the clarity
yeah that's highly illegal
Attract heavy cash 'cause the game's centrifugal
It isnt showing up
Yeah, but 14 year old me (a dude) isn't going to get into a night club in the US most likely.
There are examples of those who don't too and are/were out there playing high level. On some podcasts they reveal the number of players who have the "half time ciggie" is astounding.
If he keeps banging goals and playing like he did in Marseille, yes. 

It would an inconvenience, an error during his journey, it’s disgusting and disturbing. 

De Zerbi is already adopting him as a son lol, I’m glad I was always against him coming to Barcelona.
Thanks dude
Knocked her out*
Even strictly speaking about football, I smile when people accuse referees of being bought today. In the 80s and 90s, clubs would routinely give cash, luxury gifts and high-end call girls to referees, today they have to construct an elaborate set-up of shell companies and fake consulting jobs to even hope to bribe one referee, and even that leaves a very long paper trail.
Not stating that you’re wrong or anything. But forensic analysis for phones and computers can pull up deleted files texts the whole nine yards. If they look they will find everything even if it’s deleted. There are ways to genuinely delete things, but it takes longer than a couple days, and it’s a complicated process that someone outside of the forensics field would probably not be able to do.
In the imperfect they are conjugated the same
If appeasement screams appeasement, it doesn't appease.
No I’m not. I’m saying it’s a possibility, and that you shouldn’t automatically condemn someone when you have a fragment of the information. I’m not making an assumption of my own.
That was Getafe, not Girona
The whole kicking his cat incident.
So basically the lyrics of Break Stuff.
And all of the voices seem to agree since we've seen what he supposedly said in those messages.
I mean not surprising at all tbh, they know Arsenal won't extend him given the situation so they can get him for free if they just wait.
There were rumors of a few Saudi clubs being in for him but he didn't want to leave so nothing came of it (or it was bullshit in the first place, who knows)
That was only for one of the incidents he was arrested for. Multiple women, multiple accusations. 

One took place abroad and at a time which made further investigation or charges not possible.

But that wasn’t the only incident. 

It’s shameful he still plays for us
I think the difference lies with getting caught. If you're wealthy, you have much more protection in the vast majority of the world. But yeah, wealthy people have everything and feel invincible. Sexual assault etc. is a power thing. Wealthy people get everything they want, they get the income from their workers, they can buy all cars, why wouldn't they "take what's theirs" from women?
Eh?
Gotcha, makes sense.
Messaging them, tahnks.

E: it got manually approved, it was getting caught in automod
Things changed after a Steve Aoki session at the Madrid Arena. Full of minors, me included, there was a human avalanche, people died. Before that no one would ask for an ID, after that I can count with the fingers of my hand the times I've not needed an ID to get in a club
One day someone will two foot him and break his leg i‘m pretty sure.
Knock her in*
Still doesn’t take away how shady AF it is Real Madrid have someone on in the inside in police.
The article mentions this is how they recovered a part of the evidence actually.
You can't just declare appeasement, Michael. That's not how it works.
That’s fair enough.
You can say the same about the guys who they shared the videos with  then.
De Zerbi's probably already in contact with him
thanks for being one of the few to admit this
Sorry, what do pro footballers get up to?
Ah good to know.
I agree
Ah, I see - enough people on Reddit know who I work with that I don't intend to touch that question!
Fair enough
OTD, 5 years ago, Hazard was presented at the Santiago Bernabeu in front of 50,000 fans 
It remains one of the biggest player presentations in football.
Moment before disaster
What an absolutely depressing end to a career
This was probably the biggest let down of a transfer ever for me, I was so excited lol
The transfer that shifted Madrid’s future transfer philosophy.
Such a shame how his career went – he was mesmerising at Chelsea
More like OTD 5 years ago hazard took a holiday from playing football.
Looking back.. he even looked out of shape at the presentation lol
It was Neymar vs Hazard vs Bale for Messi and Ronaldo’s successor as the top dog and it never happened
One of the most talented players in probably the best footballing system. How tf did it all go wrong ?
Is there any bigger r/antiwork legend?
mistakes were made
5 years already? Jesus Christ
5 years already? Crazy
One of our best kits ever and it’s permanently soured due to Hazard’s signing - arguably the worst in football, and Ramos’ unexpected leaving at the end. Bar Vincius’ emergence in the first team, it is a season best forgotten …
And that was the last time those fans saw him ever again
people should heard what he said in obi wan show. He played too soon after that injury and never got or received full trratment during covid. It is really a hard hard difficult time when you got injured during covid
OTD, 5 years ago, Hazard retired in front of 50,000 fans at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.
Ever since then, Madrid has accumulated 2 champions league trophies with him in the roster!
Hazard looked already retired and suited up for a charity match during his presentation
Today I feel hungry
Tapas restaurants didn't know it, but this man would take it upon himself to save their business model
Am I misremembering, but didn't some Real fans chant "we want Mbappe" during it?
r/agedlikemilk
Obviously different countries have different fan cultures but I've always found the "presenting" a player in this way to be really odd. You never see this in England that I can recall. It would've come across as really cringeworthy if Arsenal had done something like this with Declan Rice.
The rest is history 👏
[deleted]
Did he play in a clasico?
Prime Hazard was on another level. Sorry for him it ended like it did.
Had the same expectations of Hazard back then as I do Mbappe now.
Hazard ate so Jude could shit on these peasants
The king of vibes football. Love him so much, but somewhat sad that his career ended too early.
Only 5 years? Damn thought it was much before.
Dude’s career imploded soon after
Can take the man out Chelsea but can’t take the Chelsea out of the man.
Does Real Madrid not have their own sub to post these meaningless tidbits on? I swear that there are a handful of clubs whose fans just post whatever the fuck they want on here, as if anybody else gives a shit. 

Hazard’s career went down the shitter after this. Do they want a prize? Or maybe we should all clap and hand out cake and ice cream?
One of my favorite players and my favorite club.  So bummed it didn't work.
Who?

Awww what a little chubber. How did he do?
Who’s that never heard of him?
I'd quite like to forget about this thanks
and the rest is history
And the rest is history
Poor Hazard.
taking into account the fee and wages it was pound for pound the worst transfer of all time
overrated fraud
Fucking yikes, worst transfer in the history of football.
Just makes me sad. From hero to zero. He lost all of his love for the game.
Would have been so good if he primed like CR7 at Madrid too...
Sad that it have to end in this way 🥲
ffs I forgot about that, just imagine current Real Madrid with a good Hazard
Hazard and Jovic in the same window. Nasty business. 


Would love to peek into the timeline where their transfers worked out.
His first of 5 appearances for the club.
Maaaan talk about the biggest waste of talent ever. 5 years wasted unfortunately between injuries and lack of playing time. Prime hazard would of benched vini and Rodrygo forsure. Sometimes life ain't fair.
That was 5 years ago?!?!?!?!?!?!
Only 5 years ago, I had a feeling he is retired for 2 years and this was 7-8 years ago
Just 5 years ago??? I thought it was longer than that!
I know 'time flies' is a meme but 5 years already
The opening credits to the Vinicius Jr. story.
A lot of people blaming injuries and of course they played a part but his conditioning off the pitch nose dived. He arrived visibly (and admittedly) overweight after the summer and he suffered as a result. In your early-mid 20s you get away with it but not when your bodys beginning to strain


He failed at Real Madrid because he wasnt strict or committed enough and that led to problems with his body
 Now do Mbappe
The GOAT
Only 5 years? Feels like eons ago
whoops....
Dudes biggest moment was winning the title for Leicester
Bro has more trophies than goals for Real 💀
Hazard retired 5 years ago already?
And the rest is gluttony
What a failed transfer. 

I don’t recall anything like this in Real Madrid history, but maybe I don’t remember
And he has eaten 50,000 burgers since. What a *ful*filling career.
Did he even play?
RM legend in my books.
He sooooo good at Chelsea. I thought for sure he would tear la liga up. Wow was I wrong…depressing because I truly thought he had magic.
God damn did he suck
50,000 people is one of the biggest ones? That's interesting, because Thiago Silva got the same numbers just last week here for Fluminense:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1daplwu/fluminense\_thiago\_silvas\_presentation\_for\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1daplwu/fluminense_thiago_silvas_presentation_for_over/)
Future fate of Mbappe.
And it was a waste of money and time
Biggest Flop Ever and it’s not close
The burger fit size LOL sorry couldn’t help it!
The biggest deception ever
I was so hype for this and then the disaster happen. Such a let down 
Damn been 5 years since RM got robbed
I'm just happy cause he won a CL and the extra payments don't hurt either
One of the biggest FIASCOS in football history
As a Madrid and Chelsea fan I was so excited about this. More than anyone else (before Bellingham) so you can imagine my disappointment. I really thought he was going to become the best in the world lol…
Certainly felt earlier than that.
That was an expensive mistake.
Santiago Munez did more I believe
And the rest is history.
Oh my dear Hazard… how I wish you could have fulfilled your potential beyond your years at Chelsea.
what happened to him man, he was so good.
What could’ve been…
Such a waste.
Worst Madrid signing over the last 10 years and probably top 3 this century. Unbelieavble for such a lovely guy to have completely failed so miserably.
MY GOAT RIGHT HERE!
Cheers Madrido.
After this, Real swore they would not sign any 30+ player . Perhaps the reason why they were so keen on signing Mbappe even after he rejected them so they get the prime years.
As a Chelsea fan I was sad to see him go but it all ended well, however looking back at this I am even more upset about this transfer due to the way Hazard ended his career. If he stayed at Chelsea he would be playing to this day :(
Lynn… you couldn’t present… a cat
What if Mbappe is the regen of Hazard
Top 3 worst signings of all time easily and no doubt worst signing of RM, even fucking Edwin Congo was better
Bro got to eat spanish food and vacation on hot beaches, play a few matches with Real Madrid, almost passively win titles... while getting paid a damn lot of money.

Most glorious retirement ever.
And he checked out that summer from football lets be honest. Arriving overweight to the biggest club in the world is simply shameful
best player i ve seen in the prem besides Wazza and since cristiano left for madrid.. what a terrible terrible shame he flopped af at real..
People love to bring up our numerous horror transfers but nobody wants to bring that energy to Hazard
He will always go down as a what if player
How many games did he actually play tho
What a presentation was that 🔥🔥
This was only five years ago? Oddly, feels like an eternity ago…
Who is worse. Michael Owen or Hazard coming?
I felt sad injuries disrupted his stay at Real Madrid. He would have gone ahead to achieve a lot, but injuries weren't fair to him.
He is a cool guy and really talented, too bad he is a lazy piece of crap
What if they bought hazard to make cr7 legacy stronger. 


Only thing is that vini spoilt market and didn’t follow the script. The mourning period was almost zero Madrid bounced back super strong after cr7 departure
What I don't care for is that Hazard settled and stopped caring once he'd signed on for Real. Everything was served on a silver platter (no pun intended): the best club in the world, filling a void in their team with the Premier League's best winger in his very prime. It was perfect. Yet, it all came to shit in the end. Perplexing.
What?! 50000 ppl to see hazard while kroos had like 14 people attending his anouncment? 
Real madrid fans are crazy I tell you
2016 Hazard is the only player within Messi's distance
Sad part is he was starting to play like his Chelsea self up until that tackle against PSG. What could’ve been.
Hazard>Messi entire career 😂
[deleted]
this is definitely the biggest transfer flop in recent memory

but we hit the jackpot with Vinicius not long after so the only painful part ended up being the financials
Not really, he absorbed all the injuries from the squad so none of the important players were out for extended times. Literally the season after he left the shitstorm of injuries started, Courtois ACL etc.
That commercial from FIFA belongs in r/agedlikemilk lolololol
Quite the Hazard
*after. The disaster was the signing part
Bro was paid to eat burgers. Not a bad way to go
Yeah, it’s sad when they go young like that
Yes. That horrific tackle literally ended his career.
He was not depressed at all, he said that he was playing for fun and was tired of training.
Oscar’s is worse, although technically not over, is in his 8th season in China aged 32
I mean, like, I wasn't expecting it to end that way.
Always feel like he just wanted to sign for Madrid, not actually play for them.
Was the cover of FIFA and won an UCL, it was depressing for the people who paid his salary.
Depressing is a strange word to use
Yeah me too. At that point it was something that was bound to happen. 

He adored Real and wanted to prove it here. Real also needed a marquee player after Ron. But it all went wrong.
He had just come off a season where he had career highs in goals and assists.  Madrid must've thought they were getting a successor to Ronaldo after that transfer.

Shame how it ended, one of my favorite players to watch on his day.  He was unbeatable.
I remember the exact moment when I received the "Comunicado Oficial: Hazard" notification, I was so happy, and hopeful, sadly we know how it ended
For me he felt as scary as the Mbappe transfer feels atm
Mbappe is like : hold my wine!
Gosh you guys just can’t catch a break can you
Don't worry Mbappe is going to top it.
Certainly the biggest.
Along with Kaka and Bale, it was RM's biggest disaster
Yeah. The shift started before him with vini, Rodrygo and Valverde but this solidified it and made it a high priority.
In my delusion that transfert fee was just an additionnal payment for Courtois
Probably also the reason why Madrid didn't pull the trigger on Kane last summer even though he was begging them to sign him and he was exactly what Madrid needed
Can you elaborate? Genuinely curious.
Yeah it really set them back in hindsight lol 🙄
I love that transfer because it SHOULD make people think when they talk about what is certain and how players should be "proven" etc.

Hazard was like, the most guaranteed transfer I have ever seen. Dude had been amazing all the time for 10 years. Except for one season in which he had health issues. But that's very few health issues for such a long career. He was fantastic in France, England and in the Belgium nationals, in Champions League too. His general skill with the ball could suit any kind of play and any teammates if you want to attack. Has no ego on the pitch! He always dreamt of coming to Real Madrid! The club where players show their best! 

Really the most certain slam dunk we've seen. And it turned out to be a complete flop. He was great in a few games, good in like maybe 10, and that's it, that was the whole career of Hazard in Madrid.
Long before Hazard Madrid invested on young talents .. Benzema was 19 ,  Marcelo 17 , Ramos 18, Varane 19 , Casemiro 20, Di maria 21
but in hindsight it’s not really a bad transfer. at that time Real Needed a left winger and Hazard was probably the best itw and he deserved his price tag
Bellingham? He was brought for the same out, but luckily lived to expectations and beyond
Yeah. From one of the best in the world to not even convincing enough to bench a misfiring vini.
And the WC, no one could stop him, amazing really
He certainly was. I'd been going to Chelsea matches for 15+ years and was getting a bit bored. He completely changed that to the point where there were times I was going just to see him play. The best I've ever seen live personally and I've seen most of the recent greats live.
Basically the focal point of our attack. Relied on him for so long. For years, as long as him and Kante were fit and on the pitch Chelsea were good. Such a lopsided team.
Retired*
Lol he was like that in the [Europa League final](https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/presto/2019/05/29/PDTN/a5ee51d8-5268-4943-b192-2f451f4b87c8-europa.jpg) just 2 weeks before.
He was like this mostly. He usually gets into shape during the pre season and all.
No wonder his body just broke
Yeah. And all of them due to injuries too shows how insane both Ronaldo and Messi were in taking care of their body too.
There is no one close to be their successor in today's football(neymar was the closest and had the talent but I guess he stopped giving a shit)
nah im not having that with Bale. Players peak at different ages. Look at Rooney as well. Not everyone plays until theyre 40


Bale won 5 champions leagues and was a fantastic success at Real Madrid. Hazard flopped at Madrid
Hazard is well-known to not work hard.

It's working when you're in your 20, but at one point your body will stop you.
That career ending injury. He was actually starting to pick up form before that match against PSG.
He's up there with the mod that went on that Fox News interviews for sure
Biggest mistake of all time most prolly.

Hazard's regression might be the biggest of all time.

And this might be the biggest flop transfer of all time based on that transfer value and he had 1 year left on his contract.
Just living his best life
That isn’t the first one without Ronaldo though, that is the 19-20 kit whilst the first one without Ronaldo is the completely forgetable 18-19 kit.
Yeah. That kit was a beautiful one.

But still a much better season than whatever we had before this season.
This kit wishes it was the 2011-2012 kit. I mean it tried to be with the golden stripes but to me the 11-12 will never be topped
[deleted]
Idk As a spurs fan Ndombele was maybe worse. On our highest wages and we never spend that much money
yeah people underestimate how bad COVID affected rehab and treatment in general. Just an unfortunate time to get hurt.
I don't remember very clearly but this is something which is highly probable since Ronaldo left and Real needed his replacement.
Yeah.

But iirc, Casemiro was presented in front of fans at United.
its a Galactico thing
I understand. They're a common thing for absolute legends in Brazil as well though. Just last week we reportedly got just over 50k fans as well in the stadium for Thiago Silva's presentation:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1daplwu/fluminense\_thiago\_silvas\_presentation\_for\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1daplwu/fluminense_thiago_silvas_presentation_for_over/)
It might be cringe to england fans because they watch football games as if they were watching the opera. Passion is different in other countries
You can’t compare any modern team in England to modern Real Madrid. Your best and most dominant team has no soul, it’s just a business with an empty shell. The parade when City won was depressing lol
Yes he was.
Not a single minute iirc.
Tbf it was 100 million for the most naturally talented footballer outside of Messi and Ronaldo. 

And while he was lazy in training I didn't stop him from making an insane impact in actual matches. Bro was humiliating players who trained harder than himself all the time.
Also the ridiculous add ons. 

And all this happened with a year left on his contract.
Hey, hey let's not focus on the money and age, okay? He was also in the last year of his contract. No one is worth that much in final year
Nahhh. 26/28 yo was the usual peak and big transfer age.
No no, one of the biggest and in the top 10.

The number one is CR7 at Santiago Bernabeu which had 80k spectators.
Worst Madrid signing of all time imo based on his whole fees (transfer, bonus and salary) which is over a quarter a billion.

One of the top 5 worst of all time too maybe on the basis of sheer numbers.
Mbappe singing was bound to happen sooner or later. Dude loved Real and Real was trying for his signature from 2017 onwards. And he is a Perez favourite.
And he would have become an absolute legend of the game. 

He still is a legend but a lot of neutrals now look down on him because of this 4 years and retirement.
Curse your vile tongue.
Don't be ridiculous
Forgetting about his career at Chelsea and Lille??
76 games/3736 minutes in 4 years.
I mean, he didn't exactly help things by not keeping fit.
He kind of stopped caring after his injury vs PSG. He was getting into form. But that destroyed him fully and he had a lot of recurring injuries after this.
Kroos had 8k fans iirc. But it's understandable. 

Kroos wasn't considered of the same status as Hazard during the time of transfer. Hazard was one of the best 5 players in the world.
Sure let's compare Kroos from 2014 to Hazard from 2019
hazard was at the top of the world sitting behind ronaldo and messi, and you think a 2014 kroos would have the same effect?
Really? Ronaldo? Neymar was also a weapon. His early years with Brazil his numbers are unreal.
Yeah. If he was bad from the beginning, it wouldn't have hurt this much.

He was fit and coming back to form before the doom.
Ego? When did he have any ego? That was one of his good qualities and he got along with the dressing room.
Vini came before
Coutinho is up there. 

Griezman at least gave us a Copa and Dembele was decent when fit. 

Coutinho scored 2 in the 8-1
Recent memory? Hazard was easily the biggest flop ever

After bonuses he came out to something like 150-160 million and did nearly nothing, not even one okay season, unlike other players in that range or higher
We also fleeced them on Courtois so I guess this was karma.
Lakaka with 100million pounds for Chelsea takes the cake. Hazard and Lakaka both might have zero impact on the teams but Lakaka did more damage to Chelsea like shit talking and dressing room unrest. He is the cancer and it has to be the worst signing in the history of signings.
I can understand people who support smaller club when they care about the financial aspect but real madrid fans? Why do you even care? Your team is one of the biggest corporations in the world, there won't vbe any "painful" financial part, no matter how bad a player is
What about kaka
Junior really made Real Madrid forget about the failures that came with the transfer for Eden Hazard.
Every team needs a main tank.
No, ít could’ve been great. He was the best PL player, was good at the World Cup. Easily top 5 in the world at that time.
How was signing the best player in the world after Messi and Ronaldo a mistake. Hindsight is 20/20, but no one could've predicted all the injuries he would go through and that he would eventually lose his speed and agility.
[deleted]
The American dream
Man’s gotta eat, Mr. Lahey
Ndombele's idol
He should have not done that and tried to win.
mind you, now that Joey Chestnut is out of the picture...
Phat
Sancho wishes he was that good.
How many can he fit in that cheeseburger locker?
WHEN THEY GO?!?
By his own countryman as well I swear
Nothing about that was horrific.
Ima be honest. I completely forgot that dude ever existed
Truly felt like a transfer where everybody was going to win.
He was so respectful to Chelsea, Made it clear that he was only leaving because it was Madrid, and played out of his skin for us the whole season,  finally moved, fucked his ankle and that was that.
I considered him Isco’s replacement, when people expected him to be Ronaldo’s replacement but in reality dude ended up being worse than Madrid legend Mariano.
Can’t feel too bad when you guys can just buy whatever player you guys want. Enjoy Mpabbe.
And he was also incredible in that 2018 world cup, to me the best player, but i can see why people would have put modric over him. Crazy just how quickly it all fell apart, couldn't even get a good half season out of him
My sweet prince 🥲
I have a comment I wrote from 5 years ago saying basically what I’m about to say, so don’t take this as revisionism, but the signs were there that he didn’t have long left if you watched him play regularly.

It’s true that he was coming off his best season, he was also becoming more and more injury prone and watching him week in and week out you could see that getting kicked to shit every match was taking a toll on him. He still had the ability to turn it on and single handedly change a game and he did it plenty that season, but his average games were worse than his average games a few years before.

I’m surprised Real didn’t get one or two decent seasons out of him, but it was pretty clear that he wasn’t going to contribute at Real the way he did at Chelsea.
> we know how it ended

Legend ! Right ?
Bale? Man scored 2 ucl winning goals.
Neither were disasters lmao, Bale is a Madrid legend who played a massive part in a lot of what Madrid accomplished while he was there, injuries and how it ended hurt but doesn’t change that, and Kaka was still good, just wasn’t what he was at Milan but he wasn’t even a flop in terms of how he played
It’s actually insane to think of those guys being brought to Madrid before Hazard
Things could be a lot different for Madrid if Hazard had made it big because Vinicius was often terrible which lead to the iconic statement from Benzema. 

Annoying, because I’d much prefer the galacticos of Madrid than Vinicius Rodrigo and Valverdr as a Barca fan.
And Rudiger😡
That's how we view the Drinkwater transfer lol. It's like we paid 60 odd for Kante and got Drinkwater for free
Yeah, same age or one year difference between him and Hazard when he joined RM, probably would've costed similar, so the similarities were there that's why probably Perez didn't want to take the same risk.

Watching Kane at Bayern, in hindsight it is obvious he would've been a no brainer and probably would've became a goal machine at Real. But in same hindsight Real won La Liga and CL, so they really "survived" without a world class striker.
i imagine it's like:

* do your best home work (due diligence) on players
* sign promising young stars, even at a premium (cuz long term it'd be way more valuable + also better for UEFA finance rules)
* develop them under tutelage of senior players so you don't leave big gaps between generations.
* not substantially reliant on signing mega stars on world record transfer fees
In terms of cost, Hazard was a massive signing (100+ million) and was on his last contractual year with Chelsea. Madrid, who within recent history, at the time, had been leaders in the ‘galactico’ transfer approach took a massive loss with the transfer (for reference Hazard only contributed 7 goals and 12 assists across his entire time with us…). Additionally he was brought in on massive wages. 

Within the same window of time, Madrid had also begun signing young talents from South America (Vini, Fede, Rodrygo). As evident by our current squad, these players were massively succesful and were afforded the time/opportunity to grow into their roles, wages, etc.; rather than being older, expensive, established superstars like Hazard. Since the Hazard ordeal, Madrid has still maintained a policy wherein we sign top older talents, however the big caveat is that we now typically bring them in on free transfers (Rudiger, Alaba). Additionally, we evidently have maintained a primary focus of bringing in top young talents (Camavinga, Tchouameni, Endrick, Arda, etc.). 

Effectively, Hazard’s failure here caused a pretty massive shift in the club’s scouting and transfer policies. It’s very unlikely that, under Perez, you will ever see us make a 25+ year old signing for anywhere near the 100 million mark.
- Madrid sees a Brazilian kid dribble nicely

- Perez spawns in front of his house and throws money at him mumbling something about "never missing another Neymar"
I think the oldest player they made an effort to sign since then was 24-year-old Ferland Mendy. They didn't even push hard for Mbappe... Sure, they paid him nicely, but we all know other clubs would pay more if they could, Mbappe is the world's most popular young footballer by far. Madrid was not pushing at all to get even Mbappe, they were like "ok, if it's a good deal you can come", but the conflict was all in Paris, Madrid was not fighting anybody or taking quick loans to get him. Same with other experienced players, they come if it's not expensive.

Basically Madrid doesn't sign the world's biggest stars anymore, they try to sign young players who will be in the club for many years.

I wouldn't say that it is a BIG change in Madrid's policy. In fact, in their whole history, they have always bet on signing young players and having a stable squad, MOSTLY. Players like Hazard (or Zidane before, or Kaka) were really mostly exceptions, a "this one we really have to get!" event, not the norm. Maybe there will be another at some point.
Quite a difference in age between them.
Makes me wonder: had Hazard been a success would Vinicius’ career been diminished ?
Should've won the golden ball in my honest unbiased opinion
I've seen us play a lot of top quality players since we've been promoted – some that will be considered Premier League greats – but the only one who truly blew me away was Hazard.
Chelsea whole offence ran through him and he dictated the tempo of the whole game. An absolute privilege to watch
Always gets us off the seats as soon as he gets the ball
Funnily enough the closest I've ever felt to the scintillating joy when Hazard got the ball is watching Lauren James. Not saying she is as good (yet at least) but the potential for spontaneous magic every time she picks up the ball is the same
That's a chonky boi
It's a miracle neither suffered career changing injuries from orugu opponents too. Hazard and Neymar were hacked to bits in the English and French leagues, I bet if Ronaldo stayed at United the first time round he wouldn't have been able to maintain his quality going into his mid-30s.
More like he chose to go to PSG and then got injured constantly due to the excessively rough play against him.
Neymar didn’t have the talent to be worthy of being their successor. Sorry but I just hate this narrative that he was anywhere near Ronaldo and Messi
He's just saying none of the three ever eclipsed those two. They declined before Messi essentially
[deleted]
Man Neymar, Hazard and Ronaldo Nazario. So much talent just ruined by injuries and bad luck
Tbf you were getting the closest thing to Messi/Ronaldo in terms of raw natural talent that the rest of the world could offer, no-one knew he was going to be fucked by injury so hard like that.
Lukaku has to be up there, similar price tag, similar lack of impact. Chelsea can get some money back I suppose, though if I remember correctly Hazard ended his contract one year early?
I find it quite suprising no one mention Griezmann here and how that went with him being loaned back and whatever.

But he was not horrible i guess.
Good call! Totally mixed that up. Should’ve remembered given that it was 18/19 where Vini started with Castilla and moved to the first team with the absence of Ronaldo. Wasn’t a particularly great season either lol. 

But ya, the 18-19 kits really were poor. Hated the collar design (not to the same extent, but similarly disappointed in our collar design for the upcoming season).
I definitely like the 11-12, but for me the collar takes this one clear. I really don’t like any collars beyond the standard crew-neck on football kits. I also think the gold sponsor font beats out the black on the 11-12.
It's better as a bit of football trivia
That’s a polite way of saying ‘Madrid fans are spoiled children’ lol
Which was fair, since Eden, even if he stayed healthy, wouldn't have had the same level of goal involvements as cr7 did. Though even now with the attack you guys have, I'd be incredibly surprised if any of them individually had a season as good as cr7's. We've truly been spoiled by just how good him and messi have been
Think it was at half time of a game though, bit different
He means the presentation itself being its own event.

English teams don't do that, but if a match is happening & a big new signing is there but not in the squad they might come out & wave to the crowd (like casemiro did at Utd)
You're right, in Spain they show their passion with monkey chants.
Man city are not the equivalent of Real Madrid in the UK. That would be either Liverpool or Man Utd. 

My comment wasn't a dig at Real Madrid. Like I said, every country has a different fan culture.
I think he's only fit for one, no ? And was already bench dead to Don Carlo
Thanks for the £5 mil again this year.
Unless the player makes it a point that his old club get a fair fee for him, then it really doesn't matter what length of his contract is left. He had made it clear that he'd only leave if Chelsea got the right fee for him
While I tend to agree, I feel like 28 is last big contract age whereas 26 is "I could still get a reasonably large contract before I'm 30".
I had read it wrong, thanks for correcting me!
Yeah exactly, he has spent enough time at Chelsea to be a legend but many neutrals especially the fans of his typical rivals such as Salah will not think of him highly due to this
And Belgium
Valverde played more than him in one season 😭
Complete flop wasn't he
Vini wasn’t great right out the gate
Vini vidi vici
Coutinho is not up there, on his first half-season with us, he scored 10 and assisted 6 on 22 matches.

Those are good numbers for the season of the transfer, and even if the rest of his career at the club amounted to little, at least he did something on the first season, for a similar fee and wages Hazard did absolutely nothing.

Personally, I would take Coutinho over Dembele any day. He scored 1 goal every 4'2 games while being played out of position and sacrificed a lot, on the other hand Dembele scored every 4'6 games, with hundreds of days unavailable, off the field drama, critical misses and the team waiting on him to deliver for 6 seasons when Coutinho was tossed aside as 'unrecoverable' after 18 months.

  
Not that I find any solace on Hazard being easily the worst transfer of the last decade, when we wasted almost 400M on Dembele, Griezmann and Coutinho to end up losing Messi for free.
There's no real "winner" to these kind of threads, but Torres and Shevchenko went to Chelsea for what would be a combined sum of well over £100m in today's money and scored a combined 29 Goals....

Hazard just didn't play very much, those two were both awful.
Hazard was an absolute flop, but Madrid could handle it well.
The combination of Coutinho, Dembele and Griezmann destroyed FCBs financials. This combined with long growing contracts of aging key players plus Covid almost made FCB disappear. It will still take a few years to recover, and the "lever" drama (while necessary I think to stay afloat and decently competitive) will still drag on for the next 20 years until everythign is repaid.
Saying Coutinho is up there just shows you’re either twerking for upvotes or don’t know jack. Barca had a good season out of Coutinho. They loaned him out and sold him as well. Financially much much less of a cost than Hazard. 

And sportingly much better. 

If you want a candidate it’s actually Dembele. Because that was six years of time where they could have sold him and gave time to a player that might actually act like a pro and live up to his potential. 

Dembele only saving grace for Barca was his World Cup final performance.
I'm not sure he hit many bonuses but yeah he's firmly the worst transfer of all time
Tbf, Courtois did most of the work himself.
Courtois fleeced Chelsea. It’s why Chelsea fans call him a snake lol. Acted like he was staying the whole summer and then a week before first game of the season he hands in a transfer request and refuses to train. Chelsea panicked and ended up triggering Kepa’s release clause.
You don't really say you fleeced someone when you're buying
Morata as well
And rudiger
Kaka's decent first season alone is enough to put him far above Hazard.
Was good at the World Cup is an understatement. He had a real case for player of the tournament without even making the final.
It became a problem when he got tackled :(
He was NOT the best PL player lmfao. He was just the most flashy. There were several other better players than him in the league at that time.
Plus the merchandise they sold just because of his name. All in all, it wasn’t a bad transfer, albeit not the one they wanted it to be.
Hazard was never the 3rd best player in the world on his best day
That's unfathomable. I mean ever defenders don't get paid that well per goal
Goals, or lack of
Ben Simmons has competition
_You're gonna eat that ol' Blue Jay burger...arrh_
I wasn't surprised. Quasimodo predicted all this.
Meunier right?
Yea. What could have been
lol. You’re getting downvoted to oblivion but you’re absolutely right. The tackle was innocuous. It was just a combination of really bad luck and the ankle being the one he’d previously broken at Chelsea. 
I feel like it was quite a predictable flop, his well documented lack of care for his own body and his training methods were always gonna catch up to an aging winger/forward. Not to mention he was never a world class scorer like Ronaldo and has never been elite in the CL. He fit Chelsea well and was consistently the best performer in the PL but it's not what Real needed at all.
That classico goal after he just came on is one for the books. Fly high king whenever you are.
You don't have to feel bad for Real but for Hazard. He went from top 5 at the time to not even top 15 at Real in a short time span.
Watching Chelsea was so much fun from 2013-2019.  Hazard gave me happy feelings watching him rip through a team.

Palmer is giving me the same happy feelings.  Hope he continues to play at the level he did last season.
Yes, which is an incredible legacy to have for such a failure of a player. Guess he was in the right place at the right time.
Yeah. Rodrygo and Vini for 45M each was a huge gamble but it paid off well.
Madrid followed the Epstein playbook. Bag ‘em young and keep them filled.
Yeah that's true. If Hazard was in form, Vini wouldn't have gotten this much chances and become the player he is today unless Hazard is played as SS or CAM. But Real isn't exactly lacking there then or now.
And we got Bellingol instead, who will be world class for at least 10 more years.
[deleted]
Curious to learn more about this upcoming player Mbappé !
Mbappe is the exception I suppose. He's an exception probably worth making, but I would have said that about Hazard at the time.
Probably. If he succeded, there is a high chance he would still be at Real. And Real might not have been patient with Vini during his first 3 years too.
Christ, he's already getting the Paul Scholes treatment.
scored 2 and had an assist in that match.
And went to Saudi at 30 and is taking a vacation and getting more money than ever without playing
> Neither of them were anywhere close to Hazard

???


Hazards best season at Chelsea he scored 19 goals. Bale in his 2013 season before moving to Real Madrid outscored Hazards best ever season with 21 goals 


Hazard was phenomenal but trying to claim neither Neymar or Bale got close to Hazard is just absolute nonsense
Yeah. But the way R9 held up after the injury was insane.
To lump R9 with the other 2 is actually insane. Have you seen both of his knees? My goodness he even went to Madrid with a half working knee and still did really well, then the other knee went and he still played. I saw in a video and the amount of pain he had to pull through and the rehab work he did just to be able to kick a ball after those injuries was insane. Bear in mind knee surgery wasn’t as advanced as it is today.
Those 3 all share that one thing in common that is detrimental to any athlete tho so I wouldnt say its bad luck (maybe ronaldo because he suffered what was probably the most infamous sports injury ever)
In terms of talent, yes. Neymar might be the only one in that era that will top the talent part.
Nah. Neymar or Salah would've been waaaaay better signings. (If they were available)
Yeah. Him too but for different reasons. He was not so great in the dressing room iirc and dissed on Chelsea on every occasion. But had better stats.

Hazard on the other hand was really well with the team mates but his whole cost after every bonus would be 150M. Real face 5M or so this season cause they won the UCL to Chelsea according to reports.
Chelsea have just continued loaning him out and getting back money from the transfer. He is still a good player and they could get atleast half of it back probably. Chelsea overreacting to his press conference is their own fault imo.
His stats were not that bad imo. The problem was his insane transfer fee that makes it hard to justify fully.
I mean, one of the top 2 players of the club's history is leaving. So wouldn't fans ask for a replacement.
Yeah. Hazard was never a CR type of player and not a CR replacement. 

No. Only Benzema in 2021/22 had a close season (with Cristiano's average) and that's based mostly of my UCL bias lol. Vini's this season in which he is seen as a balon d'or candidate has weaker stats that Cris's first season and his worst season by stats here at Real.

Yes. We have been spoiled. I have seen comments like Vini doesn't deserve this balon d'or cause he has only 30ish G+A. But that's how football worked before Cristiano and Messi lol.
Oh ok.

This thing is pretty normal in Spain. Dembele not able to perform well during his presentation was a meme.
Yeah understood. Yes it's kind of like the norm in many places. Actually it would be weird at Real if they decide not to have a presentation for Mbappe.
Been to games in both countries, you should go if you want to see an actual stadium atmosphere
Liverpool and Man Utd are no longer dominant and Utd is starting to become irrelevant outside of England. Real Madrid is an international brand, hence the “shows” they put on.
It's 13M in total with the Kepa bonus too.

I seriously doubt if Madrid makes a contract thinking that they wouldn't win the UCL.
Yea in particular that 2018 WC performance was crazy
Yup, not even 1000 mins per season for a player who cost almost 250M (transfer fee + bonus + salary) is insane.
‘He’s playing against us’
Hazard being fat is the only reason Real Madrid have world class Vinicius because no way he gets that much time to improve normally lol
I remember people posting about how he was inconsistent as if he couldn't get any better than he was at the veteran age of 17.
Coutinho good player
Not sure why your comparing by goals. Dembele is a creator. You’re talking about a player who was able to become a league assist leader in half a season and who was battling to be one of the best assisters in Europe while a teenager at Dortmund. And that’s not bringing up how he’d destroy the opponents press with his change of pace and dribbling.

Demeble was easily more influential over a longer period of time. He just couldn’t stay healthy.
Read my reply to the other guy
> when we wasted almost 400M on Dembele, Griezmann and Coutinho to end up losing Messi for free.

yeah the last part was the kicker. you lost so much money on this you couldn't keep the GOAT even when he wanted to stay. he would even have reduced his salary I think? but regulations don't allow such drastic reductions, to protect workers rights.
Football inflation is a little different from what I've read, and it's been a while since I did Pay As You Play. But essentially what the author did, who was the 1st person to look at inflation in Football, was he look at what the record transfer was between any two time periods you're looking at and use those to normalise the other fees. Doing that with Shevchenko means he alone costs €127million in today's transfer fees.
Torres won the decisive corner kick in the CL finals. Worth every penny for Chelsea fans.
Today's money? The top clubs' budgets in the same currency are at least 2.5 times higher now than in 2011.
Hazard didn’t play much because he was either too injured or too out of shape and often both.
At least they scored man...
Overall Torres scored 45 goals for Chelsea and was instrumental for their League Europe run + helped for CL
I watched every single Barca game up till 2020(life hit after that couldn't watch all) staying up till 2AM to watch them because I live in Dhaka.

So respectfully I would have to ~~concur~~ say that I do know "jack". And respectfully Barca didn't have a good season out of Coutinho. He played well for 6 months - the latter stage of 17/18, with his best performance coming in the match where we scored a hat-trick(that was the match I believe where we lost the invincible season). He played piss-poor in 18/19 and got loaned out in 19/20.

142 Million for 6 months of good performance and 2 goals against us in the biggest UCL humiliation isn't a good deal. Specially when you consider he went to Aston Villa for 17M

Dembele on the other hand - whilst injured yes, was a constant creative threat, tho not spectacular in terms of G/A(that being said he did have a decent G/A out put all things considered). Not to mention the fact that we sold him for 50M.

I don't really know how you can conclude Coutinho when compared to Dembele specially when Dembele was bought for less, sold for more, and actually played decent when fit.
Dembele was overall not a good transfer due to his injuries but he contributed consistently when he was healthy. Plus he got sold for 50m.

Hazard is a several tiers more awful as a transfer. You could probably count his great games in one hand, cost a ton in wages, and didn’t bring any money back.
They weren't just individual milestones though... Chelsea just got £5m from that deal for Madrid reaching the UCL final
He hit some very heavy team performance bonuses (La Liga and CL)
100% agree. Worst transfer ever. Hazard didn’t do a single thing in his time with us. Coutinho wasn’t as bad in Barca, he was just a shit transfer. 

I don’t hate him, I still like the guy, I’m just sorry for him, was his dream to play for us and he flopped. Still, having Vini and Rodrygo makes it not hurt.
 🐍 fuck courtois that screwed us causing to panic buy on a shitty keeper
Courtois has always been a douche :(
Ahh English isn't my first language, it's just something I picked up from my English friends.
Exactly. Salah had over 50 goals in the two seasons before this transfer. Hazard was good but he was never the unanimous best player in the Prem.
Are you delusional? How it wasn’t a bad transfer in any way?
Right, Neymar was better, but other than that no one.
Maguire probably does.
Ben Simmons doesn’t arrive on court with a burger belly.
Ben Simmons had/have a back injury…
Always has a hunch.
Who did what!?
Indeed. And it was when he was in his best form at Madrid as well iirc
Yeah idc people are idiots.
Once a narrative is set it never leaves. People still think that Roy Keane ended Haalands career.
Hazard was amazing in CL.
>t's not what Real needed at all.

But that's exactly how real operates and has proven to work for them wonderfully, buy the best players, think about tactics later, when Benzema left there was a big hole in the striker position, they couldn't sign the best striker to replace him so they bought the best midfielder they could buy, figure  out who scores later, later they won the CL. Now they have two top quality left wingers, and go and buy Mbappe.
Lol dude y'all had to literally put an abusive shadow on him in Ander Herrera and STILL got caked by Hazard. A man mark plus the rest of your team and you still couldn't win lol 

Hazard was a monster and would've slotted in very well at Madrid.
Scuffed ass shot at a tight angle while he was falling down, hits the ball towards the ground and it gets a weird bounce just enough to get it over the leg of Ter Stegen. All this just before the COVID lockdown 

Truly a memorable goal.
Huge gamble that paid off well when it turned into a bargain.
To be fair, Real also paid 30M for Reinier to keep it sort of balanced
>paid off well.

Understatement of the year lmao
Well and for that you have somone like reinier as well but that’s peanuts for Madrid so they can follow through with a strategy like that
With the Hazars flop and if Vini and Rodrygo didn’t play out, it would’ve cost Florentino the job.
Dude
Just like the cigarette companies! “Only if we had their numbers!”
bruh
You sum’ bitch! 

Take my upvote
But imagine Bellingham, Kroos, Vini and Rodrygo all playing with Kane. Kane could've had a prime Ronaldo or Benzema like season for real as he likes to score but also assist and involve others in the attack. He really is the kind of striker Real should had, or have, moving forward. But I'm not mad that Real didn't get him as they had an incredible season without a great striker which was a great gamble in itself and probably shouldn't be tried again as it can very well implode a season as well.

I hope Mbappe evolves into a more central striker role or at least Ancelotti finds a way to involve both him and Vini in the same formation.
Yeah but Bellingham is easily worth more. Think he came on a steep discount. 

Mbappe is expensive yes but it’s through free transfer and he’s a generational talent, about as much as a sure bet as you can get (barring injuries).

Those are also just two big signings compared to like dozen+ of signings that are youth focused.
I think its more of an age thing than value with their new philosophy. All of the marquee signings they've been going for (Bellingham, Mbappe, Davies) aren't even in their primes yet. They also haven't been going after established superstars like Osimhen or Kane (who apparently Perez vetoed as a transfer target). So it's pretty clear they're just not willing to stomach another Hazard type transfer for a while.
His name is actually Mbaba. I understand that people would get the name wrong. Unknown talent and all that.
Also, Madrid have been after him even before he burst into the spotlight.
Mbappe is 25 so depends how you interpret 25+ as to whether he is an exception
And the injury part
Not only talent
I'm talking about raw talent though. Hazard was lazy as fuck and didn't treat his body as well but still was that good. Imagine how good he would have been if he trained as hard as Ronaldo for instance.
You mean Hazard?
Chanting to demand a top-3 (and likely most expensive) player in the world, during the presentation of a different, €100m, top-10 player in the world is exceptionally entitled, no matter what void they needed to fill at the time.
I've been to matches across Europe and can confidently say you're talking nonsense.
Liverpool and Man Utd aren't international brands? They're some of the biggest, most popular clubs on the planet.
Thank you more.
Yup blessing - that’s the type of coincidences make people believe in God
The whole quote is even funnier
Hazard got fat so Vini could fly. Thanks Madrid Jesus
holy shit i never put this together lmao, and you're dead right
Hazard waddled so Vini could run
Or he was inconsistent at that age which is fair to point out?
Dembele was hardly a creator at Barca, which is understandable given that Messi did most of the creating. But even then, Dembele showed little creative spark in most appearances. The only times where I saw Dembele providing attacking threat were during counters and transitions. He wasnt great at dribbling past the defender, though he had the pace to do it; he would usually carry the ball forward, cut back on to his stronger foot, then either cut forward or offer a cross that usually amounted to nothing. 

Dembele's strength was his finishing ability and his positioning in the box. However, his big miss against Liverpool really cemented his career as a bottler. I think he simply did not fit the Barca style of play at all, so he couldn't really live up to his price tag in the first place. He's not a bad player, even a good player, but he couldnt become the player that you've just described when he was at Barca.
Yeah that's about the right proportion considering how both seller and buyer have much higher budget today to compete for the same goal.

Shevchenko was a cult player... if anything it was a symbolic feat to get him in Chelsea, although today with FFP probably no team in Europe would splurge on a 30-year-old unless he's more popular than the sport itself.
Torres is also the only player in football history that gets lauded for winning a corner kick.
Just so you know "concur" means to agree, maybe you meant conclude. Sorry to be a bother
And dont forget that the club willingly renewed Dembele and was disappointed when he forced his exit for 50M. 

Barcelona was begging to get rid of Coutinho.

This says something about their performance at the club.
Lmao, you love to see it.
Hindsight is 20/20
He just doesn’t show up at all and chickens out of wide open dunks on a point guard half his size in a game 7
And Hazard had an ACL injury and countless other injury problems
i remember perez snubbing meunier in tunnel lol
1G + 4A in 10 apps...astounding
he only called him a league two level player (in terms of general play mind you) that's a bit far off ending his career /s
At least Roy Keane was actually unhinged. Meunier's was nothing special
Not really, compared to his PL performances he's not even a top 30 CL player of his era
What has that got to do with what I said?
Yeah yeah. Thanks for the correction.
even calling it a bargain is underplaying it, it's insane how much vini has given to the club
Until they fail something and then it's a flop again.

Welcome to football
Yeah. But since Madrid have been highly successful, that won't be taken seriously by anyone.

This is also the time of Jovic and Hazard. If Madrid wasn't able to win 2 UCL, both those transfers would have been ridiculed.
Oh no, what I meant was that the money we used for Bellingham was the money we could’ve used for Kane. No way we could’ve afforded both.
It's important to note that their mentioned style of roster building allowed them to wait for Mbappe. There was no leverage against them.
Yeah I think of that as 25 and above. But even aside from that nitpick, I can't think of Mbappe as a "young player" anymore, he's in his peak years already. He's got as much football miles with playing from a very young age at the highest level as someone a couple of years older than your average 25 year old.
I agree but still Neymar definitely had more raw talent aside from technical dribbling. He was just naturally a better shooter, passer, and had way more skills. He was also lazy like Hazard but still had the better career.
No. Griezmann.

Hazard's stats ain't close to being justifiable even a bit.

Kaka at Real is labelled as a flop by many despite boasting 70 G+A in 120 games cause he was injured a lot. Hazard in comparison has 19 G+A.
When Hazard signed for Madrid, he was better than Mbappe. Coming off the back of the best season of his career, the best player at the World Cup the summer before. He was the one that was top 3 in the world imo.
Yeah. That's kind of entitled.

But Mbappe was highly linked at that time and was the most desired transfer.

And it's not like the whole 50k was chanting. It's most likely a small section of fans which chanted.
When did I say that Liverpool and Man United aren’t international brands?
Or someone else depending on who you support lol
Uhrm..No.
A player literally went through a lot of injury and suffering, for Viniscus to progress 💀
Dembélé was a statistically elite creator and dribbler, even if he wasn't of the close-control style. Of course when Leo was still here, he did the vast majority of things but that era also coincided with the stop-start perennially injury-prone version of Dembélé too. The one that we saw after he was gifted a second chance and made relevant again by Xavi was the main creator for our team.

> Dembélé's strength was his finishing ability and his positioning in the box.

Lol if anything, his wildly inconsistent finishing which has been a constant throughout his career was one of his weaknesses. His overall goal output isn't high and despite that not being his primary role in attack, you can't say that a ball-to-feet player like him had great positioning either. There's a reason why the *Dembélédepedencia* periods saw most of the attacking play run through him whilst on the ball since that was where he'd excel.

You're right about the predictability at times, especially against buses and crossing into the box, but that was as much of a tactical issue too, since Xavi wanted him to stay wide and 1v1 all the time rather than have more freedom.

Speaking of such

> 🚨 Ousmane Dembélé (PSG): "Luis Enrique gives me more freedom than I had at Barça." Via @sport

This is both something I agree and disagree with, depending on to what extent he means this.
He was crucial in our Europa League run too the following year. And not to mention, he won the ONLY corner kick Chelsea had that game. And that led to the game tying goal. And in semis, he delivered the knock out blow by scoring a 90 min equalizer and giving Chelsea the lead in the overall score. Sure his PL stats were bad but his cup stats were decent.
I mean Vinicius in this year’s CL final did win the corner kick (that eventually became the goal) with a beautiful nutmeg that made the front page multiple times.
Ah thanks. English isn't my first language.
Exactly!

Not to mention 50M is almost half the fee we bought him for in the first place. Where we made a 100M+ loss on Coutinho.
Yes, and we are talking with hindsight
crazy how RM paid 45m each for a set of 4 year olds
Remember how people were branding him a flop the first year? Insane how much he turned that around and is now like a top 3 winger in the world.
I'd think that they've already done so much for the club that, even if they fell off now, they'd at least not be seen as a waste of money. Maybe not a bargain, but definitely not a flop. Real Madrid fans to have ridiculously high expectations though.
Really good point!
Nah, definitely not. Only thing Neynar really has on Hazard is that he just had a style where he did more flamboyant tricks than Hazard.
You comment implies Madrid is an international brand and the others teams are not. Also that big clubs put on these sort of "shows". My whole point is that different places do things differently. Neither way is necessary the right or wrong way to do things. 

I am not looking for an argument here.
haha this reminds of that ‘save me donald trump’ video lol

Drake rapping over BBL Drizzy beat was a mistake
So Drake jumped on the BBL Drizzy beat last day on that fucking trash ass earr*pe song from Sexyy Red. Everyone seems to be congratulating him for this "move" but all it did is put him in comparison to all the hundreds of other amatuer rappers who jumped in on it, at least for me. 

[Just look at all these rappers going at it using the  beat](https://youtu.be/Ri15ZFO_ptg?si=O0WioXxCr4uGWhVV)

I don't even understand what the Japanese Dude is saying and even that goes hard as fucking shit compared to Drake. 

Imagine being one of the "greatest rappers" and not even hitting top 10 in something like this. Like, bruh. 
He would do anything to cling to the current popular thing
Drake “reclaiming” the BBL Drizzy beat like this would have been a good move on his part imo, if the execution was actually good. Unfortunately for him, it is very much not. And doing it on someone else’s song is just an outright bizarre move, no idea what he was thinking there.
When I see you stand by Sexy Red I believe you see two bad bitches
it basically showcases his one-dimensional approach to making music for the world to see, if they haven’t already
“Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence. The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin',”
When you have the best BBL in History, you have to represent.
I thought the beginning of his verse was cool. You know some average drake talking nonsense tht sound dope. But when tht bbl drizzy beat drop and he doubles down on paying for surgeries and shit. Tht was cringe. Some of the lines are not good like i bet he means it in diff ways but due to the current state of rap. He lowkey shooting himself on the foot again. 
“Why you love me? Still a mystery. 
Me and the surgeon got history “
“They need a new body they hittin me”
“Bbl drizzy they need a new body they ask me for it”

Like i get what he going for but shit is just not landing and him calling himself bbl drizzy its not the move. Its cool he trynna flip it tho. 
Medal for trying. He can put it on his general jacket.
![gif](giphy|gTfIVfp2c4owI6pVrA)

He bouta make it go clap clap clap clap clap clap
Drake does cornball shit like this all the time why u still surprised?
Let's be honest, Drake as a "rapper" was a mistake
He did it too late. There's so many Drake fans that swear he killed it, but the verse was pretty bad, and the song altogether was trash (but she knows this, she does this on purpose). Drake needed to respond within a day or two on the BBL Drizzy beat, imo. It's been about 3 weeks, and he waited just to put that out? He coulda dropped somethin even a week later, and taken that beat and owned it. Now he just looks silly.
The guy had a beat made about his ass, say what you want about the Kendrick portion of the feud but nobody's taking this part that seriously it was a funny move by a funny guy lol
Drake is an embarrassment.
Imo he should have done it either the day after or the same day bbl drizzy dropped. He lacks cultural awareness with how AA and hip hop moves. If he was gonna spit bars, people were expecting bullets and he tossed out candies lol imo he should have dropped the RnB shit.
People gon remember drizzy verse on the beat, we wont remember anyone else’s, drizzy playing the long game, in a couple years time when we revisit this beef, we’ll only mention drakes verse on the beat and no one else’s lol
He could have done nothing and nothing would have changed for yall. Hated him before hated him after.
Yall just don’t like bro lol and that’s okay. Just say that and let’s move forward
that verse is worse then sexy red's hairline.
Who is congratulating him? You should stop paying attention to those people— and frankly Drake should, too. They are not doing him any favors.
Sexy Red is trash and not matter how hard you boost that  she’s still trash.
He should’ve rapped over the beat but on a solo song, not with sexy red’s trash ass. If he had killed it that would’ve been cool and would’ve shown how unbothered he was. But instead he dropped that mix with sexy red and while his verse was ok, the rest was trash.
Say what you will about the song but a majority of people here are just hating on Drake because its the cool and fun thing to do on the internet. It's the mob mentality but I digress...
Oh whatever. Somebody always thinks something was a “mistake” lol. You people will reach for everything
There it is. Y’all just moved the goal post again!
Bruh everywhere I go... It's Drake this... Drake that.
Drake bad, upvotes to the left
lol there is no end to the crying and I'm here for it
I just listened and didn't think it was as bad as y'all said...I was wrong lol

Drake is a clown for this, and I kinda feel like dude has given up, I mean this is the track you drop after the biggest beef we've had since 50/game, nas/jay, pac/biggie...this is the shit he puts out? Truly embarrassing.

If nothing else, this proves he's a vulture.
Why the fuck is every rap sub obsessed with Drake, wtf?! Everyday some weird take on “why I hate Drake”
Bragging about paying for girls to disfigure themselves…on brand
I thought it was a good song
I speak Japanese. He says drake is a bitch ass.
Him and Cole literally dropped the wackest verses of all time after k dot pooped off
Shows he’s a 🌽 
Trying to take the L and turn it into a W was the wrong move
It's always the anime people that love Kendrick. 

You're wrong on this
stop reaching for upvotes, we get it you don't like Drake
To me, it just shows how much it bothers him.
Yall are insufferable. And yes drake has the best bbl drizzy verse
Your misunderstand how only corporate funded media survives history. Drake is doing that for his fuckin estate. Kendrick bodied him, and every year hence, those who were there and cared will be the only ones who remember it with time.

  
our grandkids‘ grandkids will be listening to that stupid work work work song with Rihanna and they’ll assume BBL Drizzy started with the sexy red song and the soundcloud rappers ripped it and jumped on it. And once a year, there will be a TIL about the actual origins of the BBL beat, and that post will get less than 2,000 upvotes.

  
the revolutionary is a doomed man
It's like he can't make a good strategic move without overdoing it. He keeps acting like he doesn't take any of the disses seriously, on the same songs he's doing shit that he got dissed for. Ducking accusations, bringing up family and women, riding the waves of younger artists. Dude did all that shit during his *responses*.
Drake > 100s of amateur rappers. If anything he sonned a 100 rappers on an ass song using the same beat. For the most part it was genius even if the song/verse itself is mediocre cause that bbl drizzy beat doesnt have the same effect it had before the verse.
I’m thinking he should have titled the song “Two bad bitches”
Drake already lost so I have no problem with this
He was actually super wavy on this beatm made sense why he hopped in it. It's a good beat
If your comparing him to someone who’s language you don’t even speak  the. Your just a hater geta nee personality
The move woulda been fine, if it wasn’t ass. It was not good at all and made him look even goofier
“a mistake has been made” 🤓
It was sad 
It reminds me of when Nikki tried to do Barbianna.
Drake rapping was a mistake.
It was a great move. Drake won!
Is this just the Kendrick Lamar sub?
[removed]
Ffs wtf do yall want from the guy lol im not even siding with drake but these posts are getting boring af
Relax. The war is over its just fun.
Drake takes a shit and it’s a mistake, y’all weird dude lol
Lmao the Kendrick glazing has to stop, we all get he lost but people acting like drake being drake is now a mistake when this man already has his success. This is literally the type of thing drake would do pre beef and will continue to do post beef. 

The song makes sense with sexy redds stick which is why using the beat there is funny. No one wants to hear drake spit  real bars in bbl drizzy
womp womp
I think it’s corny not matter what but if he was gonna rap over BBL drizzy it should have been his own song
Trash take. It was a good move. The hate on this sub is unbelievable lmao
Says it’s a mistake but yet you not only listened to the song but are talking about it….. can’t make this up
It’s funny? Drake is corny, he pulled off a good bit corny joke. Idk why people would be pressed, it didn’t sound bad.
you people are obsessed
Man yall say us Drake fans be glazing but yall spend ALOT of time talking about him 😂
No way y’all are hyping those weak ass verses in that video
I don't really care to listen to random no-name rappers on the Internet. It doesn't move me that they hopped on the clout train of dissing Drake. I don't doubt maybe some of them can rap even better than Drake. Some probably even better than Kendrick.

But again, I don't really care. I can start taking them seriously when they make it big. Otherwise, they're in the boat with every other sound cloud rapper.

And for the record, no I don't think Drake made a mistake. The song was trash because of Sexy Red. But I did like the verse. He's capable of having a sense of humor, something some of y'all need to learn to do. He was clearly having fun with the song. All it is to it.
You really think Drake or the general public cares about parody songs from rappers with no motion? 

“He’s being compared to hundreds of unknown MCs that made songs rapping about his asscheeks.”😂
The impression I get, having heard none of the tracks, is that rapping on one’s own diss track represents a level of cultural un-awareness that should immediately exclude him from any relevance to hip-hop. Personally, I don’t think he had any to begin with; he’s a Disney child actor, an R&B singer, and his ‘raps’ are about the people he fucks and the clubs he gets into because of other people. Sometimes you need an R&B singer for a hook because rapping about fucking the world for 72 hours may not always be the level of delivery you need.
[removed]
Drake has officially lost the beef against Kendrick. KDot said Drake thinks he's a bad bitch too when hrs next to Sexxy Red...
[removed]
Only move he should have done on that beat was another diss track that is actually good. He needed to flip that shit on Kendrick. And not anything like the heart part 6
 Drake needs to stay irrelevant so he can continue to groom the kids, and give them much needed advice on how to get boy friends. Drake is a bitch.
You’re just a hater man get the man out of your brain he living there rent free
Might have been okay if the song didn’t suck lol. Or if he committed to the bit more and did a full on submission lol.
Drakes verse was decent, but the song itself is so ass it doesn’t matter. Sexyy Red does silly troll songs and it’s cool sometimes, but I don’t know why Drake would feel the need to hop on one of em.
Drake could have easily flipped "BBL Drizzy" into bad bitches love Drake.

Hell, I used to rap, and soon as that dropped, that was my first thought. That would have been a crazy counter.
[removed]
If I’m being real, his rap was fine and I do think it could have been a great move if it wasn’t so horribly tainted by Sexxy Red. Who thought that was a good idea???? 😭
It’s just another example of him wanted to be at the cool table. It’s what’s hot, so he’s gonna try to attach himself to it. That’s just how he always does.

He could have done it better, he could have flipped it better, bad bitches love Drake was right there, he could have made it a song…… instead of just stuck it on the worst fucking song I’ve heard in a long long time.
And the mix was ass
I actually liked the flow and thought it was a good attempt to flip the narrative…but Did he succeed no imo bc this should have dropped the week metro put the beat out if he was going to do that. i did listen to the drake verse several times (sliced out of the song bc it’s that awful) and fw it but its not a good move to 1. be on this hot garbage song with sexyy red, so fucking bad that people are just cutting out the drake verse 2. basically prove kendrick right that drake pacifies and is only rly good with the melodies. The lyrics say nothing important  if you listen
You put in quotes one of the  "greatest rappers". I have to say your perception of him would still be on the lower side, if we're to give this post any credibility. So it's like damned it he did damned if he didn't, yeah?
I don’t even know what he’s saying and it’s hard as shit.Lmao. But you’re right.
Anyone who hopped on it after the Yuno Miles remix dropped fucked up, nobody was gonna top that
Drake living rent free in all yalls head lmaooooo
Imagine catching feelings over a rapper on a beat

![gif](giphy|35MAYN05pfYj9iczl8|downsized)
I feel like if he was the 1st or one of to rap on the beat maybe woulda been different, like a gimmie that beat/ jackin 4beats like cube, but nahh he really thinking he a bad bitch standing next to sexy.
days like this i super wish P! was around to talk hella shit ngl
I thought it was smart, if he killed it….he didn’t kill it though.
The song is a joke, redditors are dense
He accepted defeat. He basically confirmed he is a bad bitch and he has had work done.
Not only did he fail to own it the way he was trying to, he did it on a hilariously awful song
the things is it didn't flip anything, people don't laugh back at Metro, they don't stop clowning Drake and calling him bbl drizzy and it's not a catchy banger because sexy red part exists
Sexxy Redd is the worst female rappers in history. I heard nursery rhymes with better lyrics
Can't say and too lazy to check but red eye is a pretty good Japanese rapper ...if that's him.
It wouldn’t be as bad if it wasn’t on Sexxy Red’s worst song ever. 
who’s congratulating him for using the beat? why are you just making shit up to be mad at lmao
It doesn’t matter.
Drake missed his chance to record a Kendrick diss over the beat but we've known he was soft since he came around
I think one difference is I didn’t go listen to all the other rappers going at it using the beat, only him lol

But man is that song some hot dookie water overall
This is basic drake 101. If you didn't expect him to be like "fuck it you right I AM a bad bitch", then you just don't understand his game lol. I personally think it's super corny, but it is exactly what I expected.
“I don’t even understand what the Japanese dude is saying and it goes harder than Drake”

I’m confused.
I'm tired of people saying "oh he's creepy, this and that, but he can rap"

no, motherfucker, he cannot.  Not in comparison to anybody who actually *can.* He displays it every time he uses the same shitty flow for the past 15 years
Realistically anything Drake does from here on out is going to be received poorly. I think the right thing for him is to step out of the spotlight and let this die down. That could take years, but I think everyone could use a break after all the Drake activity this decade.
Clout chasers. Drizzy stimulus package. lol. Mistake? That’s a bit much.
The Japanese rapper one that battle.
That song is the worst song I've ever heard and that's saying something... he chose poorly
Thanks for the link!
Not over the beat itself, but doing it on sexy red’s song was the mistake. Should’ve been a solo release.
if your favorite artist, is not really an artist but a copycat with content stolen from others, maybe you should reevaluate your taste in music, better yet, reevaluate your taste in yourself cuz denial will always take you
Looking back can you admit you were wrong?☠️ Songs still trending on every social media and music platform, huge bag.
Drake and his team need to stop getting their ideas from his fanboys on YouTube
It was pure ass agreed
You sound like a hater, it’s entertainment and the Drake verse was 🔥🔥🔥
Song is awful but drizzy part is good, especially cause he used the BBL beat. Gotta be able to laugh at yourself.
For how much y’all don’t like Drake you love to talk about him. All the time too, like every day 👀
Drake went in on BBL Drizzy. He got a free beat from Metro
Ah, yes..

The daily “Let me explain to you why I don’t like Drake” Post.. Yall are buggin
Listen to how much hate you are spewing bro “I don’t even know what the Japanese dude is saying but he did better than Drake” bro your bias as fuck so stop acting like you’re giving us some middle ground opinion
Saying your responsible for a lot of young women getting surgery after being called a body shamer is certainly a move
It’s funny how everywhere you go on the internet ppl either don’t care or think it was a mistake, but you go into the Drake fandom bubble and it’s the biggest win of the beef. Some people cannot be helped.
Nah it wasn’t. Lotta folks criticizing every move the dude make, but he having fun with it. When folks gonna realize he don’t give a damn? And realistically, why should he over such trivial shit?
BBL Drizzy they want a new body they ask me for it
He thought he could be quirky and above it all, only for it to blow up in his face
>Drake rapping was a mistake

Fixed
The song was fire. Reddit filled with a bunch of old men who hate new age
Maybe he did it because no one else will send him beats so he had to go for public domain 🥲
It was not, it's fantastic marketing. You're giving him free promotion with this post.
Lol jesus you guys need to go outside. Who cares?
Verse was good y’all are the biggest haters. Imagine making this post  🤡
It’s just petty and funny, he ain’t trying to be a lyrical genius here, just trolling metro
It wasn't it was funny. His verse was decent but the song is shit.
Ahhh yes it’s cool to say how much you hate Drake now. Can we please move on god damn y’all hung up over nothing. Who cares they made a track for the ghetto girls to bop to. 

Who cares if he rapped over the BBL Drizzy beat.
You can’t tell these Drake fans anything, man. I’ve accepted that many of them on here are just delusional or only casual rap fans. 

It’s like arguing with a white kid who only likes Eminem. They have no idea how ridiculous they sound/look.
*ting
IMO what he should do is establish a sub-label called "OV-Hoe's" which exclusively signs rising female rappers.

Imagine Drake having an entire fleet of Sexyreds.
it’s literally a song about him
It was killing Drake not to hop on a scene. He just couldn't resist.
Are you guys angry cause you thought he would go into hiding or something?
Are you saying he’s a human dingleberry?
Dude said I'm not scared to come outside and show my face after the heart part 6. Just let me do it behind this chick.
Same as his move to cop Kendrick's *The Heart* naming scheme. If you're gonna do something like that, you gotta bring heat, not excuses.
The lyrics and integration make perfect sense on a sexy redd song
I think he needed to do it right away. Not 3 weeks later.
It’s so bad
The way I see it, drake had 24 hours to drop an absolute heater over BBL and save his name. But waiting weeks then coming on as a SR feature? L
I think he thought he was playing 4D chess by doing it, and on a song with the person he was made fun of with. 

He didn’t execute, but I think that was his motive.
Day late and a dollar short.  Literally.
Ugh yeah that's the truth. And we had to sit through a sexxy redd song to get to it? That's like crop dusting the front row on the way to a podium and speaking about why ya hate fake ppl
Its funny because im on a Cypress hill kick right now and ended up listening to Ice Cube Killer today, where they rap over the beat from his diss track King of the Hill. Wouldve preferred a new Muggs beat but I think they were touring and just thought fuck it we'll flip it on him
After the first 15 seconds & hearing Sexxy Red's voice crack, I didn't care about Drake's part at all lol
he comes off as too thin skinned. He bitches about old shit n his songs all the time. He has all that money, maybe use some to go to a therapist..
Timing is everything, if he jumped on it the next day - even without the best execution then people could claim it as a win and a good sport move. He waited too long and it’s still ass lol
I think it's a smart move. His fans have been working overtime defending him. By rapping on BBL Drizzy with Sexy Redd he's showing them he's unaffected by what Kendrick has said. If he loses his core fanbase he really will be done. If he keeps them and keeps them happy, the beef will eventually blow over and he could start trying to build his fanbase back up.
Verse was solid af, the rest of the song is just so bad I can’t get to it lol.
Tryna strike a chord and it’s prolly A minorrrrr.
Dude is spiraling fr
I think the only way to properly execute it is to claim the plastic surgery and frame it as a good thing because he has money and that people are just jealous he looks good.

Which is way too bold a move for Drake I imagine.
He should have done it asap it could have killed a lot of the bbl rap drop momentum but he ofc waited way too long
🤰🏾🫃🏻
That’s been on display for over a decade but people still listen to his noise mate.
Lmao y’all need to make
Up your mind first he’s a singer then he’s soft then he’s emotional then he’s got 10’ different accents and now he’s one dimensional LOL
🤔 made multiple songs in multiple genres and he’s one dimensional? Make it make sense
“You’re movin just like a degenerate, every antic is feeling distasteful.”
This is aging so well. Kendrick really showed out.
The cake made us show up
>Medal for trying. He can put it on his general jacket.

Bars. 

Dude is just being an idiot who's repeatedly shooting himself in his foot chasing clout. Mfer should just take a long ass vacation and come back with a clear head.

>Medal for trying. He can put it on his general jacket.

Is that the same general jacket **colonizers** used to wear..?
So you either can’t comprehend or you choosing to be ignorant on purpose? He clearly told Sexy red to keep it natural and to NOT get a BBL? Tiktok generation and yall selective hearing smh
He actually said that he prefers women stay natural in that same verse
😭 😭
CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP

Drake fucked it up
People like to karma whore for the most obvious shit lol it’s funny
“Cornball, your show money merch money fee to us”
I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
Let’s be honest. All the success says otherwise. Be mad all you want
What was the first Drake song you ever heard?
I’m curious what you mean by she does this on purpose. I would have thought even if she was aware of how absolutely trash her music is she couldn’t really do any better if she tried.
Ok, thank you. I’ve been saying she’s aware of the music she makes. It feels very tongue in cheek
It's just corny.
How?
I don’t think drakes trying to win the world back with that track
Cultural awareness with who????
Social media antics and appeasing to your “well I would of dropped earlier” mind set, does not define culture… 😂 wtf are you even talking about
>He lacks cultural awareness with how AA and hip hop moves. 

This is a wild statement
Yall would have been saying the same thing yall saying now regardless when he dropped it. It’s ok to hate tho. Yo boy Kendrick Umar Lamar does a lot that
Two blocks down, there's a sub for him. 

Don't visit, just trust me.
Bro who's boosting her?

Like, I genuinely felt bad for Drake having to jump on that song, and I am someone who hates Drake.
But no one is saying worship this and Jericho that!
Cause they love this dude, you got ppl in here that claim they don’t even like him but yet are in every post about him and listening to a damn sexxxy red song just to hear him
They all mad at the boy too, it’s pretty funny.
Gotta farm the karma while its ez
Whom's crying?
I think Drake ain't aging well and he knows it. People still love Chuck D, Ice Cube, and Snoop because those guys found a way to reinvent themselves as elder statesmen. Drake isn't finding a way to do that, and trying to follow the new breed, and it's making him look foolish.
biggest rap artist of this generation was part of one of the biggest rap beefs of all time and you ask why people are discussing him in rap subs. think it through
It's what the culture is feeling.
1. Because I hate drake

2. Because many people also hate Drake 

3. Because he got his ass whopped on a rap beef just this month, a few weeks ago. 

4. Because he's supposedly "at the top of the game"

Pick and choose the ones you want.
Unsurprisingly it's what my 12 year old niece and nephew talk about, too
OPs post history tells you everything you need to know. Some people just let people they don’t even know control their lives
Fr obsession
They literally cannot get off this mans dick for some reason
This is like seeing a fucking sasquatch. 

Y'all exist? People who say this song is good?

You don't mean the entire song right? Please tell me you're talking about Drake's verse.
>Yall are insufferable

Thank you. 

>And yes drake has the best bbl drizzy verse

No he doesn't.
Wait, we can only talk about Drake in Kendrick Lamar sub?

I thought we could talk about rappers in r/rap. Oh, wait... 

I get it.
If you point out that r/muisic and this sub and a few other music subs are just fierce Kendrick glazers they will claim you're lying. I have to go to drizzy subreddit to see drake glazing but all I got to do is use the reddit app scrolling popular or all to see kendrick glazing. Really feels like so many music related subs are devolving into the "i hate drake" sub but you aren't allowed to point that out without them desperately denying it and down votting you. but anybody with eyes can see it.
>Everybody is congratulating him because it was a good verse on the beat.

>what else do you do in the situation? 

Congratulating the dude because he tried is just sad.
Fr
Not rap about coercing girls for sex right after everyone talked about what a weirdo you are with girls?
Better verses that don't come off as corny
I don't know if expecting good bars, good content, good flows etc... from someone termed "greatest" is that bad. 

If you can't win a verse battle against all these amateurs, can you even call yourself a rapper, let alone greatest?
Exactly. 

The war is over. Dude should go and get some rest but is being an idiot and shooting himself in the foot. 

Like jfc who in their right mind would jump on that track? It's a fucking chore to sit through the first few seconds of the track, let alone get to Drake's verse. I feel bad for him for having to do this and I fucking hate him.
Drake is a mistake. Lol.
Shit prolly come out with painted nails. It would be weird.
Fr
>Lmao the Kendrick glazing has to stop

Post: *Doesn't mention Kendrick Lamar*

OP: WHY ARE YOU GLAZING KENDRICK LAMAR?
Nah it's actually wop wop wop wop wop.
What even is this?

Yeah I'm talking about it as a mistake because I listened to it. That's how talking about shit works you moron.
Your bar for obsession is very low sister.
If someone gets naked in the middle of the streets and starts eating shit, people would be talking about them.  

That's not glazing the shit eater. That's just saying the dude is eating shit.
You're telling on yourself if those are weak and Drake's verse is stronk.
>I can start taking them seriously when they make it big.

Fame over skill is a valid argument, I'm not gonna throw shade at that. Not everyone is a scout looking everywhere for the next big thing, people have a life and you can't waste that listening to anyone who ever decided to rhyme. 

But this is basically a free for all thrown out by Metro. It is an actual competition he put out with a prize and all that. When someone as big as Drake hops in on the action, he's putting himself in a position where he's in a competition with the riff raff. 

Just imagine how easily Metro can now dunk on Drake if he wanted to. He could just publish a rank list, have Drake be ranked below all these no name artists, give out 10k and a beat and come out of the beef like a fucking g. Drake just set himself up for that. He doesn't even have to rank him all the way down, he could rank him objectively and still make it disrespectful because Drake made it that easy.
Was Degrassi Disney?
If funny people are trying to shed a light on drakes “content” being poor taste or him being a fake thug the last few weeks. I like rap but it is 95% about content that is deplorable and rappers always lie about how tough they are. 

I wish people just said they didn’t like drakes music instead of moralizing cause it’s hypocritical when they don’t apply it to every other rapper.
Garbage ass take that admittedly comes from complete ignorance. Do better

>Only move he should have done on that beat was another diss track that is actually good.

I still think he should not even acknowledge BBL Drizzy best because there's no way he can come out of that as a winner. 

He should've kept up the offenses and actually planned for something. But Heart Part 6 was just a big oof. Like, dude can't even drop another track without sounding like a sore loser.

His verse was decent. 

But like, it's very low as far as BBL Drizzy verses go. That's not what people should be expecting from a "great rapper".
I peeped some stuff in there like he doesn't care about Drake but he's a Metro fan and wants that beat, or how he threw away his Nocta and got his old school shoe back or something. 

It's the energy though. Dude be rapping.
Take a trip down to his sub. Or to all the comments on the song and its reactions.
It's called energy. Look it up.
THIIIIS  
  
BBL DRIZZY DOESNT EXIST TO ME ITS ONLY "uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuUUuuuuuu babaayyy"
it was pretty shit bro
>Gotta be able to laugh at yourself.

He's not though. He's just flipping it and calling himself BBL Drizzy because he pays for other women's bbls. 

Which is questionable on multiple levels.
Yeah. It's called being a hater. 

Try it, it's fun.
Metro gave the beat away for free, and Drizzy and Sexyy get paid off it. Currently at 4M+ streams. Hilarious.
Still doesn't top dissing your opponent for getting molested as a child after they called you a pedophile.
One one hand, Drake doesn't need marketing from a fucking reddit post. 

On the other, I do think he did it because no one in their right mind would listen after her first verse if it didn't have something in there after that. Hell, no one would've even sat through the first few seconds if it was not for the BBL Drizzy beat.
If you care so little that you need to make a comment about it, I'm not the one that needs to touch the grass.
Imagine making this comment lmao
Here we have people who care so little they have to say out loud how less they care.

Look yonder the sexyy armada is approaching fast
I would rather not
A fleet of Sexyreds is the funniest shit I heard today
Just curious, does anyone actually co-sign the “sexy” part or just her?

They real competition though, he might sign himself to pop ass with em
Careful, he’s in here lurking reading your comments

If more sexy reds popup it will be the end times.
Yes
Two bad bitches
Graffiti rules. If you can’t do better than what’s already there, don’t do it
But in this case the heart was a metaphor for Dave liking an IG post and the heart part series is the double entendre /s
The thing was Kendrick had already did it twice with Euphoria and 6.16 in LA so Drake comes off as a lame copycat. Also a heart has 5 chambers.
[removed]
🤡🤡🤡🤡
That’s certainly a take. What will he do to get past the pedo allegations, a kidz bop video?
BBL Drizzy came from METRO nothing to do with Kendrick. You forgetting the MF was beefing with like 5 different people at once Kendrick was just the most prominent.
Bro is that a pregnant dude emoji?
💀💀💀💀
Why does someone taking an L in rap beef mean you can just start making shit up and get upvoted for it. This sub once again highlighting out fake it is compared to the real world
nah I personally have always maintained that drake was a hack
There’s a myriad of reasons to hate on drake.
his flows and cadences are nearly identical throughout his catalogue; lyrically he lacks substance. Sore he knows how to make Top 40 records but that’s as diverse as he gets
So what if he samples a subculture's beat for his new monthly ethnicity cosplay? 

Copying accents and AI voice cloning- there's no depth to that shit.
I love that line. LOVE IT. Pops into my head randomly all the time. 
"Like that" opens with a verse about sticking a finger down a woman's throat and having a diamond become dislodged and choking her, which she proceeds to overcome and swallow because she's a "goat". 
Lol 20 popular rappers a day will talk about buying a girl something for sex. People just roasting drake right now not the industry
Bruhhhh not the ick.
[removed]
So because he has lots of money and fame he must then only have sex with people who are famous as well because he is now pressuring then solely based on the fact that he has said money and fame? Thats insane. There’s a lot of shit to talk about Drake but saying that the mere reality of his fame and net worth makes any sex he has with normies pressured is a wild take.
Its a rep.
I think he said tht to sexy
Why? Because he had a fan base that consisted mostly of basic white women? Sure
She's always done music that's more for entertainment than actual music, if that makes any kind of sense. Like the earliest I heard her was ages ago when she did that thousand miles parody song driving through the hood. There's people in the industry that are just there because sex sells, and they don't need to be good at music, just look good and shake ass.
It's Drake, corniness is on brand lool
I'm from Canada, he IS an embarrassment
“Damn, shitting on Drake is popular. I better hop on that BBL beat” - Drake
African Americans, the culture he emulates but doesn't understand deeper than surface
Exactly. That shit has nothing to do with black culture
He's not AA and while he has a better understanding of the hip hop the industry his moves and bars show there is a lot missing (i.e. telling the descendents of enslaved that an artist raps like he's trying to free the slaves is a wild statement).
That's silly,  people liked push ups and Drake was up when he dropped family matters. The issue was shit he said was tone deaf, like saying that an artist in America is trying to free the slaves as a diss. Most of the popular AA artist (except Drake) have literally used their platform or money to do exactly that. Many things he said and did seemed to lack true AA awareness
Obsessed with the boy
>Whom's

💀
Drake haters cry nonstop
Good take. It’s like middle aged people trying to dress like 20 year olds rather than owning their age tastefully. Kendrick has done this album over album.
This is a good point. It’s because he hasn’t grown and mature naturally, which is something we all must do at some point, or get left behind.
Thought he was a pop star?
Reddit is not the culture lmfao
Holy shit. How do you go through life without constantly hearing Drake. Bars? Clubs? Parties? Peoples cars?

Drake has no idea who you are yet you spend all this time and effort on constantly posting about him and commenting on him. What's the goal? You go to sleep at night and "I got em!". What is the point of this to just post in a place to get confirmation from other people that agree with you?
If you hate drake dont listen to him. I hate Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert, Migos, Lil Baby and many other rappers and I just ignore them when they drop new music. This hate is more than just hate its obsession.
I think you secretly love drake. 
Hate drake so much this man lives in your brain lmao. Obsessing over a billionaire you doing life right bro
Yikes brother
1. Why do you hate drake? I’m genuinely curious. 
2. Do they hate him? Orrrr do they wish they were as successful ?
3. This sounds like a high-school level thought. 
4. Ah Ok. You answered it. It’s jealousy.

Funny how he’s not a rapper until yall wanna circlejerk and hate him. During the whole beef y’all were calling him a pop star and not a rapper lol.

lol what? please explain
Lmao so y’all can say he didn’t fucking write them? You all are insufferable.

It’s not a verse battle tho bro. Drake isn’t automatically in a beef with everyone now just because of the kdot beef

if you don’t like it that’s cool but making a whole post over a nothing ass track/verse to say he lost against no name rappers is just hating lol
No it doesnt matter you know. Drake Fans will love him anyway and think its funny and the rest will hate him and find it cringe or corny like they did before. Nothing has changed for Drake. And I think in the long run the whole beef wont effect his career at all and if than in a positive say because in a few years from now everybody will say this was the best beef ever.
Who cares? Drake's having fun with it. No need to get your panties in a bunch and foam at the mouth on Reddit. No one's forcing you to listen to it.
Where did I say you were glazing Kendrick, I was responding to the comments in this thread.
And you still don’t get it but I’m the moron…
it’s a silly tongue n cheek verse on a silly song for sexy redd’s mixtape. it’s not supposed to be fuckin poetry.
Ummm not sure how Drake is eating shit. Seems like his career is still moving into the same direction. Yall on the internet think otherwise and that’s ok tho. Still glazing
😐
Anyone with common sense knows drake wasnt trying to compete for the rewards come on lol be for real. 

Metro ranking drake anything above the last one the list will be a complement, and anything above bottom of the list will be a W for drake
Is there any more street cred on Noggin?
It’s true.

When young rappers go through that stage it’s more relatable, when they become as old as your dad and still rapping about the same tits and clubs it’s weird.
[removed]
Lol if energy beats lyrics for you then that’s good for you. You just sound like a bitter angsty teen.
Get a life dude, you putting way too much energy into this.
Hmmm, I’m confused then. I’ll try going outside

You lot are strange.

Happy cake day
🤣
You can smell em coming from a mile a way
Lmmfaooooo that shit is horrid! 
I mean, I do.
Good. He should Pay me.  

There's still time to turn this whole thing around.  Drake spent the last decade pretending to be a gangster. Now he needs to pivot into pretending to be a pimp.
Sounds like a sick party tbh
That’s real competition, he might pop ass with her
The fact it was on her song makes the shit so much worse. 🤦🏾‍♂️
But you know, hating ass toys still scrawl it up.

Have you seen Degrassi?
Ok sir Just because you say "his flow and cadences are nearly identical" doesn’t make it accurate. If you knew what you were talking about, you’d know that’s only one part of being a good artist or rapper.
Negative. If you listen to his verses on songs like Lord Knows, No Tellin, War, Live From The Gutter, Money In The Grave & even First Person shooter all those flows & cadences aren’t identical at all. And all those verses span over a decade.
Copying accents and paying homage to different things. Idk why yall think this man is white! The internet really got yall head messed up. That brother is a black cultured man. Yall gotta grow up. 

The AI was a voice changer that’s it nerd. He wrote and rapped the verses himself.
Ok keep going. Whats the point you trynna make
Right? Rappers talking all day about women only noticing and sleeping with them because of the fame, money and material, but now Drake’s in the wrong for it? Okay.
Yea this Reddit take is wild lol people really come on here and forget their comments still have to jive with the real world
Isn't this whataboutism?
I feel you its facts. My point was tht the bars dont land as drake would think because of the drama with the beef. And he being bbl drizzy.
Fellas, is it gay to *checks notes* use words?
I’m black from the west side of chicago. All my guys here listen to Drake so you can say that all you want but it’s simply not the truth
Kendrick has a whiter fan base if you really care
Yea, but I see random more attractive women than red just walking a block or two in town..
Yeh that makes perfect sense, very true
[deleted]
Yes I would also be embarrassed to be the second most streamed artist in the world who is swimming in money
I would love to hear you expand on that point
Dam yall are ignorant asl
The dude is Canadian we don’t expect him to understand us idk where yall got that from, and he definitely is deep in hip hop culture.
Drake is probably the descendent of a slave as well. 

I just don’t see how Drake not dropping the next day is an indication that he lacks cultural awareness. What’s cultural about that?
I’m a white girl and even I see that right away. when I heard that line about rapping like he’s tryna free the slaves I literally gasped. I always felt he was a phony culture vulture and that one line says it all. I know people who are “not racist and don’t see color”. Drakes line gives that energy. Tone deaf and not really about it.
That is a fact.
If making one post and engaging with a few people who replied to the post like a decent person is your metric for "obsession", you must have zero tolerance for this shit. 

Someone could ask you "how you doing" and you'd spit at their face for being clingy I suppose.
[deleted]
I already said what I learned. You not getting it is my point.
Oh no, that was accidental. 

This is me being intentionally obtuse.
Right before that song came out there was this big beef with this other rapper, Kendrick Lamar, who’s main angle on drake was what a weirdo he is with girls. So immediately rapping about being a weirdo with girls after that wasn’t a great look

>It’s not a verse battle tho bro

It is literally a competition bruh. With prize and all. 

Like, do you not know what BBL Drizzy beat is?
>Drake Fans will love him anyway and think its funny and the rest will hate him and find it cringe or corny like they did before.

That is a fair assessment. 

>And I think in the long run the whole beef wont effect his career at all

This is not. This beef just opened up Drake to have an instant loss whenever the next guy disses him. There's just too much shit out there. Losing one rap beef gives ammo to the next guy. Losing the next one gives even more ammo to the guy coming after. And Drake being Drake, will inevitably sneak diss someone else and get his ass handed to him like this after mentioning their wife or gf. 

Also, the loss of credibility each loss gives him is also pretty huge. You can see his own fanbase cracking at the seams if you go through their sub. Just look at the comments for the post about Ak and Boi1da hinting at Drake dropping something. People are just tired and want him to take some time off, in his own sub. 

Plus, if any allegations that Kendrick threw at him materializes into anything, which is reaffirmed by his defenses in Heart part 6, it would simply be over.
Yeah. You are.
Didn't say it was bad. 

I said it was a mistake.
I should've learned by now that Drake fans don't understand metaphors. 

Drax ass mfers.
Well kinda.. they had Jay and Silent Bob, teen pregnancy, gonorrhea of the throat, a school sh**ting, a stabbing, abortion, drug use. I'd say at the very least, slightly more street cred lol.

Drizzly is very much a prolific toy. Mans is up, but there isn’t any heart or pride behind his work.
And they do their own selves in by populating the scene with their toy shit; ie Drake right now
It put a smile on my face, thanks
no
A single lyrical style drizzled on a beat selected for him with words given to him isn’t artistry or rap. It’s employment at a music factory. Drake brings nothing of substance to the craft, acting as a mouthpiece for a soulless music machine that uses a team of actual creatives to optimize beat and lyricism for maximum playability.

Drake is Kohl’s Rap.
Hard no to the first point. 100% wrong, not even worth debating. I'm gonna let that shit pile sizzle on the sidewalk for someone else to pick up.

To your second point: ghostwriters 👻 plus he should have had the sense to realize how tacky & tasteless an AI voice clone is, especially of a universally loved DEAD artist.

I think your rebuttal will involve some personal shit about me, after you spend all morning combing through my profile. No doubt you'll mention I'm white :P go on prove me wrong.
bro spent his “Summer vacation” in memphis being here for 2 months out the year does not make you cultured
Do you not see the hypocrisy haha? Kendrick is the better rapper (and artist imo) and he won let’s be honest. 

But if you come at someone from the “mistreating women” angle, then maybe don’t have lyrics like that?
You overestimate how many people have “standards” 

IMO, she looks like a stereotypical hood rat and is not good looking at all but I think that’s what she’s going for because a lot of guys don't care about that and a lot even go for the hood rat look.
Because ratchet shit hits in the club, but not in this sub.

Imo understanding the culture and the ups and downs. While you might discuss negative aspects that growing up a minority in a racially/socially segregated country might present, their tends to be a duality for those who actually experience these things. Like Scarface might talk about selling drugs and the highs but he definitely always has a "minds playing tricks on me" type of song that brings reality into the equation. Since Drake went to the gangsta shit, he only talks about the positives of the negative aspects but no duality or equality in perspective. 

Also the term hip hop is derived from slang.  HIP meaning down with what's popping and hop meaning knowledge of the reality of your situation as a community. Infact in most AA genres we tend to have heavy activism in some way or form from the top.  Drake is there to say Free Larry Holmes (because it gives street cred and yea asked) but never mentioned a single sentence about prison reforms or the wars on drugs. Even Meek became an activist for prison reform but Drake just makes music that glorifies a liestyle that gets people locked...shit even NWA made a song about police brutality...shit even Kodak was on a song about Trump. Drake dips into AA culture when we are happy but goes elsewhere when we are struggling imo. And yea I know he's Canadian so he has options but the PM of Canada is always talking about USA business. Various Canadians in the US have stood for and behind something. Even Diddy told people to register to vote lol
This point was a big part of the whole beef…
Explain?
K-os and Cardinal Official do a good job with being authentic. Slick Rick is from the UK, Shyne from Belize. Hip hop is about awareness and being authentic, if you're gonna tap into the American vibe you gotta really research or be of it.
1. That just makes it worse that he would see that as a diss. Plus while that links him to black culture its not a true link to AA culture. His dad gives him that throught blood but how much during his formative years did he learn from his pops? How much did he learn from westernized surface media outlet vs homegrown?

2. Hip hop culture. He let Not Like Us become a cultural rallying call and tried to drop when the culture was kinda moving on, so he rehashed BBL drizzy. If he atleast stepped on BBL drizzy as a trending topic early, he could have deflated some of that Kendrick energy earlier imo because his fans would have had a track that could possibly match as far as playability. He could have deflated Metro as well
Sure dawg keep thriving give me another big reply

>You spend your time hating on a person under the guise of discourse. I've read three comments from you in this thread alone stating, "I hate Drake.".

I say I hate Drake, because I do hate Drake. I've also engaged in discourse when people are actually talking. You should know that since you spend enough time on my comment history. I'm not mixing both and I'd like to think I'm being pretty objective when I'm actually having a discourse. I haven't mentioned my hatred for Drake in the post because that's not the point there. The point there is what I consider to be a misstep from the guy who's been on a series of missteps for the last few weeks. My suggestion, which I'd think you'd already know if you did read the comments, was for Drake to just take a vacation and come back with a clear head. That's not the hater in me talking. The hater in me wants Drake to just retire and fade off. But I know when to rein that in and talk sense. 

This is me having discourse btw. I'm spending this time because you seem to have spent some time in this comment and I respect the effort no matter the content or intent.
Nah you said you learned "everything there is to know about" and then said some bullshit that's just plain wrong, because I don't let a person control anything, I'm letting the algorithm do that. 

But I do want to see what else you inferred. Let's see if you got anything right.
[removed]
How did Drake rap about "coercing girls for sex" or "being a weirdo with girls" on the song with sexy red? That's what I'm asking about...
Of course it’s a competition for everyone else but I thought you would read between the lines- clearly Drake isn’t trying to win that wtf? This is what I mean by yall getting boring af with these posts. 

Do you seriously mean you’re sitting there thinking Drake is pushing his best bars out to be the BBL Drizzy champion? You cannot be serious bro surely you ain’t that slow
After that beef I am absolutly sure nobody and no beef can „end“ Drake. Except it comes to light that hes like the second Diddy or something but even than… look at all the stuff Kanye did. 
I have to admit I am for sure Team Drake and I loved the beef while it lasted and now I am enjoying the music again. From both of them. 
Somehow the whole thing only effected my view on WATTBA and my feelings towards Future. I am the most disapointed in him. The Rest was like Wrestling for me - just entertainment. But it went a bit too dark towards the end…
you’re calling it a mistake bcuz u’re comparing his verse about bbls to rappers who have to rap like the rent’s due bcuz it is
Nah just a terrible  metaphor
And that’s where that train of thought should end. We’re discussing how rough *the life he played on TV was*. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: **Drake is as much the GOAT as Hannah Montana.**
dot fuck em up.
Drake would be some corny ass street artist going around capping pieces with wheat pastes that his homies make.
Lyrically style drizzle? Good day sir
Ima tell you the god awful truth big dawg. 

Doesn’t matter what you, me, this Reddit page or anyone else on the internet thinks. Bro is going down as one of the goats. He already is. Yall can keep tryna change it but it’s just showing yall mad about it.
[removed]
Are you comparing a weird verse in a song to drake allegedly actively impacting the lives of real, tangible women? I don’t really get what you’re trying to say. Kendrick didn’t shit on drake for being misogynistic in his songs, he called him a fucking sex criminal. 
Lamar has 2 good albums let’s be real. fans of music have made it clear they have extreme respect for Drake by making him the second most streamed artist in the world. Also that line is corny coming from him and ultra cringe non ironically being used in a reddit comment
This is beautiful my brother. Tell them.
Exactly this. Drake has been larping the african American lifestyle for too long. 

Choosing an aesthetic that comes from underprivileged people’s lack of choice is disrespectful and like Kendrick said just plain “cringeworthy”
We don’t expect this from any of the other immigrant rappers so why try and pin it to Drake ?
[removed]
>His dad gives him that throught blood but how much during his formative years did he learn from his pops? How much did he learn from westernized surface media outlet vs homegrown?

Neither one of us know the answer to that question. Growing up going somewhere every summer for your whole childhood will absolutely leave a lasting cultural impact on your life

>If he atleast stepped on BBL drizzy as a trending topic early, he could have deflated some of that Kendrick energy earlier imo because his fans would have had a track that could possibly match as far as playability. He could have deflated Metro as well

I feel like after not like us, Drake was just morally defeated by Kendrick’s low blow. In THP6 he cleared sounded like he was not tryna continue a rap beef with a man who has the whole world singing a song about you touching little kids. Kendrick went lower then low and Drake bowed out on THP6. I think drake is probably moving on from this beef and is gonna focus on music again

Don’t even need to go into the comment history, your post history says enough. Your discourse isn’t objective if you are going to make a post every second day shitting on one side. You hate drake and that’s fine but the other commenter is correct in saying you are hiding behind a guise.

Wow, insulting people for enjoying Anime?

What is this? 2015? I mean, might as well be for your boomer ass.
"Why you love me? Still a mystery, me and the surgeon got history  
I changed a lot of girls' lives for real, they need a new body, they hittin' me, ayy  
BBL Drizzy, they want a new body, they ask me for it  
The last one, Jung, he did it for free 'cause I sent over so many past ones for him"
>Drake isn’t trying to win that

Doesn't matter. 

He's putting himself in a place where people can objectively compare him against soundcloud and tiktok rappers. No matter his intent, that's happening with this. 

Which is why I said doing this is a mistake. Not that it was a bad verse. He's inviting that comparison whether he likes it or not.
I'm calling it a mistake because now Metro could dunk on his ass by giving the best to someone else.  

And it's not like Drake is a sensitive guy who would be affected by shit like that right?
At least you know it's a metaphor now. Thank God.
WOP WOP WOP WOP WOP WOP
Singing someone else’s songs on someone else’s backing track is called Karaoke. Drake doesn’t even make the mark as a cover band.

Singing someone else’s songs on someone else’s backing track while wearing a costume is usually just less serious karaoke (unless you are Drake).

Yea true idk the answer i was more looking at how he moves. It just seemed very unaware, like dropping the heart part 6 and thr things said on it. It just seemed like a person who didnt have an ear to the people who make up the first audience you have to flip. 

Imo he has too because there is no way for him to win with the allegations made and most are either known or incredible hard to disprove. Best he can do is wife up a 30+ queen and start doing more mature music imo.
First of all, I'm not hiding. I'm repeatedly saying I hate Drake. Like, that's already established here. 

What I'm saying is I'm not being a hater when I'm actually discussing. Since you didn't even get that, I don't think there's any point in conversing.
You said Drake's pen should be respected. 

I rest my case.

No we all enjoy anime. Hes insulting you for other reasons.
…So yes you are sitting there thinking he’s trying to win the bbl Drizzy contest

It’s not that serious bro hate it or love it it’s just him capitalising on a cheap gotcha moment knowing cornballs will run and post about it online
It's based off Paul Mooney i believe
[removed]
When do we ask a fat Joe or a Sean Paul for activism raps ? Dj kaled is not asked to champion the Palestine cause. We let rappers skate with even acknowledging racism is an issue (ASAP rocky). Where is Cardi B activism raps. Drake has a few introspective songs. Drake often talks about the negativity of money and success as well as making more money than other rappers.
Him being a pedophile is not incredibly hard to disprove. Kendrick has done nothing to justify calling Drake a pedophile
You’re biased is the point. You think you’re being objective when you are being subjective with a bias. That’s what they mean.
Must be the knees.
He called me an anime enjoyed like it's a bad thing, which is just plain offensive. You don't know how much anime fans had to endure to get here where it's okay to watch anime, just for some internet rando to use that as an insult. 

I would've reported his ass to reddit if he used the w word. But I think he is intelligent enough to not use that. I hope he is intelligent enough to not use that because if he does that, as God is my witness, I'll strike down upon him like the hammer of Thor! THE THUNDER OF MY VENGENCE WILL ECHO THROUGH THESE HALLS LIKE THE CRASHING OF A THOUSAND WINDS!!!

^(/s for all the dumb mfers)

Except those are all criticisms they have faced and Sean Paul the reggae artist? ASAP didn't skate and Cardi B is very active on social issues outside of rap...idk ngl seems like you don't follow rap discourse and conversations regarding rappers politically and socially. Like Khaled has been called out since the first Gaza hospital bomb about his lack of public support for Palestine. It's not even hard to search that one. ASAP was destroyed when he made an offhand remark about Ferguson only to get profiled and locked up in Europe. These were all big moments in rap discourse.
It is because,  what can he do? Show us his porn collection? Give us access to every text between him and Millie? And idk as far as Kendrick, but what does he have to justify?
I mean...no, Drake is a pedophile.

He's mad it clear, repeatedly, that he's attracted to underage girls. That's a pedophile. You don't have to molest someone to be a pedophile
Everybody is biased. Doesn't mean discourse is impossible. 

This is not jury duty for everyone to be impartial.
For you obviously
We are talking about lyrical. We are talking about it in the music. They all have foundations and do drive etc about issues. You said Drake don’t speak on it in his music. Where do any of the other artists do that ? ASAP said he in Beverly Hills and that race stuff ain’t his issue. Him getting hemmed up has nothing to do with activism. He was a victim of his own stupidity. You moving the goal posts. I follow rap closely and extensively.
But that’s the thing, if you’re going to accuse somebody of being a pedo, it has to be backed up with credible accusations. Kendrick just dropping that on that man was absurdly cruel. Unjustifiable imo

If somebody were to have the world singing a song about me or my family member being a pedo, they need to put that shit on wax.
>Drake isn’t trying to win that

Least genocidal balkan chant
Didn’t have this level of hatred in Qatar, football is so back
Nothing unites people like dreaming of genocide or something like that
games back.
2balkan4u
Least controversial balkan chanting
You had me in the first half
And the biggest fine goes to..
Time to send out Ingerland onto the battlefields lads
Worst part about this is our fans will retaliate tomorrow and probably say some heinous shit as well. The cycle continues.
Time to fine Everton again
Mexico gets punished for puto lol
Velika sramota za Hrvatsku, a ništa drugo nije ni za očekivati, gore su gastarbajteri, veliki Hrvati
*an entire stadium chanting about killing* *serbs* r/soccer : 😂

*Mexicans chanting "PUTO"*  r/soccer : 😡
bokte jebo mi smo sami sebi najgori
Shit like this is brushed over, but Mexico saying Puto gets the game stopped and Mexico playing in empty stadiums lol
They can sing about genocide but with puto is where the Fifa draw a line
I hope that one day the dynamic between Balkan countries becomes like that of Denmark and Sweden, or Germany and France. Also hate how westerners cheer it on like they're watching animals fighting in a cage
When Mexico does the chant they stop the match... wheres the equality?
apparently to most redditors, mexicans chanting puto is worse than fans singing about murdering entire groups of people
*reddit: shrugs shoulders, jokes about the balkans* 

*other way around happens* 

*reddit: omg* 😱
always nice to see progressive, righteous and morally exalted people of this sub show their true face by cheering at right wing fascistoid fuckery like this and then losing their shit when someone goes to play in saudi arabia or refuses to wear an lgbt armband (which i don't support either)

yet again, our pack of morons is also probably going to be chanting some vile shit tomorrow, because god forbid we don't even out the score when it comes to being an imbecile

looking forward to seeing that comment section
Euros when there's chants calling for genocide: "hehe funny balkans!" 

Euros when there's chants calling the keeper a bitch: "Latin Americans are a backwards species that need to be tamed"
But when Mexico says Puto, FIFA stops the game entirely lmao
So everyone is fine with two groups of people singing *Hang Serbs on a willows*?

That's the worst act of racism we've seen during this tournament so far.
Also, many Croatian flags on the stands were starting with white field in the top left corner which was the flag of Indepentent State of Croatia (puppet fascist state of Nazi Germany), and some black flags with "Za dom spremni" slogan which was the slogan of that state.
Croatians and Albanians chanting about killing Serbs: I sleep

Bentancur slipping an inside joke: Real shit
But FIFA says no to Mexico’s Puto chant, what a joke hahah
Hate speech if ever I heard it.
Yeah but it’s not as bad as the Ten German Bomber song according to Reddit
Now imagine comments if roles were reversed
Pretty pathetic comments as per usual by non-serbian westerners. «Banger» «balkan stuff» «games back» etc while everyone knows if it was the other way around people would be losing their minds. In a game that has nothing to do with Serbia too. Rent free. 
Absolutely fucking disgusting 

Anyone promoting Ustaše ideology should be immediately prosecuted
Comment section turning into r/soccercirclejerk
say "puto" and watch what happens
Here before lock lol
Embarrassing but not surprising. This is genuinely why I (a person who was born and grew up in Croatia, but with many Serbian ancestors and family members) never really support Croatia as fiercely as most other people here.
Glad to see that our rampant nationalism which pretty much damned us all to a bleak future all the way back in the 90s is entertaining for our enlightened European kin. After all, nothing quite screams banter like a call to genocide.
What nice people.
This is sick both should be punished
[deleted]
But puto is too much for fifa. lol fuck off
This makes me hate fifa so fucking much 🤣
I saw a FCK SBR sign at the match and was wondering if this meant what I thought it did?
I want a World Cup of teams that despise eachother. A group with Serbia, Bosnia, Albania, and Kosovo. A group of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland. A group with North Korea, South Korea, China, and India
Serbian fa will get a hefty fine when they bring this up to uefa
No punishment? Nothing?
[deleted]
Typical Ustaše, nonstory
Meanwhile fifa loses their mind when Mexico fans scream “Fucker/Bastard”
To be true… I kinda lost faith in mankind. We are lemmings heading for the cliff…
But a Mexican fan says “puto” and the game has to be stopped. Double standards much
I hope Mexicans never stop their puto chant
Puto
The only thing the Croatians are killing is the euro viewership.
Is there a chance either of these team could play Serbia if they all make it through? Fucking nightmare security situation 
I don't get it, these countries would have a better shot at a championship if they all united. Are they stupid? Yunitedslavia would sound great 👍
That doesn't sound very nice.
"Croatian and Albanian fans sing in unison..."
Awww, the Euros are really nice!
"... about killing Serbs."
Oh....
but somehow puto is worse.
The beautiful game bringing people together 😍
Balkan moment
Pretty trashy, toxic, and racist tbh.
Dirty dirty people

UEFA when vinicius complains 😡

UEFA when 2 a whole stadium calls for genocide: 🥰🥰
Balkans clearly is the most entertaining part of the world
Albanians hating Serbs so much, they've started speaking their language. Well done lads, maybe next time you can bring some banner written in cyrillic, just to show how big of a patriots you all are, that'll show them.
it is truly disgusting to see how people from Europe on this thread react to this.
Then go cry behind NATO when shit lights up
Fuck the euros just get the balkans, the Caucasus, turkey and Cyprus in a tournament and watch the chaos unfold
This is just a Balkan banter
Ubi ubi chants are very common and happen during every derby in balkans
Love when opposing fans leave the hatred aside and chant together. Truly makes you love the sport even more.

Heartwarming: Balkans sing the same song about ethnic cleansing!
Albanians chant in Serbian? How so?
Wholesome Balkan friendship..?
Albanian and Croatians: What?? No we love Serbians this is just a misunderstanding, we just don’t agree that they are consider equal to us as humans beings, I mean they are Serbians, this is a cultural thing.
Reddit when Serbians breathe: GENOCIDAL NATION, THEY SHOULD ALL BE IN PRISON 😡

Disgusting
Divided by race, united by racism. Balkans ❤️
They should both be sanctioned asap. Fuck these fascist pieces of shit.
On a post where Serbians were chating for Putin, EVERY SINGLE COMMENT was about the enormous amount of hate being cultivated againts Serbs by a person from basically every single European nation, but when something like this happens, no one says a goddamn thing. I am saying this for every Brit, French, German, Belgian , Norwegian first and foremost and every other westerner who said something about Serbia and Serbians in the last post but says nothing about this absolute scandal: F U C K  Y O U. fucking hypocrites.
No words for croat.. ustašama jebenim and alban..šiptpederima.

The world game 😍
Rest of Europe wishes they had this level of hatred in footy
Figured this was bound to happen as soon as I saw the group pairings. Just need Kosovo to somehow make it next Euro
Okay I take it back lads - I thought the game had gone soft, but it sure is back after that now!
Well since they clearly get along so well why don't albanians move to croatia instead of serbia
Who among you can explain the complex relationships between these countries? But in simple terms for me (an idiot).
Disgusting fools
Racist ignorant barbaric Europeans
People were calling Turks barbar because of whistling opponents national anthem,but i don't think Turkish fans would ever chant something like "Kill,kill,kill Greeks!".Which is probably worse than whistling a national anthem.
Meanwhile while Mexico gets shit for chanting a word that is only homophobic for Americans.
And us mexican fans get more shit for us saying “PUUUUUTOOOOOOO”????
Serbia is about to knock out both of them…..in this tournament
Hmm, that probably counts as hate speech (volksverhetzung), so if the fans singing can be identified they could be in massive trouble.
European civilization, lol
Well, of course shqiptars know serbian fluently when half of them are living there still
Yugoslav Wars never ended
🤦
god forbid fans yelling “puto” tho
Balkanazis
Sports bring people together!
Reddit isn’t a place for equal opinions and discussion I got banned from the Eurovision thread and from the Reddit for one week by something taken out of context by a mod. 

Things like this promote genocide yet when we try to defend it we get silenced not only on this Reddit others.
Maybe the real treasure was not the genocide, but the friends we made along the way
Games not dead
UEFA sure is eating good anytime a Balkan team is involved.
they're gonna have to sell their car
I mean these fines are a slap on the wrist at best. If they wanna solve these kinda problems they need to increase the fines so all these Balkan FAs might actually be bothered to at least attempt to solve these problems.

Nah bro they only punish Serbia FA
Germany is full of Mercedes.

They will find a way
Pretty true tbh. Football is an outlet that people seem to need in the absence of war. 
George Orwell has an essay called The Sporting Spirit. “sport is an unfailing cause of ill-will, and that if such a visit as this had any effect at all on Anglo-Soviet relations, it could only be to make them slightly worse than before.”

https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-sporting-spirit/

Edit: “Even if one didn’t know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred, one could deduce it from general principles.”
true
This is epic and so true

Germany has a tonne of Croatian immigrants and refugees from the 90s which are even more extreme in their political views than actual Croats so this isnt much of a surprise.
That's why Mbappe said Euros is better than the world cup.

Certainly puts all the bed wetting over England songs into some perspective doesn’t it
Diaspora gona diaspora, so proud of their country to chant about killing their neighbours who lives nextdoor to them in their Berlin apartment. 

jebo im svi pas mater i njihovo nacionalizam.
Im pretty sure most of those that chant here and those that will probably chant tomorrow dont even live in our respective countries, they r so patriotic that they left to shove shit with a shovel somewhere else.
Unfortunately true
What has really annoyed is the reaction on this sub. 

They posted a video of some Serbs shouting putin and everyone went insane. 

Here we have chants about killing and the entire thread is just meme. 

Bipolarism doesn't even adequately describe this sub.
At least your chants are more witty, this one was a pretty lazy copy of yours.
I fucking love this sub
Major points deduction
Ten point deduction because an Albanian fan was seen earlier this year at the Goodison.
It's strange.

"Puto" is always used as an insult but can have many meanings, and the most common use translates to "bitch", whereas "die" unambiguously only has one meaning.
Seriously, all this Euro posts with tremendous levels of violence and they say we're the savages...
You see the difference is we are brown and they are white
Sounds delicious if you're Filipino.

Svi smo mi ista govna, kada se vrate gastrabajteri kuci pa  ce da pricaju kako su "branili" svoju zemlju na evropskom
Should have happened here too tbh
tbf it's been several centuries since the Danes tried to kill any Swedes, but it's been just 30 years since the Serbs carried out an attempted genocide of Bosniaks.
Is there something I can read to learn more about the history of the Balkan countries?  A particular event, maybe?
Its honestly disgusting.
Romanian here. Bro, football fans are not representative of people's beliefs. 2 reasons:

1. On a football stadium, there's the "herd effect". You would often find yourself chant stuff you don't believe in just because everyone does it. (I know, stupid, but that's the human psychology)
2. Hardcore football fans usually have extreme political beliefs (usually because they are dumb). You can see this all over Europe

Don't believe that the average Croatian would enjoy "killing Serbs" because that's just stupid. Most people are chill
It won't. It helps that every side is clearly divided by religion. The divide is only getting stronger and stronger, and neither side is close to willing to accept their sins. All sides committed some awful crimes during the 90s, and all of them are doubling down on their revision of history.
So you saying that if I am going to Croatia for holiday I shouldn't wear my Jokič basketball shirt on?
There is a few hundred years of distance between the Swedish and Danish wars, so that helps. People still have living memories of the Balkan wars.
>Also hate how westerners cheer it on like they're watching animals fighting in a cage

That's not it, it's more the shock of how bold it is. I've been to plenty of sporting events in the U.S., and not once have the crowd, in *unison* chanted about murdering a group of people.
It's a clear case of anti Latin-American prejudice.
I was gonna write because no one in charge has a clue what they are chanting, then I remembered the UEFA president is literally  a Slovene. But maybe that's also your answer why he doesn't care.
Europeans hate racism and xenophobia unless it's their racism and xenophobia.
The average r/soccer nearly dies any times Vinicius Jr is at a campo, sometimes even when he isnt just the idea of him. Gives you an idea of why they let this one pass with a laugh, right
There’s specific groups of people they really care about. So many other things don’t get a word from them.
Hate it when the Balkans joke about reddit
I’m honestly really surprised by the reactions to this. A few days ago there was a post about a Croatian footballer who made anti-black and anti-immigrant comments and people in the thread were defending him and promoting great replacement theory. Like England or France footballers/fans could never say something like this and have it tolerated.
Lol more outrage over washed Jordan Henderson going to Saudi Arabia than this. Really perfectly encapsulates their morals
its funny the contrast between the debate on the mbappe post about politics and this one lmao... truly a reddit moment
I sincerely hope that most of the people upvoting this post do it to express outrage and bring attention to this shit, and not because they support it or find it amusing.
> always nice to see progressive, righteous and morally exalted people of this sub show their true face by cheering at right wing fascistoid fuckery like this

Most of them don't even know they are fascists and Nazis, they have no experience with these people and their beliefs but many have encountered homophobes.

Don't get me wrong they should know better but they don't and that is why there is the disconnect.
I don't think Serbia has any negative feelings with Slovenia, unless you think they will use that game to chant anti-Croatia and anti-Albanian chants?
we r just a bunch of circus monkeys to w*stoids lol
It's like river Seine contaminated with E.Coli for the Olympics? Oh, those Parisians, so funny.  Rio de Janeiro Olympic river contaminated with E. Coli? What could we expect from a disgusting third world country?
/thread
Gotta ~~love~~ hate FIFA
Hey its because they really care

  
just ignore the fact theyve chosen to host the world cup in Russia and qatar were the LGBT community have no rights and worse.
I'm 99.9% sure this is just because American stadiums/networks don't want them to chant it. I doubt fifa actually gives a shit
Apparently its just “balkan things” and the “game is back”.
Literal nazi support in front of our very eyes
Sadly, as someone who lives in the Balkans, I don't even bat an eye. This is genuenly every day behavior here. Especially if you are a minority like this, you need to get used to this asap, because you'll be dealing with it a lot. Me and my friends are now just laughing about the instances in the past when we were beaten because our nationality, because that is just a normal part of life here. This area is so fucked in so many ways, can't wait to get out of here.
Some people not being ashamed of being nazis to this day, subhuman scum
Za dom spremni has no place on a football pitch (or anywhere else). However, whether the red or the white field is first on our flag changed a lot through history. You are correct in thinking that a lot of people reference the fascist state when they wave a flag with white field first though. But it isn’t apriori unacceptable like ZDS is.
Well when they celebrate their victory Oluja most of the flags that people use that day are from NDH and Ustase regime, of course with casual listening of Thompson war songs who are usually celebrating Ustasche Regime.

One of the most popular Dinamo Zagreb songs celebrating Bruno Petkovic(player) has it's words and rhythm taken from one of the most gruesome Ustashe songs celebrating Holocaust...
eurotards at his finnest
It's not like FIFA is saying "yes" to this, tho...

Comment I've been waiting for. Thank you for noticing
If Serbians do something then it is disgusting Serbian stuff

now that Croats and Albanians call for murder it's "Balkans stuff".
Western europe hypocrisy.
It‘s honestly not really fun as someone with a Serbian mother. Yes, Serbs are also very often uber nationalist assholes who hold vile opinions but it‘s kinda disheartening to see people simply joke about shit like this as if it‘s just funny Balkan banter. Serbs often have a victim complex but in threads like these you see that it‘s sometimes absolutely warranted.


Just IMAGINE if it was Serbs chanting about killing Albanians. And honestly try to tell me that it‘s not hypocricy.
The average UK take on Serbia is deranged unfortunately. We were fed loads of propaganda to justify our attack on Yugoslavia in 1999 but most people know very little else about Balkan history so there are absolutely loads of people who think Serbs are all bloothirsty maniacs surrounded by poor innocent victims like Croatians and Albanians - no one really knows about the Ustaše so stuff like this gets laughed off as Balkan shenanigans.
Facts check
That comment coming from a Lazio fan it's just ironic.
It's idiocy no matter who chants it.
Hey u/gccmelb, what did you mean by your deleted comment?
Somewhat ironically most the Serbs, Roma and Bosnians who survived the Ustase genocide in Croatia were sheltered by the Fascists... The Italian Fascists controlled the coast, and let them into their territory for safety... Even the Nazis overseeing parts of the army wrote back to Berlin in an attempt to stop the killings...

Anything vaguely Ustase should be wiped from the face of the earth... 

When Nazis and Facsists help those being killed, you know it is a bad government...
Now that's a real group of death

Or when Cavani complimented his black team mate in his mother tongue.

It's unlikely either Albania and Croatia will qualify, unless Croatia beat Italy next. Albania beating Spain is a stretch. Croatia could draw with Italy, have 2 points in total and that still might be not enough, because they have poor GD.
no we’re both getting knocked out lol

And how exactly do they solve it for shit like this? Half od the people in that stadium are living in Germany. How the fuck do you police something you habe no control over?
It's the Balkans. Trust me, even God himself couldn't stop them from doing things like this. This is pretty tame by Balkan standards, I hear stuff like this irl all the time.
It's also an outlet to be "social" without actually getting organized on a community basis.
sports in general but yea
[deleted]
Except for Balkans, just remember Boban and Dinamo-Red Star riot. But we always need to be different.
For Europeans, that and nude beaches.
My theory is that the troubles didn't spread to Glasgow because the football was enough to keep people feeling like they were at war.
So you're implying the Balkans are the Empire/Sith the clear villains of Star Wars? Or the Trade Federation? Another clear villainious faction?
Many Balkans died to bring us this information
Only a Balkan deals in absolutes.
>Jedi

Fun fact, the word "Jedi" came from the Japanese "Jidai Geki" (時代劇), literally "Period Drama". (As George Lucas was a huge fan of Akira Kurosawa, a lot of things in Star Wars are inspired by Japanese culture)


So I guess you could say this whole Balkan thing thing is a Period Drama, with countries instead of people

You’d know
Xhaka on high alert
🎵 Shaqiri Shaqiri🎵
a fun fact about this is that indirectly caused Liverpool to win the CL

because a couple of months later Liverpool drew Crvena Zvezda in the groups, and security said it legitimately wasn't safe for Shaqiri to travel to Belgrade, so it left a spot on the bench free

ended up that player on the spare spot on the bench got his first minutes of the season in that game...Divock Origi
Him & Shaqiri both did it and they got fined and/or banned
Best part about that is still the Brazilian commentator who apparently didn‘t know the sign and thought they were doing a peace dove 😭
world cup 2018 i think?
I remember this vividly, some were wanted xhaka banned for life and the result to be overturned / the swiss to be disqualified from the next world cup lol

Totally shithousery I love
To be fair, that was also not unprovoked.
Shaqiri throwing it up after his goal was so bad ass.
This is fucking football right here. None of that pansy ass dick tugging smile for the camera bullshit. Men puke, men poop on the field, men deliver their new born baby on the side lines. Fucking hard core dick in the ass butterball foosball fuck it chuck it game time shit. Take it to the showers. Dicks get shoved in places you don’t even remember. We win together we celebrate together. Football is back baby.
yes it’s common knowledge diaspora are 10x more extreme than in the home country. 

idk why tbh, like they’re so ‘proud’ of their country they can’t even come back and live here they’re that proud, like fck off lol. 

also we wouldn’t be in the EU, Schengen, or whatever other sht that exists if diaspora were in charge here.
Australia is the same. Though a number arrived before the 90s wars. Usual caveat of not all people of Croat background of course.

A number of Croatian football clubs in Australia are notorious for their open use of fascist imagery and chants. It’s an ongoing frustration that it doesn’t get weeded out of the game (and more generally).
"I like my bigotry oddly specific"
Our hatreds go back waaaay too many centuries
Just tell them to say the same things they say about Pakistan but replace it with Serbia or Croatia.
You just reminded me of that godawful video of a group of Indian fans chanting “It’s coming home”, none of them had ever heard the song before. Agonising viewing
I know your comment is a joke, but I am pretty sure this chant is criminal based on §130 Volksverhetzung (incitement to hatred)
> in this part of Europe

It's in Germany, where genocide is now considered quite distasteful
Now, I'm not an expert, but it was weird af hearing Glasgow Rangers fans singing that on public transport when they came to my city for Europa League. I don't even live in Germany and I thought that was more of a English NT fans thing.
Tbh this is most normal occurence on the stands, even when we play our own leagues. Like when hajduk plays dinamo, we have chants on how we are going to kill them, beat them up etc. 

Nothing unusual for balkans. Expecting the same from Serbs! No hard feelings, just pure football heritage.

ma frende, nabim jedne, druge i trece. u kurcu su svi
I went to bosnia for holiday. The tour guide made it seem like there wasn’t really any real hatred anymore between them, and that people for the most part are over it. Dunno how true that is.
Of course, I'm not comparing, as it's unfair to expect such fresh wounds to heal so soon. It's more of a hope for the future
And 80 years since the Croats put us in extermination camps. But thats irrelevant, its not like they had Ustaša flags and scarves at the game today. The Balkans are unfortunately very far from the Scandinavian countries. Hopefully at some point in the future, although I’m not too hopeful when I see scenes like this (both from Serbs and the other countries).
But so did the Croats lol
Genocide not attempted genocide.

In 2004, in a unanimous ruling on the case of *Prosecutor v. Krstić*, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY ruled the massacre of the enclave's male inhabitants constituted [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide), a crime under international law.[^(\[22\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre#cite_note-Krstic_para._37-24) The ruling was also upheld by the [International Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice) (ICJ) in 2007
While that's true, presenting the conflict in a purely black and white way and blaming just one side is not gonna make the dynamic any better.
so this chat is ok for you?
But it has been less than a century since we Germans tried killing the French.
It’s been 30 years since croats had concentration camps for serbs that disgusted even german nazis you mean
Classic nationalism here. Get lost with your hatred spreading.
and 80 years since Croats genocided Serbs and Jews, this cycle of hatred just has to stop
Just one event? You gotta go way way way back
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars
Man it really depends on what you want to learn about. To be honest, my recommendation would be "The Bridge Over the Drina" by Ivo Andric. It's fiction, but goes over a wider period of history in Bosnia, centred on the bridge as the main character, if there can be one.

Events there are too many, the BBC documentary is good, but there are also other good things to look at. "The New Class" by Milovan Djilas is an interesting look at Yugoslav Communism, "Prime Time Crime" by Kurspahic is good for Milosevic media, "To Kill a Nation" by Michael Parenti is an interesting but heavily critical of the West view of the fall of Yugoslavia (all of these looking at recent Yugoslav history really).

As I said there are many events which you would want to look at to know more, but the Battle of Kosovo (1389) is important for the Serbian mythology surrounding Kosovo relevant today, WW2 in the region was also important. For more recent events re. communist Yugoslavia some interesting moments are problems surrounding the new 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia and the leaking of the SANU Memorandum (both of these of Serbian concern). 

I think other writers (more fictional) such as Aleksandar Tisma and Danilo Kis(?) should be fairly interesting too.
There is legit only one country that keeps saying they want to invade kosovo and want to be putin bestie
So true. Another example is the Ruud Gullit blackface thing. Even before he said anything there were already hundreds of europeans defending them.
So weirdly dehumanizing, "haha there go those silly people again"
In Soviet Russia, Balkans joke about you.
which footballer
I'm not even surprised at this point. 

However, this obsession and clear bias is even more strange when you realize most of these people, the one's really vocal about it here on reddit, weren't even alive during the 90s balkan wars nor are they even from that part of Europe.
Champagne progressives. No one told them to be mad about this type of racism in particular.
we're totally fine with slovenia, i'd say, i doubt anyone will be chanting anything about them

however, we could be playing myanmar and there'd still be idiots chanting something about croats/albanians/bosnian muslims
Goes deeper than simply "nazi support". The ustaše were nazi, and the Balli Kombetar were alligned with them too, but one of the main rivals to Ustaše in Yugoslavia (aside from the partisans with Tito) were the Četniks (Serb), who were also collaborators with Nazis. The history of yugoslavia is very messy
It's remarkable how those Croats that celebrate Oluja like christmas (i say some because there's a few of us who couldn't give fuck) deem themselves ultra patriotic but they can't for the life of them use the official flags and symbols of the country they are allegedly patriotic towards
It's not like it's saying "no" either
Remember people were losing their shit over the no surrender flag the other day, calling for exclusion of Serbia etc.
My favorite is the threads here where they call Serbia racist and xenophobic while being absolutely xenophobic, it's so lost on them. Top prize goes to the UK fans in a country that voted Brexit and Farage holds decent approval ratings due to their hatred of immigrants commenting on other countries.
> Just IMAGINE if it was Serbs chanting about killing Albanians.

Tomorrow we won't even have to imagine.
Recency bias is very much a thing. The conflict and genocides of the 90's is fresh in ppls minds, while the ustase was 80~ years ago.
Both are disgusting and should be critiqued?
Did you ever hear about the tragedy of Darth Albania, the wise?

Isn't like, only 6% of Romania part of the Balkans though (Dobrogea) ?
Like a 30 year old Mercedes?
Yes and i just remember Top Gear episode in Albania where they mentioned that.
That's actually crazy, how the hell is that even possible.
this is so true, I grew up in a small town of 20k people and there were groups of kids with Serbian and Albanian background fighting each other on a daily to weekly basis. 

Always carrying flags with them, and when they meet on the street it goes into a fight.
But then they (hardcore ones) actually go and kill each other and everyone else for thinking differenly... so not the same at all lol
Far worse my man… germans but got kicked properly by poorly armed partisan guérilla …

This line always gets me
Holy shit, thats a fucking motivational speech right there, i am in baby.
For Australia at least, historically speaking the Croatian diaspora here are the people who got kicked out by Tito's partisans in WW2, i.e the Ustases. [Some Croatian soccer clubs in Melbourne has a statue of Ante Pavelic](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-04/sydney-united-australia-cup-analysis/101498652) in their club. I remember a Croatian colleague from Zagreb being invited to one of those clubs to play football and he was horrified at seeing Pavelic's bust, it's basically like a German person seeing a statue of Hitler in a German social club
Tito kicked out the Ustase aka the Fascists that scared the Nazis. Could be a reason
Some of the people over at Sydney United (Formerly Sydney Croatia and founded by Croatian migrants to Australia) have been found numerous times to be.....well how do you say.....very fond of the regime that collaborated with the Nazi's. Fined a number of times by authorities for displaying fascist imagery. Some of whom have been banned for life for Nazi salutes at games. [People have just ignored some of these groups for ages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk2L_6FLdDw).


I don't know much about Croatian history. But a common thing some of them say is ""Za dom spremni". Some general searching leads me to knowledge that the phrase is linked with the fascist state that collaborated with Nazi Germany, but again this is just from general research. 

I just wish these people would get weeded out of the game down here. Fuck off.
a huge number of Ustashe fled the Yugoslavia after the WW2 and a lot of them found their place in Australia among other countries. They stayed pretty active up until 70s. A lot of today's australian- croatians are descendants of those people indoctrinated by ideology by their ancestors (of course, I am not saying all of them are the same-plenty of good people are there as well). These people usually have a more radical stance than people in their 'homeland'

To be fair football fans cant be used as a representative sample. Traveling to any of the foreign countries you are more than likely to receive a warm welcome. 

However, people in all countries are still nationalistic as fuck and even if welcoming to strangers when it comes to politics they vote for nationalist parties who will further division, rather than working on solutions. It’s unfortunate really.
From my experience people, with some exceptions, get along just fine. But there obviously disagreements about politics and history, it's just that those topics are avoided.
Not overt, but covertly its all still there particularly given each area has their own interpretations of what happened.
On a micro scale in day to day encounters people get along fine, no one cares for your religion. 

But people are not over it, especially in places deeper im the country with more homogenous demographic. The feeling is that people are content to ignore any differences as long as no one brings them up. 

I live on the border between Muslim and Serb entities in Bosnia, in my 28 years I've not once had a bad experience with a any Bosnian Serbs that was related to religion.
From the Croats and Serbs I've spoken to they seem to be fairly friendly. Same language and that.
It's true, for the majority apart from the idiots which exist everywhere. There's hatred for the politicians and people involved in the genocides, and the "never forget" stuff which is 100% required. But also there are "normal" relations I'd say with your standard people in there. The problem is people are easily impressionable, and the political landscape there is still a disaster and one of trying to rip it all apart, so things can quickly blow up, or some people get swayed very quickly and bring that stuff back for no reason.
I'm of mixed Croat/Slovene/Serb/Montenegrin ethnicity and have been travelling the region just now and have not experienced anything but love when I tell people my heritage. But I think it depends on where (urban, educated, and tourist areas tend to be more open and welcoming) and how you're interacting with people of "opposite" backgrounds.
Absolutely untrue lmao. I think you'd be surprised by the amount of "we're all brothers and a single people" and "the west divided us but we never meant any harm to anyone" propaganda going around anywhere Serbia has any influence.

Their outlook on the FOUR (4) wars they started and lost and everyone else's outlook are drastically different, and they remain different to this day because someone (guess who) is refusing to admit or, god forbid, pay for war crimes.
It’s a bit frightening to see people scoff away occurrences like this like “eh that’s balkan for you” as if nationalism, hate and violence is inherent to the regions’ culture. 

And as you pointed out, it wasn’t only Serbs that were doing ethnic cleansing during the last wars or wwii.
Unfortunately won't happen for at least 50 years.
the west has their balkan favorites, the croats are a part of that, the serbs aren't.
Can you please recommend books or documentaries about this topic? We don't read about it a lot here in Brazil
If youre claiming only one country has strong irredentist intentions or xenophobic greater state ideals you clearly get your news from reddit comments
Yep. I was so excited to leave my conservative village to go to the university in the progressive big city, only to quickly realize that most progressives are only progressive because that's the social norm. And they only care about what they are told to care about. It's very rare to find someone who is actuality a progressive by default, by their core morals from deep within. The faster people realize this, the less they get disappointed.
We are shown in the west like the worst nation ever, but when some insult Serbs in game that we aren't even involved, that will be shown like "hahaha they are so silly".
Eh, Croatian militias in the 90s were as bad as it gets. Really goes to show how it got whitewashed in the West if you think the Ustase were the last big blemish in Croatian history.

A part of it that after Croatia allied with the Bosniaks, it was counterproductive to put those crimes in the limelight. And the ones against Serbs kinda paled in comparison to the Serb war crimes against Bosniaks (not that is an excuse for anything, just discussing scale of media coverage).

ICTY did its part. So slowly it lost purpose. Hence why you do not know about it. This wasn't just some isolated massacres by untrained angry local militias, but organised and systemic ethnic cleansing in places like Lasva Valley.
Geographically, yes, but the Balkans are a state of mind.
Get this: we are a balkan nation but we are like Slovenia, we don't really have a mortal enemy and nobody *really* hates us. It's mostly because we never conquered anybody and never laid claim to huge swaths of land just because we have a minority there (think banat and timok in serbia)
You’d be amazed seeing the cars circulating there lmao. I’d say every other Mercedes is a recent G-Wagon.

Little detour to Ram Ranch
I know a club in Melbourne back when I lived there had an ustase flag on the wall lol.

like I understand these guys want to connect back home, keep the Croatian spirit even if they don’t live here in Croatia, that’s fine. 

but why the fck do you have to latch onto the ustase? we Croats hated pavelic and his hitler regime, we even have a day DEDICATED to the fall of the ustase yet these fcks go on to unironically celebrate it? 

peak delusion honestly.
ye but that would make sense for the 3 Croats alive who were in ww2, of which 1 might’ve actually been a nazi. 

most diaspora werent alive then or moved during the 90’s, they don’t have any logical reason to be having ustase ideals, sure you could maybe hate Serbs who forced you to leave your country, but there’s nothing stopping them coming back, and there’s nothing forcing them to turn to nazism as a coping mechanism for it either.
Sydney United was one example I was referring to, including their president who always just waves it off. Also the clubs that openly display photos of Ante Pavelić. And of course Joe Šimunić - born and grew up in Australia but ultimately chose to play for Croatia - getting fined by UEFA for leading that very Za dom spremni chant (and then trying to argue he didn’t know what it meant, lol).

The normal folk don't really think about these tensions too much because there's far too many other worries for your average Bosnian citizen to worry about. The politicians make it seem like a war is about to break out any moment, when the reality is quite different.
> refusing to admit or, god forbid, pay for war crimes.

I have to react here and say that this is just NOT true. Milošević died in The Hague, Mladić and Karadžić were sent there _by Serbia_ , as well as numerous other Serbian generals and politicians which were charged with war crimes in the most recent Balkan wars. So, who else needs to _pay_ ? Serbs as a people? How does that work?
Like the other commenter said, while blaming one side, you are also actively pushing your one-sided propaganda which is not helping _anyone_ to achieve lasting peace.
I can assure the current Serbian government sure as shit ain't pushing for brotherhood and unity. You have people that do but to pretend those are only Serbs is silly, Yugonostalgia is alive and well in many places, whatever you may think of it.

>Their outlook on the FOUR (4) wars they started and lost and everyone else's outlook are drastically different, and they remain different to this day because someone (guess who) is refusing to admit or, god forbid, pay for war crimes.

Ignoring the semantics of who started the wars and who won, you are literally right now pushing your own propaganda and one sided narrative, which isn't helping people get along.
tbh as someone who lives in the region there is a great resentment between Serbians and Croats The people of Bosnia and Hercegovina tho try to be friendly towards both despite most of the war in balkans was Croats and Serbs trying to take  Bosnia apart.               
Both croats and serbs have huge victim complex
Did Croatia pay any war crimes for the genocide against Serbs in WW2? Also what 4 wars did they start and lose? Serbs and Croats are the same fucking shit dumbass stop spreading your dumbass propaganda both are war criminals
It is our culture, stop being xenophobic racist westerner and respect our culture 🤓
Darkness: It'll take fifty years for these things to pass

Light: Fifty years, in the scheme of history, is nothing, and we will likely be alive to see it
Yeah, it’s a shame.
The death of Yugoslavia, BBC documentary, it’s available in full on YouTube. It straight up had the major players involved speaking and was released while the conflicts were still ongoing

I’m not from the area, so if there’s a better one perhaps someone can point it out. But in English I haven’t found one superior
It's not directly about the conflict, but ESPN had a basketball-focused documentary called "[Once Brothers](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tLP1TdISc9LLk8xYPQSSi0uyFPIz0tOVUgqyi_JSC0qBgCsHwsY&q=espn+once+brothers&oq=espn+once+brothers&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgBEC4YgAQyCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyBwgBEC4YgAQyCAgCEAAYFhgeMggIAxAAGBYYHjIICAQQABgWGB4yDQgFEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgGEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgHEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyCggIEAAYogQYiQXSAQg0OTYzajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)" about the relationship between Drazen Petrovic, a Croat, and Vlade Divac, a Serb, going back to when they both played for the Yugoslavia National Team. I don't know if you can view it in Brazil though.
[To End a war by Richard Holbrooke](https://www.amazon.com/End-War-Richard-Holbrooke/dp/037550057X) is a great book written by America's chief negotiator at the time.  He might be the one guy that all sides view positively. I personally learned more more about negotiation from this book than any place else.
I can't blame him, that's the image that Vučić is sending out to the world. Every other country has better PR and chose better allies than Vučić did. Even though all of us know that he doesn't give a fuck about Putin and Russia and that there is no chance that he will ever invade Kosovo, the Western layman is gonna read about that from his "impassioned" speeches and draw fairly logical conclusions.
It's just Reddit man. I dunno what the fuck you're expecting.
A mind map even.
You're too romantic to be balkan 😉
I wonder how many of those new ones still have an owner looking for them.

Not that I have much room to talk since rental companies only allowed people to start taking bmw and mercedes cars to Poland like 5 years ago.
Oh so it's like Cuba where they keep cars running forever. That actually makes more sense considering they aren't that far from some more wealthy countries, still not sure why Mercedes specifically though.
wait i thought the Albanian thing was a joke sage for Dua Lipa there’s no way they’re punching that hard above their weight in pop stars
I have a particular set of skills... mainly football skills. I have a particular set of football skill... I'm quite good at football.

Well it seems that *when Croatia sends it's people, it doesn't send it's best*. 

But i guess the british started that shit with Australia.
I meant the diaspora are their descendants which matters. Look at the Vietnamese, Cuban and Iranian diaspora in the US or the Indian and Pakistani diaspora in the UK or the Moroccan diaspora in The Netherlands
Simunic was interviewed by the roar a while back and he was completely unrepentant at the time lol
Insert Mario saying 'Here we go!!'
Every single German I know seems chill and then I mention Turkey… Mfers turn into Adolf instantaneously
The last time time the Germans came out against the jews, a wee bit of bad banter occurred.
Iirc a lot of polish pilots also flew for RAF against the Nazis
Half slovenian /half serbian, his dad is an ethnic serb from Slovenia. Luka speaks perfect serbian, is a big Belgrade red star fan and proud to be both slovenian and serbian. Doncic is a serbian surname.
There won’t be a physical war because Serbia can’t afford that but there are really high tensions, especially where Serbs are the majority. They are very vocal about how they feel about the Bosniaks.
It's the admission of guilt that he is referring to I think. To move forward, the admission and acceptance of "yes genocide was committed" (and none of the "but but but this and that happened in the past as well"), just the full on admission and apology is what is needed. It's what was needed from Germany to move on all those years ago too, and it's what they did. 

There were problems from all sides and of course all sides need to do this. But when you have regions in BiH (in RS) glorifying convicted war criminals, naming streets after the main people in charge of the genocide.. yeah there's never going to be closure.
Does anyone remember that game between Serbia and Albania, I think it was in 2014, where some Albanian supporters flew a drone over the pitch carrying a flag that had something to do with a "greater Albania"? The match had to be called off because a brawl broke out between the players, followed by supporters rushing the pitch.  As a Serb, all I could do was laugh my ass off.  It was a perfect troll job with an entirely predictable result lol.
Damn, almost 5 hours of content. Thanks.
Absolutely fantastic documentary by the way. The scene of Milosevic declaring war on everyone was unreal.
Fantastic 30 For 30. I'm not even that big of a basketball fan, but this had me enthralled.
A break? Please?
No man it’s not just Reddit. I’m Serbian and I hear this bs on all sorts of social media.
finders keepers! doesn’t matter where you find it
Its mostly drug money and imports from Korea nowadays.
Older ones are cheap, reliable, easy to fix and driving a Mercedes is a status symbol
Built different
Nearly all raised in the UK though. See the UK really has the best scene in the world for nurturing talent, our gene pool is just a bit too shit to realize it.
BIG HARD THROBBING COCKS SHOVED IN UNEXPECTED PLACES
that’s true, but ffs man why couldn’t they keep shit to themselves instead of giving to their kids :/
Turkey? the country and its citizens who constantly deny the Armenian genocide?
I can agree with the admission of guilt never being done on the institutional level, and yeah, that _would_ be one of the necessary things for closure. There _were_ steps towards that, however the current government has found it beneficial to abuse the opposite steps, by stoking fear. 

However, I'd like to also point out that we're discussing this on a video of members of both Croatian and Albanian nation openly singing about murdering Serbian people. And _still_ the conversation inevitably turns the other way from that, as if it's nothing, "deserved" toward those murderous Serbs. Again, I am not murderous, my parents/siblings/neighbors/friends aren't murderous. Do _I_ need to _pay_ anything? Do _they_ ?

And it is exactly _this_ sentiment that the ruling party in Serbia harnesses from this whole ordeal, and rides the wave. Point being, as long as conversation inevitably turns one way only, we will be further and further from that admission of guilt, and ultimately closure and Scandinavian way of cooperation. And, of course, as the first comment in the thread says, time.
That match was in Serbia right if I remember correctly?

That was funny as hell and much much better troll then "ubi ubi Srbina" thats chant is like we are in 3rd grade of elementary school being edgy.
I lived with my Albanian friend at the time and he was laughing about it like no rational Albanian really believes in “greater Albania” iirc they claim even parts of Italy?
Was that the match a player was trying to shoot down the drone with a ball?
That documentary was invaluable to the ICTY prosecutors as well as the footage and interviews provided a ton of evidence.  You had guys like Praljak and Seselj straight up admitting to war crimes on screen.
Man, in America Benz are considered the most expensive shit to fix and are only nice for the first 5 years before something breaks and you have to take out the 1000 page manual to fix it. Toyota and Honda are the cars that run forever here because parts are cheap and everything down to the headlights aren't over engineered.
>our gene pool is just a bit too shit to realize it

Damn bro
RAM RANCH IS UNDER SIEGE
Wow, you're right, it was in Beograd.  That is wild haha, I had assumed it was in a neutral location.
atp they claim the whole world lmao
I don't recall anyone kicking a ball at it, but one of the players definitely grabbed the flag and pulled the drone down out of the air.
Remember when I say older I mean the boxy ones, those that brought German car manufacturing the good reputation, not the ones from today
I was not 100% sure but I seem to recall newspapers being dumbfounded how was that allowed to happen
Ryan Reynolds IG story
This friendship - I can’t 😂😂
this is me Tryan
Ryan being Ryan. Also I kinda want to know Travis's reaction
The person who did the edit is fantastic. Ryan posting it is fantastic. This whole thing is fantastic and I’m excited to see how it gets more fantastic on Wednesday when the podcast drops.
Why does Ryan actually look so good in this
Ryan had the opportunity to do the funniest thing and he did XD
Hahaha Ryan was like “this photos too hot let’s make it hotter” 😂
We all need to be ready for a recreation 100% hahaha
This NEEDS to be discussed on New Heights this week, I beg of you.
It's nice that he's comfortable enough with Travis to have fun with something like this.....not saying any of  Taylor's exes wouldnt but I knew this would be coming and I even wouldn't have been surprised if Travis shared it first
Please I am begging someone make this edit with Rob McElhenney as Taylor!
Ok this is very cute! I like Ryan Reynolds's reaction!
After years of literal CRUMBS from Taylor’s relationship with Joe, sometimes posts like these actually shock me a little bit…in the best way. 

I can’t believe we finally have a boyfriend that Ryan feels comfortable enough to do this with. Really hoping Travis and Jason react to this on the podcast!!

ETA: 1) stating that we had crumbs of their relationship is just me stating facts. Nowhere did I say I blamed Joe for this; 2) Ryan never did this with *any* of Taylor’s exes before so my second sentence *also* isn’t a slight against Joe. If you feel like it’s negative, fine but then you have to say it’s technically negative against all of her exes.
[deleted]
Smash.
ok Ryan needs to take a real one in this pose with Travis 🤣🤣
I absolutely love Blake and Ryan’s relationship. I would love to see Ryan and Travis interacting because I’m sure it will be funny as hell. Can you imagine Taylor and Travis on a double date with Blake and Ryan?? Oh to be a fly on the wall.
wait but why does ryan eat with that hair 😩😩
The need to recreate this irl lol
Hard smash
i ship it
🤣🤣🤣
This is fantastic
Ryan wins IG this week. But Blake should receive some credit after all she set up his date night.
I’m not NOT turned on 😂
Took me way too long to realize the other face was Travis ☠️
I can't wait to see Jason ask Travis about this 🤣
Taylor Swift NEEDS to be Dazzler in Deadpool 3!
I feel like the only person on the planet who does not get Ryan Reynolds.
Omg this awesome🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought Travis was Ryan Gosling until I started reading the comments😂
Oh my god this man is a legend no one is on his level
ME! in the OG: They're hot 🥵![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1079)

ME! looking at this: 😁😂😂🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀☠☠☠☠

Thanks Ryan!
I literally howled and woke everyone up in the middle of night XD
Corny.
You better not be cunty ryan reynolds’s when I get back!

🤣
He's obnoxious
a certain group of swifties gonna have a field day dissecting this
He's annoying
Omg he’s SOOOO funny 😂
This just made me realize that Travis and Calvin look alike lol. Taylor really must have a type.
Fucking hilarious!
Omg 😭💀
Meh, crazy times…
he’s so unfunny i’m sorry 😭
Your horrible for this lmfao 😂
Cursed lol
could have lived my entire life without seeing this and been okay
Is this Ryan Reynolds or Ryan gosling lol few will get that
Are they the same person? But one is aged? Like the young self hugging the old self?

Is this AI?
What the actual fuck?
Nope. I wanna see them do it for real.

Ryan would, because Ryan. Travis… that would be a much bigger ask!
Why does the long hair actually suit Travis though😭😭
"This week in Ryans" for the DHaJ listeners
Taylor just touched down in Green Bay for the game tonight fyi
This made me give the weirdest, longest, loudest laugh I’ve produced in recent memory.
lol
Looks like Ryan is doing two things at once.
Travis looks like blonde JVN!
Travis and Ryan should recreate the picture in the same outfits.
nah. wrong clothes
Someone needs to edit it to where Travis is eye fucking the camera like Taylor lmfao
Can someone please photoshop Paul Rudd's face over blake/ Ryan's? So, that it's Rudd and Kelce?
<edit this was a joke because Paul Rudd always looks like he just adores Travis kelce>
Why does Travis Kelce kind of look like Ryan Gosling
lol. that editing is gold!
Musics mid
He’s so unserious 😭😭😭
💀
I think "Travis" is in Lavender Haze!
Does that say Ninjart1st in the bottom
Nobody has ever commented anything this excellent. Ever. 🤣🤣🤣
Travis needs to repost with the caption: I remember it All Too Well 🤣
Oooooh! wow very clever i must say ! Lol
pack it up, boys. there's nothing left here for us to do.
You win reddit for the day 🤣
Fell behind on Travis and I ended up here.
I cackled so hard.
I’m screameing
🤣🤣🤣
That is just as funny as the picture itself!!!
COMMENT OF THE YEAR RIGHT HERE😭😭
Wheres the freaking free award when we need it the most
🤣🤣🤣
SCREAMING 🤣
🏆 you win 🤣🤣🤣
This wins today
He's going to laugh his ass off. He died when the couple did the "Taylor putting Travis on the map" costume for Halloween.
Hope Jason brings it up on the next podcast 😄
I hope he reposts 😂
He doesn’t give a fuck just like everybody else.
I appreciate that Ryan called it art
You are s Travis fan like me. Ryan is among my favorite actors and I have mad respect that he not only pulled Blake but married her and is a great father. I'm hoping Travis is growing up like I think and they find happiness.
Right? Ryan actually makes a very beautiful woman 😭
He'll be a long haired Viking for his next role
He needs to dress like Blake more
I feel like it was a missed opportunity to ask Rob mclhenny when he was in the pod if he feels threatened by Travis’ looming friendship with Ryan
I hope we get the real thing soon with Travis and Ryan doing the actual poses and everything 

Like Taylor and Blake post photos on the day and then the next day ryan or Travis posts a photo from the same event of them doing the same pose
Already done and Rob posted it himself! I love this whole thing so much

https://twitter.com/RMcElhenney/status/1731392299643384118
i am a little bit faceblind (like, actually for real) and until reading this comment i assumed ryan had photoshopped his own face onto both taylor and blake. i was like heheh that’s silly, good ol’ ryan.

finding out it was travis photoshopped onto taylor made me go OH THAT’S WHY PEOPLE ARE FREAKING OUT... genuinely said it out loud lmfao.
One of my first thoughts. I think it’s a really good sign that Ryan felt comfortable to post this. I could have missed it, but I don’t think he ever posted anything remotely like this previously.
Cmonnn we can’t blame Joe for taking himself too seriously. Some ppl just do that and that’s okay too.
And also this comment reminds me of Joe and Jaden Smith being the same type of person.

Reference: https://youtu.be/u67LcppGqIE?si=2Yl2tlyWdtR61xI5
Why do you guys always need to refer everything back to Joe. Ryan does these because Travis too is famous. It is basically PR.
‘I can’t believe *we* finally have a boyfriend’ 😳😳

Friend, this is not our boyfriend
It means Travis is the real deal
And Travis 😭
He's got a very Canadian sense of humor, so sometimes it doesn't hit the mark with a worldwide audience.

Sarcastic absurdist comedy is a thing up here. Tom Green, Colin Mochrie, Trailer Park Boys, Letterkenny...
I tend to see him as absurdist. He just goes for the absurd and *sometimes* hits the mark for the general public who aren’t particularly absurd. I don’t always get it either but he seems to be enjoying himself and plenty of folks are just as absurd as he is.
Strike force 5 podcast he made personalized ads and then they had him on and he clearly felt like they were funnier than him and was game for things but also stepped back and let them help him and I thought it was a real interesting side of him we don’t usually get. 
All this to say it made me get him more
It’s alright, humours subjective
You're not alone.
You don't find this funny?
It's an all time winner, I am still dying
Agreed. This is literally the best comment I've ever read on this forum 🤣🤣
Legs were bare, I was there I was there
Got a pic of that?
I love when Jason throws this kinda stuff into the podcast.
I mean, Ryan knows art when he sees it. 🎨

Despite having a beard Ryan’s face is so smooth 

I’m so goddam jealous of his jawline like come on man can you just not be perfect for 5 mins and give the rest of us a chance
Omg this would’ve been hilarious! Rob is the very overly attached friend
No, Travis would never allow that.
Have you seen the video of him dancing with Gronk? Him and Ryan will definitely goof around
OMG the Variety cover on the wall just absolutely makes this
Yes! Finally thank you lol I am not on Twitter so did not see this. Lol of course he posted it himself
Rob was a guest at the NH podcast just this last week. 
Hopefully they will somehow talk about the two photoshop pics on the podcast next week.
Joe is just shy. You have no idea how seriously he takes himself.
It’s ok to call a spade a spade. Joe wasn’t in any memes with Taylor’s friends husbands and ok with it. It’s not trashing him, it’s just stating the obvious. 

I am HERE for the senses of humor and the comedy which will unfold!
Didn’t she also say in her documentary that they both made a mutual decision to not be public about the relationship? So I don’t understand this narrative that it was all Joe
Do we really need to rehash this argument in every single thread?? Like just create a Joe Alwyn subreddit at this point
Acting like Joe wasn’t also famous is a weird take.
For real, why are people like this?? Actually reminds me of the Reputation era when there was a large selection of fans who didn't like Joe because he was 'boring' ie not giving them things to talk about every 5 minutes 🥲 the same people saying Taylor and Calvin were the best couple in 1989 era because of how public they were
>He's got a very Canadian sense of humor

Yes! This makes me nostalgic for the Canadian version on Second City TV I watched as a kid.  Rick Morranis, Harold Ramis, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, etc.  No wonder I grew up to become a huge Schitt's Creek fan as an adult.
How are ya now?
I think I would if it wasn't Ryan Reynolds 🤷‍♀️

Oh I'm sure they will. Jason will have a field day with this haha
Too many people are giving him shit for just being an introvert. Which is perfectly acceptable.
I mean...  when a couple is making a decision, and one person feels strongly about something, and they decide, jointly to compromise a bit more towards one person's opinion than another...  that is still a "mutual decision".

A "mutual decision" doesn't mean they feel exactly the same about something, it just means they talked, and compromised, and are now making the same decision to move forward.
I mean...  Joe is low-key British actor-famous. It's a thing, they consider acting to be their "job" not their life.  And because of the insular nature of the British film industry they don't have to constantly be waging a campaign of personality and publicity to get jobs.  Everyone knows everyone else and they just call up the actor they want for a project (or ask them when they're over for dinner), whether they've been in tabloids lately or not isn't a big deal in the serious film community...

Travis is in an industry where one too many tackles means he has a traumatic brain injury that starts acting up in 5-10 years...  he needs to make a name for himself and make people love his personality so that sooner rather than later he can retire and transition into an announcer or TV personality.  

Travis is actively seeking publicity like his life depends on it (because it does...) Joe is in an incredibly different environment as regards "fame".
Ummm I think Joe's a really good guy.but he's not nearly as famous as Travis Kelce is outside of Britain. I mean Kelce hosted the leading comedy show in the USA which is a rarity for athletes. Don't think Joe has had any real guest appearances on Graham Norton or Jonathan Ross (correct me if I'm wrong). Travis was on the tonight show is also in a ton of commercials and has his own radio show (all of this before meeting taylor) - i honestly don't know what Joe does aside from some supporting roles in some low budget low box office films
he was not famous outside of Taylor, only known for his association to Taylor. He was only known by her fans, and her casual fans didn't even know him.
People act like anyone can go to the met gala
He isn't I have no clue who he is  beyond British blond and whiny ass skinny white 6'0* guy?
It’s WILD
Goodnyou?
This is the most perfect comment thread.
I love a well done visual pun costume.
Omg this is gold 😂 can't believe I'm only seeing this now lol
OMG I missed that!
I mean, I understand this, but saying we got crumbs before this isn’t bashing her ex. It’s stating the obvious.
perfectly acceptable to give someone shit just for being an introvert? don't get me wrong, i hated that he became too complacent but giving him shit for wanting things/acting differently is just shit itself
You are absolutely right that and I’m not here to disagree, just here to say that we don’t know. Maybe it was *mostly* Joe’s choice and Taylor just went along with it as she loved him and wanted him to be happy.. Or maybe Taylor had enough with all the dating speculation throughout her career and at that point in her life when she got with Joe she was just tired of the drama and needed privacy, but ultimately realized due to the relationship she loves being showed off. The relationship is over either way, and Taylor is happy, so speculation is pretty meaningless now
Taylor's reputation was horrendous at the time. The press tears everything she does apart. She's spoken about it at length. The privacy served her equally.
Wow, finally. Someone with some sense 🥹🥹
But she mentions in the documentary that she went into hiding because of all the negative press from the Kanye drama, and during this time she found a relationship that she decided to keep under wraps. She also shows a diary entry where she is extremely excited that no one has found out about them after nine whole months of dating. So it sounds like she played a huge part in keeping them low key, too.
I don’t think Joe is really famous in Britain tbh (I’m British)
Discovering more and more things in this meme
Pretending there’s not a negativity around calling it crumbs is delusion.

Edit:  it’s been funny watching the this comment go from positive to negative as the delusional people roll into the thread and get salty.
I think they meant being an introvert is perfectly acceptable,  but I read it the same way as you at first.
>just here to say that we don’t know.

Yes, I agree with everything you said. 

We don't know, and unless she decides to write a tell-all memoir when she's 80 we'll most likely never know, and that's fine.

I just think it's interesting when people say "well this one time she said THIS" as if that's the view she's then required to hold for eternity!
>So it sounds like she played a huge part in keeping them low key, too.

Yeah...  I'm not saying she didn't.  Once you make a decision on how you're moving forward, it's best you 100% buy into that decision...

my point is that Joe may want that for his entire life, and Taylor may have wanted that \*then\*, based on everything going on, so they made that joint decision...  but that doesn't mean that Taylor wanted that forever.

She could have tried to keep the Travis relationship secret too, but she didn't...  maybe because it's all a PR conspiracy and they aren't "really" dating...  or it could be that she's just in a different period of her life, and while the first 9 months of keeping it secret was fun with Joe, once that carried into YEARS of doing it, it lost it's charm.

They made a choice together...  but looking at her behavior now, it seems like she didn't actually want that level of hiding forever.
Kanye fans are the Taylor Swift fans of the rap community
prove me wrong
‘He made graduation’ started off as a meme, now I think some Kanye fans literally live by it
100%
Let’s just say we are lucky that Nicki Minaj never held the top spot before
See my username, unfortunately absolutely true
They act like Kanye. Insufferable.
I think the difference right now is there are millions of casual TS fans in addition to the hardcore Swifties.

Kanye has done a great job of alienating his casual fan base by putting out shitty music and turning into a Nazi sympathizer so what’s left are the hardcore and the dellusional 
The only fanbase that could come close is the Barbz.
Rabid dogs who will consume anything regardless of quality because ye made it…yeah this is accurate.
I don’t even think Kanye fans are the worst in hip hop so idk 

Taylor fans are feral and have leaked peoples info for making comments about her, I can’t really remember that happening for kanye 

I’d say barbs are closer

Hell even carti fans are more feral 

Kanye fans are mostly just strong on their love for him but don’t get into much other than arguing, Taylor fans actually do shit if you call her out
Kanye deserves the recognition for his musical ability.. dudes an actual musical genius
Yes yes yes yes yes 100%
Their sub is having an absolute meltdown over a “not review” by a bald man on the internet. It’s pretty entertaining.
I'm into music production, so I'd be an idiot who didn't do my homework if I didn't at least peep his projects to have an ear for his production. He collaborates with a lot of top electronic producers, be it people like Daft Punk, Gesaffelstein, Hudson Mohawke, James Blake, so I like hearing how these minds collaborate artistically. Whether his album ends up being great or not, you can't say he is boring. Every album is different, he's not afraid to blend genres, or push into different territories. There are few artists who have as varied a discography as he does. You got some others like Quincy Jones, Radiohead, David Bowie, Tom Waits, etc. Even Taylor Swift is getting up there.

All this being said, he's insanely problematic as a person, and has his issues. He sucks as a person at the moment, but I still try and judge the music separately. He's like a 1/10, but Vultures is like a 7/10. I like to believe people can change opinions and viewpoints though, so still holding out he can dial back some of the damage he's done.

There are two camps that I think have issues. Those who defend his actions in real life because they like his music. Those who dismiss his current art because of his unhinged remarks outside music (boycotting is different than trying to convince people his current music is a 1 star album like a lot of publications are already trying to push in their reviews).

Kanye might be my favorite producer, but I personally think r/kanye and r/goodasssub are pretty cursed at times.
Crazy to look back at their incident at the VMAs and think about the trajectories their careers have taken since then. Love them or hate them, it is genuinely impressive when you consider their staying power compared to other artists.
I know we are 😭
Kanye fans are cultists
I’m not even joking when I say Kanye fans are probably in a landslide the worst fanbase of anything, straight up. The only thing even making me put “probably” there is that I just woke up and can’t think of if there’s any other uniquely awful act out there I’m forgetting
r/kanye is not the average kanye listener
![gif](giphy|RIeC72moePyKcFQGK5|downsized)
I see what you're trying to get at but Kanye is deeply problematic while media tried to portray Taylor watching her boyfriend play sports as problematic
I'd say its moreso Nicki Minaj fans are the Tay Swift fans of the rap community. They actually behave similar
Swifties aren’t idolizing an anti-semite, though…
Interesting. I’ve always compared Taylor Swift to Drake. But fandom might be different.
Wrong, as insufferable as Swifties can be I don’t see them supporting a Nazi apologist
Taylor Swift is not a racist, dangerous, moron. So no.
Swift fans aren’t Nazis or accepting of Naziism. Key difference.

Are people just going to forget that Kanye has been praising Hitler for 20+ years?
Idk, have you seen barbs?
Kanye is an antisemite bigot who should have no fans
Taylor Swift fans aren't defending a vocal anti-semite. I don't see Swifties spending $100 on Jesus socks or going to a Taylor Swift ran church.
I love Kanye's music, but this album is awful beyond words from every perspective.

The mixing is off in almost every track, the beats production are forgettable and weak, Kanye's lyrics on this is goofy and delivered with zero passion, and the features doesn't do it any favours. It's such a lazy and rushed album just to release it around the superbowl. Hell, even the cover is garbage.

It is Kanye's undisputed worst album ever, it is a pile of shit plain and simple.

The fans should be mad about this travesty of a record being released like this, they should hold him accountable on his laziness and carelessness that created this album.
Kanye is an amazing producer, he could easily be mentioned in the conversation of the greatest producers ever.

But he's a trash rapper. His lines are corny and his personality doesn't make you want to listen about his life unless you're incredibly shallow and brainwashed by social media.
As a Kanye fan I have to agree
Barbz do the same shit that Swifties do.
Kanye doesn't make good music anymore
1000%. The only difference is Taylor Stans don’t have to defend literal Nazi takes
Kanye fans are so much worse, not even on the same level.
This aint a comparison though, kanye is way more talented than taylor, and way more influential to music itself
I suppose, I don’t know. I feel like drake is closer to a taylor swift than kanye, but I haven’t seen that much drake recently.
Damn
I didn’t think I was a huge Kanye fan. I’ve never thought of myself as a big fan. But I know all his albums. And I think he’s crazy. But I like crazy.
Anybody who bought/streamed his new album supports this racist anti-semite. And if you give that “you gotta separate the artist from their art” you are a coward and you need to have your moral compass fixed.
Drake fans are worse than
Pretty true, there's some fans that comes close but they are definitely the closest to the swifties
Eminem fans treat him like a unrivaled rap king and usually have that slight little racism in them like swifties
They’re worse. At least Taylor hasn’t gone off on antisemitic rants and hangs out with the MAGA losers
I feel like Kanye fans are like, “Yeah he did some fucked up shit and said some fucked up shit BUT have you heard this album?” Swifties are more like, “Taylor did nothing wrong ever and if you disagree you’re a misogynist. You would never criticize a man for this!”
Obviously if you’re arguing with kanye fans everyday you’re gonna think that.

As someone who watches these ‘stan wars’ from the sidelines, Nicki fans are by far the worst fanbase in rap and it’s not even remotely close. They’re worse than swifties even
I'm a Kanye fan. You're right
I like Taylor Swift fans so much more than Kanye fans. Kanye fans are the worst of the worst. I hate them
I think his only fans left are teenagers that didn’t get the memo that he’s not cool anymore
[deleted]
The difference is that Taylor still comes out with good music and Kanye hasn't made anything worth listening to in a decade.
Without a doubt. All both groups do is argue over who is better. They’re both overrated as fuck
As a Kanye fan, this is true.
Kanye West fans are the worst in mainstream music. Taylor Swift fans are bad and all but they don't approach the level of toxicity of Kanye fans. The idea that they're close is ridiculous.
Them and Stans.  Insufferable
Kanye sucks so bad
[deleted]
Kanye is in my top 10 fav/best artists of all time but I'm not considered a true fan because I don't like Yeezus so this doesn't apply to me 😂.
that's probably the worst thing you could say to a Kanye fan
Eminem fans are the Taylor Swift fans of the rap community.
Nah Nicki fans need to be put into camps
As a fan of his music, I’m going to respectfully take that L
I wouls say Eminem stans are the Taylor Swift fans of the hip hop community, lets not get it wrong Kayne is Hip Hop not Rap, big difference.
Eminem fans are the Taylor Swift fans...

Even we Eminem fans hate other Eminem fans
I'ma let you finish....
Bro what did kanye west fans do?😭
Makes sense if you think about it for less than 10 seconds
I’m just going to comment to get alerted to some of the takes
I agree but , Kanye is obviously a better artist than her. And kanye fans only  target  like  " SWIFTIES " or maybe minorities , other than that it's quite chill
Not sure what you’re even talking about. Why are you paying attention to fanbases
You mean Niki Minaj fans
i disagree
[deleted]
Yall trippin, Kanye was a big pioneer into todays world of hip hop
I be worried if they say nothing - Kanye West

Thanks for keeping him relevant
Only difference is Kanye fans have an off chance of joking swifties a fully delusional. I am Kanye fan so take it with a grain of salt.
I always thought Eminem fans are really the Taylor Swift fans of rap.

Similar level of super stardom, both undeniably talented but some believe they’re corny. I say this as a huge Eminem fan.
Non Kanye fans must be deaf
You don’t know old Kanye
Not enough. I wish we were more insufferable. It's fun seeing you mf getting triggered by a rapper fanbase of all things 😹
🤣🤣 🤣
Carti fans are close
Makes sense since they are both fans of huge artists, however when it comes to less popular artists but more annoying fanbases Id put Cartis fanbase at number 1. They think he is way bigger than he really is, ive read them say he could do a Stadium tour
Huh, interesting
Yitzies.
This thread reads like a twitch chat
They’re worse
2 sides of the same coin
leave taylor alooone! 
😂
The difference is Kanye’s discography has no challenge besides Wayne, OutKast, maybe Ghostface. You can hate but you cannot deny the greatness
It’s rod wave fans
Taylor Swift fans are annoying and cringe

Kanye fans are actively promoting a literal Nazi back into mainstream culture

This is not the same
Why does people that dislike Kanye go out of their way to express it? I don’t fuck with anyone I don’t like. Celebrity or not. Weirdos.
I could name 5 worse fandoms
Kanye fans are WORSE than Taylor fans.

Taylor swift fans are annoying online. Kanye fans are sycophants will turn a blind eye to anything he does
Any fan of anything is that type of fan.
She’s not a nazi sympathizer so, no, not the same.
ye or carti
https://i.redd.it/479o0jow8eic1.gif
Except Taylor swifts music is actually good.
Taylor swift fans are much more reasonable lmao
ye’s men
What if you a fan of Kanye music up to MBDTF but think he's a garbage person? 
I'm not really a listener to T-Swift, but I don't see her proclaiming slavery a choice or saying she loves hitler any time soon.
I don’t agree with a lot of takes on this sub but this one I can get on board with
tbh at this point they are way worse than taylor swift fans
I'd argue they're worse. Kanye fans are defending an antisemite.
Travis scott fans too lol
that and carti fans
Kanye fans are actually much worse than Taylor fans let’s be honest.
yes. cattle graze where they are told to.
Swifties seem a little more grounded to be honest. But I also don't hang out in whatever forums or subreddits that they hang out in.
Idk how accurate this is.  Taylor Swift would have to have a huge cocaine problem that all her fans would have to ignore and pretend isn’t happening and excuse it by acting as if she’s just eccentric. 
Much more than one bad moment, he’s had years of hateful commentary and aligning with despicable and destructive groups and individuals. His brand represents that more than anything else at this point.
And as such, there will be dozens of angry fanboys in this thread
![gif](giphy|3wCs5mlRqu8zm)
I miss the old kanye
Hell no Nicki
I don't understand what's wrong about a fanbase supporting their artist? That's what fans do. The larger the fanbase is, the more vocal they'll be. 

If Fantano's going to give their favorite artist a shit review he needs to be prepared to take their backlash.
Wouldn’t that be Nicki’s fan base? Worst than Yes fans
Wrong. Taylor fans don't worship a Nazi.
Kanye has fans?
It's kinda like the chappelle skit where he couldn't think Michael Jackson diddled those kids because 'He made Thriller'
But he made graduation
the funniest thing is up until the new gen of fans most (not all, don’t come for me) older kanye fans put that album lower on their lists. but it somehow became the model album. idk why.
That cracks me up so much. Most of the defense of him boils down to some equivalent of “his music helped me through a really dark time so I’m gonna hand wave away his anti-semitism as solely a mental health issue.” 

I cannot take those people seriously. EVERY single time Kanye gets brought up one of those people comes in to rationalize away his awful behavior.
He made Jesus walks, he’s never going to hell.
Marvin Gaye made Gayduation
but beutifulbigtittitedbuttnakedwomen just don't fall out the sky yaknow
Nah, Kanye fans are even worse since they are literally simping for a self proclaimed nazi.
Her fans would be just as insufferable as they are now
Give it time. Today’s kanye fans are tomorrow’s Nicki Minaj fans. Just there to be controversial and edgy.
ye i agree. kandidly, west
100% couldn’t have said it better myself. not even Kanye has reason to act like Kanye in this day and age, let alone his fans
Kanye has a shitload of casual fans. People still listen to R Kelly and Chris Brown even though they're awful people too.
I think Kanye still has a casual fanbase. There’s a lot of my coworkers who don’t act hard core as a fan and still bop his music
[deleted]
I picture the casual Kanye West fan as someone who goes "hey I love this song" when their favourite hit comes on. That person is used to random celebrity scandals and knows Kanye is crazy, turn it up!

Based on record sales, most people aren't scrutinizing these details as much as people the who are more vocal online. It kind of sucks.
Kanye has the most casual fans of any rapper imo. Lot of his fans will only listen to his music and maybe kendricks
Gotta say you’re wrong here. Kanye fans openly support a racist antisemite, but the worst fan base of all time was hands down the Nazis.  They loved Hitler so much they tried to destroy the rest of Europe and committed genocide against an entire race for the guy. Funny thing though Kanye loves Hitler….. So there’s a good chance any of his remaining fans do too, or at least are willing to ignore Kanye’s Hitler love.
Death Grips fans are on another plane of derangement. I love the music can't stand the fanbase.
Many will disagree but brother call any Eminem song mid and an army of a million little white boys will come to these comments defending it.
Swifties would legit ruin your entire life if they could. Gotta be careful what you say about taylor swift when you're on a public profile with your real name and photo
Could you say Anti-Kanye fans are more annoying since they try to go out there way to bad mouth Kanye to people who just like the music like making fake reviews.
Super underground artist Kanye West man I wish someone would give him his flowers already dudes been grinding and it’s like no one is paying attention just wait for him to blow y’all prolly never heard of him
How do you think a swifty would describe Taylor?

I think you proved his point.
True. And a total nut job human being.
[deleted]
And for years he had that recognition but he's poisoned the well against himself and now people are hesitant to praise or even talk about him.
"All taylor swift does is write and play on her own songs. I bet she wishes she could sample old ozzy songs and be an antisemite"
Yeah, so does Taylor Swift. The analogy still holds.
The fuck are you on about
Wow nobody ever says that about Kanye that’s a new point
He has a few good albums and a few trash albums, that’s about it
🤓
3 good albums followed by actual unlistenable slop = genius
Fucking HOW though?  What am I missing?  Is there some write up that takes an analytical approach to his “genius”?  I’ve always thought his beats and lyrics were generic “I am very deep” sounding garbage.

I feel like his fans didn’t start calling him a “genius” until Kanye started to self proclaim himself as one.  Which shows his fans to be malleable glue eaters.
i heard charles manson was a talented song writer too.
bro what lmfao. who are your other top rappers out of curiosity. Kanye fucking sucks at rapping. yeah he has catchy songs, and 99.9% of that is the beat. personally i only like a couple of his songs, and they have lots of features. 

he can be recognized as having an influence, and being big in the music and rap industry, but by no means is that man a musical genius lol. compare him to other rappers and it’s not even close, compare him to the whole music industry and he’s at the bottom of the barrel 

maybe i’m wrong. send me some solid Kanye lyrics that aren’t goofy as hell
He’s not a musical genius dude, he made 2 or 3 good albums. K? Great.
are you saying kanye gets no recognition, are you delusional?
He isn’t a musical genius. He’s pretty creative but he isn’t anywhere on the level of other elite musicians. He produced some pretty good beats. I guess if you’re perpetually stuck in whatever pre-teen age you listened to him then yeah I could see how he’s a genius.

The irony in that comment is he has gotten an INSANE amount of recognition but it’s not enough for Kanye stans lmao
seen that lately. so many people obsessed with one man’s opinion. also seen loads of them insulting fantano, making fun of the fact that he’s bald, which is extremely ironic because the person they’re defending is also bald?
he didn’t even review the album, people just hate that he called them out
I think its really funny that they claim Fantano is an obsessed hater when I've seen more comments hating on Fantano than comments actually praising the new album.
Tbf Fantano did directly say all ye fans are either nazis, nihilistic teens, or parasocial ghouls.

/r/Kanye is understandably riled up about this because it's an uncannily accurate description of their sub
how is r/GoodAssSub cursed? I get saying that about r/Kanye, but the mod team on GAS is actually trying to be efficient about keeping the sub clean and the discussion overall could be better but it’s not that toxic (while r/Kanye is completely unmoderated for how big it is and how controversial Kanye is as a person). There's a lot of fan edits and fan art being shared and a rule against any antisemitism or racist discourse.
The production on vultures might be a 7-8/10 but the album as a whole certainly isn’t. Cringey bars on almost every song, it’s like Kanye completely forgot how to write a chorus, I don’t remember a single one that isn’t painfully corny. Ty dolla sign on a song or two is cool but a whole collab is too much. 

Also add sufjan to your list of people with diverse catalogs.
Dismissing his current art might have a lot to do with the antisemitism woven throughout the album, dude.

"Seperate the art from the artist" when the art IS the artist is just wild. You like production, ok. I love a good producer, and can even say Ye is an excellent producer. But be real and listen to the shit the man says.

His bullshit is IN his art left right and center
Don’t Swift fans dox people for criticizing her?
I’d say Nicki Minaj’s fanbase is competing for that spot too but yeah you’re right kinda
![gif](giphy|kGEmOQ88Crsu6OrVtv)
I still don't understand the problem in Taylor supporting her boyfriend. What did she do? She just came to the games to support him, simple as that. The people who find that problematic instead of Kanye openly saying he liked Hitler's actions is baffling to me. I swear, they just want to hate her for fun. The crazy thing is, football fans and Kanye fans are just as obsessed with their things as swifties. Football fans worship football, Kanye meatriders worship Kanye and swifties worship Taylor. But they always try and put swifties on top of the obsessiveness chart, which makes the football and Kanye fans seem even crazier. For example, a 76ers fan tackled a Chiefs fan just because the Chiefs fan said GG. There's a video of it on YouTube. And Kanye fans keep defending Kanye after everything he keeps doing. All I'm trying to say is that they're making problems related to Taylor out of thin air when there are problems with football fans and Kanye fans that nobody is talking about.
- not about the artists
- Taylor may not be a racist (officially) but she is like the world’s number 1 polluter atm. she is quite literally accelerating the end of the world
Maybe, but the amount of unfiltered racism coming from Swifties is also pretty bad
Bro just because we love Kanye’s music, doesn’t mean that we’re Nazis. I will admit though that some Kanye fans are crazy.
Swift fans have actually ruined lives tho. As for kanye praising hitler for 20 years, im not so sure about that cause he wouldn't openly talk about it till 2022. Idk if he wld be a closeted nazi for that long
Ye fans are top 3 worst fanbases, but Barbiez and Swifties will always be above em
Bad news for you man he’s the most trending artist on the planet right now. Will you be able to sleep tonight??
Taylor Swift fans will defend her making more carbon emissions in a week than I will in a lifetime. she’s the biggest individual polluter in the world. yall aren’t innocent either.
That’s funny because I 100% see Swifties doing both of those things
If taylor became an antisemite tomorrow, they wouldn't stop supporting her.
I used to be a big Kanye fan. Loved Graduation, MBDTF, TLOP, KSG. I had a damn KSG poster on my wall. *had*.

Vultures is mid at best, annoying and headache inducing at worst.

Donda sucked ass too. And his stans will still defend Jesus Is King which is embarrassingly bad.
the beats on back to me and stars are weak? in what world? what’s an example of a solid beat to you?
He’s a trash rapper? 😂😂 Buddy he won rap album of the year 4 times, only behind Eminem. Lemme guess now it doesn’t mean anything? Because this sub was doming Killer Mike for like a week over him winning over Utopia. You can’t pretend you objectively think his rapping on Graduation, MBDTF, or even Yeezus and TLOP is bad. Homecoming, Devil in a New Dress, New Slaves, No More Parties in LA? That’s bad rapping?
Swifties are way worse and it’s not even close bro …

Kanye fans might harass you on twitter , but T Swift fans will leak your whole life and more lmfaooo
out of touch, not saying ye fans are good but swifties are worse
did u miss the part where I was talking about their fans
LMAO the self righteousness here is crazy. 90% of hiphop is about promoting violence, crime, misogyny, racism. A lot of well known rappers are killers, rapists, abusers. But oh no Kanye single handedly is the worst thing to happen to the world.   According to your logic anyone who lived in America, a country built on genocide, racism and slavery, doesn’t have a moral compass. Relax bro, you are not a saint for buying an album. If you want to feel good about yourself that bad, then do something that’s actually helpful for the world.
so all the kids that stream xxxtentacion or king von are horrible people with bad moral compasses too?
I listen to his album because I like how it sounds. The artist is insufferable but the art is actually good.
you may be onto something. Eminem and Kanye fans are the swifties of the rap community then.
Swifty spotted
But he made that bitch faaamous
They’re all downvoting but not replying lmao
They’re just trying to be edgy and cool.
Your logic is probably why so many Kanye fans “excuse” themselves for their behavior.

“He made Graduation” has been a running joke, but it is a definite reason why people agreed to listen to Vultures and appraise his TCD-TLOP run (perhaps KSG as well) even after the antisemitism fiasco.
I am not talking about the artists themselves. I am talking about their fans.
![gif](giphy|uLy4Bo680hZxm)
You’re right about Kanye lol
this is such a L take omg
TLOP was in 2016 and Ye/KSG was in 2018. There were individual good songs on Donda too.
Taylor Swift cannot come up with late registration, but Kanye can do midnights
fatass L
They dox people for criticizing Taylor
most of the Kanye fans are stans, they just won’t admit it
I think it’s the fact she isn’t antisemitic
absolutely nothing to do with Kanye as an artist. just how his fans are like Taylor fans, blindly defending their idol at every decision and being absolutely insufferable
no. they’re on a lower level.
So your take is

Female sexuality = BAD

Kanye is a literal nazi = not even problematic
It has nothing to do with how influential Kanye is. his fans are just even more mental than he is
this is the third time u have replied to me bro calm down it’s only a post
Be that as it may, she is still the world’s top individual polluter and possibly a zionist. so she’s not innocent
if kanye had a cocaine problem his fans would all overdose on it within a week
That guy gave us billie jean you say he touched those kids?
therefore all his fans are absolved of any sins
*AND he made Graduation

/s
BRO FOR REAL

they used to say it was his worst project

now NO ONE talks about 808’s
cause that’s the one that’s got all the songs on TikTok. These newer fans are 1000% teenagers, meaning a lot of their early consumption of him would’ve been through “Flashing Lights”, “Homecoming” or “I Wonder” trending like a mf.
It basically is the standard Kanye album. Catchy beats and braggadocios lyrics too. Ironically the new generation Kanye fans like this more than 808s and heartbreaks which is more influential.
When I, an electronic music fan, like Graduation more than Kanye’s other albums, that’s when you realize that Graduation isn’t really a pure rap album and it polarizes a lot of people as a result.

Shit, it samples Daft Punk. Like… it’s not really like his other stuff. It’s an album that appeals to people who aren’t hip hop fans necessarily.
How ya know?
Do you think they know about this? I bet they have never in life heard any of his album
???
I can like the music but not the dude? And be annoyed when people can't divorce the two? Am I Nazi man 2 now?
I’d fear they’d be worse if she was the most popular lol
Yeah there's no difference between Kanyes discography and Nickis.

Kanye has a good case for GOAT rapper. Nicki ... I guess GOAT female rapper but she wouldn't make most people's top 10.
Says the mf making a reddit post about him 😭😭
They got the Fantano sub set to private at the moment from dog piling in there after Fantano called out his antisemitic behavior
I mean Kanye does because he literally is Kanye
Number one album in Israel 😢
People are listening to it because it’s extremely controversial and because it’s Kanye, who’s made great music in the past. I’m sure most people will listen to it once to see what the hype / controversy is about, realize it’s mid , then never listen to it again
*on apple music yes, dosent even crack top 50 on Spotify tho
I googled it. And only one source, Marca, some sort of online magazine claims Kanye is number one. And supposedly, kanye has a social media post himself claiming to be number 1 in 74 countries.  I honestly don't know number one where and how? He's not number one on spotify, not number one on billboard. The only metric I could find is he's number one on Apple music, according to some website called kworb. So is he number one on apple music currently in 100 countries? How do they measure that by countries, and where that is shown, is a mystery to me.
I’m a Kanye fan and I don’t support his antisemitism so that makes your opinion invalid
Okay this guy is right. Eminem fans are shit but I really don’t like Hitler.
yea but they also don't support a openly antisemitic dude or would try hunting down your address if you said something bad about their favoriet artist

all of us death grips fans are just either nerds or feral
Maybe don’t support a Nazi
Is this about fantano?? 

In that scenario I think both sides were being massively cringe but Anthony came off worse as he was a professional critic stooping to those low levels
dudes patient, humble and doesn't need outside validation, someday he'll get the recognition though
That's a different world like three summers.   
He deserves to do these numbers.     
Now he's getting gross public hummers.  
Every time he speaks it's a bummer.   
All his fans are dumb as lumber
I like Taylor too.. my daughter is a fan, and I don’t mind listening
Also true
Probably mega unpopular opinion but I really can’t take anyone seriously if they didn’t jump off the Kanye train at Slavery was a choice, but clutched perls at the anti semitism. 

I think the time to draw your line was a while ago. Of course anyone can change their mind at any point, but that will always speak more to that person than Kanye at this point.
I'd at least say 5 (6 if you include Watch the Throne).

But Yeezus and everything after have been dogshit imo.

Everything before that though, I Stan.
You can feel that way all you want. Doesn’t make it true
I feel like Kanye fans usually discuss his genius with people who don't even listen to hip-hop or rap so they can just say "you don't get it"

But I grew up on rap. Its not 1990 Kanye isn't a cutting edge producer anymore, your average dj has better more creative production than Kanye without the need to just overly sample better songs. He's always been a bad rapper but now a days he is awful, he just talks. His lyrics are all inside references to personal drama and lame free style circle one liners. So he's not a great lyricist, he's arguably an above average producer, and he's an awful rapper. I for the life of my can't place the basis for the genius claims.
Everyone dont have a great taste in music man, understandable
Huh? He had a 7 album run of hits, Wym??
im sorry but this is such a cope. I don’t like kanye as a person and his quality has definitely fallen alongside his mental health but to a lot of people including myself the TCD to KSG run is one of the greatest in music
Literally got 6 albums in Rolling Stone Magazines top 500 albums of all time, including a top 20 album.
that's just not what they said at all lol
No.. reading comprehension.. I said he deserves the recognition that he does get.. are you dense?
No man you don't get it. When bald man Fantano reviews Kanye's album, he has to remove his bias. Just like when I, YeCarti9382, do it by giving his album 7/10 because it's "just fun". 
They are also making fun of him for being divorced (shitty and juvenile) when the person they are defending just had an iconic public meltdown while being divorced just two years ago. The irony is so lost on those delusional Ye fans, it's truly impressive.
The mob mentality on those subs are wild
kanye is quite possibly the single best producer in modern music history — 
 
*before* he went insane. 
 
Afterwards? It’s all dogshit. But it’s wild to me how many people are equating fans of a rapper with extremely hateful and bigoted psychological issues with hugely dedicated fans of a pop star whose only sin is private jet usage. it’s not even in the same ballpark
Better than being Nazi’s 🤷
Especially about how being a nazi is morally and objectively repulsive.
“This man is a genius and my mind is blown. My god those two lines will shape the remainder of my depressed childhood” -some 12 year upon hearing this
>but she is like the world’s number 1 polluter atm.

\[citation needed\]

Also comparing her flying a private jet with a person spreading anti-semitism is stupid. Completely braindead comparison.
If you support Kanye you support Nazism, antisemitism, sexism, and general arrogant idiocy. If you support Taylor Swift you support one of the many ultra rich who pollute way more than they should, though she isn't encouraging polluting like Kanye is encouraging misdirected idiotic hate. I guess you could argue which is worse (though that's a weak argument imo) but they are veeeeery different.
>worlds number 1 polluter

this is the dumbest sensationalist exaggeration I have ever heard. You don't think Ye is flying private? You don't think any celebrity who is at risk of public harassment isn't flying private? You think Swift is out-polluting factories around the globe?

The whole premise of your argument is stupid and false. Bafflingly so.
What dude

Like criticize her for her carbon emissions sure, but number one? You cannot be that stupid
Yeah remember when taytay told Alex Jones he loved Hitler get the fuck out of here with this false equivalence bullshit you clown
A ton of his hardcore fans agree with his Nazi talking points. You see it all over the Internet. The Kanye sub was insane until it finally got taken over at one point (haven’t been there recently).
Yes of course but will you with all that hate in your heart?
It's annoying how many people complain about her carbon emissions, but don't talk shit about people like Darren Woods. 🙄 Like how are you going to say she's the biggest individual polluter when there's people like Wael Sawan?
How would it go for Taylor Swift if she took a regular plane trip?

She would be harrassed constantly. Its not safe for her to travel on a commercial airline.
Fr lol that’s an absolute trash take
Kanye fans defended Hitler bro
Except only one of them supports Nazism..
they have a reason to meatride him. He's the best hiphop artist
What self-righteousness? I wasn’t talking about myself at all. But also fuck any artist who uses racism as a crutch and I’ll stand by my point. And as far as your other point, ‘merica has a completely busted moral compass. Look at how we treat the homeless, sick, children, etc. for the sake of profit? Look at what we did to Japanese Americans during WW2, or the Mei Lei massacre. So that’s a stupid arguement. 

And by the way, we absolutely support this broken system because we have to. Buying food, clothes, etc. But we can choose to tell someone who uses their respect, power, and platform to spread hate and misinformation, to go duck themselves. 

Kanye isn’t the worst thing, but he sure is a shitstain from an improperly wiped asshole. Also also talking about one cushionhead rapper does not equal all of the people who ever lived in america, dummy. 

And c’mon, most rappers are not criminals and murderers, get real. And I’d say one rapper murders a few people what do you say? “Man he had some great albums but he killed those people so fuck him.” Or would you still fluff his royalties from album or merch sales?
90% of hip-hop that talks about violent crime is self-aggrandizement and making up a story to fit in with an aesthetic. Many rappers have said as much.

If rappers did nearly as much shit as they say they'd be competing with Pablo Escobar. 

Kanye stans stay lacking self-awareness
Have either of those dudes said “I looooooooooove Hitler.” on Info Wars? Have either of those dudes expressed anti-semitism and racism? Or said things like “slavery was a choice.” Kanye says all this shit *outside* of his music. That’s the difference. So it’s not just “his art” like people keep saying. It’s who he is as a person.

But! He can make people sing and dance, and nobody really cares to stand for anything and I’ve already been arguing with Kanye stans about this for months so whatever.
Us kanye fans are more like the tamer male Nicki fans, same level of devotion and support no matter what but with less doxxing
Bro trying to fuck a swiftie I’m assuming
hell nah
[deleted]
Kids See Ghosts is unlistenable garbage. There's like 2 verses on the whole thing and they're nonsense. People acting like it's incredible and visionary and experimental are huffing their own farts.
Still not endorsed by Taylor, still not as damning as anti-Semitism so
I think correct term is yes man lol as Jermaine called them lol in false prophets
She is better at hiding it, but how she talks about Alex Soros is pretty telling
Isn't that the case with every top artist, it's just kanye is dangerously  vocal about his opinions because he's mad . BUT THAT MADNESS LET HIM MAKE THE BEST MUSIC.
Yeah no comment I'm just going to let your comment and how you interpret what I'm saying speak for itself.
Wow I didn’t know you could only comment on a post one time
Because he made graduation
Crazy cuz both of those are in my top 3 of his. Bro hasn’t impressed me much since TLOP though and even since then it was one off tracks like Ghost Town or Off The Grid or Jail. Vultures was trash
That album came out in 2007, as in the formative years of a lot of millenials, not teens. You can tell because the arguments are usually higher concept than youd get from teens (something something, bush doesnt care about black people) 

And then theres me who kinda recognized that 99% of rappers are raging asshole villains (im sure other genres too, but i listen to rap) so I kinda stopped using that as a metric for liking the music a long time ago. Although there was a period where I listened to exclusively Wiz because i like him as a person
Their loss, beautiful piece of art

Dumbass

Nope, you do you. I’m just talking about the harcore fans that would support his most wild statements. Many idiots were saying that Kanye has the right to free speech so he can say antisemitic stuff and that they don’t understand why everyone is so mad about it. So yeah, I’m referring to those idiots.
Well you’ve decided that supporting an antisemitic nazi isn’t a deal breaker for you, so there’s that.
Kanye and Nikki the GOATs?  Lmao, u high or just stupid?
Who in their right mind would even list Kanye as being a top ten? Only edgelords and… well, actually that’s the only group I can think of.
Says the mf making a Reddit reply on the Reddit comment on the Reddit post about him

We all on reddit, ur only degrading urself
u have replied to me twice bro why u so mad
I can’t fathom being so obsessed with another man’s opinion like they all seem to be.
Ehhh, some of it definitely was shitposting because Fantano legit was losing his fucking mind listening to a Ye song. 




That, and he gave a dog's hit review without even listening to the album for real. 





(I should add, im not a defender of Kanye or his fans but I do listen to his music. I don't like him and Fantano was right for calling out Ye's bs, but he should have atleast listened to 3 songs off of the album. When someone does something like that, they just go to the level of the person they are disagreeing with.)
Kanye likes to act like he’s the absolute best, a genius, and a good Christian. he’s none of those things.

he actually was able to say those things a few years ago because he was one of the best, he was a musical genius and to a degree, he was a decent Christian
💀

Aint no motherfucking way 😂😂😂
Makes sense Israel infamously has shitty ethics
zionists and nazis shake hands what can i say
This kills me


I'm not going to verify this further, I just choose to believe this.
Whatever helps you sleep at night buddy
because they only count albums released up til midnight friday. vultures came after
Aas he said. You r t at the very least willing to ignore Kanyes love for Hitler. U prove his point
I think you may be the exact type of person bro was talking about tbh lmfao
Rappers have supported alot of negative things in hip hop though so why stop there? It makes it looks like you pick and choose what to cancel.

How come nobody canceled Amy Schumer when she went on all those rants on social media?
No not both sides. Fantano is a culture vulture and a lame, but watching how he reviewed Kanye album just shows you what kind of culture vulture lames in hip hop spaces. PitchFork also.
“I can’t believe Kanye’s a Nazi now.”

*[Looks back at Kanye wearing a “White Lives Matter” shirt, hanging out with Candace Owens, and having his own rich people church]*

I can.
I see what you mean. I feel like he wiped his black fans after the slavery was a choice thing and you could sense how much whiter his fan base was. Then the anti semitism pushed away a lot of his white fans, especially ones in more upper middle class communities where anti semitism is more sensitive. Wouldn’t be surprised if his fan base demographically leaned towards the people he hasn’t upset yet: lower middle class white people and Asian minorities (notice how popular Yeezys are with Asians, I feel like I see them wear them more than any other race). This still leaves a large vocal minority. Combined with how both demographics lean conservative socially, I can see the correlation. Sorry if generalizing, this is pure speculation.
Eh, very different in my opinion. The ‘slavery is a choice “ seemed like a really bad metaphor in the moment, and truthfully, tossing someone to the side for one ignorant comment when they’ve been an advocate for the black community their entire career feels a bit unfair to me. But after his antisemitism, maybe I was just giving him the benefit of the doubt. Hindsight is 20/20.
That sentence is grammatically as bad as most of his work. Just shows us his fan base is just a bunch of dumbasses that don’t understand great music. It’s very understandable man do not even worry about it.
No he didn’t.
lol in music in general? That’s absolutely insane to say let alone think dude. Best of luck with your own mental health issues.

This is exactly why no one takes Kanye fans serious. You’re always saying shit like this.
No the thing is fantano attacked Kanye's wife so the fanbase retaliated
The ultimate hate towards him is because he’s a sellout. Man used to praise Kanye and then completely switched up because of the controversies. It’s one thing if he actually criticizes the music, but he’s been on rants saying complete nonsense about the album purely based on his political opinions. As a music reviewer/critic your job is to separate the art from the artist. For an artist with as big of a fan base as Kanye you’re literally asking for a backlash. Which tbh I think is his plan, he wants the attention he’s been getting from this.
I’m actually a mod on GoodAssSub and we try to keep the community as clean as possible while still trying to keep it fun and engaging for fans of the artist (there’s a lot of producers looking for a community based around Ye's production methods and we're also trying to push that type of creative content on the sub so it’s not all about meatriding the artist) . It can give the impression of “mob” since it's a pretty passionate fanbase but I've seen worse honestly
I feel the discussion is more about the fans than the artist. Taylor fans dox, send death threats, and other insane shit if you even say you dislike her music personally. There are some shitty Kanye fans, and no doubt that Kanye is a worse person at the moment, but his fans don’t seem as bad, at least not vocally. 

Also, Kanye has certainly lost a few steps lyrically, and can put out some half-baked beats, but his production is still as good as ever for the most part.
Supporting Kanye’s music does not make you a nazi
Oh boo!!! Go make sense somewhere else! /s
my guy she rides jets to take trips that you could walk. the writing’s on the wall
very different indeed, but Taylor’s hardly in the clear. her silence on the situation in Gaza is telling too.
She literally is the biggest individual polluter in the world.
I feel the discussion is more about the fans than the artists. Taylor fans are some of the most hateful, racist people I’ve seen. I’m sure Kanye fans aren’t great as a whole, and supporting someone like Kanye isn’t a great look, but his fans arent verbally abusing people to the same extent, to my knowledge. Kanye is worse than Taylor. Taylor fans are worse than Kanye fans. Some people choose to separate the art from the artist.
Those people aren’t even real fans though. They’re just some antisemitic assholes who agreed with Kanye’s words during late 2022.
Just because we like someone's music and fashion doesn't mean we agree with their real life political opinions or have hatred in our hearts dumbass
Because these people don’t show up in our daily media. Anyone would have a problem with them if it was being reported nationally to the levels Taylor swift was. Instead of shit talking, why not educate people on them? Also, people can have a problem with Taylor and oil executives. I don’t like the idea of anyone owning a private jet. Those who tend to own a private jet, use it and loan it to others a lot. They’re inefficient and a symbol that the rich play by different rules
I couldn’t give 2 fucks frankly. she’d be alright. but it’s the fact she takes flights for trips that could be walked. That’s fucked up
Just compromise and they say they’re all bad.
What does this have to do with the music? You are just as annoying as a Taylor Swift fan going out your way to attack Kanye fans and just bad mouth him just because of his comments. With all the negative stuff in hip hop and it's music yet Kanye is the biggest problem?

Bruh get over it. Kanye has the number 1 selling album in the world  and his clothes sell out and people still listen. The truth hurts Kanye has more fans than the people who hate him and run around bad mouthing him with fake reviews. You people look like losers at this point.

Not even defending what Kanye said i just don't care like i didn't care about all the drug sellings, killings in hip hop, negative images of women. It funny Kanye is the problem, but the Grammy awards don't have a problem with Dr.Dre history of domestic abuse and neither did the superbowl yet Kanye needs to be canceled for his opinions
debatable. also a Nazi apologist.
All that yip yap just to morally grand stand. Well done
king von has committed multiple murders and xxxtentacion beat and abused his girlfriend and possibly other women. id say those are extremely worse than what kanye has said during a manic episode. not downplaying what he’s said obviously those are abhorrent things
Go check the Kanye sub and see if that sentence holds up
he’s alright. but his fans defending the Nazi-ism and anti-semitism, as well as all of his other deranged outbursts makes them more insufferable than swifties.

hell, even them pretending to enjoy vultures makes them look insufferable
The debate is around which fanbase is worse, not which artist is a worse person
because you have nothing to say. This is a shitty cop out of a comment.
But why did he make graduation?
You can’t tell me you didn’t like a single song off vultures
yeah that’s true too. I guess that since I’ve been in my twenties, I don’t really understand the hivemind that’s kinda infiltrated the fanbase in the last couple years which has made me be extremely hesitant to listen to the music or even get into topics like this
I’m sure you listen to murderers drug dealers and woman beaters though
Antisemite =/= Nazi
mid dumbass answer
[removed]
yeah that shit was wild to me.  as annoying as swift fans are, they aren't excusing nazi talking points like kanye's hardcore fans have
I remember being raised that it was mature and woke to separate artist from art. Did it flip?
Neither of them are remotely close to the goat convo lol
This is just false. Ye's first 6 or 7 albums are classics, it's pretty dumb to dismiss him as the massively talented and influential musician he is. He's just also a terrible person. That doesn't mean that everyone who recognises him for his art are doing it because of his recent antics.

(This is also assuming we're talking about GOAT rap artists, not just GOATs at actually spitting. In which case Ye isn't close.)
Again, this is all coming from the dude who spent his time making a reddit post about someone who’d doesn’t know he exists. Take it with a grain of salt
It's pretty pathetic. Imagine being a cuck boi for a Nazi
> Jesus exposes our desire to condemn others without examining our own hearts before the Lord. When we look for flaws in others without bothering to search for our own wrongdoings, we are exhibiting pride. Jesus warns us against such hypocrisy. We are being measured, not by others, but by God.

Always was confused by the whole "good Christian" thing, kinda ironic
He is definitively one of the hip-hop greats. However, genius is a big word and reserved for the very best of humanity, IMO.

Mozart, Beethoven, Einstein. I doubt Kanye is the same league of them.
I’m not a Kanye fan but “good Christian” is subjective js
Okay so he was a genius but now he’s not ? Make it make sense , you contradicting yourself now
You didn’t have to say Nazi twice.
Keep listening to this mid album then idc
For sure. They don’t seem to have a problem with supporting a Nazi. It’s not so much annoying as fucked
everybody picks and chooses who to “cancel”. if they won’t draw the line at other people but will at anti-semitism, that’s up to them. there’s only so much you can be aware of at once, you might as well do the right thing when you’re aware of it
Kanye *is* a Nazi. Kanye fans all support a Nazi.
I mostly mean all the wife jokes being thrown at him those were just for no real reason
It's so strange how more people don't take your 24/7 shrieks of "NAZI" more seriously

I mean he's literally Hitler! What could be more serious than that?
Pretty sure Kanye is despised for more than just one really bad metaphor
Everyone's not a native speaker of English and this proves he's globally worshipped artist not just among suburban teen kids
Yezzir
The College Dropout, Late Registration, Graduation, 808s & Heartbreak, Watch The Throne, Yeezus, MBDTF, The Life Of Pablo, Ye, Kids See Ghosts are all classics. Albums like Donda & Vultures are not on that level but are still great. His only misses are Jesus Is King & Donda 2
i just don’t think you’re able to comprehend people having other opinions than you. To anyone who listens to hiphop and for a lot of the wider music community it’s not even a hot take in the slightest
As he should, Kanye’s fan base is horrendous
I can’t believe his opinion of an artist changed after they praised Hitler!
Don’t get me wrong, y’all are great 👍. Keep up the good work. Some of the fan base is just toxic
People seriously forgot how to separate art from an artist
Her silence on Gaza means absolutely nothing to anyone besides terminally online teenagers who scroll tiktok and Reddit 14 hours a day.
No, she is the celebrity with the biggest carbon foot print caused by planes in pop media articles, among a group of celebrities chosen by the editor. She’s not even close to the highest polluting individual.

Just one of Bezos’s yachts produces as much CO2 as Swift’s plane usage alone. That does not include his multiple private jets, or personal decisions that have directly impacted the environment. In fact, pretty much anyone with a yacht is going to be significantly worse than any non-yacht owning celebrity. She’s definitely in the billionaire class that is a massively contributing problem, but the notion that she’s the worst is 100% a media driven narrative.

Like criticize her carbon waste, sure, but at least be accurate.
Cool anecdotes bro they are worthless.

You think the followers of a dude who loves Hitler are more racist than the most milquetoast pop singer ever imagined, you are an idiot
Kanye has been talking about Hitler for over 20 years and they are his fans. This doesn’t mean every fan is like that, but the crazy extreme ones (which this post is referencing) are more toward the Nazi side.
I wasn’t originally referring to you but I am now. Are you so small and insecure that you need to call someone a dumbass because they accurately describe an artist based on what that person has publicly said? You are defending Ye a lot for someone who says they don’t agree with his opinions
You can only educate those who want to listen. No matter what I said, the OP was going to act like Kayne fans are equal to Taylor fans. Didn't feel the need to explain that media will misdirect people to be angry at pop stars instead of the real people pulling the strings of power. It's great you don't like people who own private jets. Hopeful you're doing something about wealth inequality and climate change! 

Besides, this Taylor fan hate has to do with the fact that these are men who don't like women, especially successful, powerful women.
i love how the 2 options are “hitler bro” and “leaking personal information” on deciding worse fanbase
Ain’t no way bro actually goes “this dude has killed somebody, let’s not listen to him 🤓” 

😭😭😭
I'm on there 😭, there is no doxxing
Well, the answer in both cases is Kanye and Kanye's so it's pedantic.
Because being late to registration made him drop out.
Because he’s him
As collateral for this very moment
I didn’t like a single song off Vultures. Freddie Gibbs verse was cool on one song but as a full song it wasn’t good and couldn’t hold a candle to his previous releases
I think its the same loyalty you see from J. Cole/Kendrick fans. Yknow they make listening to this "genius" part of their identity, something that makes them better than other people, so they gotta defend it at every step. Except j. Cole/kendrick arent out there making asses of themselves so they dont have to cope as hard
you are just jumping all over the place. something hurt you child?
He's a nazi.
yhydih?
[deleted]
Nope. It always excluded *living* artists that are actively assholes. There's no reasoning for supporting that. 

When you appreciate a dead artist, wether or not they were an asshole, you don't enable their immoral acts, whereas in the case of Kanye, you do. 

Got it?
I mean, I can’t tell you what to do so use your judgement, but I’ve never heard a song so good that I was willing to support a nazi sympathizer to listen to it. It’s not like listening to artists regardless of their views is some sort of virtue. 

There’s an infinite amount of art out there, maybe branch out instead of supporting highly visibly shitty ones and continuing to extend their reach.
Stupidest shit ever said. GOAT Rappers? Not Kanye or Nicki?? Be serious
and here’s weluvbibby, on the front lines defending and flexing the success of a man who also doesn’t know who he is 😂
Sorry, didn't mean to speak ill of the antisemite, our bad
I’m sure when they hit the age of 16 maybe they’ll mature
When you think about his catalog… he kind of is 😭 bro dropped 7 classics in a row
im not a Christian but I do know that praising Hitler, hating Jews and making your wife’s bare ass the subject of your album cover amongst other things is definitely not in the Christ agenda.
his music used to be that of a musical genius yes. it just sucks now, he’s fell off
I will. Keep missing out on great music 😊
Do you know how many rappers are literal murderers that people still actively support
How many people has he killed?
I hated  were the discourse went but he was also kinda of unnecessarily disrespectful to Kanye’s wife
because they can’t actually criticize him for anything substantial
Sure, but that’s what they were discussing.
Worshipping an antisemitic douchebag that has a couple good records is pretty fucked up. That being said I guess some people think being a Nazi is cool. “I love Hitler” -Kanye 
Right??
ALL THAT SHIT IS TRASH
It’s a pretty hot take to say his run is one of the greatest in music. Rap aside I could name a lot of artists with better runs and more talent than him. You’re just hell bent on worshipping Kanye. Good luck with that psycho shit. His music is decent but it’s not as good as you Stan’s make it out to be.
He should slander Ye's wife? I'm confused now lol
 what was he doing bringing other people in their fights
Opinion of ARTIST. Not the album.
it's cool dude I totally get where you're coming from ❤️
Her silence on Gaza means the world actually, she has the influence, so much so that she could actually sway the US government to make a decision.
Your reply to me was completely irrelevant to my point. We’re talking about the fans, not the artists themselves
That has been proven false. The only time he’s actually done that was in 2022. Also his fans don’t have to follow everything he does. For instance, just because someone is a Playboi Carti fan, doesn’t make them a woman beater.
I never defended anything he publicly said outside the music and never will. You can't erase 20 years worth of positive artistic legacy with one big bad moment he had in his career. That's why he went #1 in over 100 countries even with all controversies. Hope that clarifies why he has all the support from his fans that he does.
Nobody is defending Kanye’s views. We just want the music and shoes man
Nooooo, we just don't like capitalist douche bags who overuse their private jets
The point is that nobody bats an eye when it comes to listening to murderers, but for Kanye the line is drawn
Actually I do, it’s not that hard to stand up for something.
Ya just anti-semitism everywhere
Not even burn, do it, stars, talking(once again), fuk sumn, carnival, or beg forgiveness?
except he's not and filmed a 40nminute apology which is better than what 99% of public figures do after even raping or killing people.
“Got it?”

Fucking arrogant. Dude was just asking.
I mean Kanye is just the JK Rowling of Rap I guess?
Buddy says I’m mad but starts calling me by my Reddit username 🫤 get a job
Yes im spreading positivity you’re spreading hate , what are you really doing for the world ?
All of these things are 100% part of the Christ agenda
So basically you’re saying he’s a genius but the music doesn’t hit for you as much anymore. Simple
I’ve listened to it, I’m not missing out on anything. Keep listening to only mainstream rap tho lil bro
...
True but I feel that the way to deal with that isn’t just constantly saying lol your wife left

There were valid reasons to be mad at melon such as his whole not reviewing stand point despite basically reviewing it already showing blatant hypocrisy but yk actually make it about that instead of jokes about bros wife leaving that ain’t cool 

I think a majority of people in the situation on either side are being mad cringe
They absolutely could’ve criticised him for some of his behaviour towards vultures but chose not to 

Anthony was literally insulting people for liking certain things about it and also said he wasn’t gonna review it despite giving constant opinions on it basically reviewing it

But nope fat jokes (which then got turned around on Kanye by Anthony)and wife jokes
He never said that moreover are we still associating music with what the artist's ideologies are?
You seem like you only found out about Kanye last year
Of all the bad things to be in this world, that’s the one I care the least about due to reasons I wont elaborate here on, to be honest. You white, probably would never understand anyway.
Nobody is perfect, dude obviously has some issues he needs to address.

Regardless, he is unironically and unequivocally the most influential musical genius of the last century; nobody comes even close.

You are just semi-understandably offended, get over it.
Calling mbdtf trash is crazy
Name the artists. You wouldn’t be saying all this if it weren’t for what he said don’t let your bias cloud your judgement 😂😂
I don’t really buy that Kanye fans are actually offended by that. You stan someone who reaches new lows every time he opens his mouth but suddenly *that* comment from Fantano is upsetting and shocking and mean?
I would be willing to bet that a solid 90% of the people fanatically defending Vultures on here based their opinion of the album on their opinion of Kanye too
That is absolutely fucking ridiculous to think that. Not everyone has to have an opinion on everything. If you genuinely think a pop star could influence the United States government into changing its stance on Gaza you are absolutely insane. That is beyond terminally online it’s not even funny.
Nuance and reading comprehension aren’t that dude’s strongsuits
it means they’re fine with woman beating on an ideological level. You are fine with nazism on an ideological level. Admit it or stfu.
Much more than one bad moment, he’s had years of hateful commentary and aligning with despicable and destructive groups and individuals. His brand represents that more than anything else at this point.
THE MUSIC IS ABOUT HIS VIEWS

how are you people this dense
I know I was making fun of the person above you since they said apparently people don’t listen to an artist if they killed people. Which is the farthest thing from truth. People don’t give a shit.
Burn is the only great one out of those imo
Nope. They were boring and dissapointing for Kanye songs. Granted this album wasn’t Revival bad but it was just mid and not enjoyable to me
He is a Nazi. When asked if he’s a Nazi, he says “I am a Nazi”
He hasn’t released it yet
He's a nazi
No he’s not just asking lmao it was very clearly a backhanded statement
"Dude" is just a guy supporting a nazi because "Lol woke culture says separate art from artist"

Quite literally not "just asking".
How else is he supposed to address you? Did you give him your name? 

Yeesh.
[removed]
… you think that commenting “Says the mf making a reddit post about him 😭😭” is spreading positivity? lmao
sharing my opinion that his fans are mental, and im speaking to exhibit A
no im saying he’s fell off lol he lost his touch
You can listen to both mainstream and underground, we live in the era of unlimited access to music. And thinking that Kanye is just another “mainstream” artist tells me you don’t know anything about his music.
I mean yes he did say exactly that. 

Here is the link https://youtu.be/rvItSE8y9LE?si=e32_YNN8xxGIQaIP

And yes when the artist hates an entire group of people I think it’s important to not support that. You know how many Jews Hitler killed right? This guy supports that and you’re cool with it.
I didn’t say it was one bad comment. I will say again: we just want the music and shoes
Because we are open minded enough to not let some of those views affect our own perception of reality and enjoyment of music.
It’s not tho. Any references about antisemitism in his new album are tongue-and-cheek comments/jokes about his cancellation broadly
Mb, but it’s very ironic that Kanye is the focal point of the moral grandstanding. Kanye’s antisemitism was REALLY bad, and it’s interesting fans if his are held to a uniquely high moral standard but fans of murderers and women abusers are somehow going unnoticed
Respectable but I don’t get how you didn’t enjoy burn or do it. The beats are too infectious for me to at least not headbop
because I take everything a person says during a mental health episode as a permanent reflection of their true self

you are reductive and disingenuous
Looking at his other comments, I am seeing that now. I feel foolish.
Why would he address me formally on reddit  😂you mus be 40+
Wow dude you really got me there! Shit it’s almost like every 15 year old comments that , very original
Why share a hateful opinion though , what good does that do? And now you’re calling someone mental. What if I really was mental? Bros just full of hate no wonder he made this post , you should meditate or try to figure out what happened to you when you were a child
The music doesn’t appeal to you maybe but #1 in 80+ countries says the opposite, numbers don’t lie
This album is 100% just another mainstream rap album, his albums before Donda were not, and some of the are some of the best rap albums of all time. I'm just assuming you only listen to mainstream rap because you're calling this boring ass album "great". And I don't see how anyone who's listened to his whole discog can't realize how lackluster this album is compared to his good albums.
Lol and now this dude is sending me the old “get yourself some help” lmao you’re just mad that Kanye is literally an antisemitic little bitch and you “worship” him. Yikes!
You shouldn’t be open minded to nazism bro
There’s lots of bad songs out there with good beats. There were some enjoyable beats on the project but what Kanye did with those beats wasn’t it (for me)
bro doesn’t get a write off because he’s bipolar. actions have consequences, he’s not coming back from this.
TIL using someone's name is "formal."

Truly a travesty to your intellect and education.
nothing I said was hateful. I merely stated my opinion on his fanbase. im not the one defending a Nazi apologist anti semite
nothing I said was hateful. I merely stated my opinion on his fanbase. im not the one defending a Nazi apologist anti semite
Not what I said.
Kendrick's "Euphoria" is the perfect diss response.
I commend Drake for "Push Ups" don't get me wrong but Euphoria absolutely fries Drake on every level imo. If you haven't listened to the track you need to go check is asap. Hip-Hop fans are eating these last couple of weeks bro.
It already has 6.7 mil views and 680k likes ,it really blew up
I agree Kendrick was totally on a different level. Easy 10-8 round for Kendrick over Drake. The response should be fun.
Funny every drake eater is just saying “He only said….” and lists 1 of the 100 things he said. The issue is you were too dumb to catch the rest.

Push ups was sick but it doesn’t compare to this.
This is like Bacon vs Canadian Bacon.
Drake commented on the diss by posting the "10 things I hate about you" poetry scene on his IG. I'm sorry but ain't no way this boy ain't pressed, you ain't fooling Noone bro.

People saying this mid af, I'm tryna see where you coming from but I can't see it. I can see if you think he should've went harder but saying this bad make me think you a Drake Stan or just genuinely bring dishonest cause this shit hit harder then Push ups no lie

EDIT: Sexy Redd heard the diss and about to write a diss on Kendrick... I wish I was making this up
Drake is easy to roast for so many reasons. It’s not surprising that when a legitimately good rapper like Pusha T or Kendrick goes after him, he gets ripped to shreds
such a good song
I don’t think people noticed some of the other stuff Kendrick said throughout the track. Like the reference to the Drake sexual assault case.
I just love how the past few days all these folks been talking about how long it's taken Kendrick, if his response will even hit or mean anything lol yall just need to sit back and wait for greatness to happen because that's what happened yesterday and it's on Kendrick's time, not yall time so anyone who thought he wouldn't respond or that it wouldn't be great needs to apologize to Kendrick lol go on IG now and shout that apology out.
Why does Drake keep getting into diss battle’s lol. Dude gets cooked every time.
That line about sexy redd
Hey there everyone. Forgive my ignorance, but what exactly is going on with this whole rap beef? J.Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Drake. I’m confused and very lost and I would like to be up to date on what’s going on. 

Thanks
Okay I'm biased and maybe just dumb but was push ups good? I hated it, sounded corny and lame. But I listened to Euphoria like 9 times already, it's fantastic. The first 5 times was to hear all the different things Kendrick said. The last 4 because it's a good ass tune.

Can someone make a defense for push-ups?
Kendrick is just so smart with the way he shoots his shots. “I don’t want to hear you say n***a no moooooore” is almost a 100% chance Drake responds back to it with something that doesn’t go over well. 

KDot wins the round by a 10-7…I think Drake is cooked and his ghostwriters are probably working overtime trying to think of a clever response. Probably just gonna be something lame though knowing Aubrey. 

Yikes…Kendrick just done put Drake on the back foot.
I was like nah k dot gonna go ghost then when he responded I was like okay he went in was not expecting that at all
Push up beat was mid but maybe that’s just drake. Last song I had on repeat was passion fruit. Beat carried that
Bro if you go to Spotify on each song and click on song credits under Kendrick's it says performed by Kendrick and written by Kendrick. If you look at Drake's bro using his writers smh haha that says a lot tbh. Kendrick for da Win
Everybody has had ghostwriters at a point in time, and alot of the top guys ghostwrite for some of your other favorite artists. People have to gain more knowledge of how the music business works. Years ago, I've literally laid my eyes on a giant book with listing for ALL of your favorite rappers, and they all had listing for song types they were looking to have written. The boy Drake got talent. He had to get in the door. He was just marketable. His Diss was pretty good. Kendrick had a good response, but in my opinion, left a bit of meat on the bone (Pause). But it definitely was a good diss by Kendrick. Drake on the clock now.
I feel like by making it 6.5 minutes, he’s kinda going at J Cole and his Seven Minute Drill song that wasn’t even half that long
Who wrote it for him?
I listened to it, was there a part where he calls out drake for being weird around children? I couldn’t spot it
Per usual Kendrick delivered a classic, literally. He gave us a six minute operetta saying why Drake is shit for the culture. The beat changes are each act. I just hope Drake makes this an intermission and not the full act.
Kendrick is playing this so well: drop a 30 second diss feature that gets the whole world talking (without Kendrick saying much). Gas Drake up into “responding” with a full track, and then he could take his time. Somehow simultaneously ignited the beef and forced Drake to really take the first swing. 

The main takeaway I got is that Kendrick wants from Drake what he’s gotten from every other artist that has challenged him before, like Macklemore at the Grammies, and Cole after the diss: respect and submission. He told Drake in a couple different ways to stay in the dance/pop genre, and stay out of rap. If Drake does what Kendrick told him to do there is no question Kendrick has the greatest aura of any artist
People finding out Drake is a shit rapper and Kendrick is a good one lmao
I just wish Kendrick would stop mentioning icons like Michael Jackson and Ali in order to diss Drake. Both are monumental to black culture and Ali to black americans in general.
There's absolutely no problem leveraging existing disses. My problem is that many of the ideas that "cooked" Drake are things that have not only been delivered, but delivered in a less impactful way.

  
EDIT: 

I will finish list out more examples later, but here are the points:

# Not Being Black Enough:

  
**Pusha T**:

>Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough

>Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough

– [The Story of Adidon](https://genius.com/Pusha-t-the-story-of-adidon-lyrics)

**Kendrick:**

>How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?

>I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
Drake got No Vaseline'd.  There's no coming back.
I know this is a win win for both of them because of publicity, spectacle, etc. but damn you couldn’t pay me to start shit with Kendrick, that clever mf will put you in the ground and win a Pulitzer in the process. Lmao
Not enough people are talking about how disrespectful it was of drake to use tupacs voice as AI
What's that Daft Punk line about... I feel like that flew over my head
Is it just me or did we enter 1990s level beef this year?  This records been on repeat since it dropped and I think drakes is commercially better put together and the details in the words are layered like damn if you caught that line it’s crazy. I feel Kendrick’s is straight to the neck. No bs no crazy deep diving needed just straight blunt forced trauma to the head on drizzy this is getting good <pops another bag of popcorn>
Ngl if we being objective.

Euphoria is just a super good fucking song as a diss.

Kinda like back to back.
I think Kendrick back to backed Drake.

Also, i personally believe this is the start of round 2.

Kendrick wasn't saying anything new, but he says it really cleverly, i really hate this angle of "i have a nuke bro x3" like Bro Drake obviously wants to go there.

Everything Kendrick said
Pusha T already said.
Ross already said.
But its really good tho.

8/10 diss 

I think Drake can take back the lead.
Ya, I think it’d easily best modern diss ever.
We know Reddit loves and adores Kendrick and anybody that takes a shot at Drake. Not a great place for discourse, it’s just a massive circlejerk lol
It was decent. Every major thing he touched on was already said on Story of Adidon. Push touched on his soul, his contract split, absent father, his blackness, and more. 

Very good diss but Kendrick didn’t do much but this battle is far from over on both sides.
Yeah this is the next "No Vaseline" lol.
It reminds me of the kind of scathing levels of Nas’ Ether tbh
am i the only one not feeling kendricks diss. no passion, and weird delivery for a diss track. dissing poetically is not a thing. was really only one verse i got what i expected.  i have to say push ups hit harder imo
Agreed. But I think pushups is more appealing to the ears, more vibe to it. I definitely would rather listen to pushups than Euphoria, that could just be me tho.
Yeah, Kendrick is superior, and he won. Enough said.
His bars were insane but the delivery for some of it just wasn't it. He got to stop the whiny shit that he be doing other than that yeah it was crazy
Energy doesn't always make up for punchlines on diss records, I didn't find it compelling like I did story of addion
Let's wait a few days for the hype to die down before we jump to conclusions
I hate the structure of it. Almost as meandering as the Game diss against Em.
It has bars, its cool. But how can you fry somebody by repeating exactly what two dudes before you said? Why does he get props for that?
The fact that the typical take I see is something like "It gets better with every listen" shows how low the bar is for lyricism in mainstream hip hop these days.

This isn't a diss against Kendrick as much as it is against the general listening population that seems to be discovering the idea that finding new meaning in subsequent listens to a rap lyric is something novel.
i knew no matter what kendrick did everyone would say its great. it was shit. why is it ok to tell drake hes not black enough, he cant say n\*\*\*\*, you arent one of us. like what kind of fking racist shit is this, because his mom is white? i wish people would just wake up and say dam that was nowhere near the level i was expecting, what a dissapointment.

I love watching this beef and checking in on it - then I read the comments and realize that music fans music be stupid as fuck with all these john madden play by play breakdowns of the game and artist intentions. Just stfu and be a fan, not some active participant in some drama that you want to involve yourself in. Wait - god damn it.
Light pack
To defend drake push ups was respond to a lot of different people he didn’t only focus on Kendrick, his next track will say a lot
Crazy that diss tracks are just an accepted thing, they feel like middle schoolers passive aggressively arguing over social media. If people genuinely have an issue with each other, just talk to each other. Otherwise, it's just a fake unnecessary feud for views
I would say its a direct response. Kendrick seemed he wanted to make sure Drake got his message and he did
The song was ass. But lyrics were good
I saw someone say it's two grown men writing poems about each other and.. lol
Haters got Kendrick wrong.
This comments section is a cesspit of pseudo-intellectual pretentious “fans”. I know it’s cool to be extremely one way or the other in this world but I find this “team K dot” “team Drake” shit so corny.

They’re both releasing great disses. I’m just enjoying the beef from both sides
It was good but don’t let your drake hate get you speaking hyperbolic
I saw a poll on complex music's page on IG where Drake's push up won as the better diss track and I was like, "what's going on?"
Drake got absolutely cooked for 6 whole minutes and his fans really have the audacity to call it mid. Kendrick simply has the better pen.
Are drake's comments always limited on his ig? If not, they are now lol
[removed]
Drake stans: 
“SOMEBODY PHOTOSHOP YOUNG DRAKE WITH SOME FUBU ON QUICK! We can still salvage what’s left of him from this MASSIVE L !!!”
THANK YOUUU. everybody hating.
PushaT snatched Drake's soul. Kendrick is simply coming in with the fatality.
As crazy as you all think the diss was, it is very evident that Kendrick held back in case he really needed to go in later. That diss was a beat down and not a murder. That is still to come.
Euphoria is lame af honestly. Drake had like 4 people to respond to in his diss, hes sparring the league of unextraordinary gentleman. Just wait until kendrick gets a singular response. "[Your last one bricked, you really not on shit](https://genius.com/31429844/Drake-push-ups/Your-last-one-bricked-you-really-not-on-shit-they-make-excuses-for-you-cause-they-hate-to-see-me-lit)"
[removed]
It was too casual I thought k.dot was going to push the button on this one ! Mediocre if anything smh
The dic...drake glazers won't admit it was a very harsh and cold response cause they only used to catchy hooks,beats and ghost writers
I disagree. I can’t help but compare every diss track to Ether and/ or Hit Em Up. I am old though lol.
Push-Ups has 3 individuals credited for the composition and lyrics. 

Euphoria has only 1 lol
2-0 kendrick 😎
You know this cut deep cuz drake stans are like "nah it ain't shit" while crying under their blankets covering they ears.
[removed]
The more I listen to it, the more I think Drake should just accept defeat. He can’t win.
This is my fave the whole time

![gif](giphy|5i7umUqAOYYEw)

I think he might have gotten ja ruled.
Did Eminem just take over the comments
i absolutely loved it. I want more tbh
It’s top shelf quality, line for line, he did Drake dirty. And there’s more truths to come out if Drake foolishly responds which come on it’s Drake. Lol he will respond. I can’t fucking wait!
[removed]
[removed]
Yeah if people think it isn’t the best diss track ever go through the references on genius for the next hour (yes there’s that much to it) and see how deep it really is. No one is doing what Kendrick is doing. He made a diss track that doubles as an instant classic.
Kendrick won with this track.
Drake should take the L, and be done with it. 

Kendrick called him out, but by no means hit him as hard as he can. Kendrick is pulling punches and Drake would be stupid to not understand that. 

It was fun, but this ain’t a fight; it’s a grown man slapping some sense into a boy is all.

Take the hit, and learn homie.
I just know J.cole is thinking that he made the right decision to drop out
I just heard both. Push up was incredible and then I heard euphoria!!!!!! Oh bookoooo! Damn he bodied Drake…. So can tell me how it started
Bruh this is fake beef. No Vaseline is the perfect diss track
I fell like the first verse was the Pulitzer Prize winner giving the culture a reset and reminding everyone why there is such chaos in rap right now. He’s calming us down, calming the talk down. We as an audience have been screaming for a response and arguing who’s better. The beat in the first verse being so calm and melodic was prob meant to symbolize Kendrick slowing it down and spelling it out. Then with each verse he proceeded to rile the audience back up again. 

He was controlling the listener like a Conductor at a symphony.
[removed]
Kendricks diss has no replay value at all.
I don’t even believe any of this drama is real. They’re all rich celebrities with fake personalities that are only doing it to make more money. Who is really going to write an entire song to try to make fun of someone? That’s some like elementary school shit
Lil Boof really won in this battle out of Kendrick, Drake, J Cole, and C Breezy.
Mannn Kendrick’s diss was so good I had to listen to it in between Nas Ether and Tupac’s Hit Em Up and man…he fucking fried Drake. Real lyrics, mentioned stuff the masses see and things we haven’t. The last beef that Drake was in made him reveal his son…I want him to respond so Kendrick can COOK AGAIN!!
As a fan of other artists and not familiar with either I've been enjoying the breakdowns from some YouTubers. I love that hip hop is back to being a competitive sport. I didn't like the direction that it's been gone the last few years with  artists in the mainstream.
Is this dudes real voice or is this more ai stuff? Never heard Kendrick before.
Man, indie battle rap spoiled me with witty puns and creative punchlines that I get upset when mainstream dudes don't have em in disses, hah
Unpopular opinion this is the worst beef in the history of the genre and it's just a sign things are failing and the money is drying up. They're not even beefing for a real reason
  Pp
But it ain't fun to listen too. Drake 6 Kendrick 3. this beef is weak. Kendrick recycled Ludacris lyrics
Kendrick's "Euphoria" is the perfect piece of trash.

Don't even like drake but this this is ASS
No beef will ever match LL Cool J and Kool Moe Dee
That's the Perfect diss? Taking lines from past disses and talking about shit pre-2020, while at the same time making the Push Ups(Demo leak) outro true.

"You had a song for four years, drop that shit and shut your mouth."

Also a bunch of other lines/verses are just reused from Rick Ross' shitty diss.

Push Ups went line by line on Like That. The Kendrick diss was Taylor Made Freestyle and I didn't hear anything on Euphoria that went line by line on it.
🥱
Lookup control featuring KendrickLamar
Someone needs to call Drake out for having Xxxtentacion killed
It might fry him but it does not hit or leave an impression
The beat was mid at best and the rap sounded rushed.  Euphoria wasn’t very good. I’d put it one the same level as Drake’s Charged Up years ago.
It dont fry anything, he wanted a match but afraid to swing first, cornball
Kendrick is still dog water tho
Eh. I’m really being unbiased af here. Kendrick had some great bars but he had already said a lot of things pusha and Ross said. It doesn’t hit as hard hearing accusations about a person the 2nd, 3rd or fourth time. Low key disappointed because I expect so much more from Kendrick.
The diss is average at best I was expecting a bit better
Kendrick said Aubrey eat his potato salad with raisins.
I listened to this shit 6 times, this was the best one so far.
I’m looking for that “Control” Kendrick…has to be a warm up….
These grown men are beefing like hs girl. Super lame. Yawn
Kendrick has been swinging down... this whole beef is stupid af
Mfs are glazing kendrick so bad bro
That Joel Osteen line really hit hard lol
Jesus , this sub really shows you the toxicity and cognitive dissonance of people on reddit lol.
Glazer
euphoria is the perfect diss track, but meet the grahams is first degree murder
You know Drake is really just deflecting, shrugging this off because he knows he's fucked, hoping it will just go away by not addressing it.
Push ups was kinda fire, but not even as a diss record, because it was weak in that sense. 

I really hope his run is over, but I'm afraid his fan base won't let him die
Family matters is good too, both keep getting better except for meet the grahams, while typing this Kendrick just dropped another diss I’m boutta listen
A canadian degrassi-hard autotune pedo coming after a pulitzer winning rapper? Gee, wonder who comes out on top
Considering how talked about this beef has been that isn’t great, killshot got 35 million views in the first 24 hours and this beef has been  talked about more imo
Damn they profiting off this shit! Wonder if they’ll just keep it going forever. Pretty soon they’ll do a “beef” world tour together.
Trash. He recycled beef lyrics from Ludacris.
[removed]
i am disappointed with it. dont think kendrick came hard enough.  5 of 10 imo
You mean his next cease and desist?
When that beat dropped Dot when hard on him.
Kendrick is on a completely different level than Drake in every conceivable way lol
Lmao that’s like saying lebron is on a different level than college players.

No shit.
Isn’t this technically the second round tho? Or are we not counting like that as a full diss?
Real heads know.
Personally, that FUBU line cut deep to the heart of the culture Kendrick and many others have criticized Drake on.

On the surface it's clothing, but it's a lot more than that and damn it was toasty.
They also said euphoria didn’t have substance, as if push ups did 🤦‍♂️
the fact that some people thought drake had a chance is just baffling. yall are not fans of hip hop, yall are just fans of Drake xD
Meanwhile drakes diss was basically "lmao you're short and poor!"

Drake's barely 6', and Kendrick is by no means poor.

182.2cm is not 182.9cm 
https://www.celebheights.com/s/-Drake-47444.html

E: tbh I didnt listen to the diss with Tupac since I thought even the idea was poor taste, so maybe I missed something.
I mean Push Ups wasnt solely for Kdot. He had to shoot shots at everyone else for half the track lol
In the words of 50:

>I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time  
Are you illiterate, fella? You can't read between the lines?
I also don’t know why drake fans seem to think a rap diss needs to be a TMZ breaking news story. Just because that’s how push defeated your boy doesn’t mean Kendrick even had to go there to do it. Plus it’s not like we didn’t know Kendrick was short lol.
Also listing one of the 100 things he said lol yea, that’s how this works. He said 100 things about dude 😭
I think euphoria is fire and better than drakes but saying hes to dumb to catch the rest is insane, kendrick didn't use any double or triple entendres besides the easily caught Parkinson thing and the double for shooting a drake in the beginning, he was very straight forward and nothing should be going over your head unless u just don't know rap, but then again I listen to battle rap religiously so maybe I'm bias but nothing kendrick said was extremely lyrical on a high level 😂
Push ups was ass my boy

![gif](giphy|UuDyq20NSFfjD6XG9D|downsized)
They’re either choosing to not hear what he’s saying or are genuinely too stupid to get it
“Raising my son correct, teach him integrity, morals, respect (you’ont know nothin’ ‘bout that)” the double punch of “you don’t know about raising your son/you don’t know about integrity, moral, respect) is fucking evil. That’s about the worst commentary you can make on a man, and it all rings true for who drake is. Honestly I don’t see how Drake can come back at Kendrick, fake never wins.
Thing is he grew up a privileged life and was a child star on family friendly TV shows. His whole persona is fake. 


Haha you guys seen that video where he’s on stage and someone throws a water bottle at him and he pretends to pull out a gun? Cringiest fucking thing I’ve ever seen. DMX saw his corniness early on. I never liked him either.
Aubreys ghostwriters got some work to do

Edit: Don’t support fake art my friends.
It’s definitely harder than Push ups, coming from someone who roots for Drake, but I disagree with people here saying he completely destroyed Drake, because he didn’t and that wasn’t his intention - felt like these were just an extended warning shots track and he’d go deeper on the next one (probably might take the pedo angle, also whatever the gunna bar is about). 

If Drake’s response is whack, it will give more power to this track until then it’s a good diss which is not impossible to come back from
Drake munchers will defend him like crazy. Drake is undoubtedly the softest dude in the game lol.

I always laugh at how “gangster” he tries to act even during his livestreams when he’s describing his super fruity signature drink.
It's mid.
Honestly the song was just weak on a musical level
such a fucking drake ass thing to do LMAO 💀
As soon as i saw that ig post from drake the first thing i remembered is the ending of that scene is literally “and the thing i hate most is i dont hate u at all” hahahaha
Even if Kendrick's disses were mid (they're not) his delivery and creativity is elite.
I honestly thing the 10things I hate about you post is a bit zesty tho like why you watching that drake.
Those were real bars. However he didn’t have any new substance. Everything that was said about Drake is nothing new. performance wise everyone knows kendrick washes Drake, a battle isn’t even necessary. This is more about dirt. And no dirt has been dug up yet.. soft ass beef tbh
Bro sexy redd like someone watching a grizzly bear fuck a guy up and she’s gonna jump in to try to help the dude fight off the bear. Why would she do that to herself?
Whaaaat. Ofc drake is a fan of that movie
I don't even think Drake understood the reference to those bars lol. Guy's a dumbass.
I'm still not over the beef between Push and Drake getting shut down. Push was for sure sitting on something juicy going out that hard with Adidon as just a warning shot.
Or the cease and desists on like that 😂
Because only a small amount of people actually listen and care about who wins. Mainstream listeners probably don't even know anything about this beef, and most feel like it's manufactured.
Didn’t Kendrick start this by taking offence for being compared with Drake and J Cole for the Big 3 line?
It’s free publicity for him probably is a big factor. His fans will ride with him no matter what happens (see Pusha T beef) and he is constantly in the GOAT conversation as long as he keeps going at the top lyricists in the game.

It really comes down to that. He feels like even if he loses, he wins.
Nah he def won against Meek and Budden
Beef with Kendrick too lmfao it's not even a fair match up
getting into diss battle's what?
Cause 90% of his street cred came from the Meek battle and we all know how desperate he is to be accepted by the streets.
Back to back was sick top 10 diss tracks ever
He got one up on Meek Mill and thought that meant he could handle anyone.
Very simplistic summary: 

Since 2010ish, those 3 artists have been crowned the 3 up and coming talented artists/rappers. They have always been lumped together as the top of that generation. For the longest time, Kendrick and drake have been subliminally insulting eachother here and there. Not all is public knowledge but it's been relatively well known that they aren't friends. 
Now skipping forward to last year, drake dropped a song with j. Cole called "First Person Shooter" where Cole drops a bar about Kendrick, Cole and drake being the big 3 "like they started the league". While this obviously isn't an insult, Kendrick views hip-hop as more competitive than that and treated it like an insult, because he views himself as a superior artist to Cole and drake. 
Skip forward to last month, future dropped a song called "like that" with a Kendrick feature that, for the first time, took direct shots. He said " f the big 3 its just big me" and a bunch of other lines directed more specifically at drake. 
This obviously ignited the internet, and since then discourse has gone crazy everywhere about who's the best artist, who needs to diss who etc. 
After this Cole dropped a song called 7 minute drill. In which he responds to Kendrick and insults him back. However after a few days, in a public display he apologized for his diss track, saying he didn't mean what he said and wants out of this beef.
Since then drake dropped a full diss track "Push-Ups" and a secondary diss track "Taylor made freestyle". 
And today Kendrick dropped his full nuclear response which is what's being discussed here. 
Hope that helps
Boiled down answer:

- Drake and J. Cole was on the song First Person Shooter which was supposed to be this hip-hop allstars thing with the biggest rappers in the game (essentially like “Forever” with Eminem, Lil Wayne, Drake and Kanye). Kendrick is not on the track (he likely turned down a feature request). 

- J. Cole makes reference to Kendrick on that song, stating that Kendrick, Drake and himself is “the big three”

- Kendrick then takes numerous digs at both Drake and Cole on the song “Like That” (mostly going at Drake though). Amongst other things, he states “Fuck the big 3, it’s just big me”

- J. Cole then responds with a super weak diss track (7 minute drill), which he deletes and apologizes for a few days later. 

- Drake’s Kendrick diss track “Push Ups” leaks and it’s actually good compared to Cole’s attempt. Song officially releases about a week after the leak. Drake takes shots at Kendrick and numerous other people 

- Kendrick release this. You can listen for yourself


Edit: I forgot Drake also released a diss where he used an AI voice filter to disguise his voice as Tupac and Snoop Dogg to diss Kendrick. Didn’t go down well with anyone
I thought it was hot.  I liked the beat and it had some good bars.  Euphoria is just cold blooded
As a song Push Ups was fun and could certainly be remixed into plays at the club. 

As a hip-hop fan Euphoria was a flex. The beats, flows and lyrics were all tight.
That was my experience too.
Drake is an average MC at best in terms of lyrics. He makes catchy pop music and hybrid hip-hop and pop music.


I have no idea why Drake would think it's a good idea to go after a lyricist like Kendrick Lamar when Drake himself is basically a pop musician masquerading as a hip-hop MC. We all say what happened when he went after Pusha T.
That song is ass
Tbf the other guys listed as writers are Boi-1da and Drakes sound engineer.
Wild hearing T Pain was ghost writing for country artists but he’s got chords.
[removed]
“I make music that electrify ’em, you make music that pacify ’em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time”
his aura 😭
Drake's songs are bangers at least.
They are petty late to the club
That’s part of the diss though, a central point of what Kendrick is criticizing is that Drake’s tryna use black American culture to reinforce his own image even though he’s fucking Canadian
I mean Kendrick bated Drake into saying he’s Michael Jackson to make the nonce comparison.

1. Prince outlived mike jack
2. What’s a prince to a king you my son
3. Now he claims the Michael Jackson role which leaves him open to more pedo accusations.
yeah but then he used Tupac’s voice… so that’s a 100% worse than “mentioning” said icons
This needs more upvotes
yes, i can’t believe some people thought that was gas. whackkk
They need to wear a mask like daft punk or they'll get a headshot
They wear helmets often
I assumed it meant walk around with a mask on like Daft Punk i.e. don’t show your face
They wear helmets, and they also retired daft punk
It means to stay hidden. Daft Punk initially wore those masks to keep their identities unknown.
One of Daft Punk's songs is called "Around the World"
The problem is that after adidon people think that a diss track needs to be some bombshell news drop. Its just supposed to be disrespectful and attack the opponent
The contract bars weren’t even from Adidon they were from Exodus
Yeah keep seeing "didn't say much new" but I don't see how that's relevant. How well you diss someone with what's said is what's relevant. And kendrick demolished drake in 4 dimensions
Rick Ross also said half the stuff kdot said too
Well sadly not everyone places bounties just to know personal infos about their opponents
Tbf I doubt we gonna get anything on the level of story of Adidon (unless pusha T comes back with more smoke) because it honestly is going to be one of the most icon diss tracks ever. It's been haunting drake ever since it dropped, across all of his other beefs
I think if Drake comes back, we'll get kendricks no Vaseline, he held back.
💀💀💀 You gotta be joking
His delivery was insane with every beat switch 

different strokes for different folks ig
[deleted]
That's because story of adidon was a near perfect masterpiece.
Way too rational. We need to consume everything by the second and quickly move on to the next thing
People just want to hear Drake get made fun of
You fundamentally don’t understand the concept of a diss track. Just stop.
Everybody’s missing the point of the song. The reversed clip at the beginning is literally “everything they say about me is true,” then Kendrick goes on to list all the things people have shit on Drake for.

Mixed in with all the truths are hints that Kendrick actually has more and worse shit he can dive into. Pedophilia, snitching to feds, paying off accusers, mob affiliations, being closeted, etc. 

This song isn’t meant to knock Drake out, it’s a warning shot. He references Cole bowing out because he thinks that’s what Drake should do. And if he doesn’t, Kendrick has made it clear over several bars that he can go deeper.
And jokes from twitter like Drake being a bad bitch lol
All drake said is he’s short and has a bad deal. You can’t really use that argument
I’m far from a Drake fan.. but Kendrick’s diss is ass. It should never be compared to any classic diss songs ever!!
Don’t you think that every person has to go through a process of listening and learning to “discover” that there will be more to art with subsequent listens? I think it says more about the demographics of the posters than the state of the music. As in, they’re just young. Nothing wrong with that. We all have been there. Hip hop has always been a young folks’ genre
It’s the music equivalent of boxers having real beef with eachother, they COULD settle ur privately but they both in the same profession and want to beat the other person in that regard. Therefore boxers would fight and rappers would rap. Can also add that there’s the publics validation for whose better and who won/lost blah blah

No. Kendrick’s response is definitely not that great. Drake could easily come back with a response

It’s his real voice
Family Matters?
This beef definitely hasn’t been more talked about, Eminem is just ridiculously big still. This beef has only been as relevant to rap fans. Killshot was getting played by suburban mums
Look with all due respect you can't compare anyone to em ,he is the goat of the goats and everyone loves his diss tracks ,am from an Arabic country and here out of 10 people who knows em maybe one or two will know Kendrick or drake ,they don't have as much wide spread as em
Eminem is white, of course he’s going to have white people who don’t listen to hiphop want to hear it. 
Eminem is one of the biggest artists ever 
One is Eminem one is Kendrick isnt it normal
You can't say it's not "great" just because another song had more views. Eminem has worldwide pop appeal so 80% views were probably like people in other countries that don't speak English but clicked because they like Eminem.
I contributed about 20 listens since yesterday.
Yeah, but if you look the track up on YouTube the first one that pops up is not the one Kendrick posted, there are like 9 of them that come up before the one actually posted by Kendrick
That’s because it’s two white guys. America is mostly white guys so is it a surprise that a more relatable beef has reached more ears? Most white people shrug off black media.
Different era
Why’re u playing dumb? Who do you think eminems core audience is? They’re majority of the population no matter what he did he would’ve hiked up a bunch of views lol it’s the same reason that despite Taylor swift being a mediocre artist she consistently tops charts
Well am not sad ,beef songs are the best
K , keep coping my guy

I’m know as the Drake hater in my circle. Always thought he was whack. Especially after his young money era, I’ll concede and say he was good during that era. Cmon man it’s Jimmy from Degrassi.
The 808s go crazy on this. Gonna be massively played in the clubs and in cars.
Can I bleed him? bet
I don’t really count it because it really seems like it’s a throw away line. Kendrick got Drake to make a whole ass song about Kendrick for being short for a couple of bars about being the best. I think Kendrick wins that too.  I also think this was a warning shot. 

A nice friendly fade bar suggests this. Right now Kendrick is saying Drake hasn’t violated him enough to up the violence.
C'mon now drake said a lot on pushups. And said the _u short uwu_ in a lot of ways too

Drakes push up diss was good but he got cut up
A legit 182 is still well (about 2 inches) above the average, and this is coming from a Drake hater that thinks Euphoria washed Push Ups. Stand Drake and Kendrick next to each other, and the former absolutely towers over the latter. An almost 20 cm difference is massive.

Odd comment, honestly. What height would Drake have to be for him calling Kendrick short to be a valid diss?
You're picking out the lame setups as his hard hitters? Nah Drake went the battle rap route. Funny jabs then hits hard. His diss is exactly what I imagine Drake doing, entertaining. And he doesn't disappoint. He's no Kendrick when it comes to rap but he swung back. Rebuttals, some... not a lot but some wordplay gun bars, exposing his record deals and ripping that tough guy Compton image apart with Taylor and Maroon 5. Yeah Drake did just fine.
lmao, I get not listening to the song but your dumbass can’t even interpret the title?

“Push Ups” cuz KDot controlled, but sure kiddo, it’s just short jokes if you ignore everything else to keep doing tricks on that KDot meat.
Push Ups wasn't good. Full of mid blows.

 He had nothing on Kendrick. Kendrick is short and is still a multi millionaire (without selling his soul), wow.

 Telling (arguably) the best hip hop producer to go make beats isn't a diss either.
It was like 80% Kendrick. And Kendrick’s 1 v 20 bar alone was so much better than drakes 20 v 1 bar lol.
They don’t understand the lyrics and don’t wanna read them. I use to be that way of not understanding rap songs. It’s a skill you need to really sit down to learn and dedicate yourself to. 
It really doesn't take a lot of research to go back and listen to old diss records and see how MCs really spit, yeah you would get new info every now and then no Vaseline was literally just flames without dropping a lot of new info, I think pusha t just got us spoiled tbh

There was multiple deep angles like saying he saw the two other goats kissin and huggin on stage and said he’d explain in 8 lines. 8 lines later he says if they’re not friends he’ll go YNW Melly who killed two of his best friends. There is so much shit like that.

He said he makes music to electrify them and Drake makes music to pacify them but we don’t have to go there (pacify cause drake into kids)

The I hate what you wear, I hate how you walk etc is where the beef started when Kendrick said he was laughing with his whole team to DMX saying that on breakfast club. 

He named it Euphoria cause drake was exec producer of a show about kids having sex. He said he’s not into women cause he’s hinting at drake not to go there or he’ll expose. He even bated drake into calling himself michael jackson so he can pull the pedo line:

1. Prince outlived mike jack
2. What’s a prince to a king you my son
3. Trapped

There is so much shit
There was the rapping against “ghosts” entendre too. And the 6th sense one. A couple others I’m forgetting. But yeah overall this wasn’t his most lyrically dense track.
Have you ever played? 

Have you ever?
Simple as that. We gotta stop entertaining these dorks.
You gotta hook that video
Drake's be working his ghostwriters overtime in the gullah like "Nah nah nah, not this time, you following through"
He’s working with AI now too
OVO sweatshop working hard as we speak
[removed]
Agreed, I don’t really see this being impossible to come back from, but I’m sure Kendrick put him back in the R&B lane. No more fake tough guy stuff from Drake will be taken seriously by the culture anymore. 

I don’t think Drake can top this diss track. What could he even say? If he doesn’t drop a bomb his credibility will drop further. He is better off just taking this L to go before he really gets bled out.
Tbf, all Kendrick’s gotta do if Drake responds is just stop alluding to Drake being a pedo and just straight up say it. Can’t really come back from that when it’s the truth.
Damn if dude straight took the man’s n-word pass with a warning shot I don’t wanna know what aiming for the head looks like…. Ok yes I do.
Finally a good take 

I have my fair share of issues with it. It seemed a little all over the place. A couple of the bars felt downright sloppy flow/syllable wise and there was nothing crazy lyrically wise. As well as explaining some of his own lyrics as if genius lyrics and annoying Kendrick nerds (like me) won’t pick up the slack on that. At times it kind of reminded me of that bad Australian rap battle video. 

The gay lines were out of character for Kendrick and the real women line seemed weird and targeted towards the women instead of drake. Gunna stray was weird.  

BUT…

Of course kendrick isn’t going to drop his nuke. He wants to see Drake drop HIS nuke first and he’s giving him the opportunity to do that. He doesn’t want to end it now because he loves the sport but also because he still wants to have the last word. 

So we can’t judge it on what shocking new info was introduced. And Drake’s “new” info is just him lying. Kendrick made the better song with better production and higher highs.

The only other theory that makes sense is that he’s going to pull a back to back and drop a much better track Friday. If he does that then we pretty much know for certain that Drake has no red button. Which makes no sense because why would Drake bluff so hard knowing Kendrick can legitimately body him? That being said, he can always hit us with the classic “I just couldn’t drop it” and take no hit on his career as always. But Dot isn’t Push and this one actually is actually about goat status.
That’s exactly how I feel. It was a great response, but Kendrick was clearly holding back. As was Drake. I don’t believe in the whole “rounds” thing. There’s a winner and a loser that’s it. As of now, there’s no winners yet.
No fucking way 😭😭
Funniest shit I've heard all day
Low-key... I'm not even suprised. I am suprised tho that he knew that scene enough to repost it
Drake makes money for a lot of people. If his ship sinks, then they take a hit to their bank account.
The amount of shit that happened in the last 6 weeks, yeah no way someone is keeping up with all of this unless they are a fan of the artists involved or a rap enthusiast
I'm aware in that I listened to all the diss songs, and I'm still nearly certain this is manufactured.  This is the industry testing the waters and gaging reaction to the AI stuff.

Pac's estate sued, but I'm sure other dead artist's estates could approve whatever if the money's good.

Selena, Lennon, Sinatra, Cobain, whoever. It's coming, and it'll sadly take ears away from actual living artists.
Totally. This is some real underground shit. Only the most hard-core fans know about this.
It started a long time ago with Drake being pissed off at his control verse, Kendrick responding in 2013 BET  Cypher, and then Drake sneak dissing him for the next 5 years.  

FPS reignited it
I'd be offended too if someone compared me to Drake
[removed]
That helps tremendously! Thank you so much!!!
It does go back further than First Person Shooter. Drake, and Kendrick alludes to this, has been taking subliminal shots at other rappers for YEARS. 

Future and Metro Boomin have specifically been close with Drake, but both feel like they got wronged by Drake. Much of the content in We Don’t Trust You and subsequent We Still Don’t Trust you is geared around taking shots at Drake. Kendrick’s verse was just the most direct and outspoken on the album.
i don't understand why cole hopped out of the beef?
It’s worth noting that Cole shouted out the big 3 but Drake notes it’s just him and Cole in the first verse (or at least women he hangs with thinks that). This is likely what KDot took offense to, not the Big 3 line. 

And in Cole’s verse he calls himself the GOAT, which doesn’t help
Isn't that line in King Kunta about drake? 

"Now I'm rapping with a ghost writer, 
Bitch wtf happened,
Oh no, I swore I wouldn't tell,
But most of yall sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell."

I always assumed it was.
Thank you!!
Some friends agree with what you said. I'll have to listen to it a few times, some of the references (from both songs) go over my head.
Hes definitely not average MC
Man, damn near everyone that's on any type of major label has ghost writers. You ever hear on a movie or show pertaining to music or music labels where the executives say we're looking for a particular sound, that's why lol this isn't like back in the 80s or 90s where people were really signed for talent. Most importantly they have to be marketable. That's what's being sold. Almost errrbody got writers.
He’s not the only one and it’s not that surprising honestly. Modern country went through (and is still sort of going through,) a phase where it sort of saw the same shift pop-rap saw with the advent of the SoundCloud generation; except instead of Midwest emo layered over trap or toned down 140BPM records it’s Florida Georgia Line doing weird rap-singing. Even T-Swift is guilty of sort of “gentrifying” hip hop by making it more palatable to country fans and honestly some if it is pretty catchy. 

IIRC there were even rumors for a while that RZA and other Wu Tang members had gotten into ghost writing for country artists so T-Pain doesn’t seem like a stretch to me at all. Hell, Chris Stapleton is one of the biggest country acts of the last ten years based almost entirely on the success of a mashup of Rather Go Blind/Tennessee Whiskey and even he spent the decade before that ghost writing country hits.

?? Eh is that really a call out to drakes creepy behavior it sounds like he’s just calling his music boring
Definitely a good artist, or at least his writers are. But he is certainly not a good rapper.
Both are bad imo
Helmet*
Ok yeah that makes sense actually but I think Daft Punk should come out of retirement help Drake for his redemption arc... After Kendrick curb stomped and whooped his feet
Daft Punk got bangers if I had to choose not a single Drake song or album goes harder than Random Access Memories
You get it. Lol 

I don’t understand the battle really… do people really think Drake is a better lyricist than Kendrick? That’s the crazy part to me
If TMZ can’t run a news story about it apparently it’s not a good diss…

Did people just turn off the song before the cease and desist line about the “Like That” track? People wanted something we didn’t know about and that makes Drake look soft as fuck if true.
Foreal. Like how mf “nuclear” do people want it? I love all three of em and I’m here for it all.
But if it's just saying the same thing back and forth it gets old after the second song. Kendricks short and Drakes white we get it.
[removed]
I agree with this.

But the punchlines are basically made by push, like the points of the bars..

"You signed to a n***a that was signed to a n***a that was signed to that n***a."

Pusha:

"You signed to one n***a that's singed to one n***a that's signed to three n***as, now that's bad luck."

And theres many more examples like about drakes fro and his stance as an "actual artist"
 i could bring up, but im lazy
m's count different when baby divides the pie
These mfs want every diss track to be this super unknown ass deep dirt on these cats when that’s literally impossible for every diss to be that groundbreaking
I think part of the problem now is with social media everything has to be “cooked”, “demolished in 4 temporal dimensions!”, “destroyed”, “obliterated” for views and engagement.  

People just get burnt out on that shit. It was a good diss track but it’s not going to have any effect on Drake’s career and he’ll respond right back. Community seems pretty split on this beef so far with most just finding it entertaining. 

No one has been “obliterated” by either of these tracks, chill tf out.
It’s an expectations thing. You expect kdot to be on a higher rap level than Aubrey. 
You see a kid do 10 kick ups and go ‘good job’ you see a professional do it and go ‘ok’. Aubrey is the kid.
Now this is an opinion I can respect We might not agree but like you said we all got different taste 💯
As an artist (and Tyler has spoken on this) I think it's commendable that he's still playing around with inflection, experimenting with strange cadence, and switching voices up. He doesn't have to do any of that, but to me he seems like someone at the top of his game pushing past what is normal/expected/comfortable and into that strange/experimental territory. I feel like I'm listening to someone have fun
"Near"? I can't think of a better diss track. The only reason it has competition is that it didn't end Drake's career and other disses have ended careers. And it should have, in my opinion. Or impacted it more. But then, Drake's not really a part of the culture so he's not judged by it the same way.
yeah don't worry I'm not saying that to be rational I'm just saying that cuz I like drake
And thats cool, but like with any joke it loses its luster after hearing it for the 500th time
Thank you. Wasn't sure because this almost always happens after an event like this.
He can, and probably will fire back. Don’t mean his swings are connecting, and doesn’t mean Kendrick won’t come back harder. 

We’ll see how this plays out. For now, Drake be giving Caillou vibes 🤣.
Can confirm. Am suburban mom.
I would say out of my friends I listen to the most hip hop and killshot was the only time a beef became a topic of conversation around my friends.

Most of them like Drake songs but none of them care about the beef.
Idk, doomsday pt. 2 didn't get that many views.
Dudes fresh from India at my work bump Eminem , he’s a mega star 
Popularity wise, sure. GOAT rapper and rapping? Gimme Nas
Being the most listened to does not mean the greatest of all time.
We don’t care! You’re only saying that Eminem is a bigger popstar. And I think only Snoop will come close. But hey that’s marketing for ya.

But for Hip-Hop heads Eminem hardly makes the top 10. Guy can rap, can battle, but he’s not better than Rakim, Jay, Nas, Ice Cube, Andre 3000, Chuck D, Kendrick, Biggie, Tupac, all the Wu-Tang rappers, Big Daddy Kane, Krs One or LL Cool J.
True. As a white person it’s my solemn duty to listen to everything white people make.
Don’t be a racist moron. He’s popular because he’s good.   Nothing to do with colour of hes skin.
You're gonna get downvoted for this, but this is it. Eminem appeals to more people because of his race.
Starting from the bottom is actually a reference to Jimmy’s wheelchair. I mean, drake couldn’t be talking about poverty. 
“I did half a xan, 13 hours til I land, had me out like a light.” I worked with 20 year old girls that got lit off one bar and some wine — they were fine. Drakes a bitch 😂
WHATEVER IT TAKES
I don’t know why, Drake always felt like the music equivalent of mayonnaise that had been out in the sun all day for me.
😅🤣😂🤣😂
With his broken leg havin ass
Pac was a young actor as well and would have taken the role in a second if offered to him at the same age.
It was funny to me when Jimmy linked up with Headie One on a drill track 😂😂 drake really said "don't make me have to ride by a high school" in it... he's been corny since his old rap days
“Once a lame, always a lame”
And you're 100% in the right.  His lyrics don't correlate with his life  but I guess there's an argument where most mainstream artists are the same.  I put him in the end category with Taylor Swift, about as generic and bland as you can be
His YM moment came because Wayne was locked up. Drake was Wayne light and filled a gap. He copied style and had nothing of substance.
I was initially somewhat impressed by Push Ups, but the more I think about it the more it rings hollow. Talking about how the last one didn’t hit and how TD gets 50% after the last one had one of hip hop’s biggest tours and him departing TDE to start his own label is goofy.
yeah but besides the fact that kendrick took him seriously, drake's been exposed for having ghost writers already...

he's a disney actor turned industry plant. his first two charted hits that got him on the map are with Rhianna

idk if people just forgot or what, this isnt a serious beef to kendrick. he knows drake has nothing on him in hip hop drake just has power and influence in the industry and media
Cole had reason to mention height and it was whack lmao. 
Yeah because calling Kendrick short has so much substance, and why is Drake hating that feature when Drake lip synched the same song?
I commend Drake for responding I think this is good for Hip Hop but the YNW MELLY lines alone had more substance than all of Push ups
When did Kendrick make himself out to be a tough guy from Compton?
The Taylor and maroon 5 stuff rings hallow when drakes own music is closer to theres then it is Kendrick’s though lol. Plus who cares that he did songs with other stars? Every artist does. Wayne and Kanye did songs with maroon 5 too, well at least adam Levine. I honestly don’t think there was a single thing in push ups that I’d call a hard hit. The hardest thing was the splits and we don’t even know how true that is but I’m sure it’s not as bad as what his own label head was doing to Wayne back in the day.
Lmaoo that or sending em all good morning texts lolol

And if he drops a bomb about kdots family then even if it’s true there will be heavy skepticism
I might cringe the next time Drake says the n word. And I doubt I’m the only one. If that happens drake better just stick to the R&B.
Kendrick dissed him on that too.
I’m keeping up and haven’t heard any of the diss songs just loving the drama lmao. Not a rap guy at all
👋🏼 yeah that’s me

I saw Euphoria pop up on my feed yesterday and thought it was good but had no context haha. Then I come on here and my general understanding is Drake released a diss track for some reason, J Cole’s album also has a diss to Kendrick, and then Kendrick came out of the woodwork to tear down Drake yesterday?

I’m still probably wrong 😅 I thought Cole and Kendrick were cool with each other
Isnt king kunta a drake diss too though? Or at least partially?

His heart wasn’t in it. He doesn’t really have beef with any of these dudes
Bc he knew it was inevitably gonna get personal, which it has gotten. He probably didn't think it was worth it for him. From the spectators perspective, it does look like a huge L but icl it's reasonable considering where it's gone and where it's likely gonna go.
I’m surprised he even responded in the first place. Dude was never about beef that’s just not how he moves.
He probably realize he doesn’t really give a fuck
Drake himself is a below average mc his writers are decent
Drake is a great MC if you like hybrid pop hip-hop music.


Drake is average at best if you like hip-hop music.
noones comparing their lyricism, its more about their impact.

Like kendrick isn't the best lyricist in hip-hop, altho his lyricism is incredible, his impact and artistry has carried him to the crown along with cole and drake.

It's hard for ppl to admit this, but for the longest drake and kendrick have shared the crown in the public eye for the past decade, it seems like kendrick wants to knock Drake off it and finally set the notion straight.
💯 It's not what you say but how you say it. That is the fundamental aspect of a diss, simple as that. Mfers want every new diss track to be a TMZ piece
Social media has ruined people man. You can tell Kendrick doesn't want to take it there because he's not a petty fool who gets off on other people's humiliation. Yeah, he just roasted Drake but kept it all within the frame of the sport of rap.
Well, I'm no expert when it comes to rap beef, but if it's anything like rap battles, then there's nothing wrong with some hyperbole. And bar for bar kendrick had way better lines attacking more substantially than anything Drake said (size 7 shoes and ripped jeans). Obliterated doesn't mean drakes career is ending or anything like that, just that he got obliterated. The disses against him in this "battle" were way fucking harder. End of the day its all entertainment and that's all it'll amount to be.
Someone that understands the way music works.
Yo wassup?
We’re all suburban moms on this blessed day.
Mom we’re out of milk
Don’t forget us suburban dads, we bumped the hell out of Killshot too.

Euphoria however is a fucking deadly diss track, this should be fun to watch play out, that track got harder and harder as it went 🤙🏻
Looking gorgeous. Just a normal guy. DC4L
U here talking about this too mama..u don't count.
Skill or craft wise perhaps, though he's definitely in the conversation, but there is no other rapper in the world that has as much international coverage and publicity. There are murals of Eminem in 3rd world countries fgs, if your existence supercedes that of every single one of your contemporaries in all eras before and since then I would argue that does in fact make you the greatest of all time.
True , but you can't say he isn't one of the greatest
Cryin😂😂
Well technically even Eminem said he sold more because he was white in white America
The hype always makes me laugh. I think he’s the favorite rapper for people who don’t really like rap, but   If you meet somebody raised in the culture if they say Eminem is their favorite your definitely giving them a side eye😅
[deleted]
Having a tolerance to pills is not a flex 😂
Such a corny flex. He wants to be cool so bad
Ngl it was a flex / triple meaning about how high the elevation is (expensive plane) and a call back to famous dex ‘japan’ plus the basic bar. U gotta appreciate wordplay
Soon as I heard that line...I was like...there is absolutely nooo wayy he thinks that makes him sound hardcore or something ?? Like you said...I've seen homegirls literally CHEW more than 1 like 2 DRY XANAX BARS and then chase it with e&j no chaser and still somehow be able to walk around the mall and steal without stumbling around or getting caught lmfao those 2 girls were a mf trip...
Because he arguably is.
Lol I don't think that was a broken leg
C’mon now, we can’t compare Drake to Pac lol
Drakes feels like a bunch of one liners and disses strung together. Especially Taylor made. Kendrick’s just felt like he actually wrote a diss song. 

I’m sure I’m just being bias but whatever.
Yeah were he and Cole’s (pre delete) plan really to try to convince us mr morale was a mid album? That shits easily better and more memorable than anything drakes dropped since at least nothing was the same. Drake hasn’t made a song let alone album that truly stands out and sounds good and original in like a decade now.
Who is he bleeding?
On every song that isn’t about him cheating on his wife?
***"Rise & Grind, team! Who's gonna have a great day writing? WE are!"***

His Mama probably CC'd to check up on her big strong man 💀
At this point even AI is like “nah g, this all on you now. You said you got one in the chamber, better let that off and say your prayers”
“Am I battling ghosts or A.I?”
Yea and dropping bars about people’s family is wack just like Dot said in the track, crodie. 

He can’t even do another A.I. stunt because that was widely panned as lame too by the rap/radio community. 

He has to stand on skill alone and we know who will most likely win there based on comparing past diss tracks. 

Drake is trapped. Drake is doomed.
I wouldn’t really want to be compared to a p3do / groomer
yeah it does kinda look like an L to first launch a response and then backpaddle on it
Be careful don’t say he shares the crown w Cole and drake or Kenny may diss u
This. Most disses are acknowledgements of known facts.
Exactly they don't want bars they just want gossip. This shit is supposed to be about the music
Fantano tweeted about this yesterday. The Story of Adidon messed with expectations because it dropped such a gigantic reveal. Diss tracks aren’t necessarily meant to be about that. It’s about how creatively an artist can use known information.


>Drake and J. Cole are aware that I am unwilling to share the title of King or Rap. Being the king of rap is a challenging responsibility. I hope Drake and J.Cole are real freinds of mine, otherwise I will do bad things to them. 

Does not sound as good as 

>Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish n****
>The crown is heavy, huh
>I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly
She got the bark with bite homie **wassuuuup**
When talking about em you can't say "with all due respect". You gotta start it off with "disrespectfully,..."
He definitely isn’t “the goat of all goats”
This fool just said “Drake doesn’t even pop pills fr what a lame rapper”💀
to an idiot like drake it is.
The bar is not that complex bro sit down
Even still half a xan shouldn’t knock him out lmao.
They sound like bums.
![gif](giphy|MQq6vRv0T0xjO)
That’s why the “he took to long” responses from the drake stans now ring hallow. Yeah he took longer and you can tell in the results. Like anything they do.
I don’t think rap bravado = actual violence but that’s just me. Pretty sure drake has some “tough” bars too.
Yeah Kendrick boxed him in by clowning on the whole pop star I’m richer and more famous than you crap and making it known this isn’t about all that. That’s the only card drake knows how to play.
I agree it is a loss. It takes a lot to admit you are wrong especially in the rap game so I respect him for it nonetheless
Yup, within 48 hours
Agreed but anything less than top 10 is slander 
Look i get where you come from , but when  you can go to almost anywhere in the world and see people listening to you , that's a goat status, true he isn't the best but he has the widest audience out of them all
I mean, half a bar can totally enhance sleep when you were already planning on sleeping..
Thats real lol
Altitude changes how drugs affect the body .
That white kid ALMOST looks like Drake lol
That is wild. Drake took like three weeks. Which, I mean, fine. Not even that bad. But to act like Kendrick lost because he took 12 days, I mean...what?
He also is the best
With no tolerance? Come on now
I know this. I’ve done the exact same thing drake is referring to. Want a half xan.  

Lil bro must get high off second hand smoke too
Once Drake started legitimately using that as if he didn’t do the same thing I knew he was cooked
True
I took a whole bar back in the day and proceeded to fall asleep in a chair for 12 hours. I cant sleep in a chair but that did it lol
My language came off weird but I was agreeing with dude ^
Half a bar would destroy me
Taylor celebrating her bday tonight with Blake Lively and friends
This outfit has me gagged. She looks absolutely stunning 😍 The paps also sang her happy birthday and she seemed so happy.

I wish I was rich and had long legs
Midnights is over

Started with blue starry dress, ending with a black starry dress

That bottle of pee on the floor in the fourth picture is hilarious. Humble queen.
She really makes the 34-and-not-married-with-no-kids thing look more ideal by the day. 

And here I was jealous of everyone for having a ring and two little ones wayyy younger than even that.

This may be my favorite dress of hers ever
Fucking LEGS for DAYS

Makes me want to hit the gym rn (its 1am)
Hear me out: She's announcing the final version of Midnights (Afternoons Edition), which will have not only every Midnights song in one physical version (finally!) but also some brand new songs, including the next single Sagittarius. It's the beginning of her Grammy's campaign. This is a totally legit theory and not at all unhinged 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

In all seriousness, though, she looks amazing.
Respectfully, she’s so hot
I love how she grabs Blake's hand and helps her not trip as they make their way into the restaurant (in the full video I watched on tiktok). Must be pretty blinding with all those camera flashes!
As a fellow Sag… this dress is giving **the most** Sagittarius vibes ever ♐️🌙✨
Holy fucking ground, she went to the Box in manhattan, a club my very good friend works at. He was texting our group chat earlier saying “there is paparazzi outside, I wonder what celeb is coming.” Kicking myself for not trying to get in (who am I kidding it’s a Wednesday night 😂)
the dress is giving midnights
I wonder why everyone was saying Travis was throwing her a big bash for her birthday tonight. He isn’t even in NYC. Do people just make up BS?
Gorgeous birthday girl. Everything she wears looks amazing. Especially that smile. 🩷
Not even Taylor can escape a piss bottle 😭
Is it weird that I'm starting to recognize her security team since there have been so many pictures of her going out lately?
Is that dress Clio Peppiatt? It looks like it.

Edit: It IS Clio Peppiatt! Clio makes works of art.

I turned 33 earlier this month and it’s nice to see a woman my age be praised for her style, etc, without the “FOR HER AGE” treatment. 

Maybe Reddit is just less….oddly generational but so many tiktoks I’ve seen have comments like “omg I can’t believe she’s 34! She actually looks good” Like…that’s young…
it is simply way too cold for all that lol
1. She looks so happy. 

2. I love that dress but could never afford it.

3. I love those shoes.

4. She looks stunning.
Are the "and friends" in the room with us right now?
That dress is sooo adorable I love the design!! Also obligatory legs for daysss. Sometimes I get insecure about wearing short dresses with long legs but damn she just pulls it off so well
This dress…finally some good fucking food
Oh my god she looks stunning!!! That dress is everything 😍

Taylor has looked so happy lately and with that, so confident. I love it so much!! ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1067)
She really is just glowing these days!
I’m as tall as her, I think maybe an inch more, I can NOT fathom being able to operate in heels that high! Good on her ❤️‍🔥
HBD Queen! 👑 she is serving tonight 🔥
I hope she’s having the best year of her life ❤️
that discarded water bottle of piss behind her 😍
This dress is fabulous! I hope I’m this happy at 34 🥰
She looks stunning. But also the dress is giving midnight rain
She looks STUNNING ✨
She really is the moment
ECLISPE CONFIRMED 

Also she looks so happy & fun! Happy birthday Tay!
Guys, I’m jealous she can wear 4 inch heels and not worry about getting comments about being a giant
One of the prettiest dresses I've ever seen her wear 💕
That dress is everything. She is crushing it lately.
i love the jewelry she's been wearing lately! too bad they're too expensive for me haha but she looks amazing
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates and the the stars, all aligned ✨
Ah they’re going to The Box
Her outfit. Dreamscape and all other variations of dreams used in her posts. Link? Maybe ￼​

Holy moly Blake!
Her stylist has been working overtime lately because she's been serving looks non-stop and I honestly hope she keeps this up. It's also really, really nice to see her branching out into new brands like this instead of sticking to the usual ones. Nothing's wrong with the brands she usually wears, but it's always a lot more fun to try new things like this.
Our girl is so bejeweled and absolutely stunning 😍 and by the way, she’s going out tonight 🎶🎶
How does she not flash with dresses that short? That is what I always wonder 😂🤔
goddamn blake lively is absolutely gorgeous. i know we all know this.. but, wow.
Blake didn’t want to shave her legs I guess 😂
WINNING 😍
BUT WHERE
She is stunning and I swear girly does not feel the cold- I don’t know where they are but it’s December!
legssssssssss for days! i love those shoes too, but oof those days of mine are over lol
It is 36 degrees out in NYC how is she not freezing?
Yep, Taylor’s back in her Midnights era, wait a minute, black dress, reputation TV coming soon??![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1087)
if reputation and midnights had a baby
She’s so beautiful I can’t 😭❤️
Oh this dress is EVERYTHING ✨🌙
Omg LOVE this dress. She’s so beautiful
It’s giving midnights, my favorite album 🥰
She servin LOOKS. Our Queen is at it again
It amazes me how I never tire of looking at her after all these years
Best believe she’s bejeweled!!!! Making the whole block shimmer!!!!
I WANT THIS OUTFIT IN MY LIFEEE
This midnights dress is iconic, i wish she debuted it before the tour or i might have made one just like it 🥲
The ever so pretty T-Swizzle!!
Who made this Midnights vibe dress? Looks great. 

I think she’s manifesting for the Grammys!
Blake let’s her bejeweled lol
Oh my, I'm now rethinking if I'm straight or not haha
The dress is giving midnights and I love it
Did Travis come
She looks perfect... Hmmm her boyfriend isn't there. How are the stans doing?! The same people attacking joe for working and not being at her birthday.
Can you imagine having legs like that? I would wear shorts in January
LEGS!
Real question, do you guys hold hands with your friends like that when going out or is it a pose thing?
Someone please ID the dress
What other friends were there
The side bang is here to stay!!!!
Blake's outfit is amazing
I thought she and Blake were the same height. But apparently Blake is 5’7” 👀
The pap walks are a lil annoying lol
Anyone else surprised that she went to The Box of all places?
Not the yellow bottle on the street... 😭 This is the main reason I prefer small towns.
She's a symbol of candy American popculture. Just like Grandana Riande.
looks like shes done with football
[removed]
I'm trying to figure out why some pics look browner and redder than others. Maybe different pap pics and filters.
[removed]
People care this much about celebrities?
Blake is drunkity drunk 🥳
Why do celebrities only have celebrity friends?
That toe hang though.
So this sub is just cool with paparazzi?
How she manages in those heels?! She is absolutely stunning! I hope she had the best birthday today!
Gorg as usual
![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1064)
Someone please give that first photo a proper background! No pap or door! lol
She's really been killing it with outfits recently and this still might be one of favorite, like damn this dress is just perfect
+ Miles Teller
![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1079)![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1082)
Wow that outfit! Those legs. Literally stunning
SO PRETTY
Ughhhhh her dress!!!
Stunners!
Taylor precariously steps over nasty curb puddles just like the rest of us 🤩
She looks gorgeous and stunning 🤩
The dress is giving Mastermind verse 1 😍
That dress is so SO pretty!!! If only I had the money…
Omg that dress 😍😍🌙
What a super cute dress
Those heels look like they could kill someone. She looks gorgeous, as always.
Damn I love her dress
I'll probably never be as happy as Taylor was in the first pic 😉
This dress is seriously the most gorgeous thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I could absolutely never wear it with the size of my ass, but I love it!! 🪐🌙🌟
The dress!  🤩
What is waiting for them on the ground in the last picture?
Looks like that’s the moment she realized the paps were singing happy birthday to her. What a cute moment! Sure the paps are frustrating and it’s terrible she has to deal with them but maybe a happy/funny moment with them from time to time makes it a little easier for her!

I do love that picture though. Happy birthday to mother we love you ❤️
It might be my new favourite pic of Taylor. The outfit + the smile makes me melt
It’s giving Marilyn, instant classic photo!
Those LEGS too!
My first thought seeing it was, Yes!!!! 🥰
It was her reaction to everybody singing happy birthday to her!
I wish I could feel 10% as happy as she looks in this picture lol
That dress has been in cart for months…. RIP to that dream 😂
lol I just asked when I should have scrolled. Thank yoh
i was just about to say i know this dress costs more than my life but i want the link
id kill to have her physique she’s so beautiful
Relatable
Mood
Lol! I have the long legs but limited time for self care with grad school. Oh to have endless money for trainer and time to work out and not constantly stressed to the point where you emotionally eat. I comfort myself by saying that going to fancy events and restaurants must get tiresome at some point. 😂 Maybe she gets bored of the endless parties and socializing?
It’s darkest just before the dawn!
and rep begins 🖤🩵
Love this interp
Yea her clothes have been giving off a lot of night sky, stars, zodiac theming. Didn’t think about that all stars aligned on the website. These are clues.
Not sure if it's an Easter egg for rep tv or TS11 at this point
I don’t usually clown but I agree. Something’s going on
⭐️💫🌙♐️🔪
Astronomer here, we’re actually in Ophiuchus season. The snake bearer 🐍 which is also more appropriate!
I hate that she does this to us haha, she can’t just wear a dress with a cute print without me being like 👀👀 IS IT A SIGN
Calling it now, her next album's going to be titled zodiac
Welcome to New York lmao
Haha the true NYC experience!
What about the security guy’s eye in that picture!
I love New York.  😆  Never a dull moment
ew why in the world would someone pee in a bottle and throw it on the street
Yeah same! I'm 35 and single and it's awesome to see not everyone married and with kids by this age.
As a response to all in this sub-thread. Of course nobody should obsess over family-making choices of Taylor or any celebrity and no matter wheter she chooses to have kids one day or not, but given how huge of a cultural behemoth she is, if she happens to choose never to have children, she's the best person to kill the notion that women need kids to be happy in life, for good.
Ha, I'm 31 and childfree and it's a joy.
[deleted]
Part of why she looks so good is because she doesn’t have kids yet.  Kids age the shit outta you
As a 34 year old not married with kids it’s a ton of fun. I worked late today and just went to the bar on the way home from work without a care in the world. Helps I live in NYC.
[deleted]
37 not married no kids and it is a dream
27 with a boyfriend of 8 years who won’t commit and ooooo do I feel that 🫠
I just got cats and I’m telling you best decision ever.
I’m 35, not married, no kids and can confirm it’s great haha
Not all heroes wear capes—some just tell you what brand the cape is
It’s Clio Peppiatt!
[here's the link! ](https://cliopeppiatt.co.uk/products/night-lucina)

The dress has been designed in multiple colours and it's just one of the most beautiful dresses ever.
Their entire line is gorgeous!
Those earrings look cute! Kind of look like a pull tab from a sodie... interested to see what Taylor Swift Style posts about those
She is glowing ✨ with happiness and also abundant makeup highlights! Love to see it
I thought that was her hand for a sec lmao
same and i blame it on my sailor moon interest in the 90s
You and me both.
this has to be a lyric in her next album 🤡🤡
Meet me at midnight 🤡
As it shouldn’t be!
'happy birthday queen' at the end of the vid is so funny lmao
They were likely notified that she would be there to take photos with how many of them were there
oh lord their singing is, ummmm, really something  😂😂
Stop the clown car, lemme get in bestie! 

🤡🤡🤡🏹🏹🏹🚙🚙🚙
delulu is the solulu 🤡🤡🤡
>Makes me want to hit the gym rn (its 1am)

It's the thought that counts, bestie!
I love a little birthday clowning! 🤡
I have a playlist with every Midnights song from every Midnights edition that I named Midnights (Midday Edition)
Many articles mentioned some big celebration involving Travis...That never happened...Yes indeed many reporters made up BS ...

Some poster made the point that US Magazine is not to be trusted...I guess that poster is correct...

Maybe it is a good idea to ignore most articles written about Travis and Taylor...
No, people never say anything not true about Taylor. 



/s
No. People recognize long time members of Beyoncé and the Royal Family’s security teams.
I’m so curious to know their salary and whether they live in her house or whether they go home to their own families. Do they get to eat at the same fancy restaurants? Do they fly on her or have her? Seems like an isolating yet exciting lifestyle.
I’ve started giving them names 🙃
It’s absolutely stunning and makes me want to save thousands of dollars for a dress. 😂 I wonder if the designer makes clothing for taller people, too. This dress looks like it was made for a petite lady but Taylor absolutely slays in it.
the way i screamed when she was wearing clio peppiatt, i been dreaming of the day when I can afford their midnight dress!
All of these, haha.
I think those booty short dresses work much better on a celebrity out on the town than they do us on us regular folks. I’m Taylor’s height and can imagine getting some stares that would make me uncomfortable in the dress. 😂
Me too & she inspires me to put on some damn heels, because she gets showered with admiration for being “sooooo tall” when it’s just normal to us! I need to capitalize on this. If only I had anywhere to go at any time in heels!!!
Hahaha same! Also my boyfriend is my exact height and I don’t want to tower over him too much. Do you care about that sort of thing being a fellow tall woman? He wouldn’t mind but I still kinda like to look like we’re the same height. 😆
The early 30s are a magical time. I’m sure you will be if you surround yourself with good people.
I know I need some dupes!!
I live in New York and it’s fucking cold tonight friend
 Blake looks incredible either way tbh
they’re in NYC…i’d assume it’s pretty chilly up there
no,he has to practice all week

I keep seeing people say things like this, but Blake is sober??
She's said before that NYC paps are her favorites (least disliked?) because they don't chase her or ask her inappropriate questions. There's a mutual understanding that she'll do good pap walks if they're nice to her.
Actually she said in an interview that she prefers the NYC paps compared to anywhere else in the world!
Yes I feel like even the backstory is really iconic. I can imagine us years from now repeating the lore- “the paps had started singing happy birthday!” Such a glamorous story and image combo (while I realize paps aren’t always, my eyes hurt just watching all those flashes on video).
The dress, her legs and her smile makes it sooo goood . Everything perfect.
I think the regular pink Lucina dress is eerily Lover-esque in comparison to this one (Night Lucina) which is giving Midnights/Reputation.

My heart for one of these god

[Night Lucina Dress](https://cliopeppiatt.co.uk/products/night-lucina)

A small part of me was legit considering buying it for my upcoming eras tour date lmao.
Omg same bahah
I'm a guy and I'd kill to have her physique lol
Omg
TAYLOR SWIFT IS THE ZODIAC KILLER
TS11 will be streaming exclusively on the moon and the only way to listen to it is to get your space shuttle tickets through ticket master.
I actually think it’s midnights related…….it all seems to be connected back to mastermind and it *is* Grammys season
I'm clowning for very early coding for TS11 

I don't expect an announcement til 2024 tho 

🤡🤡🤡
Ooooooohhhhhhhh!!! How long does this season go for??
Do you mean astrologer? I didn’t think scientists bother with all that zodiac stuff
it's been waiting for you
Pee-hee-hee
Pee is waiting for you!
It also happens a lot in Mexico. There's a meme that calls them "pineapple flavored cokes" because it's generally coke bottles with yellow liquid. HAHA. Very disgusting.
This image just gave a whole new meaning and appreciation for that song
When you gotta go, you gotta go
It's mostly delivery drivers who aren't given breaks. But could also be a homeless person who doesn't have access to a bathroom.
It’s a very common thing with delivery drivers. I was a mailman until recently, found pee bottles in trucks all the time. We didn’t clock out til everything was delivered, so stress and rushing to go home makes people do some stupid, gross things. Ask your local mailman, I bet he’s got a story about someone shitting in a mail tub 🤡
This is what happens when you don't have public restrooms. America sucks.
Welcome to New York! 🗽
I’m 25, and I was just thinking this morning that she’s made me less afraid of my 30’s! I think society tells women that in their 30’s they need to sit down and have babies. But like… I’m too broke in my 20’s to do all the fun stuff I want 😂😭 I’m looking forward to my 30’s as being a more financially-secure expansion of my 20’s!
38 myself! I got divorced eons ago and never really wanted to date again. She is 100% an inspiration to keep doing my own thing.
I didn’t get married until I was 36 and I’m not having kids. Best decision I ever made!
Random but just wanted to say I’m obsessed with your flair, this line lives in my head rent free
38, married and childfree and it's a joy! I got carded at a football game last month and the person couldn't believe I'm almost 40. I don't even have much of a skin care routine 😂
I can't have kids and reading others' failed attempts to keep up with the cost of them... no thank you.
You know what's so much of that? SLEEP. And I fucking love my sleep. I cannot trade something even I love for sleep. There is no trading that.
Yeah I have a dog who I love to death but sometimes I'm like... could you maybe chill for like a fucking second.

I can't imagine kids. No thanks lol
Not just that but physically pregnancy and postpartum hormones/changes wrecked havoc on my body. I never had defined abs but now it’s totally different. Different shape, wide hips, messed up rib or two, and different skin. I don’t know if she wants kids, but man it really does age you no matter the work out or diet.
Yes because Blake obviously looks terrible /s
I want to be you in 10 years. Sincerely, a 25 year old living in a moderately sized Canadian city lol.
Just look at Blake Lively and its obvious that you can still definitely be hot as a mom!
Girl. You know the answer to this.
Oof! Been there. 

28 with a 5.5 years of situationship.

I decided to bid goodbye to that mess last August.
(August in the month of August when you're actually going through the feels hits different btw) 

I would be lying if I said, it's been easy. But I know I'm better for it. 

To quote our lord and saviour
_let your heart remain breakable, but never by the same hand twice_
Sounds like a tough situation you’re in. Best wishes working things out in the way that serves you. Good news is you have plenty of time to find the one who will want to make you his forever person. The man I’m dating now at age 35 blows away everyone I dated in my 20s. There is hope. :)
Oh yeahhh I totally see that, kind of resembles safety pins too
Omg same that was the best show, I loved racing home from school to catch it!
Fellow Moonie!
Thank you for reminding me of Sailor Moon. Just did through a drawer and found a holographic Sailor Jupiter sticker yesterday. I hope it makes a third comeback in the U.S., haha.
made me giggle 😂
Yeah, it's pretty clear they got the heads up. But hey, a serenade from the paps is kinda a unique bday gift. Least it was a good vibe this time around!
don't the celebrities themselves call the paps most of the time?
![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1087)![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1087)
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 I need a ride!
exactly 🙏🏼
I about died at this 🤣
Ain't no birthday party without a birthday clown 🤡🤡🤡
I called it Afternoons because of the Anti-Hero lyric: "midnights become my afternoons"
Bojack Horseman and a Midnights girly!! My people 🫶
Wore tights myself today.
Of course 👑
Gotta show the WRs how to do their job
Wednesdays are usually the first days of practice and, considering how their past few games have been, big red is not going easy on them.
Is she?? Oh damn. I take it back
That mutual respect in NYC must be such a breath of fresh air for her, especially after all those crazy paparazzi encounters she's had in the past. Plus, it gives us those iconic candid shots where she's just being herself. Love that for her, and we get to see her real smile, not just the camera-ready one. Happy she had a blast on her bday!
I remember that quote but it was more about just how bad LA paps are, which a ton of celebs have mentioned
I wonder how they always know where she is
Omg I love it just as much. 🖤🩷

Someone send my broke ass the SHEIN link 😂
The pink version is a freaking work of art. Gorgeous. I’d be afraid to go anywhere or eat anything wearing that. 😂
Goodness gracious! That's half of my total annual income in my currency lmao 💀
OMG the Clio Peppiatt “Eve” dress 😍🐍
Me considering it for my 34th bday, I’ve got 2 years to justify the cost 😂
Dooo itttttt!!! It’s really is a piece of art, and if you can get get a great cost per wear out of it, why not?!
That entire line is simply gorgeous. Playing fantasy rehearsal dinner as to which one will photograph the best 😂
Mastermind was a threat
We tried to forget it but we just couldn’t, and I bury bodies but I send the cops riddles of where I put em
Hahaha wow it's been a minute since I got a true laugh out loud from reddit. Well done
😱
This really made me laugh.
🤣🤣🤣
I agree. Lavender Haze music vid also had a bunch of zodiac references.
Actually I do see Midnights from the hair but in my opinion the outfit is more rep/Hollywood glamour. I watched a video which theorised TS11 could have a Hollywood glamour vibe.
That interview where Taylor says she knows we look for easter eggs everywhere and starts wondering "is it insane of me to drop easter eggs for things like 3 years in advance"
Announcement for TS11 will probably be nearer to the end of or after the tour has ended, after debut and rep tv has been released.
Don’t ask me how I know or when it’s dropping but there is another album
The Zodiac are based on constellations. Makes sense an astronomer would be familiar with where the constellations are in the sky and when, even if they don't put stock in the astrological meanings.
What a warm welcome, eh?
😂😂😂
😂
it's also drunk people in the streets tho
Nearing middle age here, married and no kids. I’ve never felt the need to have children and I’m honestly very happy. 

When it comes to kids, weigh the pros and cons and do what’s best for you. 

But never, ever let society or other people push you into doing something that you don’t want. Your life is your own!
lol same! 28 with a dog, she’s my baby but like sometimes I feel like it’s too close to having a toddler. And she affirms for me all the time that, that kids aren’t in my near future lol
Tbh my plants are already stressing me out. How could I deal with a pet or a child? Even though I really love cats..
Same. Honestly the worst for me is that my profile looks so different. I don’t have a double chin, but it’s like the slope from my chin to my neck is so much less sharp. I hate it and feel like it ages me so much
Idk how far postpartum you are, but in case you’re still newly pp, give it time! I thought my stomach would never be as flat as before, but around 18mo out it went back to looking just about like before.
Knowing the answer and not wanting to accept it are two different things lmaaooo
Beep beep!
I cackled hahaha 😂
LA paps are the worst. Professional stalkers and harassers
LMAO I was gonna ask for a dupe too 😂😂
Oohh! I think you should! That would be so cute!
It's so expensive and concerts are messy (especially because I'd opt for a lighter colour)! But I agree it's a piece of art!! I am also REALLY considering it for my wedding to switch into. If my wedding was before the concert, maybe it'd be easier to justify the cost 😫
I’d love that! She’d rock it. I loved when Xtina did that kinda vibe with Back To Basics too. Taylor really shines when she goes for old Hollywood glam looks
Slut! has a very Hollywood glam feel to it. I love this look on her. She is stunning.
Mother knows we don't rest, always clowning, always coding 😌
Yep, near the end of tour I reckon, gives rep and debut time to live a minute before the next decade begins ✨️🏹
Ha, FAIR. You're still young, too. Either he'll change his mind or you'll naturally part ways. I'm sure there's a TS song for this ;)
That’s so hard. If it helps - you’re young and there are plenty of fish who will definitely commit to you.
Prayer circle for whenever you’re ready
They are the scum of the earth and literal criminals.
Yep! Wildest Dreams MV was stunning.
I wonder if she will get Artist of the Decade again
DO SOMETHING BABE SAY SOMETHING
LOSE SOMETHING BABE RISK SOMETHING 
CHOOSE SOMETHING BABE I GOT NOTHING TO BELIEVE
UNLESS YOU’RE CHOOSIN’ ME
YOU’RE LOOSIN’ ME
She's the artist of every decade for us, so I'm a little biased when I say that I can't imagine how she wouldn't be awarded that title again 😌
YES this... or simply 'tis the damn season.
Kendrick Lamar just passed Drake in Spotify listeners
”Numbers-wise, I’m out of here, you not fuckin’ creepin’ up” - Drake

As a massive Kendrick fan this means basically fucking nothing.
Tbh who cares atp
Well, there goes that talking point
Pretty sure drakes still getting more daily spins, good for kendrick though
This number will plummet as soon as not like us becomes old
Drake has had enormously more streams in the past 10 years and will have enormously more streams in the next 10 so this doesn’t really mean anything.
I support Apple Music who doesn’t pit artists against each other and feed into who’s got more spins narrative.
I really hope these type of threads stop by the end of the year lol
Pretty sure this is forced
Kendrick got you wiped down
Oh god not the numbers game. Look man - I love Kendrick. I listen to him every day but this means absolutely nothing. Numbers aren’t a good measure for how good something is (since that is subjective) and isn’t an accurate measure on someone’s actual popularity.

Take Nas for example. I don’t have Spotify, but I suspect his monthly listeners don’t even come close to either Drake or Kendrick’s. I don’t think he’s charted high for a good while now. However, he’s in most rap listeners top 10. 

Which brings me into the next point. Not Like Us has been hovering around 1-3 on Billboard for about a month now, so naturally his monthly listeners are up this month. Realistically, Drake will probably overtake him again next month. Kendrick has a somewhat *niche* audience (I use the word niche extremely lightly), whereas Drake makes music for almost everyone. Naturally, Drake has and will do better numbers for that reason. 

The two are practically incomparable. I think that most of us knew before this beef that Kendrick is the better rapper and Drake is the Jack of All Trades. Hence why almost everyone agrees that Drake’s numbers point was moot, like this post.
Kendrick won. He proved Drake wrong. Drake lost.

So what?

Drake is still doing just fine. Kendrick got more listeners. Cool. Drake is still Top 3 in Hip Hop and Top 14 overall. He’s fine. [+]
Less streams and he needed Drake to get here
![gif](giphy|oDXiRdueeFtE4)
I will only take this serious if i ever see Drake below 50 million, THAT’s when it will be laughable. Chances are this is just temporary until he drops another bland teenage love album 🤷‍♂️
Oh god who gives a fuck
So
R/KendrickLamar  12/25
It won’t matter long term…Drake is just too big of a crossover artist and he will always have a sizable lead over Kendrick when it comes to the numbers.
This aged Like milk 😭
Don’t turn this shit into the Kendrick sub bruh. Talk about something other than this fuckin beef.
get a job
maaan these short kenny bootlickers are riding him so hard
Yall do know when Drake drops this will easily go away right? lol
What does not like us even mean? In a crowd of people chanting not like us, is there no criminals or creeps?

Who is us? I am not with you guys I’m solo. Who does Kendrick consider us? Did his concert in LA screen all the participants for their sexual conduct?
And all he has to do is pop out and show ninjas
*monthly
Now Kendrick fans wanna talk numbers 🤦🏻‍♂️
Who cares Kendrick has always been the better rapper and artist and everyone who has taste agrees.
Drake’s the most listened artist in the world, fuck the guy… But c’mon, now numbers matter to us? Y’all pathetic, lmfao
[removed]
Both on 74,1M
[removed]
Oh no, let’s fire up the old Spotify and stream the hell out of D until my ears bleed!
YOOOOOO
Cool
[removed]
🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
U need drake to beat Drake
This has to be like the 400th repost verbatim.  I think it's funny too but just upvote and comment on 1 of the other ones. You're like 2 days late to this bruh
Can’t listen to drake no more
But does kendrick have a bigger d than Drake?

Haha

Yes.
They faces killing me why nobody gaf
The Drake stimulus package is crazy. Congrats on the #1 Drizzy
I think this only proves the bandwagoning is real...
Means nothing to me but I hope this means more people listened to Mr. Morale. that album is incredible in its own thought provoking way.
Ok
Holy shit do you guys really still care about this? I can't tell who's more annoying, the kendrick or drake stans.
Who gives a shit
It’s just gonna go back up Kendrick passed Drake earlier in the year and that was at the peak of the beef Drake gon pass him again
As a fan of neither in particular, I'm sure it's temporary. The masses will gravitate toward the catchier less thought provoking music. People want to be entertained, not enlightened
Why’s he wear a crown of thorns he thinks he’s Jesus or something?
😂
NLU has been number one twice in the past month so not shocked
He deserves his placement over drake.
![gif](giphy|J2CLvzhay29UwhkAKT)

Drake fans right now
Damn he’s still conquering his shit 💀
Only because of not like us. Once people stop caring about the song, it’ll go back down
Kenny fans won’t acknowledge Spotify doesn’t promote Drake, but they do promote Kenny.
and cause of drake
This number only indicates those who played a song in that month. Monthly numbers wise, Drake has been the most streamed rapper every single month this year.
“numbers wise i’m outta here you not fucking creeping up” mhm
Number don't matter. But we need to get over the "he did not affect Drake's career" cope. 

Dude has lost 10 million monthly listeners despite releasing 4 features post beef.   
There is a perceptible change in attitude from a lot of casual listeners about Drake.
dont care but good to see drake off that throne
say what you want, but it is the height of hilarity that after years of claiming just because drake does more numbers it doesnt mean he's better, that now all of a sudden numbers is something kendrick can dunk on drake with.

i know i know its because all drake has is numbers so kendrick managing to get more is a chess move directly against him, but still.
Ask yourself why….
Aubrey is screaming into his pillow 😂😂
Numbers didn't matter before and they don't matter now. Drake is fucking eons ahead overall in numbers but it don't mean shit. K dot washed him and is the undisputed rapper of his generation.
wild that neither of them are above eminem.
Is this a sneak diss?
I’ve been a huge fan of both for a decade plus. 

The last couple months drake on randomize gets skipped almost every time, I am literally afraid of someone overhearing me playing him. 

Kenny still bops anytime any place.
And eminems at the top
All that fuss about not caring about streaming numbers, this is all the K-boys are talking about now, hilarious…how many physical albums did K-comma sold vs Drake?
God's plan
Bro the beef helped Kendrick so much at this moment, y’all gonna downvote me but you know it’s true😭🙏
“It’s not about the numbers!”
People actually bump Kendrick?
“Tired of hearing bout who you checking for now, just give time - we’ll see who’s still around a decade from now.” Drake dominated a decade. And is half way through dominating another. The first time most people heard Kendrick was Buried Alive off of Take Care. Kendrick is miiiiiiilking Not Like Us lol
Kbots no one is rocking Kendrick outside of a few songs this is fake streams
[removed]
[removed]
But it feels good knowing HE cares.
It does to Drake fans, though. The only thing they bragged about now was numbers, and they don't even have that now.
It should. Kendricks a rapper, Drakes a popstar. The fact that Kdot surpassed somebody whose demographics expand from 12 year olds all the way through the spectrum to hip hop fans and casual pop music listeners is fucking phenomenal
as a hater of both, i still don’t care.
I don’t, but Drake probably does. And it makes me happy knowing Drake is probably sad out there somewhere.
Drake cares.  He made it a point to say Kendrick would never creep up as a diss.

Just another thing Kendrick made him look like an idiot for.
I'm no Drake fan, but Kendrick passing Drake momentarily in monthly listeners during a career peak doesn't constitute that he has Drake beaten in the overall numbers game. Drake's total AES are far above Kendrick's and his total streams dwarf him. There's a strong argument to be made though that a substantial chunk of Drake's sales and streams are from pop and R&B, not rap. More generic radio friendly songs that appeal to a wider audience. 

Funny enough, Eminem quietly has more listeners than either of them for a while now in addition to having the most AES and all his music is undoubtedly rap.
Drake might have the most streams over Kendrick, but then again, Kendrick hasn’t rushed out 20 albums where half contain the same topic. Quality over quantity imo
I’m glad we can admit it was bullshit lol
Those background laundromat playlists carry heavy
How many songs + features do they each have on the platform, again?
There's zero chance Kendrick's keeping up the chart pushing like it completes him somehow. He's gonna return to the hermit life and probably already has
Ay yo but that adds up to 20 years tho. That's too much for him 😭
True, however kidna apples and oranges when it comes to audiences and how and the product that both of them deliver. 

Kendrick has some club stuff, and stuff that has replay value. But he also has songs like “We Cry Together”. 

It’s a fantastic song that achieves exactly what it was intended to do. With that being the case 

I never want to listen to that shit again. 

Either way even if Kendrick got a billion more streams than Drake it doesn’t really change anything one way or another.
He better have way more streams having damn near 3x the songs.
Why not
Drake's got two times as many daily listeners as Kendrick dawg
I think the post is just signifying how confident drake was in his line and then it turned on him. Not that Kendrick is better solely because of the numbers
Proved Drake wrong how?
He never tried to be that kind of radio star, but just proved he could easily do it better.
Drizzlers suddenly stopped caring about numbers 😂

I do agree though, numbers don’t mean nothing. Just funny seeing the Drizzlers’ reaction.
I read that in the voice of Milk Dee
I think it's hilarious that we call 50 million monthly listeners laughable. That's how much of a champion of the charts Drake is lmao
Thank you!
he's dropped five songs since not like us (the heart part 6, wah gwan delilah, the sexxy red one, and the two camilla cabello ones)
Nah he had Dre on stage with him
Ah yes, tens of millions of people have bad taste except for you.
Shaming others for musical taste based on a rapper is wild

Clearly. Christians and Catholics pretty much all agree that's pretty blasphemous lol
lmao it's symbolic as the crown was to mock jesus for being a "messiah", it is the same with kendrick as him wearing a crown of throne is mocking the idea that he is some savior as he explains in some of his songs. u could also view this diamond encrusted crown as a physical example of the way that rappers use wealth and diamonds to hide and mask the pain and burden of their trauma such as the actually crown of thorns representing pain and burdens
NLU is his first number 1 hit in 7 years. Over 40% of Kenny's recent streams are from his Drake disses. After 15 years in the rap game, Kenny only had 4 songs to reach number 1 on billboard...

HUMBLE (7 years ago), Bad Blood (a Taylor Swift song lmao), Like That (a feature and Drake diss), and Bot Like Us (Drake diss)
And Drake stands correct.
[removed]
It’s not that at all. Kendrick fans secretly crave for him to have the success Drake has. 
Remember when DAMN sold more than More Life? We never heard the end of that one “Kendrick is taking over, DAMN outsold, Drake is falling off”…..
With them, it’s a clear case of “N****s downplaying the numbers, but that’s what they do when the numbers’ down”
"Numbers wise I'm out of here you not fuckin creepin up"
Good kid maad city, to pimp a butterfly,DAMN, section 80, untitled unmastered. These words mean anything to you?

[deleted]
Man y’all are weird 😂
When Drake surpasses Kendrick, they’ll just rub it in yall faces

Yall have shown that numbers do matter
Total album sales: Kendrick 8.5 mill / Drake 48 Mill 

Total Solo album streams; Kendrick 20. 2 Mill / Drake 41.4 Billion

Billboard Hot 100 Songs Kendrick 75 / Drake 333

Diamond Certifications; Kendrick 0 / Drake 3

**Gotta ask, what gassed you up to say "They don't even have that now"?**
Realistically Drake still clears by 100’s of Millions of streams across their entire discography. Kendrick isn’t catching up anytime soon. Neutral Fan of both these artist but god damn are both fan bases now the bottom of the barrel.
I mean overall he still up to 11billion just not on Spotify LOL
He still has the numbers he’s far and away ahead the most streamed, this is how many different users play atleast one of your songs
Not sure why this is downvoted so much. It is true that Drake is much more pop and should have a broader appeal. That would be similar to Kendrick overtaking Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish. It would still be fairly significant.
I feel like people can't even define pop music or pop star these days. It's just music created to be popular. Plenty of rappers make popular rap, Kendrick included.
Not really. Not like us was inserted into every playlist like  East German accordion, classical jazz, and Tibetan throat hymns.

Being that Spotify is only counting monthly listeners and not streaming leaders, it adds up perfectly
his fans definitely care too.
Y’all are so fucking miserable lol
I’m sure he’s just crying into all of his millions lmfao
He and his fans care so much , seeing them in shambles is the funniest shit ever
Kendrick would need to double his current lead and maintain it for like 10 years before he actually passes Drake in streams. This is a temporary (and well-deserved) bump in monthly streams for Kendrick. He should enjoy it while it lasts, but he still isn't creeping up.
He hasn’t? Drake is still the leading male artist streamed every month of 2024. This is monthly listeners not most total streamed..
He never said that. He said Kendrick won’t creep up numbers wise, because he won’t. History is done. K dot won’t surpass Drizzy except for Grammy’s (which is rigged anyways)
What does AES stand for?
Yep, fully agreed. Other than enjoying Drake fans getting twisted into a knot, I don’t care about numbers.

McDonald’s sells more burgers than Michelin restaurants. Doesn’t mean much to me.
I think what it does show is that if Kendrick wanted to, he could make radio music, and that realistically, the only reason Kendrick doesn’t get at least close to Drakes numbers is because he’s a conscious rapper who chooses not to make radio friendly music.
What’s/who’s the cause for this “career peak” do you think? 🤔🤔🤔
[removed]
How much of Drakes catalogue is buffered by stores and places like that playing his music though
Yeah but eminem is white, pretty much equal or better than drake having pop songs
i think Drake mentally needs to accept lots of stuff in order to even put a new record thats going to be a hit
You can't say that when most of his songs with high streams post '09 are Rihanna and Skylar grey hooks
Nah all of drakes albums have good and bad moments (take out honestly never mind)
Barber shop too unfortunately when they have pop radio on
canadian radio laws love drake b
[removed]
[removed]
Not sure of the exact numbers but Kendrick’s got around half, interestingly drakes still got higher avg streams per song
He’s rumored to be dropping a project this year, which is why the snippet was included at the beginning of the NLU music video
You can only listen to one song at a time, this talking point doesn't make sense. If the songs weren't great no one would be listening. Numbers don't tell you much, BUT if you wanted to use numbers, the fact that Drake has more average streams per song than Kendrick implies that people are more interested in listening to Drake's music than Kendrick's
How many times have you commented on this post dude, it's not that serious.
I mean the point was drake thinking Kendrick would never climb up in numbers got disproved.
You are comparing an artist who releases one album every 3 years vs an artist who literally spams songs
I get that, I just think that it’s a pointless post because soon, Drake’s numbers will be higher again. Like Drake’s initial point, the numbers still mean absolutely nothing which is why I think the post means the same amount of nothing as the line.
Drake said that numbers wise he’s outta here and Kendrick isn’t creeping up.

Drake said Kendrick and his fiancé separated. Proved wrong. 

Drake said Dave Free is the real baby daddy. Again, wrong, they are still cool. 

I can keep going but essentially Kendrick destroyed Drake in this battle and Drake is perfectly fine after being embarrassingly proven wrong over so many of his claims. [+]
glaze harder bro
I think people in general are tired of hearing about this drake Kendrick shit
Check the sub. Nobody cares. Drake has 2x daily listeners as Kendrick. Y'all making ghost people to laugh at I swear lmfao
[deleted]
nah, what it would really show is how negatively the beef impacted Drake lol
And OVERALL he has more streams than Kendrick. So what we talking about then?
all just features except for the heart part 6, an album or feature single from him would obviously do way more numbers.
Lol splitting hairs but Dres thing was Assault, not SA.
Drake is playable in the mall, that’s the millions of people you’re talking about. Kendrick is by far the better artist and most people who actually listen to rap will agree. Username checks out fr
You've been doing it up and down the thread.
This sub not allowing the N word is so stupid bro. You know black people browse this forum too, right?
Who cares?  That's irrelevant.
So is he a atheist or satanist or something
We know what’s your point tho ?

Literally if numbers mattered Flo Rida would be one of the greatest rappers in hip hop history and Nicki Minaj would be at the same level as Jay-Z. I can't take anybody's opinions on rap seriously if they bring up numbers, these people are clearly clowns that don't actually listen to rap.
and he's not. 100b streams to 36b. you're looking at the wrong system. nobody meant monthly listeners on spotify lmao.
He still has wayyy more streams outside of monthly listeners though.
![gif](giphy|lQ0VQmLuLH7lS)
[removed]
not a single one of his albums are pop bro. get some culture lmao
Is there video proof?
Certified ZIP file indeed
We a fan we a fan we a fan
i think Kendrick fans will be just fine knowing that he embarrassed Drake in front of the whole world.
It matters because the numbers guy who said “you’re not fucking creepin up” is getting crept up on. Dot beat Drake at his own game. It would be like Drake being more lyrical than Dot.
People are mentioning it because drake clearly does care, Kendrick has never shown that he cares so it doesn’t work as a diss to him
I mean, I don't really care, Kendrick was better before he had more listeners than Drake, he's still better now and he will still be better if Drake surpasses him in numbers. It's just funny that they were all like "still lesser than Drake 🗣️🗣️" and now they don't even have that because they ran out of arguments. Maybe working with Kodak Black and Dr. Dre, but I really haven't seen that many people using those angles, maybe because Drake really isn't that much better himself in that aspect.
[removed]
Nah it's just funny to me that he's proven to the world that he could get there if he wanted to. He'll go back to making really good but not as approachable music and those numbers will drop and I'll have a new album to listen to
Aye yo how is this not downvoted to oblivion by the k-thots
exactly lol, i'm a die hard kdot fan, but ppl need to realize that drake got numbers on top of numbers. not many people are gonna beat them. but ppl ALSO need to realize, drake makes his music to make money, and get numbers. kendrick doesn't. he makes his music to tell his story, and to spread love, he doesn't care if he goes number 1. but hey, that might be why he's better than drake too. he makes the best he can every time while drake, although he has usually incredibly good production, his lyrics are usually fairly simple and spunky, so he can "see the club" as kendrick said. but that's just me, ion fully hate on drake, i'll still listen to him a lot, i just love kendrick a lot more
Drake's songs can be considered R&B, NOT pop. Pretty sure Kendrick actually has more pop tracks than Drake lmao
His fans do care and when Drake surpasses Kendrick, they'll rub it in faces. 

People aren't consistent with their "numbers don't matter, numbers matter" stance and thats the problem
I enjoy both Kendrick and Drake’s music and I couldn’t give a single fuck
As long as he is crying.
Album equivalent sales
We literally made a post about it and laughed about it lmao. Nobody's twisted
Drake fans didn’t get twisted into a knot they are mostly surprised at how  KL fans who for years said numbers didn’t matter now skew every stat they can to make it look like Drake is loosing the numbers game which he’s not. Just goes to show the hypocrisy of KL fans
The McDonald’s comparison is so funny to me.  It’s an acknowledgement that Drake is the best mainstream rapper and if anything, he and Kendrick can’t really be compared.  I frequently eat at Michelin restaurants, but I eat at McDonald’s more.  Why?  Because it’s available and it’s a much better meal when I’m road tripping, after a night out, hungover, etc.  There’s other fast food, but I, like most people, prefer McDonalds.  Is it complicated food?  No, but I’m not going there for that.  I could get other fast food, but I usually don’t want it.  Just like I could listen to other mainstream rappers, but I usually don’t want to.  

What Kendrick does is great just like Jean Georges, Daniel Humm, and David Chang.  That doesn’t mean that what Drake does isn’t also great.  They’re doing different things.  While many fast food consumers can’t consume Jean-Georges, 11 Madison Park, or Momofuku Ko, all michelin star restaurant consumers can eat at McDonalds, and if you think they aren’t, you’re deluding yourself.  

Sorry to unload.  I’ve just seen the comparison so much and it’s just not the dunk that people think it is.
Drake getting rinsed, I would imagine.  It's clearly a victory lap for Kendrick, sponsored by the fans.
Relax bro
You're right, nobody cares... about your opinion 😂😂
Are you going to be fair and ask this about every artist, or just Drake since he’s the easy target right now? I mean they’re playing Not Like Us in arenas, stores and other venues - are going to put that under a microscope?
What? He don't need to focus on beef to make more great music. Hot Uptown and Uuugly prove this lol
I don't think so. He's got producers, writers and an army of fans willing to listen to whatever he puts out.
"Most"
IDK, I heard Like That and Not Like Us at the gym today, he's starting to hit that rotation and I'm in Jersey so there is no coast bias here.
[removed]
🤨
Where do you get that info from? That is pretty dang impressive if true.
Kendrick's catalogue is full of hard listens and challenging choices for the art. Drake is a shallow radio star. Do we need to be surprised that U gets less streams than Best I Ever Had?
Exactly! Like yes, in terms of total streams, having more songs out does matter. But in order to have good daily, weekly, monthly streaming numbers you do need to have music that is good enough for people to come back to.
See, average streams per song is indisputable, but the person I responded to was just talking about streams in general. The more songs one has, the more space that artist will take on the playlists of the people that listen to them. The more space an artist takes up in an artists liked songs, playlists, etc., the more likely they are to come up in rotation. 

If I listen to 4 hours of music and i shuffle nothing but Kendrick and Drake’s entire catalogue, there’s a high chance majority of that playtime will end up being Drake songs, meaning Drake gets more streams out of that 4 hour session than Kendrick would. Extreme example, but eh. Not to mention, more songs mean more chances for hits, and the style of music Drake makes means he has more songs that’ll stay in the general public’s regular rotation than Kendrick.

The numbers are the numbers regardless, overall, Drake wasn’t losing the numbers game, but a lot of people didn’t expect him to lose the numbers game in regards to the beef, regardless of whether or not Kendrick came out on top.
One person can only listen to one song at a time, correct.  Billions of people, however.  

Then you take sheer size of the catalog....


It's not hard, I'm literally writing a word problem for you right kow.
Never said it was dawg. No one's serious lmao
that was NOT the point homie. The point is that in terms of total streams Kendrick would never clilmb up. Has absolutely zero to do with monthly listeners lmfao. Monthly listeners isn't even an accurate stat considering that I could accidentally click on NLU and I would count as a monthly listener..
By your logic guccie mane is the one with the most songs released and " spams" them and yet he's nowhere near drake's level of streams. You dont get to attack drake's consistency of uploading much music but rather you should go for Kendrick's inconsistency of dropping every full moon if he's that good and that much of a genius he should be uploading yearly or every 2 years
Dude Kendrick ain’t creeping up in numbers bro Drake has 2x as many streams than him and that’s by billions and that’s just Spotify alone imagine every other streaming service 😹
Numbers wise, yeah he still ain’t touching Drake. He’s having his moment but a few months from now, back to normal. 

Are Kendrick and his fiancé are together? I don’t think we can prove either or. Just because she came to the concert and did a video doesn’t mean much. 

The Dave free thing was more about putting seeds of doubt into Kendrick’s head. 

Also Kendrick said soooo much cap as well.

The thing about fucking Wayne’s girl while he was in prison? Cap

The alleged daughter? Cap

Certified pedo? Where the victims at?

I came into this as a fan of both truly. I respected Kendrick more actually. Now? Fuck this dude. Starting this shit for his own ego and shine. I was falling off as a Drake fan but this shit revitalized my appreciation for dudes music and I’m not the only one.
Phoenyx get off of drakes dick youre in every comment, defending him.
Just 9 hours ago, you said:

“First track?

"They don't like us"

😈”

Seems like you’re still not over this. BUT OKAY.
I dont think it's possible for an artist the size of drake to be impacted by beef. I know drake lost the beef, but now I listen to him more than before.
Yeah... which literally proves my point that he's a champion of the charts if a fall to 50 million is low.
We're talking about how many songs Drake has released since Kendrick last released a song and what impact that has had on his career (minimal, not enough to keep Kendrick from passing him)
His first child was with a girl who got pregnant at 16 and had the kid at 17, much worse than anything drakes accused of, the worst we have on drake is him acting creepy to a 17 year old on stage. But even that his stage crew brought her on stage he didn’t even pick her out the crowd and he was about 22 at the time
Pay attention lmfao. I've been defending Drake, not shaming anyone. Eyes open!
They’re not gonna make a black person verification system
No it doesn't, when Kendrick himself is literally Christian. It might be irrelevant to you, but that only shows your bigotry and lack of respect for others' opinions lmao
how did everything i said fly over your head?
Kendrick is a glorified clout chaser?
Where's the detachment from reality? You do know there are more figures than just monthly listeners on spotify, right?
Drake is currently over 100billion streams Kdot is at around 36billion. Drakes point still stands.
[removed]
ain't no way y'all believe it was bots when I've heard NLU being played everuwhere
drake fans try to accept that people listen to the number one hit on the bill board hot 100 challenge (level: IMPOSSIBLE)
Fucking right.
ZIP file still deep, I can extract to desktop I promise
In regards to your latter, that's why a lot don't fuck with neither, but yeah it doesn't hold much weight in that regard because of what you said at the end.

Both men make music to sell numbers. Stop falling for that industry lie. 

If Kdot could reach drake audience and numbers he would. 

Y’all think Kdot just making music without projecting sales.

Can you name me a brand that is not focused on profits.
We're gonna have to poll this... Sure Drake has a lot of actual RnB songs, but you can't include all his huge hits like Controlla, Hold on We're Going Home, Hotline Bling, One Dance, etc. Those are all pop
Classic drake stan, can't admit they enjoy formulaic pop lol
i think Kendrick fans will be just fine knowing that he embarrassed Drake in front of the whole world.
Thanks for clarifying
Its just funny that the only thing drake had on kendrick was pointless and now that hes starting to lose it, you guys have even less to talk about
"Hypocrisy" lmao
It’s not hypocritical, it’s just noteworthy.  

When people say "numbers don't matter", what they mean is that by itself it is not an accurate way to measure the quality of the art. If a smaller artist suddenly shoots past a bunch of high profile artists in streaming numbers that would obviously be an incredibly noteworthy event.  

Calling it noteworthy isn't hypocritical, because it still doesn’t change the previous sentiment that by itself the numbers are not an accurate metric of the quality of art.  

Hypocritical is when you say the smaller artist is better specifically because their numbers are higher which is not the sentiment being expressed among Kendrick fans.
Having a sweatshop of ghostwriters churning out songs non-stop = best mainstream rapper?
Kendrick is a goof then 🤣
This is why you guys are constantly ridiculed. Enjoy your little farty beats and edgy rhymes.
Yep, I'll never downplay ems reach with all types of his music, (you literally can't) I'm just saying a large chunk of that are those types of songs so it takes a little from the point. I mean for that matter most mainstream rappers cater to multiple genres for many different reasons. And I understand it sounds good, but it's pretty much a useless stat to say "Biggest numbers, all Rap", when rap is literally the biggest genre in the world.

"Hard listens and challenging choices" is a wild way to categorize and gatekeep
yeah TPAB and morale outside of a couple songs are definitely albums i just listen to on my own.
So more people like listening to Drake's music than Kendrick's music?
[deleted]
So by that logic, that same thing could happen by mistake with Drake tracks.  Moot point.  Start over.
Moving the goal post. Kendrick went #1 TWICE in the span of a month and surpassed drake in monthly listeners
Outside of the gap between DAMN and Mr. Morale there is nothing abnormal about the rate Kendrick was dropping albums. Outkast literally released an album every 2-3 years. Quality over quantity. When Kendrick drops an album, it's some of the best material to ever grace hip hop. GKMC and TPAB are literally two of the most critically acclaimed albums in hip hop history. Kendrick could have stopped making music entirely after TPAB and still went down as one of the best rappers ever.
Kendricks last single before NLU and his Like That feature was The Hillbillies, which peaked at *93* on billboard. 

This was a clout move, in case anyone was ever in doubt
What are you talking about? The OP shows a picture that Kendrick passed Drake already. [+
You basically just said “I can’t prove that anything drake said is wrong🤷‍♂️ but also the Kendrick stuff hasn’t been proven true so he lied his ass off” lmao I’m sure you went into the beef so unbiased 😂
Im the opposite. I came in a fan of both and wondered where the young rappers were, just content to let these two fight over an imaginary throne?

When rap beefs like this happen its cause two millionaires are starting to run out of ideas.

Where are the young rappers at to step to these two nearly 40 year old men
I'm pretty sure the Wayne thing has been all but confirmed homie.
See, but the pedo thing is still a major L on Drake’s part even if it isn’t true. Drake has such a track record with questionable relationships with minors that the general public doesn’t find it too far fetched that the allegations could be true, even without concrete proof. Meanwhile, no one is running with the dv allegations on Kendrick because he has no such history. 

The fact that people are entertaining the idea of you being a pedophile because of past behaviors is what makes it scathing, regardless of if it’s true or not. Regardless, based on Drake’s history, it wouldn’t be crazy to argue that he’s a groomer.
The OP shows a picture that Kendrick already passed Drake. What are you talking about? [+]
Literally ever single one.
This is true though. I never listened to Drake before the beef post 2013

I still listen to a ton of Kendrick of course but a lot of those Drake timestamp tracks getting spins for me now. I didn’t even know dude still made rap since I quit listening after Nothing Was the Same lol
Literally same lmao
It's pretty much not. The memes and crap will go away. Y'all want to forget about the disturbing stuff around Dr. Dre, so we know y'all can forget
I haven't.t listened  to drake since the beef
fair
For one, feature songs don't count towards monthly listeners unless they're accredited, which HOT UPTOWN and U My Everything were not. UUGLY is, but it's an interlude. Nobody expected it to do anything. Same with Wah Gwan Delilah. THP6 speaks for itself, dude. That's two total songs. Your point was?
If it's all about association, Drake did enough with Future to combat the Dre cosign.
Lol cap
I thought they could sniff us through the screen tho

well, we already know billboard charts are easily manipulated and you can pay for spotify streams due to past exposure. not saying that's what kendrick did, and i really don't think he did. but it's possible. it's not stupid to theorize that especially when someone like joe budden says it's true
Hell yeah fucking right
Ain't that WinRAR? Wasn't it free? Please stop tryna make me pay for it

Dawg Kendrick has barely social media presence, he spends years between drops, and his latest album was a therapy album ffs. This is not the behavior of someone who is primarily concerned with popularity.
A ton lol. People obviously don't make music to flop but they can make music that is less accessible knowing it won't chart but would still be appreciated. Like you can't tell me kendrick made songs like Father Time, We cry together, mother I sober etc thinking those would sell a lot. I think they're all outstanding songs and pieces of music but thags music you play at a certain mood.

I mean Andre 3k released a damn flute album and you and I know damn well even if he shits out a rap album it would sell waaay more.
And Kendrick’s features for Taylor and maroon 5 lmao?
Hold on We're Going Home is clearly an R&B song, based on the rhythm and the bass. Controlla and Hotline Bling and even One Dance use a bit of Jamaican riddim, which cannot be considered pop simply due to that. Hotline Bling is honestly the best argument for it being a pop song, but the riddim in it kind of makes it lean more to the R&B side. 

  
Just looked up Hotline Bling and nobody can make their minds up. It's listed as both Pop and R&B in Wikipedia lmao. That one might be a stalemate. The other ones I think are pretty clear tho
No, i definitely do. But Drake doesn't fall into that category
Yeah idc much tbh. But it was a fire month when it happened tbh
Thanks for asking the question I was about to ask. All I could find was Audio Engineering Society, and I KNEW that wasn't it lol
Loose what Drake is still the most streamed rapper in the world by a huge margin even after this beef. That’s why KL fans mad they thought Drake was gonna disappear 😂😂
The only thing? "They're not slow" is aging horribly right now wtf lmao
Y’all the biggest hypocrites 😂😂😂
One thing to get out of the way Kendrick is not a small artist all. He had one of the biggest tours and his streaming stats are up there as well. 
Noteworthy? Sure but i don’t think it’s what most Kendrick fans think. The sentiment for most of them is to use this to show that “see Drake fell off because Kendrick defeated him…” and statements along those lines. That’s why i call it hypocrisy. If Drake had a hit song as diss they would just say “well he just proved that he’s not not a real rapper he’s just a pop start nothing new…” because most KL fans i had discussions with whenever i brought up comparisons to Drake, they dismiss him as pop star and use it to say there is no substance to his music which i disagree but now that some numbers seem in their favour now let’s talk about it?? 
You see the hypocrisy?

Also most of the media try and skew stats in KL’s favor like Spotify say NLU is the fastest song to reach 300M streams, you ever wondered why 300M in particular?? Why not 100M or any other arbitrary number because they just wanted to highlight NLU and that’s the stat they went by. 

Same skewing of analytics happening here: monthly listeners is of course gonna go up NLU is a #1 song rn. Streaming wise Drake is still leading by a big margin and since the start of the year and multiple years going back but let’s not talk about that and say “numbers wise, you’re not fucking creeping up line from Drake aged like milk…”  isn’t that hypocrisy?
Kendrick a goof for dominating your boy crush on wax?  Sure.
Your extreme oversimplification of the music of one of the GOATs of rap just shows me how much you know. "Farty beats" and "edgy rhymes" don't make you the highest selling hiphop artist of all time smh.
I don’t think “Hard listens and challenging choices” is gate keeping in the slightest, it’s just pointing out that Kendrick makes music that isn’t radio friendly, maybe doesn’t have a spot in most people’s playlists, and can’t just be thrown on whenever. You don’t see/hear people playing a lot of songs off of MM&TBS or TPAB, because despite them being good albums, they’re not easy listens, they deal with heavy, touchy subjects that make them hard to listen to in a lot of scenarios. 

Auntie Diaries and Mother I Sober are beautiful songs, but they are absolutely hard listens because nothing about transgender rights/transphobia, or generation trauma and abuse, is easy to listen to.
Who tf told you rap shouldn't be gate kept
The point











You
He’s just talking lmao, he’s allowed to do that 😭 this sub is for discussions
Yes, that absolutely could. But that's for monthly listeners, which I'm not talking about. I'm talking about daily listeners and streams, which use different metrics.
Okay? Drake has two times the amount of daily listeners, and even tops Kendrick if you take away every single one of his featured streams. He dropped one album with a grand total of 3 #1 hits. He's tied with Michael Jackson for #1 hits. He's the first artist in history to hit 100 billion streams. He's the best selling rapper in history online-wise and has sold the 2nd most amount of physical albums for a rapper (Eminem is 1st, Kendrick's like 8th). It's not even close. Monthly listeners was never what he was talking about. If you actually used an inkling of sense, it would be clear he was referencing streams in total, not monthly listeners where one experimental listen in a month counts as a monthly listener. If I listened to NLU and hated it, I would still count as a monthly listener. If I accidentally clicked on NLU and plaeyd it, I'd be a monthly listener, If it played on the playlist while I was on autoqueue, I'd be a monthly listener. Stop all that fallacy shit and come up with a decent argument.
No he would have not, even now he still not even top 6 oat
For one whole month wowww
That’s not what I’m saying at all but I’m not going to lose time in my day going back and forth on this topic. There’s a few more things Kenny said/narratives he painted that rubbed me the wrong way. So not just Tea being spilt but from the horses mouth. And everyone has bias, it’s in-escape but I can say that at one point I thought Kendrick won, but as the dust settles…
>Where are the young rappers at to step to these two nearly 40 year old men

Being honest? Most of the best ones died. 

Mac, X, Pop, Juice WRLD, and others. All of these guys should've been entering the heights of their careers by now, but they're all gone now. 

Now, there's a generational gap without as many bona-fide acclaimed ones as we wait for the youngest ones to establish themselves. So instead, we have to go through a pointless exercise as this beef and other before it that suck up all the oxygen in the metaphorical room.
Confirmed that Kendrick lied. It’s in Wayne’s journal that they got together before. And the clip yall gassed here didn’t confirm anything
Ain’t this from him beefing with the #1 guy? You think Kendrick will keep being ahead of Drake once the dust settles?
I feel like a lot of these ice cold takes about Drake come from people like you (no offense). They stopped listening to him over a decade ago but they keep sharing their opinions about his current place in the rap world. It's wild lmao
Drake isn’t making those accusations though. If Kendrick is trying to stand on moral ground he’s basically singing that song to Dre while they’re standing next to each other
What about them? We were talking about numbers.

Doesn't really work when Drake and multiple other artists have denounced the grammies publically. And pulitzers being corrupt since the 1940s.
This dude salty as fuck 😂
You go out to clubs or partys?
Y'all didn't like my corny ass line?🥺
This zip file just gave me a virus or sumthin

You an idiot if you think Kdot make million of dollars going in the studio just to make therapy songs.


I’m tired of trying to teach y’all how the music game is done behind the scenes.

Kdot lack of social media presence doesn’t mean he is not behind the scene.

Look at playboy Carti…he is super mysterious, about his online scene but has a cult following. Most of Curtis song are not on Apple Music or YouTube…but rather Spotify and soundcloud…but Carti is still selling out shows.


It’s called brand and marketing!!!!!
Bro this is not what I’m saying.

When these big artist make an album they want to sell. Yes, not every song is meant to be a hit.

So you will get these fillers on every single artist Albums. Eminem is a good example, he had a song like Stan on a album release but he also had a threw away song like FACK.

Kdot is the same as drake. When you look at a song like DAMN…do you think Kdot wrote it or do you think the label provided references.


I’m coming from a place where I have a few friends within the music scenes. I’m not cappin it just how the industry works.

Both Kdot and drake are playing characters.

Kdot playing the black messiah…it’s easy to sel trauma as it relates and if done well gets you Grammys.

Drake is roleplaying as the new Michael Jackson. Because of the numbers he is pulling. Yet again if done well people will believe.
First of all, nobody said those 2 songs were not pop...

Secondly, if you're going to welcome yourself into a conversation to try and make a point, at least acknowledge the points being talked about. We're talking about which Drake songs are pop or not, and your helpful interjection is to point out that Kendrick's 2 most obvious pop songs are indeed pop... Good job bro 🤓👍
Are you now trying to say Drake doesn't even make pop music?
No it’s not lmao 😂
Oh yeah? What else did drake have on kendrick? Its not his writing ability, none of his albums even compare to kendricks (take care is close but he didnt even write a good portion of it), all he had was higher numbers and even those are from his songs where he doesnt even rap
>One thing to get out of the way Kendrick is not a small artist all. He had one of the biggest tours and his streaming stats are up there as well.  

Just to be clear, I never said Kendrick was a small artist, I was just making a general example. However, Kendrick's overall profile is definitely smaller than Drake.  

>Noteworthy? Sure but i don’t think it’s what most Kendrick fans think.  

And here is where you're wrong. 

>The sentiment for most of them is to use this to show that “see Drake fell off because Kendrick defeated him…” and statements along those lines. That’s why i call it hypocrisy. If Drake had a hit song as diss they would just say “well he just proved that he’s not not a real rapper he’s just a pop start nothing new…”.  

Because here you are putting words in mouths and creating a strawman rather than listening to and learning from differing opinions.  

>because most KL fans i had discussions with whenever i brought up comparisons to Drake, they dismiss him as pop star and use it to say there is no substance to his music which i disagree but now that some numbers seem in their favour now let’s talk about it?? You see the hypocrisy?  

First, you're making assumptions of and applying a blanket view to an entire group based on some interactions you've had.  

Second, Drake is obviously more mainstream leaning than Kendrick. I don’t think that robs him of substance at all, but like other mainstream artists his brand is more associated with numbers.  

Lastly, this is not hypocritical. You keep giving wrong examples of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is if I say "high streaming numbers don't make Drake a good artist but they do make Kendrick a good artist". People are not saying this. People think Kendrick is a great artist regardless of any accolades, but when he gets those accolades people will celebrate. You can't determine the value of art from numbers alone, but you can celebrate an artist getting more publicity from it. That's not a contradiction. 

I feel it should also be mentioned that Kendrick probably does care about these achievements because he's independent and they literally represent his own bottom line.  

>Also most of the media try and skew stats in KL’s favor like Spotify say NLU is the fastest song to reach 300M streams, you ever wondered why 300M in particular?? Why not 100M or any other arbitrary number because they just wanted to highlight NLU and that’s the stat they went by.

Streaming wise Drake is still leading by a big margin and since the start of the year and multiple years going back but let’s not talk about that and say “numbers wise, you’re not fucking creeping up line from Drake aged like milk…”  isn’t that hypocrisy?  

No it's not. Again with the wrong example. This is not a hypocrisy, it's a false equivalency. The media is talking about a song and you're talking about a catalogue. Compare like to like. Not Like Us is a trending topic and becoming part of the cultural Zeitgeist that's why they're covering in, but specifically they're reporting on what the song is doing, who's dancing to it, how it's being parodied and whether or not it's breaking records. If Drake had released a song to do that they would be reporting on that. We know that for a fact because when God's Plan released that's exactly what the media did.
good luck gatekeeping one of the most popular music genres on the planet
If I play a Drake song right now, it is a stream.  Whether I choose to, or it pops up and I don't skip it for whatever reason.   

Try again.
You don't have to be top 6 to be one of the best rappers ever but I guarantee you Drake does not belong anywhere near that top 6 to anybody that actually listens to hip hop. Maybe on a top 50 list if he's lucky. Literally Redman could rap circles around Drake TODAY let alone in his prime. LL Cool J is actively rapping circles around Drake with his new album.
How does that change what Drake said? Drake said he’s outta here and Kendrick ain’t creeping up. He did. He surpassed him. One month. So what? Drake was still wrong. It’s simple. Stop making this complicated. [+]
That's why the world is laughing at Drake and nobody is pressed about DV allegations. Whether you can admit it or not, Drake is not a trustworthy figure, Kdot is
Lmfao so he still got with Wayne's girl.  The timing was off.   Wow, bullet dodged there!
It all comes back to the culture bruh.   Drake can have his numbers and his radio airplay, it's not about that.  The culture chooses Dot over Drake 9/10 times.

Somebody said this thread makes it worse for Dot and they are right.  He doesn't give a fuck about those streams.
That’s not at all what Drake said. He said he’s outta here and Kendrick ain’t creeping up. He was wrong. That simple. [+]
Well luckily I won’t take offense because I don’t share opinions about his current place in the rap world haha I couldn’t even try to place him anywhere in it because I just haven’t listened to him really 

I just know when he does rap, it’s usually solid
Again, if it's about association, then they are both fucked.  Drake came up under Wayne and Birdman, who is one of the worst individuals in the game period.  Dot had Kodak on his album.   We can do the rap math all day.
yeah, but we don't blast songs with sexual abuse allegations at the parties i go to
Maybe you’re a whore for money, but dot is set for life. If all he cared about was sales, he would’ve made another DAMN. Style album. It’s not a coincidence that his most accessible album is by far his most commercially successful. Idk how you can call me an idiot when that’s exactly what happened btw. He literally made a therapy album. Also funny that you mention Carti, because him doing all the mysterious stuff is why he’s about to fall off. His fanbase is getting tired of him always being radio silent, acting like he’s too cool to give them a straight answer about his next drop, and not dropping in general. Current Carti is not someone to emulate if you want to be successful. He became famous because he was a completely different person back then, and he can only get away with the shit he’s doing now because he’s already famous. Also, maybe you’d be more credible if you could spell Playboi Carti right.
I have friends in the music business is the most common trope for people cappin, you don't know for shit who used reference tracks or not, we go off whose had them leaked, name a Kendrick reference track that's been leaked other than those he's done for other people.
Terminally online bro 😂
no, he makes some pop music. That is NOT his main genre.
This comment thread is proof haha
Btw, Marvins Room, The Motto, HYFR, Crew Love, Take Care, Best I Ever Had, Over, Started From The Bottom, and such songs from Drake's older era are all considered hip-hop
If KL was a better artist the he would be more listened to than Drake. The truth is Drake is better and people like his music better he doesn’t have to pretend to be an activist or make pretentious album or beef with nobody.
Bro literally wrote the entire Take Care album. He had assistance, but so did every other rapper in existence whoever dropped an album, including Kung Fu Kenny lmao. Yes, GKMC is the best album of the big 3. But Take Care clears MMATBS, TPAB, and even DAMN. And the other ones are debatable.
Maybe you haven’t been around in r/kendrick or on X most people bringing out NLU stats or commenting on them they talking about Drake most of the time. I’m not strawmaning Kendrick fans at all or using my personal interactions. X and the general sentiment on Reddit is just a sample of opinion i can base my judgement on. This particular general sentiment is by definition hypocritical because the same people if you say Kendrick was falling off before beef (since his numbers was down) they say numbers don’t mean you fell off. These are the types of convos people were having and still are having.
If you don’t think that hypocritical then your definition is different than mine or you look at some of this behaviour in a favourable manner to Kenny fans so you can’t see the hypocrisy. 


Analytics are skew, it’s part of marketing. Like i asked why 300M in particular?? 
Answer: Because that puts Kendrick ahead

You wonder why no one saying that Drake has a lead in streaming numbers in of any rapper since the beginning of the year despite nasty allegations and it being public opinion that he lost a rap beef?
Same reason marketing. Those numbers are not posted or talked about but they are facts and are more impressive depending on who you ask. Also Spotify got beef with Drake because he was pushing for artists to be paid more. Kinda like how he got beef with Grammys and he will never get any more even if he wrote an undeniable classic ( the ignored the Weeknd’s After Hours because he wasn’t going to perform, but this was album of the year to many people) so go figure Drake has dissed them and they’re still salty about that. Though this is a bit off topic.

Of course Kendrick cares about numbers all artist do independent or not. Numbers mean you have more eyes/ears on you which all artist who publish they work want. 

Again it’s hypocritical and you haven’t shown me why it’s not. The only thing i got from what you said is that you personally aren’t in the majority of people who use these numbers as a way to put Drake down. If don’t think you’re in the minority go in those places where people are having these convos
🚩🚩🚩🚩
Consider this. I hate NLU so I never want to listen to it again, but I've already played it once in this month. I'm a monthly listener. But I never play it again, so Kendrick isn't getting any daily streams from me. The song NLU pops up on my playlist, and I skip it. I'm going to be more careful from now on that Not Like Us doesn't pop up, and I might even hide the song. Kenny got a monthly listen from me, but no daily listen. Also, Drake has two times the amount of daily listeners as Kendrick. Kendrick has about .5 million more monthly listeners. Factoring in some mistakes, it's realy not even a comparison, and the analogy you're trying to make falls short. Even if a bunch of people misclicked on a Drake song, literally 31 million people would need to do that every single day for it to make an impact vs 500,000 lmao. Odds are way more in Drake's favour
I think the context of his argument was notoriety and lifetime metrics not monthly streams (for one month no less)
Yes but now Kendrick’s numbers are about to creep back down as the diss track hype dies after the summer
"Dear baby girl" has entered the chat.

Kendrick is NOT a trustworthy figure
That’s that moral high ground shit that Kendrick is riding on. These DV allegations are more than a decade old. And whether it’s with Whitney or someone else, it does strip away Kendrick’s can do nothing wrong imagine. 

Why is the world laughing at Drake? Cause they been waiting for it. The amount of people who straight up hate Drake is up there. In his early days until now. A lot of these people aren’t even hip hop but they still thirsty for a reason to drag dudes name. This app included. But if you wanna follow the crowd, do you.
He wasn’t Wayne’s girl you goof. He fucked before they met
Bro what culture?! You’re telling me that Wayne, someone I’m guessing you co-sign as “the culture” took Drake under his wing and bro went on to be the biggest hip hop artist for 15 years and inspired and influenced sooooo many artist within the “culture” but he’s still outside the “culture”? Who dictates who’s in this culture? It’s all bullshit. That’s one of my big issues with Kendrick during this beef, bro is doing a great job dividing mfers and making people wonder “who invited to the cookout” type shit when we should be trying to unite and come together as one. Regardless of culture or background. Fuck Kendrick.
Bro it’s business.

My bad for the name calling. But your take is delusional.

It’s all business kid. These conscious rappers are all actors. None of it is real.

Another lil secrete even Kdot has writers. Mj didn’t write Billie Jean also. 

I’m not tryna be mean but it’s Smokes and mirrors. Most hit songs are written by ghosts in all popular genres.
ik kdot and he said he cares
Listen if you’ve never been in the studio with artist it’s cool bro.

Trust me most pop songs are reference tracks. 

The same way beats are getting passed around.

Most reference tracks are not leaked. Drake is an anomaly on why so many of his leak.
Oh I agree with that, but you said Drake's songs cannot be considered pop but he has made quite a few of them
Grandmaster Flash also made a statement about how Drake is absolutely hip-hop for his ability to hop on ANY type of beat.
[deleted]
More people liking drake doesn’t make him objectively better lmao it makes him more popular. Opinions are still subjective
>If KL was a better artist then he would be more listened to than Drake

This just in: The Big Mac is the greatest sandwich of all time.

Also, if that’s your opinion, then surely you think Taylor Swift > Drake, right?
If streams and sales are all that matters then is taylor swift the greatest artist of all time? Is dance monkey the greatest song of all time? 

How is kendrick a fake activist? What about his albums are pretentious? Is it pretentious to shed light on social and political issues?
delusional take. and the Weeknd wrote at least like 4 songs
Lol you just made a whole ass argument for second place.
Take Care does not clear TPAB, not even close, but agree to the others.
TPAB will be talked about decades from now, take care won’t
Here, you mispelled 🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️🏳️
I was simply playing devil's advocate.  I couldn't care less about the numbers.  Kenny is simply better.
Again, how does that change what Drake said? How does that change the fact that Kendrick proved him wrong? 

IDK why everyone has a need to make an asterisk to try and say that Drake wasn’t proven wrong. [+]
He doesn't keep any such image. He trashes himself publicly.
Cool I really don't care that much.  Def not enough to read another man's diary, public or not.
Doubt it.
[removed]
okay, lemme rephrase lol. he is not MOSTLY pop. he does have a couple pop songs, but so does k dot.
You good? Why you thinking bout all that lmao
Subjectively it doesn’t mean he’s better but objectively it does mean he better: why do artists put music out in the first place?  Show me an artist who put out music and say “ i wish no one listens to my music”. All artists want to has as many listener as they can that’s why they put music out.
Second, imagine an artist who is the best (checks all the boxes for what you consider to be the best) at their craft but just burns it after creating it. Would we still give them that title? Fuck no! We never heard it.
Drake is the best because despite releasing double the music Kendrick did over a decade plus years lots of people still listen to his music and most importantly connect to it. Now you personally might not like it for some reason but fact is music is made to be consumed by people and most like Drake over Kendrick’s music so objectively he’s better
Burgers is just a bad comparison, both products need to be equally accessible at the same price point

If you put Gordon Ramsey in every McDonalds and had him sell his burgers for the same price as a Big Mac it’ll sell more

And Taylor is great at what she does, this is the rap subreddit though, no one here thinks Taylor > Drake but there’s 100’s of millions of people who do
She is in a sense depending on how you want to evaluate: 

1.Subjectively: numbers don’t matter and your opinion is as good as anybody’s 
I’m sure her fans feel this and who am i to tell them otherwise.



Objectively: numbers and influence on the artform or medium matter.
Based on my knowledge she got the numbers down but influence on her particular lane of music i don’t see: she doesn’t push the boundary of her artform  based on my limited knowledge and i don’t see artist who claim that she had influenced their music or who sound influenced by her. And she hasn’t brought new blood to her particular lane of music. So no but bear in mind i have limited information on the pop genre.

In terms of rap, Drake ticks more checkboxes than Kendrick in all of those objective aspects of evaluating an artist. So he is a better artist than Kendrick.

Side note: numbers matter because if no one was listening to Kendrick and he had the same discography he has but no one listened we wouldn’t be having this convo would we? I’m pretty sure there are better technical rappers than Lupe, Kendrick or who ever else has a bit of clout (ei: King Los) but as great as they are i wouldn’t call them great artist for the same reason. NUMBERS MATTER
You mean co-wrote lmfao. What kind of a take is this?
Hell yeah. I admit that Drake doesn't have the best album. Now you're mad that a Drake fan is admitting there is something Kendrick is better at? What the fuck?
that's opinion but yeah tpab is an amazing album either way
this comment is ridiculous considering it is literally over a decade since take care released and it's still one of the most streamed albums lmfao
Here's a stance that actually makes sense lol. I respect that you think Kendrick is better, as long as we're not with that hypocrisy bullshit
But bro who gives a fuck? Yall act like he’s such a horrible person. He’s not painting himself as an angel he’s a regular as dude who came into the game overly hated and now 15+ years later he’s still hated but has dominated this shit like no other. I’m not here to convince you anything, I’m painting the bigger picture to why people were eager to see him fall… and he hasn’t

I was singing this shit in the grocery store today lol
it was over before it even started 💥🫡🥶🤯🔥🗣️
Too BBL or not to BBL, that is the question Drizzy
Metro really made a whole song about another man's ass. Ya'll really gassing a repetitive beat
Why y'all thinking about his ass?
Uh, yuh, call me BBL drizzy.

High school girlies make me feel jizzy.

The head so great it make me real dizzy.

If I see twin nine’s i be whippin out ma glizzy.


Messin with me will leave yo ass unconscious. 

Money I got it, flaunt it like yo daughter want it. 

Light skin BBL, call me Pocahontas.

Leave you in the past, son, Adonis.


Diddy’s my homie, we both had our fill.

What could the cause be (Cosby)? Better ask Bill.

Sugarcoat my sweet talk just like a senator

To distract from the fact that ya boi is a predator.
Lmao this is so corny..imagine being this emotionally invested in people who will never know your name 
metro really is a lame, and does everyone on this sub hate drake more than they like kendrick? its weird
[deleted]
Singing about another mans ass is kinda crazy not gonna lie
Metro flopped, he thought straight dudes wanna be boppin and thinking about drake's backside for 4 minutes. Get outta here. 

Even not like us is better, and that's about paedo allegations.
This beat sucks. No rapper with clout going to spit over this. 
If this doesn't clearly show the bias of this subreddit, idk what does lmfaooo
Redditors that never hit the gym have to project their weight insecurities on to someone. Who knows maybe he did get some surgery. Still in better shape than most of you.
Praying on his downfall don’t make you a religious man.  Drake with facts Kendrick with thirsty false info.
Caught myself saying this at work and said yea metro won the beef 😂
Especially because he made it a contest and has all these other rappers dropping Drake disses. 4D chess.
1 hr loop if anyone else needs it in their lives: https://youtu.be/PWj885qfojs?si=Iljd-d1p9ssh4O05
Dude that song less than 48 hours old ain't it?
[deleted]
For sure having fun but ngl Rick Ross hopping on the "drake a fake" bandwagon dont sit right with me 😂😂

"You know rick reading my miranda rights" was my favorite line outta drake lmao. If kendrick didnt clap him so hard rick mightve taken a hit
Drake should have used that beat for one of the disses he put out😂😂
Idk why that flute sound with that line is so satisfying 😌
I think you meant no drizzy

That’s the new term these days
I’M GOIN IN, FULL DIDDY
Shit drake told him to go make some drums.  Be careful what you wish for lol
9 Monkeys type shit
Metro groomin
Bars 😂
r/drizzy is in denial rn
Brazilian butt lift. Calling out drake's plastic surgery
Average redditor here young enough for this to be their first witnessed rap battle.

In before "OMG, lol, average redditor here young enough for BBL Drizzy to be interested, I am so smart."
Ayooo his allegations be wild🤔😭😭 like “Nice try bucko jokes on you, I was waiting to see if you’d fall for my TRAP but points already made… well, this was good exercise”🤣🤣
Well, keep in mind that BBL Drizzy got bodied. People are still hype which is understandable. Good post.

That's a big-ass assumption from a single shitpost
Plus, you're weirded out that people are invested in a rap beef on the rap subreddit?
Bro this is called every artist sub Reddit that exists
y’all hate when ppl have fun 😂😂
Nice try, Drake.
You're the one commenting on a low effort shitpost.
False binary ⚖️
Says who? The point is to humiliate the other person on the receiving end. And he accomplished just that with this. At least he's not running around saying "I just got them done, don't make me break a nail" THATS not hip hop.
Drake told Metro to stfu and play his drums so he did. Why you mad?
Drake is a grown man with a BBL. How could we not clown that?
I mean Metro did what Drake told him to do, and he's not singing so......
Why?
You think getting down voted will make Aubrey notice you?
Cope harder
Drake is a bubble gum pop star
Yeah, you know who else got facts? Mediocre white dudes. But their bars trash too. Lol
Me too and everyone started laughing 🤣 it’s a bad week for Drake… or BBL Drizzzy
Yeah bro I'm actually Metros ghost producer. We've been cooking this one for a week
Didn't Ross flow to the original that Metro chopped up
Got the best BBL in history
You know it b(bl)aby.
I will never forgive Metro for this
Either or
[Sure](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=L8Za5OpX8bM&si=ZeK5C5OfvzWbZPmN)
He actually reused the snare from Ice Attack lol
Thanks lol I kept thinking it was “be back later”…
I knew someone was going to mention this one the moment I read the question 😂
>big-ass assumption 

i see what you did there
Nah you guys actually think you’re involved in this. Hysterical. Following a rap beef is different than being so emotionally invested that you think you’re involved 😂
I think that’s corny too. This specific post is next level though 
The big homie was so emotionally invested in the post he came just to hate...but we don't even know his name 😂😂😭
You think this isn’t corny? 
Metro groomin want some more
It’s still a song about another mans ass 😩. These yams deserve a trophy? 

Lmao I mean you do you I guess.
We need lik nas x on the track 😆
There is a banned 2024 word to describe metro's track and I believe you'll find the correct terminology in old diss tracks like Easy E Real Muthafuckin, ether by Nas.
He has soo many hard hitters man.  50 cent said go ahead and switch the style up and if they hate then let them hate and let the money pile up.  This is 2024 artists don’t have to be real gangsters to rap.  Artists don’t have to be black to rap either.
Drake goes harder than 99% of these other rappers, especially his older stuff. Still can’t find anything that comes close to the vibes on “What a Time to be Alive.” You describing Nicki Minaj with all that bubble gum pop bullshit
Mediocre ain’t Drake he gonna go down as one of the greatest whether u like it or not haha
I'm his other ghost producer it's actually been two weeks
Aint that the same week Drake was convimcing kendrick that he was a pedophile?🤣
Where can I find this?
THIS CAKE WILL MAKE YOU SHOW UP
Why did you link the beat? And downvote me lmao? Is there a misunderstanding here or what?
That's the only one I heard, and I don't need anymore after. Straight fire.
But he didn't say he's involved? Did anyone even say that?

The latest update was literally yesterday, people are excited and clowning. I don't do it, but that shit's normal
It’s more corny you trynna tear down a random person whose just having a laugh. maybe you should have a laugh too. Also I think you have to be aiming for a target to be corny. This person just dancing n laughing cause life is good ! Stay blessed !
It's trolling, is he not allowed to
It’s the funniest roast, idk why you’re thinking so deep into it lol deep into his cheeks.
Oh, theres *no question* whether Drake goes down. Hahaha
I'm his great aunt and Metro actually wrote this in 1996.
I KNOW YOU SEEN THIS GLOW UP 💆‍♀️ 💅
[https://x.com/NemRaps/status/1787247779561033911](https://x.com/NemRaps/status/1787247779561033911) did you see this one? twitter is going off with this stuff. there was also kid with.an electrict guitar who was shredding over it, was super tight
I never said I was weirded out. Why did you say I was? 
“You are but what am I” is the corniest comeback 
Of course he is lmao, I just find it funny this man went in the studio and made a beat about another mans ass Saying his ass deserves a trophy 

Way to stick it to Drizzy Metro
Funny
Can confirm. I'm his great aunt's younger brother. Metro thought about how he would write it mid-1995
💀 that ain't the same and you know it, but I'll try to explain

When you said the post was corny, and to imagine being so emotionally invested in these celebrities, it's reasonable to assume that you mean it's a weird thing to do

When someone makes one post repeating a diss that came out of an ongoing beef, it ain't reasonable to assume he literally thinks he's involved.
ouch 😰 man you making me hungry thinking bout corn
No, you’re upset that your Queen is getting clowned. BBL is wild lmao
I'm Metro from the future. I produced the track in the future, with Future.
I don’t agree. I think all of you think you’re involved. Repeating it in a celebratory manner and/or to antagonize freaks who think they’re involved in the other side. It’s corny and you are corny. 
Good you can finally put something in your mouth other than rappers. 
I’m the man that killed Metro in the future and can confirm based off his diary that he made the beat 
Metro from the Future... I'm crying 😭😂
brother projecting hard
You’re weird
😭😭😭 YOU A FREAK LIKE DRAKE HUH why you thinking bout that stuff. Cut it out. You looking strange
Im Future Metroman. I play for the Mets and invest in stock Futures.
Lmao can’t take them out of your mouth for even one comment 😂 

Try the “no u” comeback again. It made more sense. 
Bro why u so upset? …

Edit: After reading ur other comments u def having a shitty day rn 😂
I ain’t surprised you so worried about “comebacks”. They probably help you pay your bills with how much of a Hoe you being 😂😂😂😂
Taylor posts a picture with Prince William, his children and Travis before the show yesterday
she posted on Twitter and Instagram. second pic is from the Kensington Palace social media.
never thought we’d see taylor wishing prince william happy birthday before evermore but here we are 😂
Oh Charlotte's face in the second picture almost brought me to tears. The pure joy on her face.
On the 2nd pic Prince William looks so honestly excited!
Dying at Travis with the USA hat 💀

And now they're Tiktok, Youtube, Twitter and Instagram official 👀
[removed]
So cute!!! They’ve had such a hard year with their mom sick - glad they got to enjoy the show. 

Were they in a special tent?
Just casually referring to the future king of the United Kingdom as M8 🤪
i RAN to this sub. 

ITS MISS AMERICANA AND THE (…?) PRINCE(S)!

i love travis in the bg of the first pic lol, insane way to do a hard launch but also iconic
And she’s wearing one of her The Man jackets? Iconic.
Those kids look so happy to be there. I wonder why Prince Louis wasn’t there maybe because he’s too young?
Hard launch ft. the Prince
Not bad.
This is so lovely for those kids with what their Mum is going through ❤️
Happy for those two little kids! Cancer is a true bitch…  She must have a soft spot for them considering Andrea and Scott’s cancer battles 🥹
she really saw sabrina’s hard launch and said “hold my beer” 😭
america's royal couple meets the British royal family
Charlotte is an actual princess, but this is probably the first time she ever thought her dad was cool 🤣
Been a rough few months for those kids so nice to see this 
I discovered that she was playing when I was on my train down to London yesterday, there were loads of people on the train going to see her and the conductor was even getting people in the mood for the gig. Good vibes all round really.
It’s great to see that she makes so many people happy. I quite like her music. 
Unfortunately I looked to see if there were any resales available and they were way out of my price range!
I hope you guys all have a nice gig, Taylor Swift is a legend!
I just had to come on here to express the complete and utter JOY of seeing her post so candidly on Instagram again!!! It really reminds me of pre rep era. Just a cutie picture with the royals and her man! Love seeing her so happy.
Little Charlotte in her sparkly outfit and braids. Oh-so-adorable!!

I really hope Kate will feel stronger come August to see Taylor’s return to London. I’m positive Charlotte won’t stop talking about the show for a long, long time, haha.
This right next to the hottest photo ever taken is quite the profile! Lmao
OMG, I absolutely love this! They all look so happy, especially Charlotte! As a royal fan and a Swiftie, my life is complete! 🤩
I’m just here for those kids, they deserve happiness and to be kids ❣️

Hard launching in LONDON with the future kings of England is just hilarious and perfect.
Do you guys think Price William sings along to "Fuck the Patriarchy" in ATW? 

In all seriousness though, this is awesome and I love how happy they all are.
[removed]
I'm almost 33 years old, and I have no idea where this phrase started, but this is my roman empire! I live everything about the Royals and Taylor Swift, of course. Loving the crossover!
This is my favourite pic lmaooo. She hardlaunched him in London🤣🤣
Well no paternity test needed there
I know this isn’t *about* joe or any of her other British exes, but I can’t help but think of fucking FUNNY and ironic and what a sick burn this ends up being anyway. The best revenge is truly a life well lived 💁🏻‍♀️
Is this the first boyfriend she’s posted on Instagram since Calvin? 
It so bizarre still, that she actually hard launched their relationship, in a selfie with royals, in London. And it all just seems so casual. Am I in the right timeline? 😭
There’s nothing more funny than telling someone you can’t meet them before concert and then getting with them and them seeing you see other people before the concert all the time! I know there’s so much going on but like that’s my favorite thing  ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1069)![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1066)

Go team, USA ! 🇺🇸 kaw kaw mffff
In this week’s “Outta The House”….
I think it’s really awesome that she was able to make those kids smile so big when they’re dealing with their mom being sick. Taylor knows what that’s like.
It’s Instagram official you guys
Taylor and Travis def be getting invited to the coronation
I’m a big fan of William and Kate. Let me tell you: their haters and Taylor’s haters overlap like crazy. It’s wild. 

If you go look at some other groups talking about this picture, you’d literally think it was Putin, Trump, and Kim Jong Un hanging out instead of three incredibly wholesome famous people.
What a way to hard launch on feed
Love this, and I love that she posted on her IG. Of course, there is hate about why does she needs to hard launch when she's already been public with Travis, but let's look at how many people still think this is a fake relationship. They think a breakup is coming, that he is a beard, or just because they don't follow each other on IG they aren't really together. I can't.
HARD launch IN LONDON! So Long, London! ✌🏼
So nice of William and his kids to visit royalty
Calling the future King of England M8 is hilarious. Also, I’m leaning more now to the speculation that they’re dropping the E news this weekend.
This is so funny because she’s in the “the man” outfit. SO RANDOM 😂🤣🫶
God they’re growing up fast
I saw this picture 90 minutes ago and since then I've been imagining Travis' conversation with future King George and future Charlotte, Princess Royal, like oh hey do you guys like football? I brought some jerseys! George super wide eyed: are you playing in the euros?!?!
THIS IS NOW MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITE PICTURE OF THEM!! 💖
“Better put my sparkly Man Jacket on. This is serious 🧐 👑”
I don’t know what to focus on. Taylor casually referring to a future king as “mate” or Taylor casually posting a picture with Travis.
Why is this so adorable? 😭
I hope they enjoyed their night! They deserve a night to just be kids and have fun. Hopefully Kate is feeling okay!
I love everything about this picture
I love that the even the young royals are obviously star struck.
I had been following the Kelces since their Super Bowl and was shocked when my worlds collided. If anyone had told me a year ago that this image would exist I would never believe them. Super cute photos though!
Charlotte looks so dang cute in this picture! I saw a video of Prince William dancing to 1989, I’m guessing his era is 1989?
The way I RAN here as soon as I saw this post lol.

They are all absolutely beaming…soooo cute!
The contrast in comments here vs. at fauxmoi is so mind boggling to me
Wasn’t on my bingo card actually
The Joker and the Queen
this is so cute 😭😭 also what a way to hard launch
I thought she didn't talk to people before shows? I guess The Royals are worth making an exception for
Sad that Princess Catherine can't be with them
Better than following their team at the Euros
Happy.
Where’s Louis!
My question is where’s Louis?!😭
Iconic 🌟
As a fellow balding guy, he needs to just completely shave that head. Maybe grow a beard.
Prince William wishing he could get away with wearing a baseball cap our.
I’m obsessed. I wish Kate were there!

The future king of England and the future king of America
Look how happy William is. I don’t remember ever seeing that kind of smile from him? I bet it’s because his kids are so pumped!
Tayroyalty tayprincess tayqueen 🙂‍↕️
Oh the royalty in this picture (I'm talking about taylor and Travis)
Omg this makes me sooooooo happy Tay and Travy 😍🥰🫶🏻
Aw I love this, it's so funny and wholesome
i’m not a fan of the royal family but this is rlly cute
Awwwww
William should just shave his head.
I was surprised to hear everyone describe this as a hard launch? Is it really? I thought that had already happened but I guess not officially from her?
In this picture are two future kings of the United Kingdom, and to their side is a musician who is richer than royalty, and deserves it.
OMG a glimpse of Queens Swift!!! Sorry Travis!
Abolish royalty
Did Taylor curtsy?
Ain’t that nice
Damn them royal genes are strong
It was his birthday on June 21st
[removed]
Has Taylor ever posted Joe on her main feed?
Now Taylor can say she met the future’s royalty
Okay I’ve literally never caught an Easter egg or attempted to but anyone think there’s more to M8 than just “mate”? Month 8? Are we getting Rep TV in August? 

Let me live my 🤡 life
Both those kids HAVE NOOO idea who Travis Kelce is. They don’t watch football 😫
I love how Prince William posted the photo without Travis 😂
[removed]
I don’t like these people. 
where’s Prince Louis? huhu
It’s grosss that the royal family get to meet her but die hard fans, nahhh
How is it? She’s able to meet with Royalty, but I can’t even get concert tickets.
The M8 has to be some kind of Easter egg, right?
Bro, they need to think about firing some servants. That boy’s shirt is wrinkly AF.
Taking a picture of taking a selfie?..... that's a main character post for sure
Taylor swift 😂😂😂
Blah
LMFAO i just choked on my redbull.
💀
The deepest cut.
Sissss 💀💀💀
Yeah happy for those kids. I know they’re rich and royal blah blah blah, but at the end of the day they’re kids who both their mom and grandpa are going through cancer treatment, and that shit’s not easy to deal with emotionally no matter how rich you are. Hope they had a great time!
I love that she’s all decked out in sequins, the same way any girl would be.
I didn't notice travis when I first saw it because all I could see was the joy in her face
William looks so excited in the second picture two. He’s a legit swiftie you can tell
That was my first thought!! She looks thrilled.
I loved this! Seeing her just be a kid and that unadulterated joy.
You know you're a pop megastar when an actual princess gushes over seeing you the same way any other young girl would.
They all look like all of us - the video of Prince William boogying down is sending me
That is the face of a little girl who is worth more than a singer. Taylor is worth $1.3 billion, Charlotte is worth $4.4 billion
Did you see him dancing to shake it off? Man was PUMPED to be there
>USA hat 💀

He's about to go full American revolution mode
A single tear is running down a bald eagle’s cheek right now after seeing this photo. 🦅🦅
It’s an Olympic hat as well.  The Is US Olympic trials are going on now.
Can’t wait for the inevitable ‘Travis, we gotta talk about it’ from Jason on the pod about the hat lol
I kind of assume he was making a nod to the American OLY trials starting yesterday, but it's a funny as hell coincidence all the same 🤣
[deleted]
literally nobody else would care about some hat
wait has she never posted him before???
2 future kings!
The fucking BALLS on Travis 🤣
Funny I was just thinking how precious William took his kiddos to meet royalty last night
i thought you just called her "Queen Shit" lmaooo
Pretty funny how that Tay hate sub was saying they broke up last week
literally a hard-launch flex
King of the United Kingdom*.
That’s baller as hell man
What do you mean hard launch her BF on insta? She posted an instagram live with him? Correction- IG reel
She hard launched after a month of dating, lol. This is not news.
yes they had a suite! so not exactly a tent but yes, a private area.
The Royal family has the Royal Box at Wembley. William is the President of the FA (the football association), so he and the family attend often.
That was my first thought! This was probably one of the best nights in the last few months for all of them and Taylor made it happen 😭. They all look so happy!
They were up in the suites.
theyre honestly really nice
The pic was jarring until I remembered they're apparently besties...? Still wild.
[deleted]
Precisely 😂 I had no idea they were so close
I am not following the M8 reference?
And here I was thinking she was referring to the M8 motorway which runs from Edinburgh to Glasgow
Miss Americana and the British Prince! 🫶
The USA hat is hilarious. Like thank you for bringing our girl home Travis
Travis was in all of these and Charlotte had him photoshopped out 😂
Maybe she thought wearing only the bodysuit was a little too risqué for a meeting with royalty? Or maybe it was cold 🤷‍♀️
Am I the only one who think Louis would kill at this show
The show ends at 11 pm, I think. That would be too late for Louis, he’s still very little.
Kate Middleton was stayed home with Prince Louis.
Imagine this being your life.

Imagine being Travis Kelce??
Hard launching with the future Kings(s) of the country where both your ex's are from. It's a huge flex.
I’m trying to think of a more iconic way of hard launching. 

“Just my M8 [the future king of 10+ countries] on his birthday [celebrating it at my show] and his kids [royal children looking thrilled] and also there’s this guy in the background [multiple Super Bowl winner, regularly called the the GOAT of his position, the President of the US addressed him by name and invited him to the podium to speak a few weeks ago, and most importantly, we are dating]. Happy Friday!”
I’m seeing the phrase “hard launch” throughout this thread, can you explain what that means? Edit: Thanks for the explanations, guys!
Yes Travis is such a bright, polite and distinguished gentleman
Same!! Two worlds colliding 
I’m crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So iconic.
Right! Those genes are STRONG throughout the entire line. Especially when you consider that Harry looks like an exact clone of his grandfather (as a younger man, with a beard) which knocks all of the rumors that he is not Charles’ son out of the water.
I bet the fact that she was depressed at the time had something to do with her limiting visitors
Can't wait for Jason's "what is your life, Travis?"
fauxmoi called them both colonizers

it was wild
How would she announce it? They’re a great couple, I’m just wondering if she’ll casually be wearing a ring in a photo or if she’ll say something. 

IF the speculation is true, of course
E news is what?
wait where have you heard this?
Omg please I’ll die. I try not to get involved in the parasocial aspect but I’m also engaged and would loveeee to see her in her engaged era 🥲❤️
There have been a select few pre show pictures that have come out but they seem few and far and only like close friends 
Nah there's been lots of backstage pictures with people she actually knows. There's a cute one with Kobe's kids and with Billy Joel's family.
[deleted]
It was probably super late for him to stay up
Besties, really? It’s not that deep 
100% agree. There are not enough comments like this.
I don’t think she ever did. Closest she ever got was Instagram stories on conversations with friends. Calvin made appearances and Tom made one but that was back when she was very active on social media. She doesn’t really post personal things anymore.
[deleted]
The one with Travis is in their story though lol
He probably paid for a suite. You can too - for about $25,000.
tbf their mom/his wife has cancer that taylor knows about. I am sure she is sensitive to that considering her moms health
That’s how life works
because she's a super famous pop star ??? this comparison makes no sense.
It just means mate. It’s common for Brits to write it like that.
No, it just means mate which is just a casual term for referring to a friend.
M (13th letter) - 8/13? My head went there too. 🤡
Also Taylor's mom has/had? breast cancer. I bet she had some kind things to say to the kids.
I feel for them with the grandpa having cancer treatment. My grandpa had lung cancer when I was a kid and it was hard to see him fight his cancer. I’m definitely thinking of the Royal family during this difficult time.
Yes! And her hair looks like it has tinsel in it.

Honestly ALL of them have joy in their face and I'm sure it was something they really needed with everything going on with Kate.
I noticed that right away! Charlotte dressed up for the concert and I love it
Fearless colors too. 🥹
Yes! I thought the same. So cute!
Yees, that video is so funny, it made my day 😂
There’s video? I heard there wasn’t any of the royal family.
This just made me find it on tt and omg that is the best thing ever lol
I...declare...~~BANKRUPTCY~~ INDEPENDENCE!
I remember when they started dating, (Taylor with an American again,) seeing someone on social media say I’m telling my kids this is how we won the Revolutionary War 💀
Hahaha
[removed]
I was just joking because he's wearing it next to British royalty, it's obviously not a big deal, though
Ever heard of the American Revolution?
Lol Americans love to make sure everyone knows they are American whenever they go to a different country 🤣
Never on insta. She posted the Super Bowl after party on TikTok, the fortnight challenge on YouTube reels, that was eventually shared to instagram stories, but this is her very first Instagram post with him in it. 

He also liked the post, which is the first time one of them has acknowledged their personal Instagram account. She’s previously only liked a New Heights post, they usually stick to media accounts (nfl/espn/people) or friends’ posts to like.

And he just went through and liked the last four of her posts 🫠
Not on the grid, though obviously going down on the field and celebrating his wins was their hardest launch 😂
She posted Travis in an ig reel awhile ago
Not a direct photograph like this, no! He's been in her TikTok reel after the SB once, and her Fortnight challenge.
She did on TikTok and Youtube (Shorts)
And the future Princess Royal. I love her cute sparkly little dress!
At first I read your comment that Travis was a future king (if he ever married our queen).
and future prince consort of the united states 🤣
He's saying So Long London 🤪
It took me multiple reads to understand what they were saying. Probably cause I’m old.
I initially thought the same! Lolol
That sub is so toxic. Took a peek once and noped out immediately.
And Canada right..? And.. Australia? Am I making shit up? 😆
...she has not?
Suites are probably better from a security perspective- the VIP tent seems pretty accessible based on based videos
✨Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best m8s✨
https://preview.redd.it/l7utnfjak48d1.jpeg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d0306b93d3cd3fa1c18c61cc233dab84de7e65f
They sang together back in the day.
Wait nvm she’s calling him mate right ? Lol omg I am so dumb
It was her insta caption :” Happy Bday M8! London shows are off to a splendid start 🇬🇧🇺🇸🤝”
PERFECT OMG. i need to finish my energy drinks before i get on this site 🤦‍♀️
there are technically rules for how you have to dress around british royalty. I attended an event where the queen was (not anywhere near) and i remember a knee length dress/skirt was specified. might be something like that.
Even if she didn't think of it I'm sure she was told that for photos she would need to cover up a bit. The rules may have relaxed since Charles became king... but not that much 🤣
He absolutely would have! Prince Louis would have rocked the show🕺😂
YES.
I definitely thought this, the kid has moves, haha
Seeing the kelces at wembley yesterday really was funny to me. Imagine telling any of them a year ago how much stuff would change. Jason, travis, and Kylie all are really great in their own rights, the jason documentary really showed how much of a normal family they could be. This has to be such a mind whirl.
One day you’re making a friendship bracelet with your number on it and the next your gf is introducing you to the future king of England. Must be so wild!!
For reference, this is what this man's life has looked like just this month: https://x.com/sohighschooll/status/1804503550015230272
When someone first posts their partner on social media, it’s known as a “launch”, kind of like a company launching a new product. 

“Soft launch” is like posting a pic on your story where the partner’s hand is visible, but you can’t tell who it is. 

“Hard launch” is HEY. Here’s this man’s full face on my main insta post.
She uploaded the photo as a post, not just a story or reel. It’s more permanent as a post, so that’s why people are calling it a “hard launch.”
I think it means an "official" display that confirms a relationship. Back in the day this might have been updating a relationship status on FB but now its more (I think) photographs on social media.
It's like confirming you are really dating someone, like posting them on your own social media.

Versus a soft launch like showing up as an event with someone and paps or fans taking pix
This is the first time she's posting Travis on insta. So they're talking about her hard launching Travis lol
I might not have the definition entirely correct but it’s like Taylor herself officially confirming that she and Travis are together. (I would’ve considered that the tiktok of them singing Love Story at a party a few months ago)

A “soft launch” is like posting you holding hands with someone but you can only see your hands. So your friends would see it like “she’s in a relationship but we don’t know with who” so a “hard launch” is like a “this is my partner, we’re dating” confirmation.

(Hope I explained this well enough to get the idea 😅)
When you go “official” with something.  A soft launch is testing the waters out. A hard launch confirms things.
Same question here.
Gonna be funny to hear the "king" comments after Jason said fk Kings on New Heights last episode.
Fauxmoi also hates Taylor. No wonder Shake it Off is William’s anthem
i’m guessing tree would give an exclusive to people mag and then she’d start wearing a ring. idk abt social media since they aren’t very predictable with that sort of stuff lol
I honestly don't know that they will. People can't crash a wedding that they don't know is happening.
I think they’re going to go out to dinner .. pap walk and she will have ring on
I think they’re referring to an engagement as the E news
Engagement
I think engagement?
[removed]
You can see her wearing the Lover necklace, this was pre-show.
She's nearly always in the Lover bodysuit when she meets with people. After the show she typically legs it out of the stadium.
She never posted Joe. She posted vacation pics with CH though 
When did she post Joe on her main feed?
UK resident here… I will have helped pay for that suite, unwillingly, from my taxes, that keep them. And I couldn’t afford to go.
I already did with my taxes mate, just annoying that the royal family once again get special treatment over the British working class by virtue of their heritage. Nobody is born more deserving than anyone else. This is also a clear attempt to appeal to the youth as they’re losing popularity with us, and it’s frustrating. Your uneducated condescension is appreciated for giving me a reason to go further in depth however.
I get the point you’re making but it’s definitely not about that, if that was the case why didn’t she just visit a hospital to support those suffering or give this privilege to a regular fan who actually feels the difference to their pockets to be there. 

Just aggravating that there’s tons of people out there who will struggle with their bills to be there to support her and experience her music, but it’s the rich kids that get to meet many famous people all the time and live a life of unimaginable privilege that get the best things.
And some sweet loving hugs too I guarantee.
I didn't even think about that. I hope they had a great time and it made them feel better.
I believe her mom had something going on with her brain too but seems to be better now!
I hate that Kate had to miss it, she would have had fun
So much this! They deserve to have some fun and be semi normal kids for a bit
Truly the epitome of what everybody should look like during shake it off

r/unexpectedoffice
Love the office reference
Some might even say they survived the great war 🫡
why be negative? what’s wrong with the hat? they all look happy, there’s nothing wrong with that.
It’s wild to me that you, or anyone, would have this much intimate and detailed knowledge about someone else’s online and personal life.

EDIT: I just realised what sub I have wandered into so that explains it. Still weird to me though.
She looks cute & looks so excited!
it's technically possible she could be Queen
Me too lol
Hahah same it took this comment to make me realize
🤣
Jokes on you. Joe is anti royal. 
Fellow old person here. I think the way to read it is “It is Queen shit [something a queen would do] to hard-launch [first time ever post] her boyfriend on Instagram with the future king of England”. But I may be wrong—I’m old.
I've reread it several times and it still looks like Queen shit to me. Although I am also old 😂
Not because you’re old, but because they didn’t use punctuation!
Yea I sometimes browse all/controversial just to see what those kinds of users may be up to and I find subs like that I had no idea existed
[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_realm): Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, The Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and the United Kingdom
I think they mean the ig reel where you can see him for half a second cooking
exactly, especially for royalty. they don’t even sleep in the same rooms as each other for security reasons, i don’t think they’d be in a tent on the floor, surrounded by thousands of people in open air lol
Yes I know but I didn’t know they were on “mate” basis 😂
Oh my gosh I’m dumb too I thought it was a security code name like MI6 or something lol
Thank you ! I didn’t know what M8 meant lol and I am married to a Brit ! Then I realized it’s intended to mean “mate”
I couldn’t stop thinking about what Jason thought about yesterday. You watch your little brother grow up, become a man, become a hall of fame tight end, and then in literally the blink of a crinkling eye, you’re in the vip tent of a world-famous mega pop star, whilst said pop star is singing songs you probably listened to on the radio in college, to your brother. One of which she wrote *about him*.

This past year and a half (it really started with the Super Bowl) has been absolutely insane for that family. And it seems they have really stayed as grounded as you can in their situation.
It’s got to be a little scary right? Like this overwhelming love could turn to hate so quickly. 

I don’t think Jason and Kylie would get hate, but it’s gotta be intimidating dealing with this!
He knew what he wanted and boy he got her
I appreciate that he earned the first picture too. XD

Like - it's pretty solid proof he's at the top of his career too.
I commented about this as just such an iconic hard launch! The *President of the United States* invited him up to the podium, which if we’re being honest most people wouldn’t have cared about if he had even been invited to do it without dating Taylor Swift, but now the world is invested and it was shared EVERYWHERE.

I honestly can’t imagine Travis’s life right now. 

Taylor already knows her power, (I can fix him, no really I can, and only *I* can) but to just be lifted from already killing it and feeling like you’re on top of the world to this astronomical level from dating someone has to feel insane.
It’s kind of silly to describe this as a “launch” tho, since they’ve been very publicly a couple for going on a year now.
The tiktok definitely was a hard launch too, but instagram is more like changing your relationship status on fb. It's all a bit silly for people so famous (their true soft launch was those comments to media last ~August & the hard launch was her going to the game)
I think I’m still a little confused lol! Have they not been official since last fall? I thought the two of them had already talked about each other publicly and all that
I can see that happening!
She did say we (rightfully!) weren’t invited to the wedding! 😂
So low key announcement! Something subtle
I mean we don't know that for certain, just there's been rumours.
Interesting, I didn't catch that, good eyes. Looks like you may be right.
I've seen a lot of pics of her with VIP's in the midnights bodysuit, sometimes she's pretty sweaty as well. Guess it probably depends on when the VIP's arrived or the scheduling.
Maybe I’m thinking of his Instagram when he posted her cats
She did not, Calvin was the last one.
[removed]
glad i'm not the only one who wants to roll my eyes at all the gushing over this family. i only see one royal in these pictures haha
Absolutely.
It would take significant planning for her to visit a hospital and could cause problems for the patients and staff. It also just simply takes more time than taking a selfie with someone backstage after a show. I agree I wish she would do more things like that tho and I get the frustration that omega wealthy kids are the only ones who get these opportunities. It isn’t fair. I am not sure what the solution is.
How come no one is saying this?
Aww thanks!! You’re the best :)
Yeah, almost as if they don’t have a life of their own. Yet here I am…
I’ve always thought it was so funny that they actually changed the law when Kate was pregnant, to allow first-born daughters to be the heir. 

And then she had a boy first anyway 🤦‍♀️

At this rate, that law will never be used. But I guess it’s still neat that it existed.
I don’t understand it either 😟
did anyone else read this in Yakko Warner's voice?
Well, this is news to me. Holy shit 😅
That wasnt posted on Instagram either, it was on Youtube.
I think even Wills knows Taylor gets to do what she wants. If she says you’re her M8 then you are. Who is he to argue? Future king of a few countries? She’s basically Queen of the world right now. He understands rank. 🤣
Friend of his friend  .lol

Travis is friends with Rob McElhenney and William is friends /former room mate at Eton with Humphrey Ker (from Welcome to Wrexham
That is what I initially thought too ! Lol
That’s what I thought as well! 😂
I did too!!
Well the M8 does run from Glasgow to Edinburgh
I’m really excited to hear them discuss it on their podcast
I think it’s significant because as far as I know these kinds of posts never happened with Joe.
Yeah that’s what I thought too, I was so confused, but I guess it makes sense since it’s her own social media that she’s posting on
Yeah this is really silly, they literally were making out on national tv at the fucking Super Bowl, the hard launch been done launched a long time ago 😂
No, you’re right. But I believe people are using this phrase because it’s the first time Taylor has posted Travis on her instagram. Thats why they’re calling it a “hard launch”. 

But I’m old lol, so maybe I’m missing something here.
Yes, the game was their hard launch or you could argue the first Karma is the guy on the Chiefs. The ig post is just  what normal people would do for a hard launch lol, give or take some royalty.
I'm just hoping that whenever it happens, if it happens, that she shares some photos
Sure but the rumours were started by ET which feels pretty relevant
Yeah that was his way of casually reminding everyone that he’s dating her lol 
Yeah that’s what I thought too
No, not at all. I don’t think most people care. And the money I pay to keep them, I’d much rather it go to schools or healthcare
On top of that, they're not just any omega wealthy kids, they're benefiting from regular UK citizens. They get their wealth from the people based on the idea that they are somehow better than them because their family was chosen by God. I wholeheartedly understand why UK citizens would be upset about this. 
Happy to help!!! 🫶🏻
It's cross posted to ig but may have been TN not her main account
“He understands rank”

😂
So true 🤣

Queen of the music industry > King of a few countries
So glad I’m not the only one 😆 I even know that M8 means mate it just didn’t connect.
Oh they ALL went out of the house!  Can't wait!
Last (and only?) boyfriend she posted on Instagram was Calvin Harris
Exactly my thoughts haha!
Ah that clears it up thanks! I guess I’m not well versed in instagram feed rituals lol
No you're correct. It's viewed as another "step" for people who use their instagram as part of their brand/persona - because if Travis messes up, she now has to unfollow him or deal with it on her socials.

There is also a level of - she's never really done this before. Note too how big of a deal it was when all Taylor's friends  (like Ryan reynolds) unfollowed Joe. It can be a big step depending on the people, and that's a very big step for Taylor.
You know she’ll have a killer wedding dress 

I’d love for her and Travis (or whoever she marries, if she wants to get married!) to have a private ceremony and then share photos a few months or years down the line
Who is ET?!
I mean yeah but they are still just children. They didn’t choose to be born into the royal family. They obviously aren’t more deserving than every other child in the UK but its also not like they are choosing to profit off british taxpayers
Ah gotcha! That’s what I was thinking of
I mean the smile on his face is as giddy as Charlotte’s
It's really just since she went private after Snake gate. She posted Calvin a ton. There's that Hiddleswift fourth of July photo even though they dated for like half a second.
Entertainment tonight. They’re the magazine that Taylor’s PR usually goes to for updates and PR responses. They broke Taylor and joes break up for example
I don't think it's their fault. I just know I would be upset if my taxes went to these two particular kids going to Eras tour. The monarchy is incredibly controversial and just by being in the family, the kids are unfortunately part of the controversy. I think it sucks they don't get a normal childhood and seeing this through the lens of two kids with a rough home-life getting to meet Taylor Swift is very sweet, but ignores a ton of context that many UK citizens feel passionately about
They all look as happy as I was to finally be at the Eras Tour!! But it’s Taylor Swift taking the picture!!

I just love the layers to “he understands rank” 😂
Oh haha - I didn't know! I wasn't around for Calvin and I was just aware that she didn't really post her more recent gents. Six years is longer than I've cared about it, lol.
I doubt that everyone ive seen in fauxmoi freaking out about this is british. And for context, I have lived in Scotland and they aren’t fond of the monarchy there, I am well aware lol. I also doubt that tax payer money went to the tickets. You can’t buy meet and greet tickets for this tour. She probably gifted them. Tax payer money probably went to transportation but I doubt that it would be much more than usual outings for them. (but also abolish the monarchy)
I've never been on fauxmoi, it seems so bad over there! My family was subjected to indentured servitude by the British so it's always been abolish the monarchy. It was kind of visceral to see how many people support the Royals and William specifically here. I don't think any of this is cute outside of some kids getting to meet Taylor Swift. So cool you lived in Scotland, I would love to visit some time! 
Has Anyone Checked On Drake?
Man, that Kendrick Lamar concert was incredible. He really put California Rap Culture on full display. His attire was apparently an homage to 2Pac. 

Performed Not Like Us 6x (in honor of the "6 God")

Drake gotta be feeling salty right now. That song is forever attached to his career.

The show looked like it was fun and live as hell. It's been a while since I've seen a rap artist having a crowd like that. 

But yea, anyone got a status report on the Canuck? 
Locking this thread because it got way too toxic and there were too many reports.
He’ll be alright. His fan base still diehards lol 

Show was super fun to watch though. Energy was electric
Goddamn what happened in this comment section????
I called him.  He said he's cool, a little sad but hanging in there.  I told him I'd swing by later with some yearbooks to cheer him up 😂
Listening to the crowd going crazy at A minooooooooorrrrrrrrr TWICE? Drake needs black grandma love right now. Someone to rub his back while telling him it's gonna be okay, and make him a plate.
Im sure he’ll post something on insta soon posturing like he doesn’t care. He must be warmed up to this level of bad attention after the Push beef so he should be ok in the long run but yeah.. that was a lot. What a historic moment for hip hop culture. This should also be a cautionary tale for him to understand this is what happens when you do something so distasteful like using AI pac. How out of touch do you have to be to do that
Drake the type of guy to send a homie to the concert and live stream it just so he can join and send angry face emojis
Vancouver Canucks Aubrey is not.  We ride for the Westside.
Drake (and his fans) needs to just stay his freaky ass inside.
The crowd rapping every word was fucking crazy
The feds got him under surveillance, they'll make sure he's ok
OVhoe glazers in shambles rn
Drake is an actor attacking the people he pretends to be. It never ends well. He’s a pop artist in over his head vs the likes of Kendrick and Pusha. This is what happens lol
I reached out to him on IG and asked how many tissues he needed to make it through the night, but he didn't respond. It's not like him to ignore IG like that, so I think we need to have the Mounties do a wellness check.
What’s up with all the drakes getting they ass violated
Where the hell has Lil Wayne been in all of this?
r/drizzy collapsing into anarchy and rage
DJ Akademiks probably at Drake's house cuddling him telling Drake he'll be okay.
Drake probably at New Ho King ordering the fried rice with the dip sauce scoping out teen girls
That was the funeral service for drake DrDre saying see dead people. The crowd rapping word for word. Or Finish the punchline A minor all together. Bringing it back 3 times and every time the.crowd was hyped even more. Yelling OV hO OV ho
And than all the ball players on stage (drakes fav betting sport) blue rags red rags all together. That shit was fire 🔥 pure overkill. Loved every min of it
r/Drizzy a hilarious place right now
Sure, I watched him get buried last night
Top post on Drake was about Whitney being there and it got locked lol a few of the posts have been locked today 

The cope is in full force
All I wanna know is:
What’s wrong with being a 69 god? 
Is 69 not cool?
B r u h ethered him so hard he’s cosplaying as a Cowboy now
Just as dorky and lame as he ever was. So, no different I guess.
You know Drake fell to his knees when he saw Lebron in the crowd
Drake is the new Ja Rule
I bet he’s working on producing a female pop singer who just turned 18 (and who we will find out was actually 14 a few years from now).

These Pedophiles never quit, they just move on man.
Dudes living and vibing 🤷🏾‍♂️ idk what y’all want
“has anyone checked on drake” he is a grown ass man and is a millionaire. i promise you he will be fine if people make fun of him
Y’all are obsessed lol
I don’t care about Drake. I’m Team Kendrick.
drake fans are so insane that drake can literally do everything diddy did and would still have the same numbers
It’s so weird people go to a Kendrick concert and leave thinking about Drake to the point they post about him on Reddit.
I’ve never been a big drake fan. A song here or there. A lot of his “harder gangster” verses are cringey because I know he’s not, I loved degrassi. But after not like us dropped I had to take the couple drakes songs I did have on playlist off. It feels weird to listen to them. Like flying a confederate flag or having a McCain/Palin bumper sticker: you lost bro just give it up.
Check on him for what?
[removed]
He said its so embarrassiiinnngggg
[removed]
The fact that y’all have to create fan fiction of a billionaire being sad in order to feel validated in your opinions is hilarious 😂
If you battle you gotta be prepared to take an L. Drake got personal in the battle first, after Kendrick warned him he didn’t want the smoke. 

If anything this should be a good wake up call for Drake to reassess what he’s really about. Kendrick showed who he is, a Compton kid who brought LA together and proved he really is “the biggest hater.” The question remains, “who is Drake?”
His next album will a classic. It needs to be
Crazy how weird kendrick fans are. Like can't yall just enjoy music without extra antics. Drake still has millions of dollars and fans. Kendrick fans care waaay more about drake feeling than drake fans do.
[deleted]
He posted last night. A lil selfie, nothing too crazy. Looking cute and kissable, as per usual
I’m hoping we get his best album ever after this.
He didn’t play it 6 times for any other reason than it’s his most commercially successful and hyped song. You think the crowd going crazy for his other shit. It was a concert paying homage to drake. Corny af
Man both teams just straight suckin c*ck and cradling bawls🤣😭
lol why do yall honestly think he cares ?
Y'all want him to be in crisis mode so bad, truth is he's somewhere in Texas petting horses unfazed and it's makes your blood boil lol
Who wants to hear the same song six times at the same concert?
Who cares dudes had it coming for a long time
Kendrick bots really putting in the work downvoting every drake leaning comment
Only hits Kendrick has the last 5 years are about another man. people gotta be looking out for him more so than drake.
I think the only people still invested in this are redditors bro calm down lol

Drake will always be the more popular…. More flamboyant… more net worth rapper and no concert or diss gna change that. The majority of rap fans heard family matters and then stopped being interested. Like damn…… y’all are so over involved in this tiny community that you are writing fam fiction on Reddit to keep the dopamine coming.
He’s the one of the top 10 streaming artists,so I’m sure he’ll be ok
He’ll be fine. Drake will easily outsell Kendrick on his next album. There’s a reason the industry gave him that 400 million deal, not anybody else.
Biggest tour in hip hop history, 100 billion streams on spotify first artist to ever reach it. I think he’s fine, but yeah the pop out was cool.
White people love hatin on club music , jus comes off as racist tbh
Kendrick stans infecting every sub on Reddit lol. Shouldn’t you be happy Kendrick gave you a show 

I wonder if the Celtics have the mavericks living in their head rent free right now, too 

Weird energy for a bunch of Stan’s who think they won
Hold on. Idc about the beef really at all, I like both artists. But you said my man played the same diss track 6 times at a show?! That doesn't come off desperate and pathetic to you?
[deleted]
“Played the same song 6 times” yall got finessed☠️
[removed]
Drake ain't concerned with some concert. He's concerned with buying private jets and making hit albums.
[deleted]
It’s true that drake will still have his fans, and his next album will still go #1. But why are people acting like that means he’s unfazed by this? We’re talking about a guy who got butt hurt over control and is generally always in his feels.

We really don’t think he‘s butt hurt about a guy he has a giant tattoo of on his arm and made a song about and a hero in his own city vibing to him being called a pedophile? There’s more to life than numbers and material things those are just the only things drake has left.
his fanbase is as die-hard as the Swifties are, it's crazy
Hot take: I think my favorite part of the night was Tyler's Earfquake.  

Kendrick brought the house down with Not Like Us and all that, but during that one shining moment in Earfquake, the entire stadium was in total sync.
This definitely leaves a noticeable mark in the eyes of the general public, though.
His fan base is exclusively chipdren, undercover gay dudes and chick's they aren't exactly known for caring about things like.... character or substance or meaning
Drake could double down and have a concert with Rihanna, Ovo artists, etc
By their Cope shall you know them.
A lot of people getting mad about other irrelevant shit instead of just appreciating the sick and historic performance they just witnessed lol
[they not like us](https://www.tryparrotai.com/video?id=BUTo6kvx2hat)
Kendrick stans ruin everything
Gonna be flipping thru those yearbooks and circling his favorites like a 9 year old with a toy catalog before Christmas.
This is my comment of the day.... Good day to you!
He gone be ALRIGHT!
![gif](giphy|3oEjHI8WJv4x6UPDB6)
A minoooooooorrrrrr! Like Dr Dre but that doesn’t count.
He already did last night lmao look at his story
He posted a mirror pic lmao
but this is nothing like the Pusha beef. Pusha didnt have the whole world screaming a diss on him, the clubs go crazy for not like us and not to mention all the mfs that popped out last night at kens show? drake is cooked
he already did, he's so predictable lmfao u know he's crying in the car
I feel like he told all his friends that he's not watching cause he doesn't care, but kept checking the screen every five minutes
I hope he goes to therapy or something for real. How could you not have ptsd after something like this. Don’t love the guy but he’s a person like all of us
It was that and the slaves line that made it obvious he didn’t even understand what he was supposed to be doing in a rap battle. I can’t think of an instance of self-sabotage so egregious.
[removed]
It has nothing to do with Pac. He sealed his fate when he said "Whitney." That was 100% it.
Someone just commented “Adonis was in the bathroom watching it on his iPad”
Canuck is a slang term for a Canadian. OP's comment has nothing to do with the hockey team. Also, where do you think that team name comes from? You must be new.
Fosho them guys Dre and TDE Smac need to stay inside with their DV/Pimping tendencies. Oh wait those are dots homies☠️☠️☠️
It’s also hilarious because Drake tries so hard to get the love and attention from ball players and celebrities so it must have killed him to see them all there organically.
They all over the place trying to defend him like their team lost the superbowl lol.
The Pop Out (feat. Drake)
💯💯💯💯
[removed]
Thank 👏🏼 you
Bs narrative. Man’s a rapper. Kendrick won though
Pac was an actor too bud
You say drake is an actor then mention pusha, this biggest actor out there lol
Uhh, psst. Kendrick and pusha are pop artists too ...
Only one of them has songs with Taylor Swift, Lonely Island and Maroon 5... guess which one? Kendrick.
He must know you're over 18 and filtered out your DMs
and where's Ja?
Staying quiet because he has financial liabilities involved
Minding his business probably. “I never have no feelings about another man’s problems.”
fucked on Wayne's girl when he was in jail, that's conniving
On the same shit snoop on... "leave me out of it"
Wayne told drake to rap about what he knows, being Canadian and shit. Not his problem he didn’t take the advice
Honestly the delusion is worse than when the song dropped. 

They’re so out of touch they have no idea why this was such a big blow. Kendrick just had a king of the culture moment uniting gangs while rapping about drake being a pedo and colonizer on Juneteenth. With drakes hero in attendance and demar on stage. But they think just because he had no new songs it had zero impact.
with mah blammeh crowday
I’ve been wondering this, all summer!
Is it 69 god or sixteen-eyeing god?
Well by saying “69 god” Kendrick is implying that Drake is a pervert.  So do you consider yourself a “pervert”?  There’s your answer.
So glad Jorja stayed with her man
You got weird fantasies man
Do you believe Dr Dre and Jay Z are pedos as well? They had relationships with girls that were 16.

Drake fans still not understanding this shit is so much bigger than numbers 🤦‍♂️
Doubt it. He's the punch line of every joke now. He's gotta wait a few years before he can drop an album lol. He goes to LA, he'll get booed off stage
To be fair though I lasted much longer in the kendrick reddit over the r/Drizzy one. Drake fans became unbearable after a few days but it wasn't until a couple weeks ago I had to opt out of dealing with Kendrick fans after they posted a pic of Kendrick with his kid from December and the comments were nothing but "oooh this just owned Drake"
Didn't he personally DM Fantano because Fantano hurt his feelings?
Yes
No no “he’s finished” r/rap declared it so
Damn this is so salty lol. They went crazier every time he played it
They’re exaggerating. He only played the first little bit of the song a couple times.
Kendrick gets a lot more love on this sub than Aubrey does. Aubrey is a singer with a team of writers, Kendrick is appreciated for having authenticity. If bots were involved, your comment would've had -15 karma immediately after you posted it.
it’s just fans and ppl who know he won looool
We're real. Don't trip.
Go outside and you’ll notice that people are playing NLU.
> The majority of rap fans heard family matters and then stopped being interested

This is maybe the craziest copium I’ve read all year, absolutely insane delusion
‘Majority of rap fans heard family matters and stopped being interested’

What in the blue hell are you going on about? It just happened.  Selective memory or another biased fan taking shots at the other side?
Bro NLU has surpassed rap fans Idk wym.
Why are you being downvoted you’re right lmao
Drake's competition is Taylor Swift, and he's got some work to do to catch up.
Because he's a pop star?
Def not a plant
Wait so yall admit that streaming numbers can be manipulated since yall wanted to say Kendrick used bots right? 


Wait, what was your goat’s only claim to fame? His streaming numbers, you say? 🤧
That's called peaking. What happens after you peak?
As a said around here a few times already. If you want to boast his number achievements as an overall artist go ahead, I do too, they are insane.

But comparing him who also has as pop/rnb hits as rap hits to artists who only rap is bs, thats not fair at all. Rap is a way more niched genre in comparison, specially outside of north america.

So like, "biggest rap tour"... nah. Tons of pop songs on that tracklist. Drake and some of his fans love to boast he "could have been the best conscious rapper, but chose stardom". But when its time to discuss rap y'all love to ignore that. Eminem and 50 numbers are way more impressive cuz they only rap
Kendrick’s DAMN tour is the biggest in hip hop history 🤦‍♂️
[removed]
>they won

I agree
They're doing their best to cope with their recent victory
Stream numbers aside, drakes wealth aside, let's have a heart to heart about your pride.
Got to make the most of Kendrick he'll disappear for 5 years again. It's his show and looked amazing but everything I've seen about it mentions Drake. If Kendrick won why does anyone care about Drake?
[removed]
At least they aren't the ones faking shit and going through Twitter to throw some dirt after a month of the beef
LOL you bumbaras people don't realize what assembling rap's avengers actually means, do you? You sit there and wait for Sexy Red to finish up with Shawn Michaels and she may throw you another helping hand, lol
I mean Kendrick stans are wildin, but the crowd wanted it. That was just masterful crowd control.
You don’t be saying that when ye and trav do the same thing
[removed]
No he's not. He's stressing
Keems from Vegas, not CA
Kendrick also left TDE. That doesn’t mean shit. It’s just business. Also, Keem isn’t from LA.
Keem was in the building
It was an LA showcase. If you wasn't from LA, you wasn't on stage. But go off, chief
Keem, Dave Free, Whitney, and his kids were all there. Fact check your shit bro
Keem was there, so was his family, but you won't reply to this comment or any others because you know that, you just can't see past drakes ballsack
Keem was in attendance. Not on stage because he’s not from Cali.
Shit good points
They're still claiming his streams are bots, even after that show.  
Wild.
Most fan bases have a bunch of idiots in them.  
Drake has a F.A.N base
The same thing can be said about any fan base honestly. That's why it's called a fan base
NO, they not like us, either
I mean, same age group
its not that we die hard this just doesnt make his music all of a sudden bad lmao  what u want us to do write a public apology to kendrick He still in my top 5 of this generation no doubt but I just listen to drake more hes a better song maker it is what it is
His next album will a classic. It needs to be
That was epic. 

My favorite was when J Rock was rising up from the stage during Money Trees right before his verse. It was fantastic
Maybe. Dudes still pulling 2m+ likes an instagram post though so I kinda doubt it tbh outside of real hip hop fans
Stream didn’t even have 500k people watching Drake just hit 100 billion streams I think u need to rethink the general public
And lucky for him they have the attention span of flies
Rihanna? LOOOOOOL less than zero chance
Rihanna not coming to that concert come on bruh
Rihanna discarded Drake swiftly.
Hahahahahahahaha who’s on OVO? He’s gonna get on stage and sing wah gwan Delilah 😂😂😂
Nvm Rihanna bc lmao, but who tf is even an OVO artist that anyone would know?
Book of Drake 6:16
You’re so delusional I ALMOST feel bad for you.

Maybe one more comment and Aubrey will invite you to Toronto!
My god
Lmao even her trying to tell him he’ll be alright gives him PTSD flashbacks 😭😂😂
Ain’t nobody praying for him 😭
Damn. Who drake really needs is Kendrick. What a cruel world.
All his homies left him to go the pop out so he didn’t have anyone there to take a pic for him.
He just wanted to see who was that bad bitch in the mirror
Typical Drake
Also goes to show I been hearing Not Like Us everywhere. Like EVERYWHERE. They were playing that shit during the NBA playoffs lol. 

I haven’t heard any of Drake’s tracks anywhere. I don’t see anyone singing them or bumping them at parties, bars, clubs, etc. Nobody except for the 50 dudes circle jerking on his sub are fucking with him, least of all the general public. 

Kendrick has also ruined Drake’s rep for an entirely new generation of kids as well with all these elementary school kids bopping it too lol. This is one of the wildest things I’ve ever seen.
Keep telling yourself that. Maybe it will come true one day
Or some ayahuasca strip the ego from the bottom 😔. Jokes aside, i agree
he not like us
[removed]
>I hope he goes to therapy or something for real. How could you not have ptsd after something like this

😂 Dude is worth what $400m? He's gonna be alright lol I'm not even taking a side in the beef but comments like this just come off as legendary levels of coping. Lmfao yeah bro he's crying in his $100m mansion right now (or maybe his other new mansion) looking at his 100 billion streams 😂😂😂

Rappers rap their own lyrics
"He's a con artist with the hopes of being accepted"
Thanks for the update lol
Bahahaahhahahahahaha check your info kid
And Quavo made a song with Lana Del Ray? Hasn't Akon also worked with Lonely Island? Does being a rapper mean you aren't allowed to work outside your genre?
What’s your point?
[removed]
I’ve never understood this “rebuttal”. What are you even trying to prove?
lol you realize Drake bringing on black artists to his songs makes him the white pop star right
So he's definitely not a rapper. Got it.
because those pop artists wanna expand their demographic reach with features from a rapper, not another pop artist.
imagine dragons too. jesus christ he really was trying to go pop in the late 10s
Nah, he hit me up a while ago because he was looking for a bigger man to put him in his place and make him feel small. He thought it would make him feel like Kendrick for some reason, and wouldn't stop talking about Kendrick's shoe size.
![gif](giphy|vNA1bpKBwIgfu)
No more than any of the rappers who did get involved. He sold all of drakes masters so he doesn’t personally have a stake in either Artist anymore. Doesn’t seem to be an issue for anyone else. 

All of Kendrick’s homies were willing to say fuck the industry to pop out with him and show they have his back. Lame excuse. If anything he has financial incentive to defend drake.
"I like money" -Wayne
Love that they played Wayne leading up to Ken
**Fucked a girl before she was Wayne’s girl, Wayne started dating her then went to prison and Drake told him while there
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
I see your Rap Whataboutism but I’ll raise you a “stick to the subject, man.”

*“Probably A Minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!”*

The line that destroyed the manufactured Rapper (and his stans) is in the spotlight, word is bonnnnnnd 👍
This beef would be a lot more fun if his most vocal stans weren't complete idiots. Debating the beef with them is like sparring with a toddler.
No he just wanted to share a vegan cookie recipe he found
"Drake" is a character being played by an amazing actor. It's like people in soap operas: they're never *really* dead until the actor portraying them passes. He's a brand, and as long as that brand makes money, he'll continue making music.
I’m not invested in the Drake /Kendrick Lamar beef. I haven’t heard either diss track.  I was just curious about performing the same track 6 times
That’s not too bad if true.
[removed]
Well people getting their feelings hurt don’t change facts, facts : drake has been on the top ten for the past 5 years not counting all the features, facts: before the “beef” most people only remember Kdot for humble and DNA
Exactly so he won’t be affected by this. This whole post is a huge reach.
Who is yall? I had no proof kendrick used bots, so i never claimed that narrative to be true, but 100 billion streams is a lot to fake, if that was the case swifties would’ve reached it first.
lol Drake been peaking for ten years now? Bruh lol
You release DAMN
[deleted]
If you’re drake you continue to drop platinum album after platinum album. You’re delusional as fuck if you think drake peaked
You go even higher.
Some of 50 and ems biggest records are their more ‘pop’ oriented songs. 

Em: Mockingbird, Love the Way You Life, Without Me 

50: In da club, candy shop, pimp

Like their deep rap cuts are not their biggest songs, so i think the comparison is apt, and i’ll never fault an artist for being more versatile
Are you crazy? what makes Drake, drake is his versatility. Kendrick needs Taylor Swift and Maroon 5 and Drake can make the Chorus himself because he's that talented.
Not even close 😂😂😂
You smoke crack, you do not sell it 😂 

https://www.nme.com/news/music/drake-surpasses-kendrick-lamar-for-highest-grossing-rap-tour-ever-
Really tho anyone who is trying to put themselves on a pedestal or put someone else down because of the type of rap they listen to is being insecure.
Dude wasn’t even claiming Drake was talented? He was saying Kendrick fans are acting obsessed and a little weird, despite coming out on top, and you writing out this whole novel kind of proves him right.
You mean Tupac?
Yet you're the one writting whole paragraphs about a man you supposedly hate. Drake still on top and that's obvious. Nothing more subjective than music, you're not special for not connecting with Drake's music.

Succinct and articulate, so much so an average Drake listener is too young and/or too dumb to fully understand.
It’s hard work but someone’s gotta do it
Because in the history of beatdowns this one has been epic
Good points. Definition of rent freeee
[removed]
Both is good
hating a groomer and criminal is sick to you? I worry for everyone who knows you in real life
If Drake had any likability to him people wouldn’t hate him lol
Faking shit? 

- Fake allegations

- Fake daughter 

- Fake views via bots 

What isn't fake lol
Bro u gotta be the corniest mf seeing all ur comments being like “HISTORIC MOMENT IN HIPHOP👁️🫡” “ASSEMBLING RAPS AVENGERS 🤓🤓🤓”


Lmao Kenny isn’t gonna suck u bro, relax
I’ll say that about any mf that play a song more than twice at one show
Have you asked him?
Had the audience rapping those songs louder than him but they thought there were bots, truly delusional lot of people.
All*
Read that back to yourself. Then do it again. Then realise maybe the idiots are closer than u think
But drake doesn’t even write his own stuff. I honestly can’t enjoy listening to his music anymore. His best album, Take Care is literally a The Weeknd album.
Crazy how the first positive comment I see about Drake is downvoted to hell, and it's just your opinion too. Literally just said you listen to Drake more but Kdot is still in your top 5, but even that is too much hate on Kdot apparently. Actual lames downvoting you. I agree with you 100% btw.
he also made a pretty good run in the beef. Push ups and family matters are good songs. kendrick just zapped family matters then doubled it with a hit in not like us. like yeah you got a bunch of people screaming drakes a pedo but you have nothing to back it up. Pusha T had a better diss, actual proof, and forced him to publicly raise his son lol.
Not sure that’s the best metric. Anyway, I think it’s more the general public, since NLU has went very viral. Like, it’s being blasted in rural Canada, Ireland, etc. I’m sure Drake will have many fans, but to the general public, I can’t imagine this won’t do some tarnishing. This is especially since the pedo allegations aren’t out of nowhere by any means, & people have been bringing up proof from over the years that makes it not much of a reach, to say the very least.
“Stream didn’t even have 500k watching”

The show was simulcast primarily on Amazon Prime Video where it was promoted on the masthead. The Nielsen rating for the show won’t be available for a couple of weeks, as is standard practice for streaming.

The show was secondarily live-streamed on Twitch, topping at just under 200k concurrent views. 

If you’re going to shoot from the hip, leverage substance as ammo instead of blanks. As they say, the more you know.
Do you think a stream of a Drake concert would have even 60k? Also the general public isn’t watching a stream on Twitch, but they will be keeping in touch through their feed and conversations. Like I’ve said, I’ve heard and discussed Kendrick Lamar (especially Euphoria and NLU) multiple times, as well as heard it blasting in a car, and I live in rural Canada. I also heard of various clubs and venues that booed Drake and wanted NLU to be put on, one of which was said to be in Toronto. Also, 100 billion streams when he’s had so many hit songs and features (especially pop ones) is no surprise, but that doesn’t mean he’s as relevant in the eyes of the public as he was years ago. I’d argue that ever since he made the album with 21 Savage, he hasn’t been at the forefront of music, but more on the back burner of mega fame. 

You can also compare the interaction between the two, or are you one of those who thinks Kendrick is botting? That LLC was preposterous and the dates didn’t match. Not to mention the fact that it’d make way more sense to go through his label as a major artist, rather than pay some guy $2500 and proceed to not pay the full. (We’re talking about millionaires here.) That story made no sense.
I watched it on Prime Video because I find twitch chat annoying af

im literally a fan of drake and i can still admit that man got cooked
I hear you. It’s unacceptable behavior, period. All the more reason he should probably seek help. I just don’t think dehumanizing people is going to solve any problems.
Money can’t buy back your reputation. Example Diddy, Cosby, Weinstein. 

These dudes clearly love their power and influence, more than their money. Drake is dying inside rn lol
Sure he’s filthy rich but I wouldn’t trade lives with him fr 😂

Copium
Yea I can’t consider Drake top 5 because he’s had writers. But he has written his own songs. And he’s written songs for others (Kanye, etc). And other rappers who make great songs have had writers.
Source: Kendrick said so lmao

Come on, that’s not a legit argument.
No but it’s a bit hypocritical given the context
lmao if you’re not from toronto you wouldn’t understand just how funny that song is
[removed]
Kendrick is pop as well.
lol Drake is black Tim, no matter how much you want to think otherwise.
You're saying mixed folks aren't black ?
Are you really trying to say Drake isn’t  black?
I can’t make an opinion on this until Ja speaks

*And continued to fuck her
Lmao you can’t answer a simple question. Do you consider Jay Z and Dr Dre pedos?
Ah fuck mb. Good Guy Drake sharing recipes for free
So Kendrick needed a 20 vs 1 to win a rap battle against a Canadian actor? Got it
Yeah. It was only the first verse two times, & then a few in full. The concert finished with an instrumental of the song.

Dear diary… lmaooo
 Are you not defending another grown man right now though? Why is yours different?
When did I say my opinion of who won? Fuck out of here. 
What. This is just untrue GKMC and section 80 were huge hits that I still hear being played all the time. What uhhhh what’s up with your username bro?
So you don’t believe streaming numbers/ticket sales are both measures that can be manipulated with the right amount of money?
Ya dead.
lol good one. I hope you can bring a small amount of joy to Drake's sad existence today. Give him a lil chuckle while everyone marks this historic moment in Hip Hop history.
Y’all are so slow. Kendrick peaked and THEN dropped Damn?…his biggest commercial record? 

Drake fans are so delusional they don’t realize half of what comes out of their mouth is just residue from all the glazing.
No way we’re still saying DAMN is bad
It was a good album ngl,not the greatest but it was great
Drakes not a rapper.
looks like more people see it my way than yours. Maybe you're the delusional one. There's a whole economy built off of Kendrick's non-copyrighted songs and now a concert. Have you looked online recently? It's getting near Ja Rule territory
Platinum trash for the idiot masses
[removed]
Are you being purposefuly dishonest?

Are you honestly comparing "without me" and "in da club" with actual, 100% pop songs?

>and i’ll never fault an artist for being more versatile

Who is faulting anyone. I said good for him, but comparing the numbers of someone who makes rap songs **AND** rap songs to people who make only rap songs is dumb.

>In da club, candy shop, pimp

These arent pop at all, just because you are somewhat singing in your chorus doesnt mean its a pop track. You are confusing club music with pop music
You are literally explaining my point.

Every rapper who isnt Eminem and50 needs features to get worldwide fame. I.e Hov with Mariah, linkin park, Timberlake, alicia etc. 

Drake has rap songs, and he has pop and rnb songs. So stuff like "most streammed rapper" is faulty, cuz he is as much of a singer than a rapper. Most streammed rapper makes it seem like all these streams come from his rap songs, but its 50/50
That’s a broken link bro.
Embarassing
And there's a lot of that in the reddit hip hop community unfortunately
Fuck that. Trash rap is trash rap. It's fine til you push trash rap ON ME. Then it's going to be a very obvious push back. And people on this sub are allergic to giving artists their props without putting someone else down. That is something new and weird that has come from outside of normal hip hop residents, and from the newbies. I'm not going to forget my favorite rappers opinions for someone who was born after rap went pop and commercial

 Congratulations.
Okay “goodkidmaadsubreddit”
Fake allegations: drizzy sup is the only one saying it's fake even with evidence

Fake daughter: no one knows if she is fake or not because the only one who said it is fake is drake and the one who said it's real is Kendrick's party and i won't trust both since they are beefing and everyone wanna prove Their point so you can't say it's fake and you can't say it's not

Fake views: the one who made those allegations is a 16 y.o kid who showed up on AK's stream which is sus as fuck and who charges 3k per 10 million which is insane since it's a money printing method and even if he took 10k on 10 mil views it's still very low,and if it's true then congrats Kendrick found a money glitch and it's a super smart move 

Now let's talk about drake allegations:

 the women beater : oh shit a case since 2017 that was debunked, also Kendrick made a whole album about therapy and healing from addictions and traumas(never mentioned he is beating his wife but that doesn't mean shit for now)  but Whitney was still with him while making it and she showed up in the concrete, don't you think that if this is true then they would've been divorced right now? And even if it was true, it's something between them both and they surely worked it out

Kendrick is short : wow so funny 

Whitney isn't faithful: "fabricating stories on the family front cause you heard mister morale" and drake loves to talk about his opponents families so I won't be surprised,but it can't be proven or debunked 

Now tell me what Kendrick allegations i forgot that are fake
N\*gga I gives a fuck about Kenny. I'm not bumping swimming pools. I'm just not stupid. I'm normal, lol. I saw it as what it was, LA united in a way the has rarely been seen in 50 years. Not Beverly hills. LA. It don't mean shit to you, because you can't understand it, little homie. It's historic. Gangchella will go down in history, whether you like it or not. I live in CT and me and the guys all watched it separately and was buzzin about it. I'm sorry that it hasn't moved you in your friends in the coffee shops and the pho spots. Two Americas
Have you?
Lmaoo this is so dumb that’s what people do at concerts sing the lyrics mfs swear this was a flex last night bro if they weren’t singing them I’d be a problem
I was thinking there was some artist out there with like 10 fans and they are chill.  
You're just saying words lmfao
5 songs
I think it’s because it’s off base from what the beef is about. It’s not about singing songs
Im convinced mfs be botting 💀
[removed]
If that's all you took away from all of Kendrick's diss tracks, and not Drake being an untrustworthy, womanizing culture vulture with mommy issues and a fetish for ratchet black women, then congrats, you're a certified Drake Stan.
The one comment that didnt get absolutely toxic in this thread. Ppl have gotten so invested its absurd.
We live in a social media world unfortunately. If you ask your parent if they heard about the Kendrick Drake beef and they’re not absolutely locked into gossip news stations I think there’s a very good chance they have no clue what you’re talking about 

The majority of the general public id imagine have no clue this beef even happened if they don’t use social media lol and if they do use social media, his numbers aren’t particularly hurting on any of those fronts, like I was saying
You're right on the money.

People talking about Instagram likes have no idea what they're talking about
Ur a bot if u think Drake wouldn’t top those numbers you don’t get 100 billion streams and the general public doesn’t know you what r u on also you hearing NLU on the radio or at a gym is common just like u here Drake songs and family matters all the time too they are popular songs that will get played and her loss did better than Mr Morale and no one has come close to his hits and platinum records dude again your talking out ur ass and no I don’t believe anything AK or Budden say they just want views so they will say anything for it but you kbots love to say ak said Drake lied about Dave free and you believe him but won’t believe him when he has another person on his stream claiming to be a whistleblower so it’s either you believe everything that clown says or none of it don’t pick and choose
Lmaooo did  I strike a nerve my guy go outside you wrote a whole one page essay 😂😂😂
he got cooked but his next album will still go platinum. lotta people in here saying his career is over lmao
Well if it isn't the consequences of Drake's actions.
[removed]
How would you even know that? Caring that much to fantasize about a dude being upset is weird man.

Also comparing convicted/confirmed sexual predators to losing a beef is even weirder.
[removed]
The only rappers i can consider great that have ghostwriters are also producers, like Kanye or Dre. Drake had some great albums, even a couple classics. But he’s more of a performer than a rapper himself
![gif](giphy|M7BfQuvGf79DO)

Calm down
it's really not, you just can't critically think.
Y'all are in this mf saying the 49ers are 🤓 actually 🤓 the best team after the Chiefs won the Superbowl. Everybody else is enjoying the moment. 

Go listen to that terrible Toronto song and find a way to move on with your life - this shit is embarrassing
No. We just don't like Drake.
hey, look. i found the delusion
When Drake is getting cooked in literally every hip hop sub other than his own echo chamber maybe you should just admit he got dog walked in this beef.
A rapper hopping on some pop songs to make some money isn't the same thing as an actor pretending to be from the hip hop culture. Snoop Dogg is cooking on daytime TV with Martha Stuart for Christ's sake. No one questions his authenticity.  Drake is more like if Martha Stuart started rapping, hilarious, but the second people start acting like she's legit is when you gotta pop out and show em.
![gif](giphy|11xPP6XWEqSmvS)

No im not lmao. Not even close

Lmao why do you think you’re entitled to an answer when you’re bringing up other (irrelevant) parties to **MY** comment that *you* responded to? You’re on *my* soapbox, homeboy!

But while you’re here, do you think Drake did something to that Millie Bobby Brown kid? That’s gross man, she was a child when she was bragging about them being “friends” ewww
You seem confused.

Bruh no one knows that unless your a fan ! I just had my username auto generated didn’t put any thought into it unlike yours .
Numbers matter because Drake does them. But Kendrick did them so it’s botted and fake
You gotta be dumb as hell to say drake isn’t a rapper☠️ Not only is he a rapper, he made your favorite rappers famous
My man, reddit is a monolith of Drake hate, let alone this sub. Of course that would mess up your perception on things, specially for a chronically online people like most of you.
Peaks are overcome all the time.
Its literally melodys and harmonies on these songs. . 50 is harmonizing on pimp, candy shop, and in da club. Em is doing so on mockingbird, rihanna sings the hook on love the way you lie, and without me has slight harmonies. 

None of those songs are purely rapping. And yes singing on the hook makes it poppy and appeal to a wider audience
Exactly, and Drake just features himself. Sings his part and raps his part. That's what makes him special. Thank you for realizing how special that is.

The sad thing is it’s not born from a love of music but from a love of ego.
Listening to music is so easy, you just press play. Imagine ego tripping about your ability to press play. Seems silly.
I know some folks that ‘only listen to real conscious hip hop’ who are also dumb as rocks. So it’s not really a big deal what people listen to.
Lol this has got to be painful, someone you're emotionally invested in getting dragged all over the internet for a month plus.
LOL what a racist crock of shit u just spilled out there bro. “Coffee shops and pho places,” I’m sorry if there are Americans who are ‘not like us’ yet still deserve the right to engage in the art they want. Ur a real clown bro, Kenny doesn’t gives a fuck about u… besides agreeing w ur racist mindset of “THEY NOT LIKE US WE WILL NOT SHARE”
Exhibit A
Context is what makes this moment incredible.
Your entire comment history is r/drizzy and r/kendricklamar running defense for drake.  
Go outside (maybe to a concert) some time.
Cry me a river brother.
It’s very heart part 6
Exactly, you just admitted it yourself. Yes, no one is denying that the video of him on stage that was going around (and has been for the last 14 years but suddenly now everyone cares) was weird. Yeah it was, but I would like to think he has grown and matured in over a decade. But that's not even my main point, my point is you said yourself that its not "straight up pedo shit" so why is everyone calling him a straight up pedo? People seriously need to understand that label before throwing it around so brazenly. Add to that the fact that every woman he has been accused of doing things with has come out in his defense (literally every single one).
[removed]
Cant use that when all the ppl involved said it was nothing tho, kissing a underage person is wrong but if was such a damaging thing there wouldve been a trial, hes said werid shit to tho but never actually done it, and the daughter shit? Still no evidence this beef was js a bunch of lies lmao still got really good songs tho but if you cant manage to see that you js biased lmao
Not only that but just how many opps hes created by being a douchebag high on his ego, walking around like he’s pac (he couldn’t be further from that)
Both of my over 60 parents have sent me multiple beef memes over the last month, this went way outside what the culture feeling, that’s just where it started. Whole world feeling it now
No, my parents probably wouldn’t, but I’m just saying, a lot of people irl (I’ve encountered it myself in rural Canada) are talking about the song. I haven’t heard anyone talking about Drake aside from criticizing him since well before Like That.
Took 50 seconds and I was bored.
obviously his career isnt over. drake will always sell insane numbers
Screenshot taken for when it doesn't even go gold
His album will go platinum but it’ll be shit quality music

Most human brains are able to combine external observation with critical thinking skills in order to make conjectures about what others could be thinking and feeling, and predict how they might behave next. It was kind of a safety thing for early man. If you can figure out that the other tribe is upset, then you can make decisions based on that information. The ones who failed to make such observations were mostly killed out of the gene pool. But not all of them, I guess.
You don’t have to be a Kendrick Stan to understand and admit that he completely demolished Aubrey. Like, that shit was mad embarrassing. Kendrick isn’t even my favorite rapper but holy shit did he embarrass Drake in front of the whole world. Shit is funny bro appreciate it for what it is

Bro you’re sitting in the Kendrick sub calling people weenies, YOU need to get out of the house lmfao

Lmao - point to where I was wrong tho? Can’t make a legible point so you just cry in gifs lmao
Well then I don't understand.
There’s not another way to interpret what you said
We’re in a rap subreddit, and Dr. Dre is very relevant since he was at the concert last night singing NLU, and you were talking about pedophiles. So nothing I asked wasn’t relevant, so again, do you think Jay Z and Dr Dre are pedos?

That is so untrue where are you getting this impression from? when GKMC came out you couldn’t go one day without hearing money trees on the radio for a solid year.
He's a pop star. Full stop.
Dude, it's not Reddit. Only trolls who are solely on Reddit thinks that stupid shit. Like Joe said, "This fight is Oveeeerrr!!!!!!"
[removed]
You are making obvjous statements who are irrelevant to my point which you are ignoring completely. Obviously a singing hook is poppy. Even when they arent singing, hooks in general are made to be poppy. But this is irrelevant tothe fact half of Drakes catalogue is pop/rnb songs. 

And you keep mentionjng the Rihanna track. But when I say "nobody achieved Em's level of fan doind *rap music*", im obviously talkin bout 2000-2002, his biggest numbers by far. The Rihanna joint is from the 2010s. 


Theres an appeal to a wider audience, but a rap song with pop elements dont compare to a straight up pop song.

Hence why Hey Ya is widely more popular than Ms. Jackson, one being a pop track, and the other being a rap track with a singing hook and singing bridge
Plenty of rappers sing or get features from RnB artists/other vocalists. There's a difference between making rap music with a melody on the hook and making straight up pop music.
??

I know all Drake's catalogue by heart. Why are you telling me this like I give a fuck. I was top 2% drake listeners last year. That was never my point. What kind of dumb obvious statement is this "drake one of the most succesful artists ever is special" duh uh

If you dont want to actually talk about what Im saying (that comparing numbers of rappers against someone who 50% of his catalogue is pop music is dumb), then just dont reply
Drakes not a rapper. He's a pop star. Your point is moot.
So he had to get Cole and savage to help him with tickets? Sounds really pathetic
Not trying to be an ass, but who cares about this lol. We all know Drake is in the top 3 highest selling hip hop artists of all time and has massive crossover appeal with the pop and R&B communities. He’s gonna sell more in most cases because of that. Drake has more broad appeal. That’s not an indicator of who’s better, just who has a more broad appeal.
[removed]
You guys are the ones reacting emotionally, literally all I said is "*congratulations*"? lmao

I guess I *do* think it's a shame than obnoxious stan culture had to ruin one of the greatest moments in hip-hop history, but I'm not emotional about it. It's just lames being lames.
Sometime you just gotta pop out
[removed]
Sounds like you would just let a pervert communicate with your daughter because of his “status”. I feel sorry for you.
[removed]
No man, it's not even the famous ones, it's the ones that ain't famous. Look how Drake met Lil CC, or that one girl from the Ice Spice video who he and his daddy follow on IG who's still 17. 

He's no Diddy but the Drizzler did that.
Step back a little bit and get some perspective. Kissing underage girls is wrong. Period. It’s damaging to the girls. Period. “Oh they said it’s fine”, what would you expect an underage girl to say about it? What would she know? 

You don’t need a trial to know that shit is just wrong
The thing with grooming is people who are groomed often don’t realize it till they are the age of their groomer or older sometimes dude has too many young woman we know he’s been messaging and woman who he’s allegedly been with he knew before when they were kids, he’s also got his weird interest in girls highschool basketball and that line in papi’s home where he compares a high school parking lot to a strip club parking lot for me while I can’t definitely say he’s a pedo I lean towards it being the case and when it comes to being a groomer the evidence is about as damning as it gets
Yes. I can absolutely use that. Stop using the “well the ppl involved said it was okay, so it’s okay” bullshit every time. 

The behavior in itself is WEIRD. You can’t change that part despite the ppl involved saying “oh it was okay teehee nothing to worry about” because it’s absolutely something to worry about. 

Let me give you this. If your daughter went up there & drake said he liked the way her breast felt while being 17 yrs old you’d be like “haha he’s just being a funny guy, what a joker”? 

Ya’ll don’t take this shit seriously at all. The fuck.
And they take that to be proof that he’s winning this thing. They’re teaming up to attack him, they say. Nah it’s just that in real life nobody likes or respects ppl who are fake. Nobody respects Drake or OVO and that’s his own fault. He throws stones and cries when they knocking em back on his glass walls.
That’s crazy. Both of my over 60 parents don’t even know who Drake or Kendrick are lol
Yeah that’s kind of what I’m getting at. This is all the same stuff Drake has been getting shit for, for literal years now. Like I can’t imagine it’s going to affect his image more than it already has. Like I remember the Millie Bobby Brown stuff legit being all over the place 

I imagine a lot of non Drake or hip hop heads heard NLU and were like “oh yeah I heard about him doing weird stuff like that back with that Bobby Brown girl” like I think the damage just kind of tags onto what was already there
People just really hate reading
it’s drake. it’ll be gold first week. enjoy the photo!
so par for the course with drake.

Then make your own comment about them then. Here, let me help you; you might go with:

*“Hey guys, but what about Dr. Dre and other rappers/Hip Hop celebrities that have allegedly been with kids as young as 16. Why are you all so focused on my idol Drake? It’s bumming me out, please, can we talk about other potential pedophile predators in rap, please! 🙏 “*

Good luck yo 🤣
That you don’t have a growth mindset? You’re welcome
"You called Cole when you had to move them tix (eh boy)"
Drake already outgrossed Kendrick before Cole even joined the tour, and aint no way in hell you think people were there to see savage over drake. Yeah he lost the battle, but don’t start talking crazy.
Taste in music does not correlate to intellect or morality that’s all I’m saying. 

People who act snobby about rap are generally in my experience a bit insecure.

If they had other accomplishments in life they wouldn’t be on a high horse about listening to music.
We’re talking about rap not Mozart lmfao

Now put yourself in the dad’s shoes. 

So you said it’s okay that a 20 something yr old commented on how your daughter’s breast felt at 17? 

“Yes sir, it’s nothingburger”
wild reach pal. even millie who’s married now said it was a nothing burger.
He’s probably the dad that took his daughter to the concert and allowed that to happen. Unforgivable.

It started with my mom asking “who is this Drake fellow? He seems like bad news” 💀💀 they heard me and my sister pumping dot since a dozen years back and got all the photos when he did his pre release damn pop up in Compton so they’re a lil clued in on kenny 😂
The stage video blew up after Euphoria and even more so throughout the beef.
Again how’s he a deadbeat dad? Cuz Kendrick said so? Damn the glazing is wild
Two other people have thought the same thing as me, it’s very clear that you need to explain what you meant.
I’m asking you because you said Drake is a pedophile, and that’s fine if you think that. And i want to know if you believe Jay Z and Dr Dre are as well. You’re doing everything to dodge the question, it’s funny how you using “allegedly” when it’s confirmed that they dated underage girls, that part isn’t the question, the question is that since they did this, do you believe they are pedophiles?

You can't peak and then go higher. You've either peaked or you haven't
You called savage when you needed British support , he can’t save you drizzy!
Wrong, Kendrick had the biggest tour with mr morale, until recently with Cole and Drake . Learn your shit before you talk it
[removed]
Not a wild reach at all. That's how you sound defending this so hard. You'd let your daughter converse with grown men in the entertainment industry privately via text, regardless of charges or allegations brought against these people (like Drake and OVO members all have) as long as she tells you it's a "nothing burger".
[removed]
[removed]
Drake brings on black artists with a more authentic experience than him to give his sings  that appeal. His songs feel like pop songs with rap features.
What determines that? When you peak again, you can absolutely peak after a purported peak
I thought kendrick fans were supposed  to be *smart* 

Anyway, what im saying is Drake already outgrossed kendrick on the same tour before cole even joined, ntm Kendrick’s was a world tour with 103 shows spanning all continents sans antartica. Drake outgrossed him in only 30 shows.
Right but if you had more important things going on in your life or if you had more accomplishments to be proud of,

you wouldn’t get so worked up about how you listen to rap better than those phonies. 

Again in my experience the people who get all worked up about how they ‘listen to real hip’, don’t have much else going on.

What I meant about pressing play is like it doesn’t take skill to listen to any kind of music. 

You literally just press play. It’s not a big accomplishment to hold over people as if you’re better than them.

defending it so hard! lol i mentioned his evidence was all entirely well known well before the beef and pusha accusations weren’t and he had the evidence to back it up.
[removed]
literally didn’t say that. y’all are fucking weirdos like you actually want drake to be a pedo
That’s not the part any of us are disputing. We’re talking about you calling him white like he’s not black. That’s the part that didn’t make sense to any of us.
My brother everyone has one peak. If you "peak" but then are still going up that's not a peak you're still on the rise
[removed]
Again… that’s not true, it was January when he surpassed that , that was with the Cole appearances, my homie went to the show!! Are you 13? 

At the end of the day drizzy needed help, Kendrick didn’t full stop. Anyway 50 cent got the new record anyway, so I guess drizzy isn’t all that even with help he can’t keep the top 😂

Edit: also Drake had 82 shows bro.. this was pathetic
So you measure talent by streams and money? Okay. Remember, Drake doesn’t even write his own songs so what are we even talking about? His ghostwriters should be on tour
I judge hard on musical taste. Same as literature ya know? Someone reads Twain and Thoreau im going heed their words more seriously than a Rowling fan.

Same with Drake, if you’re a Drake fan I consider your taste vapid and uninspired. I extrapolate that to the rest of your personal and it’s generally true. Musical preference and taste in general is subjective but gives a lot about a person away.

I’m also fairly successful. It’s just a great way to filter individuals to help find likeminded
Taylor's goodbye post to Europe, and speaks on Vienna
In summation
We have officially wrapped the European leg of The Eras Tour. With it came the most passionate crowds I’ve ever played for, new traditions in the show, and an entirely new era added in. It was a more hectic pace than we’d done before, and I’m so proud of my crew/fellow performers for being able to physically perform that show and build our massive stage, take it apart, and make magic with so few days in between for recovery and travel. They’re the most impressive people I know and I’m so lucky they gave The Eras Tour their time, their energy, and their expertise.
Walking onstage in London was a rollercoaster of emotions. Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating. The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows. But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives. I was heartened by the love and unity I saw in the fans who banded together. I decided that all of my energy had to go toward helping to protect the nearly half a million people I had coming to see the shows in London. My team and I worked hand in hand with stadium staff and British authorities every day in pursuit of that goal, and I want to thank them for everything they did for us. Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows.
In cases like this one, ‘silence’ is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it’s right to. My priority was finishing our European tour safely, and it is with great relief that I can say we did that.
And then London felt like a beautiful dream sequence. All five crowds at Wembley Stadium were bursting with passion, joy, and exuberance. The energy in that stadium was like the most giant bear hug from 92,000 people each night, and it brought me back to a place of carefree calm up there.

Additional Comment:

We had some EPIC surprise performances from my long time friends@teddysphotos, @florenceandthemachine, and @jackantonoff. Performing 'Florida!!!' with Flo for the first time was unforgettable and Ed took me right back to our old Red Tour memories. It was the most dizzying honor to become the first solo artist to play Wembley 8 times in one tour. To the fans who have seen us this summer, you'll always have the most sparkling place in my memories. You were a dream to perform for, dance with, and share those magical moments with.
We'll see you all again when we resume The Eras Tour in October, but for now we get to take a much needed rest. Thank you for the adventure of a lifetime. May it continue...

“We were grieving concerts and not lives” are very powerful words and really do sum up the seriousness of the situation.

I really respect her not wanting to put any of the fans at the London shows in potential danger and waiting until after they had concluded safely before speaking out. A very well written statement.
i’m glad she set a boundary and expressed that she just wanted to keep her fans safe. i felt like she would make a statement when the time was right, and am glad the european swifties were kept safe in vienna and all of the london shows! ❤️
It seemed so obvious to me that she wasn’t speaking about Vienna for precisely this reason - not wanting to incite some copycat to try the same thing in London. She’s shown time and again that she cares for her fans deeply, and this was one time when caring for them meant staying quiet, not making a statement, until it was safe to do so. 
I hate that she had to spell out why she didn't say anything about Vienna right away because some people would rather assume the worst in her than have any empathy towards her and the reason why she would wait in the first place.
>Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows.

There isn’t anything more to stay 👏👏👏

Time and time again Taylor has shown that she cares about her fans. Her silence couldn’t mean anything else other than her trying to protect everyone coming the shows. This has been a VERY serious situation and I think many have lost sight of that
https://preview.redd.it/mk8y74ykg3kd1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9accf9aa8308d91e40a18017af841ff7bf815904

Hope this helps everyone who demands she speak about world issues!
It seemed very clear that her lack of a statement was because of the possible danger to her fans and everyone involved in the tour. I find it disappointing how deeply people came at her for it. I saw people saying things like "We've been ERASED" as if Taylor has ever been one to not acknowledge her fans and love for them, or that she wasn't just as devastated as anyone else. I'm sure some people will still be mad about this for some reason, but I love how directly she approached this.
Even tho I have already moved on from what happened in Vienna(as someone who had ticket for n1) I really appreciate of her saying this.
Copying and pasting from the megathread:

I am astounded that people’s trust in Taylor was so thin they FLOODED instagram with comments with lyrics and comments about being left behind or feeling betrayed as fans. The internet has a knack for jumping to conclusions before they actually know anything and then arguing and acting like they know the exact situation going on just because they read some articles.

Why did her own fans, who complain people will find any reason to hate her, jump on a train of negativity so fast? Be mad at the people who planned the attack, not Taylor.
Exactly what we expected: her silence was a safety concern. I'm sorry that she had to explain herself, but I'm glad she did. Sometimes, what feels obvious to some isn't to others - especially when the fanbase can skew younger.


I'm grateful that she was able to say something at all, and I'm glad the London shows went off without a hitch.
“We are grieving concerts, not lives” W O W 🩷
I think, 20 years from now, her decision to be “silent” (about Vienna, but also about recent global conflicts) will be a decision that she will still stand by and will not even slightly regret. There are so many crazy, violent people in this world who have a desire to hurt people, specifically women and girls. I cannot imagine the amount of threats she and her team receive, both to her, her dancers and crew, and her fans, and the amount of pressure that comes with that. I think anyone who thinks her “speaking out” is as simple as putting out a statement and moving on, as if there are no consequences to consider, is naive.

Edit: I’m so glad she finally said something about why she hasn’t said something. I was tired of fighting with virtue signalers about it.
>But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives.


Perfect. No notes.
I’m so happy she made it clear she will always do what she thinks is the right thing, even if a contingent of people online want her to do something else. That boundary is very healthy and I hope people respect it.
Everyone who felt compelled to “call her out” and “hold her accountable” can you learn from THIS ONE?

Don’t call yourselves fans if you question her heart and compassion.
Thank god people can stop saying the “silence” didn’t have to do with safety. IT DID like many of us said
As someone with a Vienna ticket, I never got the criticism. Giving the Londoners safety was  clearly going to be her priority.
As somebody who should have attended Vienna N1, I am very happy with Taylor's statement. I am sad that we have missed out on the tour, but I understood from the very first minute that cancelling the shows were the wisest decision.

Seeing many fans demanding a statement, bullying Taylor and her team (even the dancers!) without knowing the exact circumstances was even more saddening for me. Everybody is allowed to feel sad or grieve the shows we had been anticipating for a year but bullying and demanding things which we have no insight on won't take us forward or ease the pain.

I do hope the community will calm down soon and we can move forward together. I watched the London shows at home, but it was so good to see everybody having a good time. I hope I can experience the magic on the next tour.

Edit: typo
it was obvious she was gonna speak about Vienna when the time was right. idk what is up with people nowadays and thinking a celebrity has to speak about something that has happened the same day or the next day. like chill.
I had to leave X because I couldn’t handle the sheer amount of people shit-talking her because she didn’t speak on Vienna (literally days after it happened?). Then people being mad that she brought guests out and made London special.

I’m glad she ⏰ed the lot of people saying she didn’t care. I sincerely, and I hardly say this, hope they feel like shit.
A lot of Swifties need to listen to BDILH and stop being so parasocial.

I (like a lot of people in this sub) thought it was extremely obvious why she wasn’t saying anything.
I love her. I don't know her but I feel like I know enough to know she was devastated about Vienna, and terrified for fans in London. I think this statement is well done.
Honestly, people should be embarrassed by their behaviour on this.
"We are grieving concerts, not lives” 

I hope the entire subreddit set up in order to be mad at Taylor for not addressing the situation straight away feels extremely guilty and selfish about how they handled their feelings towards the situation right now. Hopefully, the statement she made puts things into perspective for them.
I’m so glad she didn’t outright apologize in this post. She has nothing to be sorry about. Prioritizing fans’ safety is nothing to feel sorry about but the way people have been speaking about her the last two weeks, you’d think she committed a serious crime. I hope people demanding a statement from her look inward and be more forgiving in the future
She’s such a classy queen
It’s disgusting that she had to defend herself in this way. She did it well though. I love the distinction between silence and restraint.
Unsurprising that this was what went down, but I’m glad she cleared the air.
Let me be clear:
“We were grieving concerts and not lives” 
👏

It’s shame that her “fans” didn’t understand this already.
so glad she called out the psycho “fans” who were “so done” and “dissapointed” she didn’t speak out. like she said, silence is showing restraint. that’s a skill our generation has lost…
Wow, who could have guessed that she was waiting to wrap the European leg until she said something (everyone should have lol). For real though, this is a good statement and I’m sorry for the people who had their concerts cancelled but it was getting real crazy with how some of them were acting online. I’m glad Taylor isn’t taking any of that crap. This doesn’t mean you can’t be sad about missing your show, but Taylor has shown time and time again that she cares about her fans. 
just as most people with any critical thinking skills thought, she wasn’t speaking on it for a reason. like sorry, but some people have been acting absolutely unhinged and entitled over this.
I’m so proud of her for being kinda stern in how she spoke about Vienna, making it clear that it was all for the safety of the remaining shows, not because she didn’t care. It infuriated me that anyone could accuse her of that when that threat must’ve been so terrifying to her, both for her own personal safety and for the safety of the tens of thousands of fans she gathers at her shows. That is a massive responsibility that I know she ultimately shoulders and it must’ve been an incredibly upsetting experience all around.
she called those people out and im here for it
Hoping we can all put this to rest now 🤍
It was extremely obvious why she wasn’t speaking. Which I think normal realistic people understood. I’m actually embarrassed and I hope she knows that majority of us completely understand and never doubted her.
I’m so glad she clarified and included the line about silence. A lot of people, while understandably upset, were coming for her for not speaking up on this. She does care for her fans and her fans’ safety and I’m glad she cleared the air when it was safe to do so.
"But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives."

One of my favorite excerpts from her post, I really hope this shuts everyone up about Taylor not speaking up earlier but they will still try to find a way to be mad lol.
Damn she really told the haters to shut the fuck up! Good for her!
And her choice of silence on issues like the Israeli/Hamas war should also be understood from the same framework from which she’s written this statement. 
I really am over the subset of fans who “demand” that she “speak up against Genocide” or to come out in support of Kamala Harris, regardless of the level of threat she constantly lives under. She’s a musician who is responsible for the livelihood of hundreds of people/staff, and the safety (at concerts) for literally millions of people (collectively). Let the woman do her thing and give some grace and trust that this brilliant woman knows what she needs to do to keep herself and the world around a little safer.
I’m glad she addressed Vienna and gave a really solid explanation as to why she has been silent. I know this won’t be enough for everyone. But as an outsider not affected by Vienna, I think it was always clear it was a safety concern for her upcoming shows in London. Keeping her fans safe is more important than keeping them happy.
As I said yesterday re: no Rep, but this time it’s the about her not making a statement about Vienna. She’s telling us to sit down, shut up, and wait patiently. We don’t know what happens behind closed doors, be it for a TV announcement or a statement regarding Vienna.
She took a barrage of hateful comments from “fans” for not making a statement sooner, only to wait until it was safe to do so.
i’m so glad she made a statement on this, the hate and trash talking over the vienna situation has made me really uncomfortable and it’s been getting so out of hand. as i said all along, taylor has her reasons for everything. i also had a pretty good feeling she would wait until she left europe before she said anything.

the whole “vienna erasure” drama just made me sick
This woman could’ve broken her leg stepping off the curb her first morning in Vienna and some people would demand an IG post from the operating room and that she play in a wheelchair.
I feel for Vienna missing their shows and wish them healing but this reminds me of what just happened with Chappell Roan. We should definitely do better next time. respect an artist’s boundaries. I definitely feel like TS team saw it as a hate train and that’s why she didn’t give Vienna the warm and fuzzies about missing their shows. Only the clinical truth that it was done to keep them and her and dancers and crew safe. You can’t be creepy!
“We were grieving concerts and not lives” is a great way to put it. 

Glad she kinda spoke out against those “she needs to say something” people when it was obvious why she was silent.
THANK YOU I'm glad she lowkey called out fans and 'fans' who demand her to make statements re: everything. For big situations like Vienna, Ana who passed at her show in Rio, there's so much safety and legality that's the reason for her "being silent." Either she can't say something for legal reasons or she can't say something for the safety of her, thousands of fans, not to mention her family, friends, band, crew, dancers reasons. Much in line with Chappell Roan's tik toks a couple days ago, the parasocial relationships are out of control and these are people's real lives as they're human. A lot of people need to calm down.
Not speaking up about Vienna was so glaringly obvious but people just want to get their nipples twisted for the sake of spouting hate into their echo chamber twitter cesspools
What I really don’t understand is why people wanted her to post something about Vienna immediately after. I would be absolutely devastated if my show was cancelled, and it would make me so so terrified if it was due to terrorism.

Maybe I just really understood why she wasn’t speaking on this the whole time because I am a really anxious person and this would send me off the deep end. I just can’t help but feel it was so obvious why she didn’t say anything immediately. This wasn’t just cancelled due to a bad thunderstorm, it was a planned terrorist attack. 

Taylor was expected to perform just a few days later for 5 more nights. Bringing even more attention to what happened just would not have made sense.
Everyone who called her out for not saying anything after Vienna must feel pretty stupid now. Taylor always acts with her fans/crew/team's best interest in mind, first and foremost.
There she commented. She was terrified. Happy? This whole debacle over her silence really pissed me off with the fandom. She really hit the nail on the head, “we are grieving concerts, not lives.” It sucks the shows were cancelled, but Taylor will likely do something really special for them next tour. I’m glad she feels at peace performing and this hasn’t caused her crippling anxiety.
I think it's so true that silence took restraint and grace. In order to protect and not give rise to copycats,(especially speaking that the terr* were in contact with the network of terror that literally hate successful women.  


She stayed silent for a few days even though she was harassed and bullied online.  
She made sure her team was safe and her fans before speaking on it,  even though she was being eviscerated by it. She cares more about her team and her fans that her own reputation. 


The ones that were chanting online about her not speaking out and the news articles,  they only brought more attention to it and more fuel to those who want to bring women down. 
I hope everyone who shamed, harassed, and spewed bitter hate at her for not making an immediate statement feels ashamed of themselves. So many ungrateful "fans" out there. She did this for YOUR safety y'all.
People still shit talking her because they think this statement is “cold” need to get their heads checked out.  She’s not a product, she’s a human being and something terrible and shocking nearly happened and she needed to keep hundreds of thousands of people safe until the European leg finished
>Thank you for the adventure of a lifetime. May it continue...

Long Live 👑
I trust this now clears up the issues surrounding Vienna and her reason not to speak out about it. 

Safety first. Always.
The people at that snark subreddit against her are going feral at what she said. Lol whatever, she spilled that silence actually does show restraint.
Glad she said something. Hope all the haters will shut up now about how she hates her fans or whatever nonsense they’ve been saying. 

Perfectly stated post, but that’s not surprising!
The last line in the comment “may it continue….. EVERMORE”. Evermore long pond is coming and I’m not joking.
Should have been incredibly obvious to anyone with half a brain she didn’t want to inspire copycats which I’m sure she was told was likely by law enforcement in both Austria and the UK
Everything Taylor does has a reason. Can't imagine what she was going through and then seeing these narcissistic comments from her own fans? I'm so glad she stood up for herself and applaud her for the way she handled this
“We are grieving concerts not lives” is a good summation as by all counts, they got very close and everyone was extremely lucky nothing horrific has happened. It sucks but at the end of the day, you lost a concert not your life.
It sucks so bad she even has to say this : / unbelievable and incredibly disappointing the number of people who were harassing her and demanding some kind of statement when it was painfully obvious why one hadn't come.

If it was just people expressing sadness and disappointment, that would be completely understandable, but for those who took it further (and I am strictly speaking about those people, clearly), I hope they are embarrassed with themselves and their childish behaviour. Probably many of them ARE children as it's hard to believe most adults would even question why Taylor was not drawing attention to a terrorism attempt.
I feel so awful for Vienna show swifties, but the people in the comments of TN and dragging her were out of line and this post shows she saw it and she sounds fed up to me. 

Nowadays mass shooters and people like Trump’s would-be assassin aren’t given much mainstream media attention because studies show that increases the likelihood of attacks. After a few days it became obvious this is why Taylor did not speak. She did not want to give that organization any more attention and make her concerts a bigger target. Even in this post she only alludes to them.

If there is anything Taylor deserves the benefit of the doubt about it’s that she cares for her fans. Hopefully people will be more generous in the future when stuff like this happens again instead of constantly demanding public statements immediately from her when something bad happens.
We were grieving concerts and not lives: this sentence was powerful . WOW.
Damn she really called some people out.
Her withholding an official statement on Vienna was only done in the name of safety for her fans. “We were grieving concerts and not lives”. That says it all.
I hope every person who was slating and berating her for not speaking up on an active terrorism investigation whilst knowing shows with half a million people at one of the largest stadiums in the world was right around the corner. 

Taylor speaks up for and about tragedies in her community but something like this she was clearly being advised to wait. 

Did nobody understand this from TTPD? 

I’m so so so happy for her being able to rest peacefully, return to travis and get a well deserved break before the madness and the end of a life & career defining tour comes to an end x
I cried. Not going to lie.

There's a lot going on here. I think her statement was excellent and heartfelt.

I can't wait to see the Eras Tour in Toronto! It'll be my first concert in 20 years. I'm excited.
Literally said “hell yeah” reading this on IG. Set 👏 those 👏 boundaries 👏 queen 👏.
Now I will call on every Swiftie that was vilifying Taylor for not speaking on Vienna to come out and apologize to her. She gave her reason, and though I can understand your disappointment at the shows being cancelled, trust me when I say that a concert isn’t worth your life getting claimed. Taylor did the right thing here.
I've been living in an ERAS haze for.. However long the tours been going on, had an amazing concert in Munich N1, and got sad about my next concert - Vienna N1.

I am emotional, thank you Taylor 🥲
I know we're all talking about Vienna and I love those statements for that audience.

But .....performing Florida for the **first** time?! Does this mean there will be second and third and fourth times????
These photos are so beautiful. I’m obsessed with that first one with the blue dress 🩵  

I feel bad that she felt the need to include that bit about Vienna and why she hasn’t spoken on it yet, but I really like what she chose to say about it. “Silence is restraint”. 

I’m sure it wasn’t easy for her to remain quiet but tons and tons of experts have spoken at length about how silence is sometimes the most powerful tool against terrorism. Speaking out provokes them; ignoring them just embarrasses them.
> But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives… in cases like this one, ‘silence’ is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it’s right to.

 I couldn’t have said this better. I knew a statement would come from her eventually—I understand people are upset but it was also for the safety of hundreds of thousands of fans. 
Can’t wait to read on other forums about the ridiculous reason this isn’t good enough 🙄
I hope that unhinged author of the "article" on Forbes the other day on how Taylor wasn't embracing "mindfulness" by staying silent on Vienna feels thoroughly embarrassed now.
The amount of people still standing firm on their stance that their feelings (and I don’t mean to trivialize their feelings towards what happened because I would too have been devastated) is worth more than the safety of the London attendees, Taylor and her crew and dancers. Anyone with any common sense would agree with the decision that the Vienna concert was cancelled unavoidably, the horrible but correct decision was made and a devastating event was avoided and there was nothing Taylor could do at that moment to fix that. Her only logical next step is to ensure the safe running of the next shows. I totally understand Vienna fans still being at the restaurant but my god you don’t deserve a statement more than people (Taylor included) deserve to be kept safe.
“…because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives.” 

This right here is why I’ve been so, so disheartened by the number of comments on social media (especially on Taylor Nation’s Instagram posts) about how she needs to say something about Vienna. “What about Vienna?” “What about the Vienna fans?” every other comment.

Well here you go, she said the quiet part out loud: sorry you lost some money and didn’t get to see the show, but thank goodness no one is dead.
Listen, considering all of the perpetrating would-be terrorists were MEN, I was functioning off of that lyric we all know and love, "If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing!" These young men tried to talk/pull shit on Taylor, so Taylor owed them nothing. No responses, no resistance, no NOTHING, because that would've been giving undeserved attention to sick-in-the-head senseless terrorists. Simple as that! All the same, it's a relief to hear her address the threats formally, and as always, massive respect to her for being able to navigate all of this unexpected turmoil and keep everyone safe!
very well put. i knew she’d say something at the right moment! “she doesn’t care about her fans bc she hasn’t said anything” …she cares so much about the fans that she didn’t want to put them at any further risk.
It’s disappointing that some of her “fans” are determined to read negative intent into everything she does.
Does anyone else feel sad that she even felt the need to defend not speaking. I honestly wish Taylor only ever felt support from her fans.
> we were grieving concerts and not lives.


Exactly. What more can you add to this? Although snarkers will find smth even in this to hate on. Whatever 
I am happy she took a firm stance on why she did what she did and waited to say anything. I, myself, made some comments in the last week or two saying I thought some of the social media comments complaining were out of line, even if I understood why fans were disappointed. I also think some of those were haters not fans. But the division of fans was kinda sad to see. At this point, on a thread of a post also meant to celebrate the European leg, I don’t think we need this thread to be a bunch of fans acting holier than thou that they were right and a little mean. Can’t we all just get along 🙏
It truly is a shame that some fans felt the need to bully Taylor into speaking. I understand disappointment, but it was very clear that she couldn't say anything. I'm glad she made it clear now, but some of you should be ashamed of yourselves.
It was very obvious to me from the beginning that the silence was what was asked of her and advised to her for safety reasons. Giving ANY attention to the people who were behind the plot can give copycats ideas and motivation.
I’m glad she stood up for herself on this. People always assume the worst of her for some reason, even though she has proven herself to be a very caring person for her entire 18 year career.
Not me being a clown ass bitch thinking the “NO!” At the end of the caption was some kind of Easter egg until I scrolled down and realized they’re emojis 💀🤡
I'm so proud to be a fan. ❤️ I respect how she addressed all the backlash about her staying silent. I always understood why, I knew she didn't want to add more fuel to the fire and keep everyone safe.
I love how even FauxMoi and the neutral sub are very rational about this and giving mostly positive reactions to the statement. Of course the unhinged sub is still not happy but let's not talk about that.
Such a honest and touching post 😭 I am already missing the Eras Tour
Anyone using logic would have been able to recognize that there was a good reason for her silence. She didn’t gain anything (PR-wise) from being silent. Indeed she may have lost some fans. But there are bigger priorities in life. She needed to do what she could to keep her crew and the London fans safe. I believe she made the right choice.
Glad she stood strong and didn’t let people online bully her into speaking. It infuriates me, the amount of “fans” that sat online and talked shit about her not saying “sorry” as if it’s her fault and acting like she abandoned them over the Vienna shows. People need to get a grip.
She really read everyone who moaning
I’m trying so hard to not go I TOLD YOU SO on TaylorNation because I am trying to be mindful about the devastation for the shows being cancelled. However, I called so many people out who were complaining because it’s just not on brand with Taylor for her to stay silent when tragedy happens. 

I think it’s acceptable to ponder why she is waiting and when she is going to say something, but I got very vocal about it because it is another scenario where everyone turned on her so incredible fast. No faith in the consistency she’s had in the 2+ decades of her career of being so fan oriented. It was so disheartening.
I told some Vienna fans that she wasn't going to say anything until the London shows was over, but they weren't having it.
Seems like a very professional and appropriate post from the most pro of pros. I'm not a TS apologist or fangirl by any means, but getting a little tired of seeing all of this bitching and moaning about her not speaking out about xyz, esp the canceled shows. It was obvious why she wasn't speaking out about them at the time, at least to those of us with common sense. She knows what she's doing (major understatement) and it's become clear what she speaks on and what she doesn't in a more general/global sense. Basically, if it doesn't affect/offend her personally she ain't gonna address it. She told y'all in BDILH about sanctimoniously performing soliloquies she'll never see...
I hope everyone complaining about her not speaking on Vienna can shut up now. She can’t and she won’t.
Honestly, perfectly said all-around. I’m sure I can’t come close to understanding what Vienna must have felt like on top of the stabbings. None of us can imagine the weight of what she must carry in terms of guilt and grief and responsibility for thousands upon thousands of people she’s never met. OF COURSE she wasn’t going to speak on it until she had completed the run of these shows. 

I’ve had tickets to see her Night 1 in Miami with my 3 kids since last summer, and I couldn’t be happier to know that the Europe leg finished safely, she and her crew will now have a nice long rest, and that FINALLY MY SHOW IS NEXT!!! 😂🎉🎶🤩💝✨
In so glad she called out the rude behaviour from the small portion of so called fans that were commenting abuse to Taylor, Taylor nation, the band and dancers.
She said it so well. The best thing she could do was be silent and so many people criticised her for it.
This post made realized that reputation is right in the middle of the discography right now , that makes me so emotional 

What a brilliant run, until October !
Thank you, Taylor 🩵
Taylor told us all to F off with that statement. Good for her.
Love this clapback but sad she had to make it. Posting "💔 Vienna" was never more important than keeping everyone safe moving foward. Fans and everyone who work at the show. And she was never going to address it onstage either. I had to sit on my hands wondering how anyone would think that would be a good idea to remind 90,000 people in a stadium about a planned terror attack at another show. Grateful "we were grieving concerts not lives" yes ma'am 👏
[removed]
She’s also probably hinting on why she’s not endorsing explicitly Kamala atm btw
I wilded out when I saw the Instagram post was open to comments. Took me a second to realize it was open to One comment.
I saw Taylor this past week and wow.. it really is an incredible show and I had the best time. I’ve been a fan for 13 years now and standing in that stadium with all the swifties took me back to my teenage self that cried to her music and brought me together to people online when I felt like I had no one. It was a lot more emotional than I thought it was going to be. It is truly magical. I’m so grateful I connect to her music and have this as a core memory that I will share with my kids soon.
Psssst! Didn't I told YA'LL to FUCKING WAIT?! YES I'M TALKING TO YOU ALL WHO MADE *THAT* SUB AND SHITTED ON HER! SHAME ON YA'LL!


ahem. Anyways. Europe will miss Tay so much. These 2nd leg of London Eras had been one of the most chaotic and amazing shows to witness. Cannot wait for Taylor to perform TTPD at her home country.
She said it in a way that makes sense to her and had so much to say that she ran out of room in the caption
I hope Taylor can focus on the millions of us who did believe she was doing the best she could to keep her fans, staff, and self safe and not the assholes who assumed the worst who even now are still bitching and moaning.

 I hope she feels our love and support. 💞
I think most everyone felt she was waiting for a safe time to speak, except people who either like hating on her or were just too emotional to be reasonable.
I hope everyone that was coming for her for not speaking out is feeling appropriately ashamed of themselves
I think it's great that she didn't speak on Vienna and her reasons are 100% valid but I can once again see people twisting this into something negative and saying her reasons are not excusable or whatever.
I hope the fans who were so quick to pile on the hate train about Vienna are embarrassed.
And yet there’s still a whole sub of unhinged folks that this isn’t good enough for
The part where she said it brought on a new set of fears for her gutted me 😫 love her and her absolute brave heart for getting back on that stage again.
I would love to hear from some of the Vienna fans who went rabid on her-are you ok now? Do you feel better now? Are you happy now? Genuinely asking, thx.
And yet there are still complaints. She will never be enough to haters.

Common sense why she never spoken about Vienna until now. Wouldn't surprise me, the same section of the fandom that criticized her for not speaking up till now, find something to criticize on this post.
unrelated with the discussion on her statement but i do love the photos for this carousel, especially the second one
She really said SPEAK NOT 🔥 Good for her
This makes me so mad, not because of her statement but because of the fans who pressured her and wanted to "hold her accountable" (for what???). I feel so bad because she has shown time and time again that she CARES about her fans. She has shown it since the very beginning of her career. It's baffling how some people want to act like she doesn't care about her fans or is some cold-hearted monster. So many people on TikTok and Twitter are acting so entitled and are just so annoying in general about this stuff.



Taylor said it best, they were fortunate enough to "grieving concerts instead of lives".
“You can (and fans should have) hear(d) it in the silence.”
This post is very respectful. Very demure. This is how it’s done.
I'm extremely glad she called out those swifties that were "disappointed" towards her silence about Vienna. I honestly think they should listen to But Daddy I Love Him more. I always believe if Taylor (or anyone, for that matter) is silent about something, there's usually a reason for it.
If it wasnt such a sad situation, id wanna laugh in so many people’s faces. Of course now people are like ‘well her PR team wrote this so whatever’ when it is so clear she wrote this herself (of course with guidance from PR probably) but still you can tell its her words. I want to feel bad for all the miserable people that are just looking for things to be mad about but I really dont.
[deleted]
Not going to judge anyone who was set to go to Vienna really but anyone who wasn't and was yapping and acting all high and mighty should really feel silly now
Where are all of you who were upset she didn't say something and put others in danger? Now's your time!
I'm glad she set a boundary against the absolutely rabid "fans". Let's be honest, if you posted something at her for not making a statement, you're not a fan.
Hatred and pain are making people's bias and views an unfair deal, anyone who cant see that Taylor swift, the biggest star in the world, able to gather hundreds of thousends of people in weekends didnt talk about an ongoing investigation of a terrorist attempt because she wanted to protect said people and investigation has been blinded to a dark place. This isnt a case of just "haters gonna hate" its part of the movement thats facilitating these type of situations mainly agaisnt women, in one side we had many people from the Vienna show who blinded by pain wanted her to speak as soon as possible and then we have the opossing crowd who blinded by hatred are trying to seem like they care about the situations but in reality their weird obssesion with her and what she stands for use every oportunity to hate her, as if they actually cared about the people who could have died in Vienna. Props to the fans of vienna who in their missfortune knew that their lives being saved was the most important thing those days and props to Taylor for not interrupting the authorities attempts of protection with a statement, and waiting for the rigth time to do so.
It made me really really sad to see everyone assuming she’d just moved on or that she didn’t care. This is the type of thing that changes someone. I can’t imagine the pain this caused her and the fear that will follow her because of this.
Damn, I was just thinking this morning that now that the European leg of the tour is over, she would maybe speak on the Vienna situation; mostly so it wouldn't "provoke" anyone else into more attacks or threats.
It really surprises me that people who are supposedly her biggest fans truly chose to believe that she would intentionally not acknowledge Vienna for selfish reasons. It never made any sense, everything we've seen of Taylor's character has demonstrated the exact opposite of that. I hope this was a lesson to people
I hope all those fans whining and complaining about not getting a statement are satisfied now that they’ve both got one and basically been told off. It’s embarrassing and awful that she needs to write something like that
What a good statement. People demanding she speak on Vienna were putting people’s lives at risk for the sake of their hurt feelings.
I'm happy to read that she addressed her Vienna fans, given the unfortunate events that lead to cancelations :-)
I hope this clears things up now. I can't believe people were so quick to turn on her for this when it was incredibly obvious there was a reason for not one person on her team or in her crew saying anything. Even Paramore, her opener said nothing. It's okay to be devastated that this happened. I would be too. It's not okay to jump to conclusions so quickly. I've been here since Fearless so I can say I fully trusted her when she didn't say anything. She wouldn't just ghost all those people. That's just not something she does. The anger from this situation was misdirected.
I’m glad she finally came out and stated why she didn’t speak out, despite it being obvious why. I feel for the Vienna fans, but nobody can say she was silent because she didn’t care and I’m glad Taylor has cleared up her silence. I hope she returns and does an amazing one off show for Vienna one day when she feels safe to <3
She’s just the best
I loved this statement and its power. I’m curious about whether or not you all think this means she will speak out about the 2024 elections in the US?
I hope all you Vienna trash talkers about "how dare she not address vienna"  "wow she should apologize" , "wow no acknowledgement is disgusting to her fans"  feel terrible. She understandably witheld knee-jerk statements and addressed it on her own timeline, as the rest of us figured she would. Some of you are so selfishly ruthless. I hope this makes you rethink your comments in the future. like damn.

That was beautiful!
I am in awe of Taylor’s level of maturity and the amount of restraint she had to stay silent to prioritize the safety of fans.
It shows how aware she always is of what’s going on with her fans!! Hope all the haters leave her alone now
Now, can we trust her from here on out?? All the people complaining about her silence, please know that mother always knows what she’s doing.
lol hope those fans who said she didn't give a shit about them in vienna feel like aholes now.
THE FIRST PHOTO 🥺🥺🥺
I think this a well written post for Vienna and for London. ❤️
I love her so much. Good on her for prioritising our safety x
It may have not gotten as salty had she shown RESTRAINT in promoting new variants and a merch drop while remaining silent on the issues. 

I am disappointed in how many people are being so arrogant about the issue as well. I am very glad she made a statement and regardless that she phrased it so strongly about the GRIEVING SHOWS, NOT LIVES. 

But THEY ARE FANS TOO. You don't get to gatekeep and decide who a fan is. Or what people are allowed to be upset about.
Saying you wish Vienna fans who were upset at the situation feel like ‘sh*t’ for expressing their disappointment.. taylor doesn’t like bullies either. Y’all are weird. Sorry.
I wondered if she was going to try and reschedule Vienna in some way but I guess that’s it.
Such a gutting sentence
Yes, that phrase was perfect
It’s SUCH a powerful sentence. I feel awful for the swifties in Vienna that missed out, but I am so, so, so happy knowing just that they were *safe*.
Such powerful and true words. So thankful that the potential threat was stopped and everyone is safe.
I felt like I should start snapping when I read that. Now we need slam poetry album
I'm also so glad she pointed out the unity and love of the fans in Vienna who banded together to try to make the most of a horrible situation. Seeing videos of fans exchanging bracelets and singing along together was beautiful ❤️
This always seemed like the reason she hadn’t spoke about it. I understand Vienna fans were devastated and money, travel and time was lost and they didn’t get to enjoy the concert. A lot of fans were dismissive of Vienna fans and that was sad. But some Vienna fans have now grown their disappointment into hate and that’s not ok. They already think this statement is not enough. I try to understand some Vienna fans, but I can’t understand them.
yes! I feel like people don’t realise how this terrorism works. People copy each other and would probably be inspired at this event. British authorities most likely urged Taylor not to speak about it too. Thankfully. I’m gutted for the Vienna fans but it was necessary to keep the Wembley shows safe. I hope she can reschedule the concert truly.
The dehumanization of Taylor Swift has been pretty wild this year. Don't get me wrong, she's by no means a perfect person but the amount of people who haven't been treating her like a human being with emotions has been crazy to see, from haters AND fans alike. I wish people stopped to think for a second before saying the stuff that they do, but that's asking too much of the internet.
Yeah, I also thought sooner or later there would be some sort of acknowledgment from her on this, for some reason I thought perhaps after Eras in Canada once it’s all finished. Either way it’s sad she had to explain herself why she was quiet, I’m glad the shows in London ended up being all safe!
>She’s shown time and again that she cares for her fans

Seriously. How so many fans decided to disregard years of her showing that she genuinely cares for and appreciates her fans... And most Swifties know how hard she tries to never cancel a show if it's within her control.

This was never something she was not going to feel DEEPLY, regardless of if or when she made a public statement about it.
There are still people in this thread complaining. Nothing she does will ever be good enough. And if all it took was this one time for people to lose their trust in her, when she has shown time and time again how much she cares about her fans, then they were never fans in the first place.
im genuinely embarrassed that so many grown adults were like why isn't she making a statement... Like the world doesn't revolve around them and anyone with an ounce of common sense could have told them that acting emotional after an attempted attack would only encourage further attacks
Yeah, I really understand people were/are upset, but if you know anything about Taylor, you know she loves her fans. It honestly must be exhausting to have people constantly assume the worst.
Knowing she didn’t say anything made me feel so much safer last night. Was I nervous? Yes of course but her silence gave me reassurance she knows what she’s doing in this moment. It’s tactical silence to ensure London would go as smoothly as it did, she did it so that we also wouldn’t be forced to miss out. It’s devastating to cancel shows due to a terror plot, no one deserves their experience to be robbed like that and she knew that she couldn’t have that happen again
The amount of people who essentially bullied her into an apology is gross. Had they all just waited and used their brains instead of crying “she doesn’t care about us!!!!” like come on. I’m sorry but it was pathetic.
Exactly. Rational people recognized that but unfortunately lots of entitled brats didn't. Poor Taylor. She did this to protect the very people who turned around and lashed out at her
Exactly this. I was reading some op-ed piece in Forbes comparing Taylor’s silence to Blake Lively’s *It Ends With Us* drama, and saying Taylor has a responsibility to her fans to make a public statement. And then way down in the article the writer mentions that she had tickets to one of the Vienna shows and was upset that she’d traveled all that way and Taylor hadn’t said anything. 🙄 I couldn’t believe it. It was ridiculous.
Seriously and I cannot understand anyone who thought any differently. At all. Very narrow minded thinking from those upset she wasn’t speaking about it.
A hundred percent! Clearly she was concerned with safety and I’m glad she pointed this all out. This statement is incredibly impactful 👏🏽
People who were trying to pressure her to speak out are haters pretending to be fans. Straight up
I'm sure she and her team were instructed not to speak about it. They all kept their silence.
Because if people want to hate someone, they don’t need a valid reason to. It’s as simple as that
It seemed so obvious that a lot of fans don’t know how these things work and forgot that she and her team are real people grappling with a crazy frightening situation. And I wouldn’t be surprised if some bots were involved in the negative commentary, looking to sow division.
Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
I completely agree! It’s better that she didn’t at the time.
ISIS terrorism is so much worse in Europe than it is in America. I’m not surprised at all she waited to speak out.
For a group of people who claims everything Taylor does is so calculated and thought out, some Swifties can be so stupid at times. Is she calculated and probably not making a statement for a reason or just ignoring the concert cancellation? Hmm that’s a hard one to figure out. 

I know a lot of the comments we’ve seen are probably not real Swifties but there’s definitely real ones out there questioning her on not coming out instantly with a statement.
Yes! That has been what has bothered me all along. People thinking she had bad intentions was ridiculous
I know it's just bec this Fandom had grown so big but the entitlement is unreal and unbelievable.... That's why I always just give the benefit of the doubt for this girl.  I can't imagine all these people waiting to jump their knives and claws at you the second you show vulnerability all bec they can't really throw any bad shit at you. Freaking disgusting some of these fans are.
Even now, they don’t accept these comments from Taylor. I’m sad for them, but their hatred towards Taylor is unwarranted. Writing letter and poems is giving speak up now letter attitude. We are fans and we support Taylor, and while she can be extremely grateful for the support we show, we are not entitled to dictate how Taylor should live her life or what she should do.
Yeah I got scolded so badly for pointing this out on a pretty nice way in the sad Swifties sub why she probably hasn’t spoken out. I get the Vienna fans are sad (I would be), but saying Taylor doesn’t care about her fans is so unfair. It’s so clear why she wasn’t speaking out right away.
i feel incredibly vindicated 😅😅
Taylor has many faults but I truly don't understand why people would question her love for her fans, that's literally the FOUNDATION of her entire CAREER! She built what she has today because of how caring and loving she's always been towards her fans and due to how much she cultivated a good relationship with them. The fact that people were questioning that was mindblowing to me.
💯 it was pretty obvious why she wasn’t saying anything. But some fans didn’t understand and apparently still don’t
At her level of fame people will take chances to "prove" she doesn't live up to the hype. 
But in general, yes, she needed to adress Vienna sooner or later. Just letting fans know she actually did care and hasn't forgotten them.
Right?! Her track record shows more than any other artist her love and appreciation for her fans. That has never wavered in her almost 20 year career. I was so disappointed in some of those comment sections I saw.
I love how firm she sounds in this. Of course she’s upset about cancelling and disappointing fans, but it’s clear she has been told about how people think she doesn’t care and wants to set things straight.
Mother really said “I’ll speak on my time, not when others demand it”.
Oh man, i know this is serious, but now I've got taylor singing "but there's nothing more to say, cause everything's okay, I've got security lining the staaaaggggeeee" playing in my head (and it applies here too lol)
AKA: she’s not going to speak out about politics on stage (especially since her shows in October are in red states!)
With great power comes great responsibility. She’s responsive for millions of fans and her crew all over the world. anything that puts anyone in danger is not worth it for an Instagram post, sorry!
I love that she’s directly called people out who were complaining she was being silent. I know “haters gonna hate” and half the time there’s really no point trying to argue with them, but when she claps back at them I LOVE it
This is for everyone in the sadswifitie Reddit who keeps commenting that she’s still not doing enough.
Totally agree. Maybe it would be different if she wasn’t touring but when you literally have hundreds of thousands of peoples safety on your hands….its too big of a risk.
PERIOD
MIC DROP. Good for her!
[deleted]
I think not speaking out about a recently foiled terrorist attack (and just before more shows with a very high level of risk) is not the same as generally staying silent on world issues. I love Taylor (and had the most magical nights at London N3/N7) but there are definitely times where her huge influence could be used for good through the messages she puts out. I find it really sad she felt she needed to make this kind of statement though - it was very clear why she hadn't mentioned it until now and I feel for her having to read such terrible stuff from her own fans about it.
Yes!! "Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating." was all I needed.
Yeah, the nasty comments about her staying quiet were kinda shocking to me. Part of the reason I’m a fan of Taylor is because I truly believe in her good character and feel like I know her heart’s in the right place. I know how gracious she is and how much she loves her fans. I felt very confident she completely shared in Vienna fans’ disappointment and fear over the shows being cancelled. Of course she doesn’t take that lightly.
That line was a standout for me. My friends and I survived the Rt91 mass casualty event in 2017 and I'd give ANYTHING to have had that weekend end with a cancellation instead of 58 lives lost and thousands of others changed forever.


Edit: spelling
The amount of people shit talking her because she hadn’t said anything. How dense can people be? 🙄
People will just say she only spoke because she was called out on it or something. It'll never be enough.
It was so FRUSTRATING to see those “fans” comment nonstop. If you truly understand the situation, you would be thankful for the cancellations. It’s a concert - prioritize LIVING over it.
They won’t because they don’t actually care. Concert safety is not something they have to be worried about.
Well some people think they can dictate her personal romantic life, why wouldn’t they think they can tell her when to speak. I’m glad she stuck to her guns with this for her own and others safety.
God the lack of comprehension skills is actually concerning. “She just doesn’t care about us!!!” like….did y’all not understand it was a terrorist plot???? And that speaking on it would bring more unnecessary attention??? I can’t seem to understand why that wasn’t clearly understood from the get-go. 

Sorry, but I hope some people feel really shitty over this. They deserve to.
I’m so glad she clocked that. I’m actually proud of her for standing up for herself.
Lol this! She literally wrote a song about this behavior and yet…
They SHOULD be but somehow I don't think will be unfortunately given their behavior in the first place.
They don’t. I recommend not going over there if you don’t want to be incredibly frustrated by the lack of perspective
Same
This. There was a reason her parents were terrified about her speaking up politically the first time. We won’t hear about even a tenth of the threats she gets. I have no doubt if it was just herself she was making a target she would speak up but she clearly takes the responsibility of the millions of fans who come to her shows very seriously.
I don't suggest going to the "Sad Swifties" sub. They're still being vapid about it all. It's so irritating to read.
Could you fill me in on what happened with Chappell Roan on TikTok?
Hahaha sorry I just have to say that I don't understand your flair but I love it anyway
Yesss this. If you have been a fan of Taylor for a longer period of time you would KNOW this. She doesn’t take cancelling concerts lightly, and the wellbeing of her fans always goes first -  we know this as far back in her Tumblr days and her Christmas gifting and everything. She cares DEEPLY.
Plenty that are doubling down and saying she wasn't empathetic enough. The entitlement is insane.
Sadly many of those people will raise the bar and say she’s still not doing enough (as they always do with her). They’ll demand she reschedule the shows, and then when she does that it somehow still won’t be right and they’ll say they weren’t special enough or not convenient and Taylor has once again failed and why didn’t she give them all a personal show in their living rooms?? Some people are strange and are never satisfied. This is a beautiful, emotional, and thoughtful statement that will make reasonable people feel loved and appreciated as they should feel. I feel terrible that the Vienna shows were canceled, but I’m so happy that the tragedy wasn’t death instead of disappointment.
It's so disturbing and disappointing how these "fans" will never be satisfied. EVER.
Snark subreddits are insane to me. I’ve never hated someone so much that I wanted to keep track of everything they do or say so I can go a specific page to talk about it.
There is nothing I would clown for harder if there was even a hint that this existed
I need this so much - sad girl fall is right around the corner
I feel like this isn’t a post to clown about, but dang I really would love Evermore long pond for Fall 😂
The amount of money I would pay for this vinyl is alarming.
I want it more than anything in the world
They just didn’t want to see it - we were labelled as bullies for trying to explain it to them
I ran here so fast when I read that.
They are doubling down and saying she was condescending and that she lost them for real now. I'm honestly like.... Good riddance. If you wanna be that entitled and unemphatic to someone you are claiming is being unemphatic to you, you're just not in the right mind. 

I do think what Taylor said was condescending - but rightfully so. It must have been so heartbreaking to see the people you were trying to protect turn on you and demand you did something you knew would be dangerous for them. I'm honestly glad she spelled out perfectly "let me clear: I will not speak on something that might endanger my fans" (I know it's not word for word, but couldn't remember it exactly). I'm truly glad she stood up for herself while also doing the right thing to her fans and everyone security. While also kinda putting them into their place - which they said and I do agree she did, but again, rightfully so. You don't get to demand someone endangers thousands of people because you're upset you've been saved (yes, I know it goes beyond that/isn't that simple, but not my point now).
“May it continue…” I didn’t choose the clown life it chose me 🫡🫥
i was so confused trying to decipher it 😭
OMG your way with words...so good.
No, they probably still feel awful because they had their concert cancelled AND have to deal with the fact they could’ve died and had a terrorist threat in their city. Jesus, what’s wrong with you?
Hi. Vienna swiftie here. I think it would have been better for her to have made a non-explicit (About the terrorism of it all) statement early on that confirmed the cancellation and expressed disappointment with us when the cancellation was announced. She didn’t have to address terrorism like she also didn’t do in her post, which is good. Her statement wouldn’t have made the news any bigger since  the cancellations made headlines everywhere. Instead the silence following the cancellations brought attention to herself in a negative way. the Longer she waited the worse it was for me and many of the rest of us who were in that situation.

of course her actions also divided the fan base and a lot of people who were not there have been very cruel to us and calling us terrible people and fake fans. I’ve loved Taylor since Tim McGraw. People I met in Vienna had tattoos of Taylor lyrics on their bodies. So I feel now very alienated from the swiftie community and I’m not sure when if ever I’ll feel comfortable back here, and that’s really sad because the community in Vienna was the only thing that softened the blow of the cancellations. It’s all been very sad.
If you don’t get from her tone and use of words that she was upset about fans comments then you don’t have a lot of experience with how she writes statements. 

She was scared and working hard to make sure fans were safe and they had the audacity to act like she didn’t care because she didn’t make a statement sooner. 
No, she clocked them. As she absolutely should
1000%. So many people love thinking taylor loves them more than other fans it’s really quite sad. She doesn’t know anyone. She’s simply explaining herself
There were those that were upset and that's a valid way to feel. There were others that called her every evil name possible for not mentioning Vienna before now.
Expressing disappointment is far from the same from lacking the common sense to realize she was being silent for a reason and villianizing her for it. No ones feelings are worth more than hundreds of thousands of people’s lives
"Expressing Disappointment" is NOT the same as bullying Taylor about the situation. You can be upset, nobody said you couldn't, but what you can't do is comment all over her posts about not making a statement when it's SO OBVIOUS why she hasn't. 
What’s wrong with this subreddit lately?
What will probably happen is the next tour will have more shows in Vienna with fans that had tickets for the Vienna show having first access (through whatever platform their tickets were initially sold on)
its very hard...  everyone involved in the show (the dancers and crew) are going to go their separate ways. The sets and stage will be returned to the vendors Tait and Stageco (who will take them apart and reuse them for new shows).
[deleted]
omg yes and i loved the way some streamers were doing the surprise songs!
I work in anti-terrorism and I tried to explain to people that she will make a statement when it is SAFE to. The group who claimed responsibility has many more willing to line up in retaliation and act quickly. Even her words today didn’t mention what actually happened or condemn anything, that is 💯on purpose. I even said by saying ANYTHING could make her future shows a target and her fan base. I tried to acknowledge the fans devastation and said those feelings are valid, but if they want to be angry, be angry at the radicalized individuals that planned this. My expertise was not appreciated or trusted.
Personally I was never dismissive of Vienna fans being sad and upset. I’m sad for them because missing the show they waited for is devastating. I was dismissive of the people who were demanding Taylor to make statements and saying that they no longer want to be a fan because she didn’t acknowledge them.
They said they wanted a statement and it was done. 

What they want now?
I was in college when Columbine happened. I remember seeing the absolute insane coverage of the events because the 24 hour news cycle needed material.  My first reaction was this is going to encourage disaffected teens who want attention to shoot up more schools. I was right and 25 years later, unfortunately, it’s still going strong. 

Taylor ranting and raving would have just encouraged repeats and extended news cycle. It had a few days of attention and was largely forgotten outside fan and Stan spaces by time the London restarted.  Taylor and her team made the right choice. 
I knew 100% what she was doing by not saying anything but I fear it’s because I grew up in a time and place where the name ISIS gave me immediate fear. This wasn’t just some random teenagers wanting to do something stupid. This was a planned terrorist attack, by people who had ties to a horrible, horrible organization. And I guess it’s a good thing I haven’t heard the name in years, but this one made me truly scared. I’m glad she waited to say something. I think her statement was perfect.
There are people who hold her in such absurdly high standards and I by no means want to invalidate her or her power but ffs she's a performer but people project so much onto her like let the woman create and do her job and what she does best. She's going to have flaws but her reaction to Vienna is not something I feel is necessary to criticize.  Hell most of her perceived flaws aren't really worth the criticism.
Exactly and at the time of the cancellations they only had two suspects in custody. There was no knowing how many total were involved and if they had access to the stadium as well. I’m sure the Austrian authorities also advised silence until they finish their investigations.
I’ve been fighting for my life in comments trying to explain why she didn’t speak up and I finally gave up bc everyone was so nasty. Feeling so validated right now feel like everyone with pitchforks got told to sit down lol
People give her like zero grace I swear...
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero. 👀🤣
As a European swiftie who indeed has seen ISIS in the news way too much the past years, I was really glad she didn’t made a statement before or during the London shows (I went n7) because as you said - it really helped me feel more secure and knowing that she was working with the authorities to ensure our safety. Helped a little bit with feeling safer at Wembley 😊
I love that she put her put down “let me be clear” that she’s not gonna be bullied to speak up.
She's probably doing the exact same thing for the election stuff right now. When the time is right, she will do what's right.
I mean there’s a large, loud group of people that call themselves fans whose “fandom” is built around her lying for 16 years and leaving only them secret messages about the “truth” 
I've seen tons of haters from snark subs masquerading as "real swifties" trying to shade her for not speaking up before.
Agreed completely. They were looking and will always look for any reason to hate her if she doesn't meet their expectations/entitlement.
Nah it's real fans alright. Their parasocial relationships with her are just bordering to unhealthy levels it's jarring to see. It's like religion, when you're mad at your god for being such a disappointment bec they did not make it rain so you decide to make another religion.
[deleted]
What’s crazy to me is the people hating on her weren’t people who hate her music but supposed fans who took being disappointed the shows were canceled as an excuse to lash out. I understand being super disappointed or even stressed about the loss of money/vacation time or scared because of the terrorist threat but why did so many people use it as an excuse to bash an artist they supposedly like??
It's been so wild seeing people saying how obvious it is that Taylor doesn't care because she didn't post a friggen heart on her story or something. The mental gymnastics it takes to really believe she doesn't care is insane. Also say she did post, like you'd suddenly feel better? Everything would be okay? The drama.
completely agree
That speak up now thing was so embarrassing
They said SPEAK NOW
More like “I’ll speak when doing so does NOT put others’ lives at risk.”
Exactly. Her song being used during the DNC roll call last night was enough of a signal for me tbh. I beg people to watch or remember her documentary about what a big deal her speaking out was then and all the reasons she was being given NOT to. I don’t fault her one bit.
I think at the very least she’ll encourage people to register to vote.
Not just red states, but open carry states. It's all fun and games until armed right-wingers decide to go protest outside her concerts with AR-13s. Perfectly legal as long as they don't shoot anybody, but even without any actual violence, that kind of atmosphere could terrify her fans.
That’s exactly what I took from this. As a response to her non response re the AI images
I don't know that she's made a final decision, but definitely a pretty clear "if I don't endorse this is why" message
Gotta love the prospect of a mass shooting at any and every large gathering (even the small ones tbh)
[deleted]
I do think she may just remind people to vote. I don't think she would get on stage saying to vote a specific way, or endorse a candidate on stage (maybe during the break but I could see her choosing silence since we had a recent assassination attempt). 

I do feel like the people in attendance at her concerts are more likely to have ideals similar to her own (most not all of course) so just her telling the audience hey go vote could have an impact.
[deleted]
She’s definitely not gonna say a thing lol
Well let’s hope she still speaks about it afterward because otherwise the domestic terrorists got what they wanted, they silenced her.
An INSTAGRAM POST! You are so right with that. I wish people could realize that. I think too many people are stuck in the online bubble and forget that some things are REAL and Taylor is a real person with feelings and big responsibilities.
I seriously think people forget that online posts have real world implications, and they’re not always sunshine and rainbows
They posted about it and said the post lacks empathy lol they were demanding a statement they said “even an emoji something” and they got it AND a reason why she didn’t speak up and they’re STILL mad. What can she do at this point?
There’s people who have responded in a way I would expect most people to, with disappointment and heartbreak, and then there is that subreddit. Woof.
There are fans still moving the goal posts every where. “It wasn’t a separate post, she didn’t speak sooner, she hasn’t done secret sessions in a while”
I disagree whole heartedly (about the world issues). To do so risks herself and her fans. Those on the other sides of these conflicts are rabid and insane.
Could you clarify please, by world issues you mean the Palestinian issue? Or maybe Ukrainian issue as well? Or maybe a Kongo issue? Or maybe millions of other scary issues in the world? And what makes you think she's qualified to speak on all the wars and genocides? Or maybe you think she should speak only about one specific issue? So many questions, so little answers.... 
No, she’s not required to do any of that. Because some celebrities like to run their mouths and share their opinions on every damn thing does not mean Taylor has to. Nowhere in her theoretical fame contract with parasocials is she required to do this.

And btw, would you even be prepared for her to share her opinions on these matters if they don’t align with yours? I suspect you’ve somehow convinced yourself she has the same views as you and maybe that’s not how it would shake down so ask yourself if you would still be a fan if she took an active role as an outspoken opponent to your views because it’s not giving that at all.
I agree. Terrorism vs political issues don't need to be lumped together here. There are things she can talk about that will not impact her safety or the safety of fans.

For example, when everyone hoped that she would feature drag queen guests during the Nashville shows. Assuming that having queens at the show would cause violence is catastrophizing. Sure, there are militant anti-drag people out there, but most drag shows don't end in violence.
I like how she said we’re grieving shows instead of people
My heart is absolutely broken for you guys, but I do think it was very understandable that she waited to speak.  

I also think it was pretty obvious that she was going to do that. She would likely have had requests from both London and Vienna authorities to hold a statement until after the London shows, because that's pretty standard after a terrorist incident. You don't want to provoke anyone or anything when you are about to fill another stadium with fans. 

I'm pretty sure she would have wanted to speak to y'all sooner, but safety needs to be first. She doesn't cancel shows and so I'm pretty sure she was heartbroken. But it's better to wait to speak than to add any risk to the London shows.
It’s kind of terrifying they wouldn’t listen to fans telling her she has a history of speaking up about things and taking care of her fans but all of that good will just went out the window in a blink of an eye for them? It felt like they were hurt cuz the show was cancelled so they used Taylor as a scapegoat for their feelings.
[removed]
It’s because they’re selfish
I still can’t figure out what they expected to get from her saying something immediately.
honestly too many people have fallen into the trap of hating her so much it's made them stupid 
The entitlement is real and so crazy! They can stay mad if they want, that’s on them. I’d rather people be mad instead of dead.
Those exact fans will just go on and be dismissive saying the song is just about her being in love with Matty. To me the song is so clearly about the crazy fans and not about an actual relationship. Like, yeah, probably it is inspired by one relationship, but that's so not the point of the song. And yet those fans will just say "oh my God, I can't believe she was so into him/I'm disgusted to know this is how deeply she was/etc" and not even come close to address or understand what Taylor said about THEM.
The amount of people who seem to believe BDILM and ICDIWABH isn’t her calling out fans for being and demanding far too much is far too many
Oh i've seen it. I'm absolutely flabbergasted by the amount of people have such a one dimension perspective on the situation. Everyone over there is very 'me,me,me' and their selfishness shines through.  

I think Taylors statement is worded perfectly because it wasn't silence for the sake of it, it was to keep half a million people safe from more threat.
really?! wtf do they want from her?
She set boundaries with fans about how she can say no to photos and people coming up to her for hugs, etc. I don’t do it justice (there’s two tik toks!) so I’m posting two links from the Chappell Roan sub where you can watch the tik tok (you don’t need to have tin tok)

Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/chappellroan/s/TOSUesewpy

Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/chappellroan/s/m2vln1X2C0
I became a Swiftie around red tv - and even then I was just starting, very slow - and yet I feel like I'm much more sane and have a better vision of who Taylor actually is than a good amount of older fans. And I don't mean it to brag or anything - it kinda scares me that this is real (for what I've seen online, which I know is just a portion of it). I sometimes feel so stupid trying to defend Taylor on things like this Vienna cancelations (or ttpd, but that's a whole other thing) because some "fans" just don't want to understand and want to hate and say it's unfair and wrong.
...' The crowds were chatting "MORE" ' - it's insane. Someone else in this thread mentioned r/sadswifties and omg that is an insane sub. 

I love Taylor's music, SO much, and I'd have loved to go to the tour but didn't have tickets (so can't wuite comprehend having tickets but not going), but I cannot imagine turning on *Taylor* and deciding to hate *her* because the concert was cancelled for my safety? People are saying they're blocking her, stopped listening to her music because what... She didnt talk about a dangerous situation for like 2 weeks? ...ok? (Also they're complaining her statement is condescending and basically telling them to shut up, which I also don't get)
I was like “is this a follow up to ME! ?” 😂
You can be devastated about all of the above and still have the common sense to realize Taylor was not commenting because she was advised to to keep hundreds of thousands people safe. They are not mutually exclusive
Lol really? If you truly think Taylor is going to use her summation of the eras tour to call out a bunch of teens - you may be too online. Not everything is a drag especially from Taylor. Stop dividing people. Vienna fans had a right to be upset and Taylor had every right (and was completely right) in waiting to talk about Vienna.

Why do swifties always view it as some sort of competition of what fans are in Taylor’s good books?
It’s a statement about a fucking terrorist attack. This is real life. Someone planned an attack in a city people still live. And you’re getting excited on the internet because you are projecting that Taylor is ‘clocking them?’. Seriously, you need to spend some time offline.
I’m not saying Taylor was wrong at all. She was right for keeping silent. I’m disgusted at people hating on Vienna fans all over when they’re going through some shit right now and misinterpreting Taylor’s words as if they don’t feel bad enough already.
Most people did not bully taylor they were hurt her team was silent about the shows and continued to release variants. 

Even if it was obvious to you (and me), for some people it’s not. It’s weird people are being so nasty about Vienna fans when something awful happened to them. Period.

Using it as a gotcha situation is immature and posting people’s tweets to ‘attack’ them is plain weird. Taylor was not calling anyone out she was explaining why she was silent and if you think any different you need to get off Stan twitter.
Loverfest ticket holders were told they were going to get a boost in line to get eras tickets, and that didn’t happen though. I hope it happens for Vienna fans though 🤞
The attack was at a Taylor Swift themed dance class/ holiday club for children, not one of her concerts.
I don’t know if it was you or someone else but I remember seeing a comment from some who worked in anti-terrorism. But some people can’t see past their own personal feelings and turn a blind eye to anyone trying to speak common sense. They are choosing to stay mad and have unnecessary hatred.
Ah yes...the good ol' I know more than an expert route. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
It was a sad situation all around. Creating a sub to sort out their feelings seemed weird but whatever, but quickly turned into a hateful place.
Nothing Taylor does is ever enough.
There’s the sadswifties sub, some people over there are happy, some of them say this statement makes it even worse. ATP I’m just not sure what else she could realistically do
Saw one comment angry the Vienna mention wasn’t its own post and was combined with her end of Europe leg instead. Smh

ETA: to clarify, Taylor’s post was perfect imo and anyone who doesn’t agree needs to go give their head a wobble
Money probably
>because I grew up in a time and place where the name ISIS gave me immediate fear


You mean like 5 years ago? 
Someone said “Taylor has to prove every 5 minutes that she’s not evil”

It’s absurd
100%, it meant more of us didn’t miss out on seeing her. It’s the relief that she knows she was in a tough spot with this, don’t say anything and they’ll be pissed off or do say something and potentially risk thousands of lives for one small post. She did the right thing and only people without critical thinking skills think otherwise
I feel like every pop star right now is *at least* bi but Taylor can’t say ANYTHING except also she drops constant hints that are “so obvious.”

It just doesn’t make any sense. 

And then they get mad at her when she doesn’t do the things they think she should be doing
This is what I have seen a lot of on social media. Especially influencers looking for clout and  numbers. 
You also have to remember that some fans are just dumb as hell. When you have a fan base as big as Taylor does, you’re gonna have a large number of dumbass fans.
I feel like a lot of her fans try to center themselves in anything that happens to her
I got in a little back and forth with someone on a different platform this week who kept talking about how Taylor thinks about things, and how real fans know. I wish I had screenshots or something, I’m not doing it justice (they blocked me lol) but the way they were talking was truly as though they personally knew all her thoughts and feelings and beliefs and could speak on them. Ok 😬😬😬. It was legit disturbing.
Yeah I called someone out on it for throwing a temper tantrum about it. They got butt hurt about it and tried to turn it around on me saying that I was the one being weird 

Taylor 100% did the right thing
The number of people who wrote posts/comments about the fact that they unfollowed Taylor on all social media platforms, blocked her on Spotify/social media and even deleted Spotify because they’re no longer interested in listening to any music is…concerning, to say the least.
There's a big difference between people being sad that their show was cancelled and people spewing hate at her for not making a statement according their timeline. I saw more of the latter, unfortunately.
Literally no one has ever said that. Everyone sympathizes with the sadness of the concert being cancelled; that doesn’t not excuse people piling on her for things that were clearly done for the safety of the remaining concert goers, her crew and herself.
Right, I don’t think there’s a single person here that wouldn’t feel disappointment and heartbreak. Completely valid feelings and emotions. But there’s a segment of people who seem to think she owes each individual person an apology.
Some of these poems and letters written by Vienna fans are giving that speak up now. It’s just as embarrassing.
I don’t fault her at all! It’s a massive safety risk, and her song being used last night is all the evidence we need on who she supports
Wait what song did they use?
Ooh what song?
For those looking. 

Roll call state: Rhode Island

Song: Taylor Swift, “Shake It Off (Taylor’s Version)”

https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/every-song-played-2024-dnc-roll-call-hot-100-peaks-beyonce-taylor-swift-chappell-sabrina-1235757392/
Idk if it's true, but I heard that they were gonna be setting up stations where people could register to vote at all of the remaining US shows? Would be really cool if so!
Yes, I agree!
I’d be scared *shitless* if I saw some illiterate Nazi fuck standing near the venue with a big gun
There’s rumblings of a lawsuit
Same, I definitely think there's a message in there for all the crazies claiming she must be pro-Trump since she hasn't said anything about the AI images.
Same. It’s so much more satisfying for me that she’s paid that megalomaniac dust so far.

She’ll speak when she thinks it’s best, no one should be pressuring her to do so earlier because, surprise, a big dickhead did a dickhead thing to try and get attention.
Yes!!
Yes! I’m sure we’ll get a generic “go vote” post at the very least
It’s so fun, right? I always feel safe going to concerts, no matter how prominent the artist! ^/s
Especially when there’s no trusting that the security hires will do their job—what if they’re secret or not so secret Trumpers?

I realize that that tends toward the paranoid but
I saw some criticism earlier tonight that "she spoke about politics in 2020 so why not now??" Well, in 2020 everyone was home all the time, there were no gatherings of 80k people to target. And it was pre-Jan 6. Things are different now
You want her to speak out against the man who is promising a blood bath if he loses, and set his cult to storm the capital building?
Agree to disagree! We’re sitting on a powder keg here in the states
When she *just* tells her fans to register to vote - no endorsement, no party preference, JUST “make sure you’re registered!” it has gotten her serious death threats. Given the US’s propensity towards mass violence, more so than in Europe generally, she’s almost certainly going to wait until right before Election Day to minimize any potential retaliation happening during a concert. I’d sure be thinking of mass shootings in her position.
Doesn’t this entire post prove she does speak out when the safety of her fans and crew is as guaranteed as she can make it??

What more do you want from her? Damned if she does, damned if she doesn’t.
And that every issue is highly nuanced!! There are usually wrongs on all sides. And, like most of us, she probably doesn’t understand those nuances enough to make a public statement. Like people calling for influencers and celebs to make statements against certain countries is insane to me. They are not politicians or pundits!

Taylor swift can anonymously donate millions of dollars to the DNC and we will never know.
Somehow Hozier manages to do a full speech on all of these issues at every single show. He’s not as big as her but he’s played to crowds of the same size, and he pulls no punches.

ETA: Plus Chappell being very blatant in her statements at Gov Ball has not raised alarms about her increasing crowd sizes, and Beyoncé literally greenlit Kamala to use a single in her commercial to be her theme song. Kesha has an explicit pride message at every show. If Taylor doesn’t do these things, it’s her choice, but the implication that a superstar speaking politically on any issue is irresponsible is both incorrect and a slight against the artists that do.
To be fair you only just asked those questions, so not sure how I could have answered them before now. Those things are all very important of course, but I was thinking more issues that are closer to home for her and lots of her fanbase, or those where what she says and does will have influence from a practical view. US elections, reproductive rights, LGBT rights etc. Whilst it might be nice to hear, her coming out in support of Ukraine or to denounce a genocide in the DRC realistically does not change those situations, though I really respect artists that do bring the spotlight to world issues that fly below the radar.
What qualifications does one need to condemn genocide?
I never said she was required, I just think it's a shame when she has so much influence. It isn't parasocial. Lots of high profile artists and creatives 'run their mouth' (talk about important things). 

And absolutely! I suspect there are definitely things we wouldn't agree on, but it's refreshing to see people talk about things that are important to them. There are lots of things Taylor has said and done that I actively don't like, but I'm still a huge fan. You are making lots of assumptions about me. I just pointed out that the original comment I replied to was equating two different things.
I totally agree with you.
[removed]
They're claiming it wasn't genuine and should've happened earlier. 
Thank you!!
As someone who did go to the eras tour and have no positive memories of it, I can say I would have chosen my show to be rescheduled any day - didn't matter how difficult it would be for me to get there (yes, I know where talking about cancelation and not rescheduling, but still). 

I went to Brazil night 1. I think I don't need to say much about that - but I almost fainted a few times during the show and my last hour there I was literally switching to singing loudly to needing to sit down at the floor (which I don't even do at my house, so you can imagine how bad the situation was) because I was too weak or getting dizzy. If I wasn't eating or drinking water for that last hour, I would have fainted. Every time I stopped it didn't take me more than ten seconds to start feeling dizzy or weak. God, I don't even know if I'd still be here if I hadn't gone with my boyfriend (he brought an absurd amount of food for us - and we had to throw some of it out because of security -, and let me eat almost everything because of my situation). It's honestly so scary to think about. And so so so bittersweet. I do know I was enjoying and singing loudly. But I have no memory of seeing Taylor. Or even of listening to her. I remember lightly a few parts of the surprise songs - and that's it. I just remember almost fainting every five minutes. And I was one of the lucky ones. I was at a spot that staff was giving water for free every ten minutes or so. Me and my boyfriend separately drank up to 2L of water. And yet I got to the level I did. 

I just don't feel at all I have attended the Eras Tour or that I have seen Taylor live. The very next night was rescheduled because of the heat and I saw SO many people complaining SO MUCH about Taylor doing this (it was rescheduled to a Monday, when initially it was on Saturday) and I would've given anything for my show to be rescheduled. Again, I was very lucky, she came to my home state/where I live and in a near city (less than an hour to get there - depending on day and traffic), so I would be able to attend whatever day it was. But still, I truly wish I could have at least one clear memory of seeing her and being there. I truly wish my concert was rescheduled and also as someone who was there when that tragedy happened... I feel kinda guilty. Looking back and remembering this show does not leave a good taste on my mouth because I know what happened. So much probably if the show hadn't been cancelled and something happened - the survivors would probably be traumatized (different experience of mine, so it's a bit of assuming, but I can't imagining going through that and not being traumatized) and have their memories of the concert pretty stained. I just wish people could realize that. While reading this I was a bit in doubt if I would've preferred a cancellation instead of having my experience the way it was, and honestly I think it only is a no because my boyfriend - who's not a swiftie and doesn't like Taylor all that much - had one of the best nights of his life just by experiencing the pure joy and excitement I had through the show - which I unfortunately have no memory of. If it wasn't for that, I honestly think I would prefer them to have been cancelled (obviously I'm talking to my experience only and not about all the other attendees who didn't go through the same and could enjoy it) instead of knowing I went to - spent all that money - and only have bad memories of what many say was the experience of a lifetime/the best night they ever had.
People reacted in anger because something devestating happened to them. Empathy is a great thing rather than fighting with people who didn’t get to experience something I bet YOU did.
 “Vienna fans had every right to be upset”.

We ALLLLL agree with this.

Vienna fans did NOT have a right to be upset AT TAYLOR.

And I hate to break it to everyone, but that IG post was the most scathing thing I’ve ever seen Taylor write outside of song lyrics.  It was BDILH the IG post, and I am here for it.

I’m an older swiftie (48).  I’ve lived through some major, world changing terror attacks.  The fact that anyone thought Taylor should face any criticism is wild.  I’m not worried about who is or is not in Taylor’s “good books”.  I am, however, very concerned about the lack of understanding some of her fans showed.  The magnitude of what almost happened can’t be overstated.  

I believe the fans in Vienna let their grief get the better of them and likely lost perspective.  They don’t need to feel like they are in Taylor’s “bad books”, but they do need to reflect on what happened and learn something from it.
A. I don’t view her fans as teens. I think the average age is 20s-30s. 

B. I don’t think it was just about calling out fans. I think it was about reclaiming the narrative for her and expressing how intense this leg was. 

C. You can be upset about a concert being canceled but a lot of responses went too far. If she never could talk about it that would have been fine. 

D. I don’t view it as being a good fan. I view it as not being a shitty person who has a level sense of reality. 
First, i don’t know where you’re getting “excited” from HAHA weird though

Second, she did clock them. She put them in their place, again, as she absolutely should have. The amount of bs people gave her for not giving some stupid statement and claiming she didn’t care about her fans and was only in it for the money was actually insane. She very obviously was protecting herself, her staff, and her fans…why that wasn’t obvious to people that she literally had to spell it out for people is so sad 😂 the lack of comprehension skills…big yikes.
I understand you’re coming from a place of pain here but I think you’re taking what everyone is saying towards what everyone acknowledges as a small subset of people to be against all Vienna fans. I can promise you no one thinks all Vienna fans have those feelings and that you are empathasized with and people know that most people are rational. People are talking about the vocal minority who were crucifying Taylor for ultimately keeping people safe. That’s all
I'm not on Stan Twitter and don't need to be.


The Vienna "fans" being "attacked" are the ones who have repeatedly gone after Taylor about this. 


She set a boundary in this post.
[deleted]
somebody on there was upset she "chose" UK fans over Austrian fans and like it's like yeah she chose to err on the side of caution and not inadvertently encourage further attacks where potentially 1000s of people could die rather than babying people who at most are out a couple thousand dollars what a monster... like how out of touch do u have to be
And even when she (yet again) proves that she isn’t, people in the comments are super quick to dismiss it as just an act to gain positive press and she’s secretly super evil!!!!!! She’s everyone’s favorite punching bag.
It’s wild because it’s so accurate.
Lmfao so true
😂
THIS. Being a member of 2 different Facebook groups for the Wembley shows made me realize that there are a whole lot of folks existing amongst us without the slightest iota of common sense. 
“How do I know if my bag is A4 size if I don’t own a ruler?” “I bought GA floor tickets and they say 14+ only.  My daughter is only 6 but is tall for her age, will they let her on the floor?” “Will we be arrested if we leave before Karma?” Copy/paste x10 every. single. day. Ok the last one was an exaggeration but not far off. 
I’m not the smartest person by any stretch, but I was amazed at how some of these people are successful enough adults to afford Eras tickets when they don’t even know how to search within a Facebook group or use Google 😩
I had to point out to someone that if they are that upset and emotional about their show being cancelled, then they should have some empathy for what she is likely feeling because it is what they are feeling x200,000. That should not have been a mind blowing concept but alas…
Oof yeah I just looked around it that sad swiftie sub and it’s like an entire subreddit of Speak Up Now. I didn’t seen any poems or letters though. I think I’ll keep myself in the dark on those lol.
Rhode Island used Shake It Off in their roll call
During Rhode Island's turn for roll call, they played Shake It Off. Each state/territory had a different song that fit that state somehow (e.g. Michigan had Eminem, Minnesota had Prince) and all songs were cleared for use ahead of time (aka Taylor/her team said it was okay for the DNC to use it).
Shake It Off! Every state had a song or two and Rhode Island chose that.
Shake It Off!
For those looking.

There’s likely a cease and desist at the least, since the post was taken down.
Especially because she’s in her WAG era and we remember what happened at the parade…girlie just wants safety, I think it’s clear she’s not afraid to lose certain FaNs
It's not paranoid at all. Even Joe Biden has said he doesn't trust some of his Secret Service agents because they are Trump supporters.   It's certainly reasonable for Taylor to feel the same about venue security personnel who go through far less vetting.
I don’t think it’s paranoid at this point.
She has already spoken against him and he didn’t really care.
She doesn’t need to speak out against him. She can simply endorse another candidate as she has done before.
Pop stars cannot save the political landscape, voting for the right candidate can.
Which one? As a Ukrainian, I would be happy to see some words of support for us but I will never ever demand anything from her bc her music is enough. It brings me much needed escapism and joy I've been deprived for almost 3 years now. I want you to understand that she either should start making statements about all the current genocides in the world or about neither bc someone will complain in any case - Aren't we humans too, why she didn't bring up our genocide?'. I don't think just bc she makes pop music she's qualified to make any statements about these serious issues.

"even a heart emoji would've been good enough" 🙄
Apparently they can’t read then. She ELI5 why she waited.

These people should stop being fans honestly. Everyone would be better off
😐 that’s just ridiculous
I have plenty of empathy for people whose shows got canceled. I do not, however, have empathy for people viciously attacking a pop star because she had no other choice but to cancel said shows. What is wrong with YOU?!
I can assure you if it were my show cancelled I would be devastated but realize that my disappointment is worth less than peoples literal lives and that I’d realize that Taylors silence was because she had literally hundreds of other thousands of peoples safety on her mind and not just mine. I am empathetic to the situation and peoples heart break over it, I am not sympathetic to anyone who claims Taylor did a single thing wrong in following experts advice and ultimately keeping HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALIVE
- BDILH could mean "But Daddy I Love Him", a track from *THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT* (2024) by Taylor Swift.

I do understand the frustration with her pushing variants without having said anything. Although, I don’t know whether that’s within her control. I do not understand the frustration with her not having said anything.
Most of the people who were saying stuff about why isn’t she making a statement we’re definitely teens.

And if you don’t think it’s about calling out fans then why are you disagreeing with me?

I never said the responses didn’t go too far. But turning Taylor’s statement into a ‘gotcha’ moment is extremely immature.
Look at these comments. There’s plenty of people posting peoples twitter @ from this girl saying she’s disappointed Taylor hasn’t said anything. It’s disgusting. So what if this girl missed the mark and tweeted something? She’s in pain. do you really think Taylor wants her fans fighting? NO. This statement wasn’t about that and it’s sad as hell people are turning it into malicious. Now that’s all.
It was a daytime dance class themed around Taylor, these were 6-11 year olds at the class at 11:45am.
It happened just before midday though
So true! 

God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what’s best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I’ll never see
You’re better off not reading any of it. It’s mostly them using Taylor’s lyrics to address her not say anything about Vienna.
I appreciated it in the moment, but if PA had used Cruel Summer (It's BLUE, the feeling I've got) I would've hit the ceiling with joy.
Of all the songs, why that one? Ready For It...? was right there!
Fun!
I hadn’t seen that!!!
Isn’t that depressing to think about?
That was pre Jan 6th though and before she started this tour. What trumpies have become is enough for her to stay quiet about him and focus just on Harris exclusively instead. We don’t need violent misogynists targeting her
Well, Kamala only officially became the candidate this week, and if we're looking into how she's done it in the past, she didn't endorse Biden until much closer to the election.
Which is why I don’t wait for my celeb of the month to tell me who they’re voting for. 

I decide for myself.
If a popstar can get 30,000 people to vote like Taylor did with getting people registered, then yes they can make a measurable, even crucial, difference
All genocides should be condemned. It doesn't matter what kind of job someone has. We're all qualified to say that killing, starving, and torturing people is wrong.
Why do I feel like some of those people would’ve rather the shows going on and actually risk dying
Oh my god the comments on the post about the statement are crazy 😭
I’m one comment away from being kicked out of there for trying to be reasonable about why Taylor hasn’t spoken out.
That's such a lie 🤣 We all know they would go feral if they just got a heart. We're all trying our best to be empathetic to them, but when you turn a positive subreddit into something so vapid, it's hard to have empathy.
I’m not referring to anyone who’s viciously attacked Taylor. There’s people in this comment section saying they hope people who simply asked where Taylor’s statement is ‘feel like shit’ as if their lives weren’t also threatneed very recently.

You need to grow up, respectfully. Taylor doesn’t need defending and this sub gets crazy parasocial.
Props to you for basically writing the same thing I did at the same time 😁  I cannot wrap my head around people not realizing this
Most people would! I disagree with anyone blaming Taylor of course. I also disagree with, and I will repeat this one last time for everyone who keep purposely ignoring what I’ve said - THINKING TAYLOR IS USING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SNAP BACK AT FANS. 

Not everything is a tea and a diss.
If you want to act like age is the problem then you aren’t active in this fandom. 

I said it was more than calling out shitty comments not that I didn’t think she was calling out the comments. 

It’s not immature to point out fans were acting poorly and it is a gotcha moment to anyone who thought she didn’t care. 
I saw that, thought it was weird and also thought that was another small portion of fans that are going to have weird behaviour one way or the other. You’re not arguing with that person
Probably because she hasn’t re-released it yet lol
It would be amazing if they used The Man during DNC
cuz usa olympics already used it 😅
It sure is.
Yeah I agree I don’t care for entertainer endorsements to begin with
...NGL I too...get those vibes.
If you go back to posts from a few days ago, it’s genuinely weird. There’s a somewhat normal reaction post here and there, but most of it is just bizarre
I’m not specifically defending Taylor here, I’m defending humanity because respectfully, some of these people are insane with their comments. Yourself included. Please reflect. Or improve your reading comprehension. While you’re at it, also grow up. Thx.
I have to believe that they are young and don’t have the perspective and critical thinking yet to realize that they are not the centre of the universe yet and that sometimes life just really isn’t fucking fair and it doesn’t just get made right. (Again reiterating that what happened fucking sucks, is devastating, I am more than sorry to anyone who was meant to be there and I’m not trivialising that just peoples inability to realize Taylor didn’t do anything wrong and did not owe them a statement more then she owed the hundreds of thousands of people her best attempt at safety)
‘Aren’t active’ as in I don’t spend all of my days going through trolls comments.. then okay. I hold my hands up.

Chances are taylor is not as ‘active’ either. 

It is not a gotcha moment ffs. A terrorist attack nearly happened that many people including Taylor were DEVESTATED. She released a lovely statement that put a lot of people’s minds at ease… and you’re using it to wage war on a bunch of people online? Isn’t that pathetic?
And that’s fair enough
I scrolled a bit, but then I decided I wanted to keep my brain cells and left lol
I don’t spend all my days doing that either. I don’t think for a second Taylor is active online. She gets told things through staff and friends. 

I’m not waging war. Exactly a terrorist attack was planned and people chose to attack her over trying to protect fans. I think it’s pathetic to have gotten mad at her. If you think pointing that out is waging war then you have some odd morals.
Fair enough lol
The fact you have no empathy for thousands of fans who have been looking forward to this for it to have been snatched away by a terrorist who was literally in their city where they could’ve died is crazy. They were mad. Most people would be mad. They felt hurt. Taylor explained why. You’re the one with odd morals here. You’re more focused about deciding who’s a ‘good fan’ and a ‘bad fan’ than anything. Now that’s weird.
I literally said it’s not about being a good fan or bad fan. You continue to respond in ways that show either not reading what I wrote or not comprehending it. 

If a concert being cancelled due to a terrorist attack being planned and you get mad at the artist then I have no empathy for you. I think that’s childish and immature. 
My daughter and the 22 hat
My 10-year-old daughter, Pippa, was the lucky recipient of the 22 hat in Edinburgh on the third night.

I am genuinely overwhelmed and deeply touched by the kindness and happiness expressed to my family in the last couple of days. I’m also incredibly proud of how polite and gracious Pippa was; it was by far my proudest moment as a father.

On behalf of my adoring family, please accept my thanks for your love and kind wishes. Pippa was blown away at the concert by how happy everyone was for her. I’m struggling to find words than express my gratefulness, but please know you are an incredible community. Every kind message has touched us dearly.

Best wishes,

Happy Dad


Very curious about how the lucky person is chosen if you don’t mind sharing 😄 
Video of hat giving and interview with Pippa for anyone who’s not seen. Just the sweetest thing https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c4nn55jn1ylo
I watched this on a grainy livestream ❤️❤️
Weird question but I’ve been wanting to know, did you get a security escort out of the concert after your daughter had the 22 hat in her possession?
Some day sweet Pippa is gonna grow up, fall in love, get engaged, you'll walk her down the aisle and dance with her and at the end of the night she's gonna look at you with tears in her eyes and say "thanks Dad, this was the second best day of my life" because NOTHING IS EVER TOPPING THIS.
Swifties gets a bad rap sometimes, but posts like these—(from the ABSOLUTE joy on this girl’s face to hearing how wonderfully she was celebrated to the wholesomeness of dad taking the time to write this thank you!!) remind me that’s there simply no fandom like us :)
The 22 section of the show always makes me cry. It’s just so lovely how much she adores her fans and how much they love her. How can you dislike her? How? It’s just gorgeous all round.
This so special! I’m so happy Pippa got to have such an incredible moment!
I watched your daughter receive the 22 hat on a grainy livestream and I was so happy for her because the joy was so evident on her face. This is so special for everyone that she got the hat and we all got to see her enjoying herself. Congratulations to your beautiful Pippa. ❤
the fact that Taylor went with having a kid be the recipient of the hat (well, most of the time), is so wonderful and delightful: It's like her connecting with an other era of herself -- a trip back to girlhood, and to the enormous emotions of that age

  
And, really, no one can criticize this decision either: you could imagine the insane jostling for attention if the hat ordinarily went to an adult. Like the Meet & Greets, but a million times worse because there's only one hat. Instead, by giving the hat to a kid, everyone just gets to go 'omg so cute' night after night, because it is
[removed]
Pippa is just too stinkin’ cute!!! What a sweetie and what a lovely experience for her !!!!
I was in the crowd watching. To say your daughter captured the excitement and gratefulness of everyone's inner child, of just to be there that night is an understatement. 

There was not a dry eye in crowd where I was standing. Your daughter did you and the whole crowd proud. 

Your daughter was the epitome of politeness and graciousness. 

I hope she remembers this always. Huge love to her, and your family. 

Love from another Swiftie x
This is your daughter!? I love her!!!!!! So sweet!
This is so amazing.  The 22 moment every show makes me cry.  What a beautiful moment.  Love that for your girl!
I was there and I actually got so emotional, Pippas reaction was just beautiful. Such a lucky girl.
Amazing!!!!! Go Pippa!
I’m glad you guys had such a good time. I hope it’s a good memory for her always. 🤍
Very cool.
Aww I saw this video somewhere this morning and I got happy tears! She is so adorable and watching her reaction tugged my heart strings. 🥹🫶
Aww every time she does this it makes me cry. She’s so genuine and the joy on the recipients face is just so amazing to witness. I didn’t see the live feed but the picture you shared is so awesome! What a beautiful memory for you and your daughter!
Thank you for sharing this with us, what a beautiful moment! Hope you and your daughter had the most wonderful time ♥️♥️
Omg! Would you mind sharing your daughter's impressions of this moment?
You just know she’s going to cherish that moment forever.
I was there! I cried! It was SO lovely 🥰
i saw a clip on tiktok and i cried!! 🥹 i'm so happy for your sweet little girl ♡
I was there for this moment! And when she and mom were escorted away from the stage after. The people on the floor were cheering and clapping for her!
She’s precious! So happy she has this sweet memory!
This is so sweet!
I was there and it made my group and I tear up with joy. Very cute reaction!
I was there!! The whole crowd was in love with her, she was so so sweet.
Congrats!!
Aww!! This is adorable! Pippa is a sweetheart! 💛
Awww. I’m so happy for her! 💜
Congratulations 😭 I'd NEVER shut up talking about this *if* it ever happens with me!!!
aw so cute🥹
Oh my god she’s adorable! How lovely for her! Thank you for posting
Awww she looks so happy. Watched all the videos on Instagram. So happy she got to meet and give Taylor a hug.
Wholesome moment
I was at the show and cried at how sweet this was, which is not like me at all! Such a lovely moment, she’s a credit to you
Pippa!!! I was there, what a genuinely sweet child she is. Thank you for sharing!
Go Pippa go!
Pippa was adorable, I was there and she was so cute. Really brought a tear to my eye. She kept saying “thank you” the whole thing was so sweet. Everyone around me was saying “aw!”.
She also looked very sparkly and pretty!
Aaaaaaah I loved this moment - so glad to see this angle as I was over in section E13 watching this live  🫶🏼
She's rocking that hairstyle.
Oh I’m so obsessed with this!! You can see the joy in both of them. So glad your daughter had this and also all the other swifties around her celebrating it as well!! 🫶🏻 please tell her hi from all the internet swifties, she’s a beautiful little girl and will do great things!!
Was at the show and saw this. Could bring a tear to an auld stone !!
Did you have floor seats?  How did Mama Swift find your daughter?  I’m so happy for her and for you, how absolutely magical ❤️🫶🏻❤️🫶🏻❤️🫶🏻
Omg ur daughter Pippa looks like she’ll explode of joy seeing talor tbh I would too :)
That’s Taylor, wherever she goes whatever she does, she gonna make quite a few people feel special. And not just oh thanks, I mean special that’s how you do celebrity and that’s how you do fame. Give it away, share it with and many people as you can whenever you can. Don’t hide, let people know you appreciate them.
To all the grown adults bitching about Taylor picking kids, that's probably exactly why she does. Kids don't bitch about every little thing they think is owed to them.
Thank you for sharing this!! I was there and seeing Pippa's true, unbridled joy and appreciation for this moment is one of my favourite memories of the night. My friends and I were in tears watching her react to the moment and then went home and cried watching videos of it as well. You and her mother have clearly raised an amazing kid who can appreciate the gifts she's given while seeming to still be in the moment enough to experience it as well - that is no small feat! Congrats, Pippa, thank you for being your vulnerable, wonderful self in front of 73,000 people and letting all of us live vicariously through you 🤍
I don’t like Taylor swift but this is incredibly wholesome 😊
So awesome for her!!!
This is amazing. What a special moment! Thank you for sharing it with us.
This is such an amazing thing. So happy for her!!
This is the coolest picture ever omg
I’m so pleased for her! ❤️
Pippa is so adorable, and I'm glad she has such a supportive father! Also to hear that the other fans in the stadium were happy for her to get the hat.
This is so special!! Congratulations🤍🤍🤍
I cried my eyes out at her reaction, she is adorable and I hope she remembers this forever!
I saw the video of Pippa on TikTok. Adorable! Congratulations to her and her family!
I was in tears watching her at the show! She was absolutely adorable and I'm so happy she'll have this core memory forever!!!
I cried happy tears at this watching from my seat 🥰
This is so amazing! Love this for her! What a special moment!
Ah I was in the crowd for this, my wife started full-on crying at how sweet this was - the kid literally couldn't cope, it was equal parts hilarious and touching 🥰
I have a video of this moment from near the back of the stadium but zoomed in on the screens, I’d love to get this to you!
I was there and saw this! I was nearly in tears, your daughter looked blown away by it all, she was so cute! 🥰
These make me cry every time! Lucky girl 🫶
This makes my heart so happy! So well deserved and sending so much love to you and your family, dad ❤️ also can we just talk about how Pippa is the cutest name ever?!😭🫶🏼
This gave me chills!! She’ll remember this forever ❤️
Hugs
This warms the cockles of my cold dark heart. I hope she had the most wonderful experience. ❤️ Love this.
This PJ obsession is ridiculous.  Could you imagine the nightmare of her flying commercial?
I was there n3 when she got the hat! She was so grateful 😭 you’re doing an amazing job raising her x
Were your daughter and her mum sitting in section E13 when they were escorted away to the VIP tent? I only ask because I was sitting in the row behind a mum and young girl when they were asked to follow a member of the event team before the show started and I started getting excited thinking they were off to get the 22 hat! I was so happy for her and your daughter looked so ecstatic and grateful when Taylor gave her the hat and a hug 🥰🥰
I love how you can always see her say I love you to the child.
Who’s chopping onions in here? 🥲
This made me cry
Congratulations Pippa! and congratulations mom and dad for raising such a wonderful child!
Lucky girl
I'm not even a swiftie, this just came up on my page but this is such a sweet and wholesome post 😭 I love it, so uplifting
The way that Taylor empowers girls, ugh my heart. I was not a swiftie until my daughter was singing around the house and some songs sound different than the other crap so whenever I say “who sings that?” She says “Taylor Swift” …so like any mother of an 8 year old girl, I want to see what she’s listening to and now I have also fallen in love. 
Now I’M down bad crying at the gym.
 it's a little off the topic but I am a swifty I adore her and her music most everything about her I am however not completely obsessed with her and at the end of the day she is just another person but with a very high profile job. It always amazes me though that what I consider the true die hard obsessed swifties who follow her everywhere claim to be the biggest fans collect everything tweet her potential location violate her privacy and expect that because of her very public life she does not get the right to any sort of privacy and must be "ON"  at all Times in the public view which none of you would in any way tolerate and knowing that Taylor on so many occasions has made it known how truly scary people mobbing locations in which she is reported to be freaks her out and makes her very anxious as well as feeling unsafe why would you guys claim to be swifties yet ignore such an important detail?

Just seems less than cool to say I love you so much but I give 0 F*cks about your feelings and or safety? Just some food for thought and something I wonder a lot but what do I know I've never been fortunate enough to even go to one of her concerts I hope the serious swifties take this as constructive advice and not me being hateful
I was there! She was so sweet.  Everyone around us in standing got emotional for her, it was so cute.  I hope she had the absolute best time!
Screaming crying! Yay Pippa!
So cool! I’m so glad she got it and everyone has such fun! Can’t wait to see her in Vancouver!
im sorry but how tf is she upright?? i would be unconscious on the floor 😭
We were there and she made our whole group cry with how shocked and happy she was! She’s obviously a very well brought-up little girl so good on you.
I love being a Swiftie ❤️
i saw her getting it at the concert on sunday!! such a cute and sweet reaction - she deserves all the happiness!
I was there with my 9YO daughter and we were SO very happy for Pippa. When her little excited face came on the screen I *may* have shed a little happy tear 🥹

Also, Space Buns? ICONIC!!
I was there and cried. I was so happy for her.
So cute, congrats miss Pippa!
I was there for this!! Such a beautiful moment ❤️ thanks for sharing so we can all hear your side of it!
Me and my partner had tears in our eyes at the true excitement and happiness and shock it was honestly just beautiful to watch and I am so happy for your daughter, a moment she will cherish forever!
Trying to get 2 tickets to any show for me and my daughter, finding it hard!
But on the note of your post, that's amazing for her. A memory she will cherish and remember forever 💕
Her little face was priceless 💖
I was there and she was a little star. So glad to have witnessed this moment.
My sister and I were there and saw her! She's absolutely adorable and we loved seeing her get the hat, congrats!
This is the show I was at! Seeing such joy on Pippa's face brought me to tears, it was such a special moment.
I think it's so sweet the kids get the hats 👒 they deserve it the most! Not only is it an amazing lifelong memory but it solidifies how amazing their idol is ♥️
Omg I saw the tiktok someone posted about this sweet girl getting it. I was so happy for her!!! What a great core memory!
I got this on video form the right side screen she was so sweet me and my mum couldn’t stop going on about how cute she was receiving it xx
Seeing the 22 hat handoff makes me tear up every time. The recipients’ reactions are so sweet and joyful, and Taylor is always so kind and engaging. Congrats to Pippa!
I saw a clip on TikTok. What a sweetie. So happy for her.
this is making me cry 😭😭😭 how absolutely sweet is this
Dad here, was welling up seeing Pippa get the 22 hat.
she was awesome.
What q lovely memory
AWWWWWE! The experience of a lifetime for both dad and daughter. ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1072)
This is the cutest thing 😭🥹
I was at this show and this moment made me cry! You could see how thrilled she was! Also loved being able to see her accent through the screen ❤️
I was lucky enough to be at that show, and your daughter getting the hat was such a sweet moment. I’m happy for her.
🥹🥹🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Well at least she is happy
Pippa was so darn cute! So happy for her.
This is so sweet I’m gonna cry 🥹 congrats sweet girl💕
How did I get a notification from r/TaylorSwift ?
Crying 😭 what a lovely dad
Wow amazing!!! How did she get selected? Did they just come up to you before the show started and ask? It seems like some cities it has been very planned out and others random?
Sweet girl 🖤 moments like this can be pivotal for someone. I hope this little girl lives a big ole life and always remembers how seen she felt in this moment
I’m so happy for you and your kiddo!
Taylor is the premiere performer and that’s life for her. She chose you guys and that’s special
I saw her/this on tik tok and I was moved to tears on how cute your daughter was in this interaction ❤️ so happy for her/you guys!
😁
Congratulations
❤️
Congratulations, Pippa! You have one of my all time favorite names. I'm so happy for you! 

And wow, Dad! You should be so proud of your little one. A gracious spirit is so important. 

Much love to you both. 🫶🏼
So cool Pippa! Congratulations!❤️
I’d sell my soul and kill to get that hat and then I’ll be buried with it
Goosebumps. So happy for your daughter. This is why I love Swifties. 🫶🏼✨
Just love this!! And so happy for Pippa!!❤️❤️
Omg!!!!! This video made me cry all the way from Chicago! I bet she was overjoyed
I’m not crying, you are!
I still haven't accepted I am probably not going to make it to Eras. However, seeing this definitely makes it easier bc the way this would wreck me to see live. This makes my heart hurt in the best way you know?
My favourite thing about this was that you could see your daughters Scottish accent come through even though you couldn't hear her on the big screen. She was adorable, what an amazing wee girl you have.
That poor girl that died at rio tho wonder how her family has been taken care of
This is so sweet and makes me so happy!  Aww!! 🥹🫠
Omg!!! So sweet
Taylor Swift is an incredible woman and the way she is with her fans is absolutely beautiful!!!
Tell her I said "congratulations", okay?
I'm so happy you got to witness this moment of pure joy for your daughter :)
Aww!
Why’s it called “the 22 hat?”
I saw her get the hat on tik tok! So happy for her, she will remember that moment forever!!!
I literally tear up every time I see a video or picture of someone getting the hat. It just seems like pure joy
That is SO awesome!
I was there that night!!! I teared up watching your daughter get the hat!! What a memory to last a lifetime!!!!
I love Taylor! She is so humble and kind hearted and cares deeply about us fans. 🥹🩷
You named your daughter what????
I can read her mind, she's having the time of her life...

Wow what an amazing moment, that's all I can say.
Omg congrats!! Such a special moment! How did y’all get picked?
What a wonderful post and picture!! Absolutely love it 😍
I'm so happy for you. We go to Wembley next Friday and it would make my daughter's life to be chosen for the hat, she's 11 and already succumbing to mental health issues. 
Your daughter will have the most amazing memory and hat to treasure forever. Well done, Proud Swiftie Dad.
got to see this irl and it was amazing!
Precious!!! Thank you so much for sharing!!!
Awww i was there on Sunday and definitely shed a tear at little sweet Pippa ❤️
This is amazing 🫶🏼
Aww I didnt know Taylor did this. She is really a beacon of kindness, compassion, and generosity.  I love this idea. Great idea Taylor!! (If you are watching, lol) ♡♡♡
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹 THIS WARMED MY HEART!!!!!
I was there and cried so much, your daughter was absolutely precious and so polite and gracious! Well done Mum and Dad! Glad Pippa got a lifetime memory!
This wee girl was 2 rows infront of my daughter 😂 it was horrific I heard
That's so wholesome
Someone needs to put this on ig reels I just wanna see that comment section
Silly question, Happy Dad, what kind of hat is it? Fedora or Bowler or ? Cause I wanna do a Halloween cosplay of Taylor and I need to know hat style! 😂
So glad your daughter got the hat! It’s so lovely to see when kids get it. I hope you both had the best time
What is the 22nd hat?
how did she get picked!???!?
Thank you, OP, for sharing the beautiful story and photo!
Omg, her reaction had me tearing up. She looked so overjoyed and kept saying thank you. It was a pleasure to witness Pippa’s joy in person!
👏👏👏👏👏🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
I don't usually get emotional but every single time I watch one of these videos of the hat passing I tear up, you can just feel the energy in that moment. So much joy. Taylor's an angel for bringing so much happiness into our dark world.
Your daughter bought tears to my eyes! I was there N3 and it was the most wholesome experience to watch.
Ahhhhh she was so adorable! Watching it actually made me tear up a bit, I hope that's a core memory for her!
I was in the crowd at the weekend when your daughter got the hat! She was so happy. I had a wee tear in my eye for her 🩷
I was there! She was adorable, glad she was so happy
Omg she is sooo cute!!!
How much money would you pay for one?!
I was in tears watching this! Super sweet. I'm sure you have probably had lots send but I have a video of the whole thing from just off to the right of the stage- let me know if you want me to get it to you!
She was so brilliant! She summed up exactly how it feels to be a swiftie, not matter your age and it was a pleasure to share this moment with her!
I was there with my friends behind her! She looked so happy! I wish I was her 🥺🥺
I have a lovely video of your daughter receiving the hat on the big screen. It's so clear she's saying THANK YOU SO MUCH! to Taylor. Absolutely delighted for her I hope she has the most magical night ✨️ my sister who wasn't even a swiftie before this (but liked some of her songs) got so teary watching the moment x
🤑
Awesome
Aw I am so glad you posted this!!! I was there and was in tears over her reaction. Such a special moment I am so happy for her!!
Saw your wee girl and it made me sob - she was so so happy and it’s so sweet. Congrats, Pippa!! 💕
I met your daughter ! She let mine try on the hat and take a picture it made my little girl so happy !!  She was so polite and so darling to my little girl from one parent to another thank you so so so much for raising such a lovely polite girl it was so heart warming to see girls come together and have such a precious moment at the concert  ❤️
Every person is good and also different people need to look into their faults before they are judging and think about playing God
awe pippa!!! I love her name so much 💓  this is a memory that she will remember forever. God bless her sweet little heart. I loveeeee Tswift and her music also
Core memory
Taylor the Two Hat
so cute, but also because im still fuming, never decidet to sell HER hat!!!

ive seen several ppl selling them and it even turned out that the kids wanted to keep them. that must be heartbreaking
What's a 22 hat?
What does contributing to the swifty community mean? I mean I’m a die hard swiftie and in all honesty Taylor and me having to travel internationally for this concert on the 22nd played a MAJOR role in me quitting drugs and I’m so thankful I did and will be able to experience this concert sober which is a once I a lifetime experience. I’ve been wanting to quit and finally was like I won’t be able to go on this trip if I’m using drugs.. I had open heart surgery in 2017 and still didn’t quit. Addiction sucks. But if it weren’t for this concert I can’t say that I would have quit at this point. I’m just grateful and happy I did and whoever thinks I’m lame cause I quit drugs for Taylor swift, it wasn’t for her it was for me, she just unknowingly gave me the push I needed. So EXCITED!!!!
How do people even get these seats!!
I’d sell that shit wit the quickness

Love Talor music  but when she went political I'm done trump 2024 let's Love are country again
I hate Taylor 😒 she's mid
[removed]
Dude, I was more appalled at putting a kids face up there, attached to an account,  on a site known for creeps. Now that her name and town are up. Well, That's a choice hun
Just out of curiosity… And learning how a father views raising children… How come this is the most proudest moment…. (JUST CURIOUS) because a celebrity what?… give your daughter her hat!???

I’m just partly confused… do you feel this way you think because you’re a father and maybe I’m seeing it differently because I’m a woman? Because that wouldn’t be the proudest moment… To mean you know I love Taylor Swift this has nothing to do with Taylor Swift she is amazing her attitude is amazing everything about her lights up a room… I get that… However, can you just help me out here and relate a little more info about how that and still so much proud for your daughter at such a young age because they’re already going to be looking up to anyone who has a higher status especially… celebrity status is called… “starstruck!?”
Some are pre-chosen (special kids or a handful of adult fans who have contributed a lot to the Swiftie community) and some TS’ parents just choose a favorite kid during the concert!
For the Singapore tour, it was only two songs before "22" when they picked someone:  
[https://www.asiaone.com/entertainment/primary-5-girl-scores-taylor-swifts-hug-and-22-hat-first-night-eras-tour-singapore](https://www.asiaone.com/entertainment/primary-5-girl-scores-taylor-swifts-hug-and-22-hat-first-night-eras-tour-singapore)

>Giselle’s mother Vicky Chang, a 39-year-old executive assistant at a law firm, did not manage to get tickets for the concert.

>Ms Chang sat outside the stadium with her younger daughter, Elyssa, who will turn eight this year, for the entire 3½-hour show.

>Giselle was dancing along to Swift’s song Look What You Made Me Do when a man in black, who looked like a bodyguard, approached to ask for her chaperone’s permission to take her to the stage.

>She remembers screaming “yes” repeatedly and adds: “I was confused at first, I thought they were just moving me closer to the stage. But then they took me through the gate of the VIP section and I thought, ‘It’s really happening.’ I knelt in front of the stage and saw the whole performance of 22 right in front of me.”
I saw this girl being lead out with her family, they were taken out as I was standing by the exit, it appeared random and the team that got her weren't dressed any differently than the typical event staff.

 The little girl didn't seem to know what was happening ( I remember being concerned because all I saw was a little girl looking confused and her family being lead out by security ) . Maybe her family were told, as they seemed to be in a hurry!!

It happened only a few minutes before 22 started, so I don't think they knew in advance as they were not standing by an exit and looked really surprised!!

Pippa was so happy and thankful, it was a joy to see such a happy kid!
I was at Stockholm N2, there were concert staff roaming the area, not too many but enough that I noticed. In my periphery I saw a group of like 4/5 pass by, two at the back stopped (that’s when i started watching them because why are you approaching a 7 year old boy) to talk to a little boy then called out to the others who’d carried on. It became obvious pretty quickly he was being told he was being picked for the 22 hat, his face was adorable it was so sweet but even cuter was he seemed torn because he wanted his sisters and mom to come with him. They seemed to confirm they could all go and they were whisked away. I didn’t see them for the rest of the concert.
Curious of the chances that she, hypothetically, might choose a 48 year old man, hypothetically, to receive the hat in Warsaw, Poland Night 2, hypothetically.
I’ve heard (sometimes, at least) Taylor’s mom picks the kids

What a darling child ❤️❤️ I would also have thought I was being reprimanded if security came to talk to me during the show! 
Why am I crying?!!! This is the sweetest thing!!! 😫❤️

🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️
I love hearing this story.  And for some reason I really love that Taylor asks permission before hugging them. Good lessons in that.
I hadn’t seen this little interview and I am now crying
Oh dam
Great question! Only my wife and Pippa were at the concert. I was back home receiving sporadic messages from event. I’d asked my wife to guard the hat with her life, and to ask for security if she felt any kind of threat. I’m happy to say that the complete opposite happened, everyone continued to be incredible kind and happy. There was no way anyone would have been able to try anything bad - there were 73,000 people looking after her.
probably not needed when there's a massive horde of Swifties around honestly. If someone tried to steal the hat from the kid it was given to they would probably get their ass beat lol
This is an excellent question that I never even considered. Commenting mostly so I can check back to see if there’s an answer from OP.
Swifties aint like that.  If someone tried to snatch that hat they'd catch hands instead.
I caught a football signed by one of my favorite bands and everyone was like lemme see it. Nope. I put it under my shirt and zipped up
My jacket.
Love this 😂
 😀😀
Let’s hope not because that’s just sad 
pls tell me you're joking
we have the blessing and curse of being the biggest fanbase on the planet. That brings with it a proportional increase in the number of assholes in said fanbase. Every group of people has them. Unfortunately they're the ones who get all the attention.
Makes me cry every single time!!! Just adore Taylor for this.
Ditto. Anyone have a clip of this 22 hat moment?
Right all the hate she gets upsets me 😔
Because she only does good for her fans and the rest of the world she actively makes worse
So you're saying that it wouldn't be cute for everyone if she gave me the hat. I can be cute, really I can. I may be old, bald and fat but I would cute my ass of for a chance to be that close to Taylor. 😀😀😀
I’m glad it’s a kid that gets because I remember the absolute shit show of the meet and greets/secret sessions! 

Plus I was at Edi N3, me and everyone around me were all teary eyed watching her get the hat! It’s honestly such a beautiful moment to see!
It's so cute with the kids. There was some grumbling along big fans on social media about it but it is so unbelievably cute and just pure joy with the kids. I also think it's probably super special for Taylor to see kids who probably weren't even born when Red came out singing along.
[removed]
Take the kids name out please. This isn't a safe place OK
Same - my whole group was crying happy tears!
[I got you](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c4nn55jn1ylo).
Floor was standing room only, so no under 14s. Andrea wasn’t at any of the Edinburgh shows, likely was someone else on Taylor’s team.
As the fifth most powerful woman in our world, it comes with the territory!
From the song

No. We named her Pippa.
Ooop didn’t know this was the sub. Ignore me ban me whatever lmao
Think how u can always be kind words 😊
In the music video for the song “22” Taylor wore a black bowler (?) style hat, so she wears one when performing it. Every show someone (usually a kid) gets picked from the crowd to receive it
Scammer right here!
Makes sense to join a fan group and leave a comment then, right?
My wife is a part-time teacher and I’m currently unemployed.
This is why people don't like us.
Last minute tickets were £50, didn’t need to be rich to get them!
She was literally featured in an interview on BBC News. I saw the story, with her and her mom, on IG long before here. Get over yourself.
It’s the side of her face and no where does it mention where she/they live. Get real.
Thanks for your question.

Firstly - for me - this has nothing to do with gender. My wife and I are equal parents, and neither of us considers either to have a specific role. I don’t have any insights on how a father views raising children beyond my own experience of raising children. I don’t know - or really care - how this differs from one father to another, or one parent to another.

As for ‘the hat’, my pride has nothing to do with Taylor Swift, or her hat. However, in my daughter’s 10-year-old world, her dreams were coming true. Something that meant so much to her that she didn’t even imagine would happen to her, actually happened. In front of 73,000 people and one of her role models, she danced, sang, and embraced every second. When the exchange happened, she was nothing but thankful, gracious, and humble. When she returned to her seat, she let every person who came up to her try the hat on and take their own photographs. Her kindness here moved others to tears, and her selflessness was beautiful.

Ultimately, I don’t think I can help you relate. She’s my daughter, and how she acted and responded in incredible circumstances, will never not make me proud every time I relive the moment. Manners, kindness, respect and gratefulness are massively important values in this household. Even in extraordinary circumstances of such significance in her wee life, she did not falter.

I deserve to be this proud.
It doesn’t sound like he’s proud that a celebrity gave her a hat. It sounds more like he was proud of her manners while receiving the hat
I’m 30 years old and I’d give both my kidneys to get this hat. But alas. I think it’s cute that it goes to kids the most though.

Edit: for the people who don’t get jokes- yes I’m aware that giving both my kidneys would kill me. That was the joke. I can’t believe I have to explain this on the internet but here we are.
Not pre choosen. I watched the interview of ops daughter. They bought tickets 2 hrs before the event and when ops daughter was dancing, a member of staff invited them "backstage"

Edit to add, since learned its sometimes chosen, just not at edi gig
Well that’s pretty cool… I’m understanding his pride gif his daughter a littttle bit more now…😂😂🙈✌🏼
Yeah they find a kid who’s REALLY having fun🤩
What do you mean by fans who’ve contributed a lot to her community? Like what does that look like
She gave it to her from the stage, dunno how "preselected" that is. If it was off stage that's another story, but this one is all over the news
Can we not use the word special to describe me and people like me please? I’m from the UK and this description is offensive. You may be from America and that word may be the proper descriptor there but maybe that could change?
So politics - brutal.
Interesting that they sometimes pick people from outside the stadium! I did not know that!
Dang, just read the article, and like, I’m SO happy that that girl got a once in a lifetime opportunities like that, but I can’t help wondering if her friend is bitter lol. Wondering if the Friend is annoyed or thinking it should have been her because they were originally supposed to take their dad, but dad didn’t go so she brought the girl who ended up getting picked for the hat. 

(I don’t mean it negatively and not trying to assume everyone would be upset rather than happy for a friend like that, I just know it’s easy to get jealous at that age and to spin the situation with “what ifs”—I still distinctly remember being so bitter that my older sister was picked to be the big kahuna at the Disney water park what I was really little lmao)
Pippa’s mum posted on of the Facebook groups that they were just asked to come with a woman (wondering if it was Taylor’s assistant Erica?) and that they were worried they were being asked to leave because Pippa was up dancing on her seat, so I think they were all confused!
She does,  when she's there she sometimes picks the child,  then normally takes them to the VIP area where she and taylors dad stand.

Taylors mum and dad mustn't have been there at Edinburgh as at least one child went back to their seats after 22
OMG I didn’t even think of that. I’m so anxious about authority figures and of doing anything “wrong”, I would’ve  been absolutely panicking if I was approached during the show lmao
Omg same 🥲
I cry every time I see them too lol
I also am crying over a hat. That interview did me in.
Haa I thought that! I did indeed cry over a hat
Yes. I already love and get teary eyed at the 22 hat moments, but finding out that she does a consent check on if the child wants a hug makes it even better. 🥹
The eras tour crowd was incredibly the safest I ever seen in my life!! Everyone was taking care of each other so much
Did everyone sing Taylor’s songs when leaving the concert? We did that in Kansas City and it was magical. 73,000 people all singing her music in unison as we all left was incredible.
Wait did she get to keep the hat? Or no?
The brads and chads can say what they want about swifties, they're still scared of us 💀
[removed]
Definitely on the cringe side😂
They are. Quite obviously.
Even if they're not, what does it matter to you if they think one elaborate ritual is better than another?
Weddings are overrated. The Eras tour is not.
Nah I didn’t even get the hat and I’m not convinced my (hypothetical) wedding could top that night!!!
This comments section is unhinged. Get a life people please
Being in a fanbase as a non-toxic fan is a blessing. People outside the fanbase don't realise what a great community it is. Too bad the toxic ones get the attention.
No, you actively make the world worse
Sweeping statement but ok.
She made a [generous donation to an Edinburgh food bank](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-edinburgh-food-bank-donation-b2561052.html#), which I’m fairly certain is not a Taylor Swift fan club. She apparently does this everywhere she performs. She is just quiet about it.
Same! Me and my friend burst into tears and had to fish out some tissues!
[removed]
??? The OP of this Reddit post (the father) himself mentions the child’s name!
Last minute tickets too! What a memory!!
I’m crying. Omg
*zing*
Oh that's great!
Wow now you’re just flaunting your privilege, anyone else under those circumstances wouldn’t be anywhere near a ts concert because they couldn’t afford it
Hey OP - just wanna say this is an excellent reply! Congratulations to your daughter on receiving the hat! I was watching the live stream and her excitement and disbelief was adorable!
You sound like an incredible Dad. Pippa is lucky to have you and the world is lucky to have her. Keep being loudly proud of your amazing kiddo 🤍
AWESOME… you see… Not ever having children nor being a man I was merely curious and I’m glad that you took the time to explain I was ignorant really in this department as far as your insight and you explained it and it makes perfect sense and well said! I’m very Thankful that you responded and I truly understand I’ve just not experienced the blessing of raising a child… 43 years young I do not know that feeling I’m still having to put together an even start to create a relationship with my mother at this age much less know what a man how a man views his child… Thank you for putting the words the way you did! And yes you do deserve it…
GOTCHA!!!!!!!!
I was just totally curious about this because I didn’t even know anything about the mysterious “22 hat” !!?????😆😆😂🙈🙈🙈
To be honest I think they choose kids because of the potential PR nightmare of choosing the wrong adult! People will find any reason to hate Taylor, so imagine if the hat was given to someone who had a dodgy online history, they’d probably say she was condoning it just by associating with them super briefly. Also I suppose there’s less likelihood of children selling the hat! Completely agree with you though, it’s such a shame older swifties won’t really get this opportunity 💔
Yup. I'm in my 30s, been a Swiftie for 15 years and finally got to go to a show (I'd never been able to fit any other) and would have died if this opportunity was given. But sadly I'm not a cute child and that seems to be the criteria lol
You can have the hat...I'd rather have the Rep sessions back 😁
I throw in 2 kidneys, my arm and a leg for the hat.
Well… if you did that… You wouldn’t be able to stay enjoy the fact that you even got the hat because you wouldn’t be here….🤷🏻‍♀️😆😆😆😆 no pun intended.. just a funny!
Both,😂
I'm way older and I'd love that Hat too!   🤣😂
Yep I'm 31 and I'm jealous lol
Same I think I would knock the kids outta the way to get it 🤣but nah I love seeing their faces and the excitement..it’s brought tears to my eyes seeing them sometimes..give it to the kids 🫶
Damn, both?! Let me get at least one extra if you’re giving em out!
It is always interesting that people who lack the wit to catch the joke are the first to point out “that you would be dead donating both kidneys.”

🤔

Do you think they’re just grumpy or dumb?
Weirdo
As a kidney recipient, I got it, and whereas many kidney jokes further the myth that kidneys are stolen or taken before death from deceased donors, I was amused by yours. My husband donated a kidney ( we dud a paired exchange) and a couple days after his surgery, he said he wished he had another to donate, because he felt so good about doing it.
It's just a hat
[removed]
Wasn’t specifically talking about this kid but a solid number of them are pre chosen. Lilly in Sydney, Kobe’s child in the movie, the many kids with cancer who get the hat etc. OP’s daughter falls in the latter “cute/favorite kids” category
There were tickets available 2 hours before the show?  ☹️
A few examples I can think of were Mikael who created the Bejeweled dance that went viral on Tiktok / that she uses in the show, and then Oliver Mills who makes Tiktok videos about TS, she said while giving it to him that his videos are so funny. Also one older teenager who was a longtime Swiftie battling cancer (she sadly died not long after the show)

 It's definitely mostly children though!
Well she gives a kid the 22 hat from the stage every single show, and they are put in a separate area from the crowd for it… this one was a cute kid they saw but many of them are swifties who are known to be attending that show by TS’ team
That feels like a real stretch.. That was clearly not referring to autistic kids or disabled kids at all, just a broad category of pre-selected children for various known reasons - special because they’re Kobe’s daughter, Gracie’s sister, or a Swiftie who’s popular in the community. 

I have an autistic family member so I am also sensitive to such uses, but the word special doesn’t just need to be entirely eliminated from every context and it clearly wasn’t referring to that here.
They didn't. Her mom and younger daughter waited outside, the picked girl was inside with the ticket of her friend's dad.
If the girl has thoughts like that it would be understandable as she's too young to realize the reality that, she wasn't not picked bc her dad didn't go... she wasn't picked bc she just wasn't picked. They dont pick a ticket number out of a hat; they chose people after seeing them and their energy etc and whatever other criteria.. 

Her dad being there would not have meant they picked her instead of her friend.. or her dad instead of her... so it's a moot hypothetical..
*Exactly* how I felt. The energy at the Eras tour was so joyful and celebratory and *female*. It felt so much safer and better than when I’ve been in that same stadium for NFL games and other concerts 😂
I wouldn’t say everyone was tbh, especially at the Haymarket train station after the show - seen a lot of ignorance and arrogance there I have to say.

Pushing to the front of the queue to get the train happened so frequently
Yes, they get to keep the hat. It would be a PR nightmare if they asked for it back.

I just asked a question and even if I did question if they are being sarcastic I can very much have opinions. It wasn't like I was spreading some hate here, I just asked a normal simple question.
you've totally lost it💀
There is no point arguing with people in their delulu eRaS
Oh no! Someone is enjoying something! Let’s shit all over it.
frr💀
Lmfao I didn’t realise what sub this was it just came up recommended, yall would let Taylor commit genocide lmfao
A true hero
I didn't see that. But that's crazy.. not my kid but ok
lol someone’s jealous of a little girl x
Actually one adult was chosen and it was embarrassing and dangerous imo. She grabbed TS‘ arms and wouldn’t let go. Kids wouldn’t be able to do that. I’ve never seen another adult after that incident 😂
That's actually a really good point
I find it one of her most loved moments when she takes time out of her performance and has a child waiting for her. This will be a time in that child’s life they will always remember
This is a very good point. Taylor Nation has gotten in the hot seat before just retweeting the wrong accounts. Swifties are nothing if not thorough (sometimes unfortunately!)
Or being a creep, honestly. Sad but true. Its why celebs are always a bit nicer and more free with kids 😮‍💨
plus, it’s a memory those kids will have for life and will most likely grow up with it being one of their favorite memories. personally, i couldn’t stand how much people complained that taylor was mainly only giving the kiddos at her concerts the hat, they’re 100% just as happy they got the hat as an teenager/adult would be! (i feel absolutely horrible for the girl whose family tried selling her 22 hat for her ‘college fund’)
I didn't think about this but you're probably so right. Great point!
Cute children get all the good stuff 😡 (yes I am still salty about going to Medieval Times and my knight gave his flower to a child when I was RIGHT THERE 😂😂)
They pick kids because they’re so much less likely to have a shady past. 

Imagine if they picked an adult at random who then turned out to be a massive racist etc. so much easier to avoid controversy
Yeah me too. They’re adorable. I just wish I was 10 so I could have a chance 😂
They’re not really working properly half the time so it’s really no loss 😂
It’s just also just a joke.
It’s like saying “I really want one!!” Because of the story behind it. Going up to the stage and getting one from Taylor Swift herself. I can’t believe I have to explain jokes on the internet. Plebs.
So are bots but here you are
I was at the show in LA (N1) with Kobe's daughter. My seats were so bad, I didn't find out who it was until the next day lol. (Most everyone in LA can probably pick Kobe's kids out of a lineup)
Ahh didn't know! Thanks
On Friday tickets went back on sale.  You could only purchase if you had a code.  I tried and it didn't work, my friend was lucky, when she logged into ticketmaster it worked, so she got me 2 tickets.  And it was a similar story for ops daughter (according to the news clip I saw)
Strange, maybe its just the shows I go to, but for me it's just something the people in the pits expect us stuff to be thrown and handed to them
Ahhh...ok, that makes more sense!
if i was the younger daughter id be happy for my sister but also sad af that i had to sit outside while she got to be VIP 😭
You couldn’t have been standing 😂. I felt many people were so viscous. I stood very close to the stage, and I felt like I was being pushed consciously just to give up my spot and leave. Every time someone else left, a massive crowd tried to move to that person’s spot, pushing others away.
[deleted]
My headcanon is that the last thing Taylor does before going on stage for the Red set is to open a closet overflowing with identical hats and put one on.
[removed]
“Pls tell me you’re joking” is not a question. It’s a pretty obvious verbal eyeroll, and retroactively claiming it was an innocent question is both insulting and gaslighty. Don’t bring that energy in here. This is a happy place.
Nope I’m just a married Taylor Swift fan. My life with my husband is full of amazing days. The day we met was incredible. The day we got engaged - that was a great day. The day we got married was just hosting a very stressful, very expensive party (though we didn’t do anything traditionally and it was tiny because I tried very hard to reduce stress and the financial burden). I have glorious photos from it, but other than that it was not a day I’d ever want to repeat. 

I spent more on my trip (she didn’t come to my country) to see the Eras tour and that is something I aim to repeat many more times throughout my life.
You seem like you'd be real fun at parties.
“I just post in whatever subs pop up so someone will pay attention to me”
Name how she makes the world worse, other than flying? Her contributions to art outweigh that overall. Plus she isn’t even in the top users list of private jets. So what is she doing?
So you didn't even read the post but came to the comments to complain and accuse people? That's certainly a choice
 😮‍💨
Yes u are
this comment made me remember the night when she found the little girl she gave the 22 hat absolutely so adorable that she tried to pulling her on stage with her til she realized she couldn’t do that 😂 one of the most wholesome moments of the eras tour
What is wrong with people seriously, ruining it for everyone else
When was that?
Wait when did this happen?? That’s gross
Kids can just as  easily grab her arms as adults can… just the kids I’ve seen get the hat have been super well behaved and have parents with them the entire time watching them to make sure they don’t do anything crazy which is why I believe we don’t see them doing anything
Agree. I think adults getting chosen is lowkey cringe. Let it be for the kids.
Did your knight only give out one flower? Mine gave out 6 IIRC. 

Most went to kids, but my partner was hardcore telling the knight to give me one (behind my back) and I ended up getting one.
🤣🤣🤣 I just think it should go to someone who was actually alive when 22 came out!

(Only half joking lol)
That’s it! I’m not having kids for another 40 years!
This and generally kids are less psychotic
Oh I am so jealous and at the same time so psyched for you!!
Not how it works at Taylor shows :) the selected person basically climbs up on stage on a specific area for the hat giving person, camera is on them for the entire song way before they even hand out the hat, and the pit folks are like 4-6ft back. 

At most if you’re incredibly lucky, security or her team hand out a guitar pick every now and then to folks up front
they said they’ve been in that stadium for NFL games which means they are most likely an american, and america had a fully seated floor. there was no GA standing room. 💗
I don’t think you can always assume that but I’m glad you felt safe to wear what you want. As you say the vast majority are nice so I doubt anyone would try anything anyway
[removed]
It very well is a question??????  And I still dunno are you all being for real or what. Also I didn't bring in any sort of energy like bro I legit asked are u joking, how can you take that in a mean sense????? ITS A DAMN SIMPLE NORMAL QUES💀💀💀💀 Atleast think before calling out someone for "beinging some sort of energy" to your "happy place"
And fantasising about a 10 year old kid who is a legit stranger to you, getting married???? Thats just weird.
literally almost everyone flies, it's such a dumb thing to hate on her for. 

The most deliciously ironic part is most of the same people who say shit like that are probably also shamelessly buying random shit on Amazon and getting the next day shipping, which has been directly responsible for a massive increase in the number of daily cargo flights worldwide.
Youre her fan. If you wanna change my mind show me her donating money to people who aren’t fans
I was at that show!!! It was super confusing lol but so cute!!! When she explained it later she said she realized there wasn’t a way to get the girl off the stage safely
I rewatched a video and she did let go! That’s my bad. But she looked like she pulled T down a little too aggressively for my own personal liking. It was one of the Seattle nights
That’s what makes it worse! He came out like 3 times with multiple flowers each and i feel like our section wasn’t even packed and I was in front and cheering and making eye contact and NOT ONCE. Not young enough for the cute child flower, not old enough for the cute old person flower. 😭😭😭
We also snuck into standing lol!
I meant it in general, replying to the first comment as well. :-)

You literally told someone else that they had lost it and responded to me about people being in their “delulu eRaS”. You absolutely were “spreading some hate”
It was a joke babe
And the gaslighty insults continue, this time with a healthy side of strawman. Go find somewhere else to troll.
That’s not exactly a solid argument tho, yeah everybody flies. But one or two flights a year that you share with a couple hundred people is different to numerous flights a week that you take solo with a small group.

They aren’t even comparable, and this isn’t coming from a negative place, I’m just saying.
https://www.billboard.com/lists/taylor-swifts-charity-donations-gifts-timeline/september-2015-wildest-dreams-video-proceeds-go-to-animal-foundation/

Here you go, and it took 5 seconds on Google. Get a life. Hating on Taylor takes 2x as much energy as loving her (or any celebrity for that matter), so either way, by hating her, you're expending so much energy. On someone who doesn't even know you exist. Yet you're here "schooling" us Swifties. Get outta here.
She donates to food banks in literally every city she tours in since the tour started last year, it’s pretty obvious you’re just repeating haters’ talking points without actually verifying anything you’re saying
She FILLED the very empty food pantry where I live. And also donated to make sure they had pet food.
Yeah you’ll be fine😃

Don’t put yourself down tho, everyone is attractive in their own way, sure you have plenty going on😃always makes me sad when people talk themselves down👍
okie<3
You sure did put a lot of energy and effort defending her on this thread 😬
Henry (talking about Brest vs Leverkusen): ”It’s a big one”, Micah: “bit lopsided”

The absolute cackle from behind camera is top quality.
That’s the funniest awkward silence I’ve ever seen
Wait until they find out who shot us to our UEFA Cup win in 1988
I consider myself an adult but whenever I see Nice and Brest next to eachother, I can't help but laugh.
Henry’s initial “oh my god” absolutely killed me
Anyone remember fox soccer report back in the day? I remember one of the hosts going through the league 1 table and saying "... and Brest sagging to the bottom half of the table" or something along those lines.
Added to the collection of funny moments along with [David Beckham’s sticky stuff](https://youtube.com/shorts/gfQRNCpY3CY?si=N629Cb_kxjZqwec0)….Micah trying to defend himself is funny as hell.
Micah with his best Henry laugh impression
Carrager just sitting back trying not to cancel himself.
Kate literally fighting for her life trying to maintain composure. They really be pushing the line this season, sticky stuff last time, now Brest lol
Genuinely the funniest squad on the telly, I look forward to them more than the matches themselves hahaha
Should be a titillating match
this is genuinely the best panel on UCL nights based on highlights I see. What channel exactly is it?
[Reminded me of this Charles Barkley clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt2YCVN5VIE)
Is this the new Ernie, chuck, shaq and Kenny?
These are just mates with cameras. I love how Kates the most immature lol
Bit lopsided 😂😂😂
“Titi” Henry
The beautiful little Brest team has nothing to be ashamed of. Following a good run in Ligue 1 last season. 🙌
 They have always had good players. This made me think of the year when the club was relegated to Division 2 (Ligue 2) for too great a deficit in 1991. All the most expensive players were sold one after the other to other clubs like David Ginola, Bernard Lama, Corentin Martins, Stéphane Guivarc'h,....
The disappointment in Micah from Henry...
‘Big problem!’
Damn Brest has a tough schedule. Might only need three or four more points but it will be difficult to get them. PSV at home and Shakhtar away probably the most winnable ones(Sparta are damn good so away against them will be tough)
Best chemistry of football pundits right now.
Sorry I don't get it, can someone explain it to me? 😭
Deep down we are all just kids lol
The replacement for Inside the NBA we all needed.
They have fun on CBS lmao
I love them. The best sports commentator crew imo
Henry shuffling his papers around like it’s the Eric Andre show.
Last night was pretty funny. The car crash interview with Adeyemi where he couldn't understand Carragher was good, glad one show treats football as the dick around it is instead of with the air of geopolitics
Titi is definitely the right one to make these jokes
This is giving me NBA on tnt vibes. Love it.
La gênance est réelle!
Hahahaha nice jokes. 

I'm waiting for Brest to win more games and then they can say, "well, Brest has pushed up the table"
Good thing Young Boys aren't playing Brest
Most insightful TV analysis of non-Premier League teams
Could they? Could they fill the soon gaping hole in my heart when Shaq, Kenny, Ernie, and Charles leave NBA on TNT?
This has become what Inside the NBA on TNT was for basketball.

As a fan in the UK, I’ll continue to be depressed to be able to view neither, outside of the occasional clip.
If CBS Champions League taking the top spot of top Sports Commentary show is what it will take to bring NBA on TNT back so be it
It’s criminal these aren’t on sky or tnt for us brits.
Does anyone know where you watch this show in Aus?
can anyone explain
They have a cracking two up front as well
Haha, love watching Nice v Brest.
If Micah would try any harder to hold his laugh he would start doing the Henry smirk
It's the chemistry. Normally Carra and Micah are like two kids but even Carra just understood and didn't make a peep because the sheer delivery from Micah was genius.
they are funny...love watching them.
[deleted]
Top bantz. Third best punditry on TV after sky cricket and Test match special.
Terrible shite. So obviously aimed at US kids and teenagers coming in from school.
lol
Brest vs UEFA*
Interesting that they did this today since the Daily Mail, with their cartoonist, stopped short of calling them buffoons.     

I actually enjoy watching them but I do think that Micah needs to calm down a bit.
This is boomer shit
Micah Richards is so damn annoying with his cocaine brat energy
lol you know Micah isn’t smart enough to think of that one himself 😂
Carra has no idea wtf is going on
Henry’s theatrics cringe me out sometimes. 

(Was one of my fav players ever even as a United fan)
Are they talking about dicks?
That’s when you know a joke was good.
Reminded me of this masterpiece [slamdunk on shaq](https://youtu.be/i-dkirKcOo0?si=wY13BEdCYsEibfG6)
Henry doesn't know what to do so he plays an invisible piano
i feel bad for you
Ok I'll bite. Who was it?
Or the Spanish meaning of "Kaká is replaced by Elano".

"Poop comes out of the anus"
[deleted]
Brest also got a player named Brassier
Don’t forget ASSE
Nice asse is also great ( which appears in french tv)
For what it's worth, it's pronounced "Niss", if that can help at least a bit!
But do you know how it's actually pronounced?
Funny as fuck but he's pretending like he didn't just induce that chuckle on purpose. They already share a glance before Henry starts talking, he knows what he's doing then shifts blame to Micah, lmao. This is gold TV.
I didn't understand the joke and the whole situation basically. Could you explain it to me ?
Loved that show as a kid
Can you please stop it 🤣
they are sitting pretty nicely now tbf
All I remember from my childhood is Max Bretos calling everyone by their street name and rattling off trivia about the subs coming on for Lanus and Rosario.
Love that Beckham clip. Had Henry looking like he was studying for the biggest exam 🤣
Man’s learnt
Think I re-watch clips from these lot more often then I do the actual matches some days.

Also you know you got a good joke off when you can hear the crew in the background laughing lol
By far the best "inside" sports show, only real competition is Inside the NBA which is unfortunately ending soon
Any easy way guys to watch those live when you're not in the US ?
CBS in America
[when a guy is bangin you](https://youtu.be/CDirss5GAKQ?si=UJjr_Dhr5ynftGEQ)
[Joey Barton is going to cum in your face](https://youtu.be/5cAWzEkma7Y?si=EZ9LE_p9-RktniF3)
Inside the Champions League
the spirits lives on.
aye
No because Carragher has no clue what he’s talking about and also spits on children. The other three are good though.
I could listen and watch kate all day. Damn
Don't get it, even after translating it.
Brest sounds like breast so they're having fun with word plays like big ones or lopsided
Breast, Boobies, Bahoonkas
It's not the 90s where you're restricted by what's on tv, you just have to find streams online lol
Cbs golazo is only for the US.
boobs are generally lopsided

(also the game)
you're on quite the rant rampage, I see. I am sure if Milan had shown half the energy you display in the first half, they could have come away with some points. Only starting to play football for the last 30 minutes is not enough.
Knock~~er~~out stages will be nip and tuck, but if they perk up they'll bounce back in good shape
but he delivered and held through it. Give the man credit where it's due!
Carra didn't even get it lol
haha that's fair. I thought so too for a sec, but missed the whole Brest context
Seeing as they called it quits recently, here's one of my favourite [examples](https://youtu.be/AtFCekVn6RE?si=S8hWcneXOfHnioF6)
There are a bunch of youtube channels that figured this out and now it feels much less natural!
[deleted]
I don’t think Micah was cracking a joke…
Chuck is always funny
I genuinely think this CBS team of Abdo, Carragher, and Richards is nearing the level of that TNT NBA crew. There’s tons of good, genuine analysis but also plenty of  contagious laughter. Certainly won’t be for everybody, but I love it.
Haha everyone dunks on Shaq, I remember in CSGO when ELEAGUE was in Atlanta with the NBA boys that Thorin had these classics against Shaq [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h1d5dCdiPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h1d5dCdiPM)
Lol so a few seasons ago they came up with a code when they want to change topics or when to move away from something to just "move the paper back and forth" or something like that lol
[He really should've cracked one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7P4Ig-TgKk)
Was waiting for his weird funny smile meme.
Carragher just nods along (he doesn't understand the joke)
Tita & Cha-Bum Kun
He’s probably going for Tita, which sounds like tits (plural) in his native language
Milton Queiroz da Paixao   
nickname: **Tita**
Never noticed this and will never unsee it
Oh. My. Lord.
I mean at some point coincidences start to become freaky lmao
How you people come up with these things? Lmao, i will never unsee that now and it kinda makes me happy.
You son of a b****
Nice
This is like when someone told me nottingham forest's logo looks like someone having a massive queef. I can't unsee it.
How does it look like that 😭
AINTNOWAY

Oh my gosh ahhahahah
BRUH
LAO

Brassier offers support for Brest
Last night I was watching Barca demolish young boys then they brought on a player called Virginius. I couldn't help but come up with all sorts of headlines in my head.

Young Boys' Virginius not enough to stop Barca's pounding.
Unfortunately he left, so I have to ruin your joke!
the last Nice-Asse belongs on pornhub
It's pronounced Nice and Brest, duh.
Yeah as soon as Kate says Brest at the start Henry looks over and points at him.

He saw the assist and just went for it.
Fox soccer channel was so good.  It was one of the only ways for people from the US to really follow football from around the world at the time before streaming services existed and a lot of the bigger channels didn't broadcast any games.
Fox used to be great for soccer/football in the States. I remember after school they had a J League round up that went on for like an hour, great stuff
Forreal. That show is the main reason I learned about all the players, clubs, and leagues around the world at a young age
Schmeichel just like "nah bro dont come to me right now"
I don't even watch basketball but i'll never skip a clip from inside the nba, shaq and charles are a menace.
Inside the NBA clears these guys but yeah they wont be around soon
You're not a Stick to Football fan? Similar format though a bit more retrospective and general than focussing on the day's games specifically.
Yarrrrrrr
Also on paramount+
What is with those oversized rooms for one small table?
"I'm not sure he'd go that far" had me in stitches 😂
"Anything is possible"
Are they using the same set as BBC Breakfast?
I’m not his biggest fan, but to say Carra has no idea what he is talking about is insane. He is practically a football historian.
So a bit more expressive ShaQ*? Every team needs one, it’s them yank entertainment rules.
Ironically enough, Chuck spat on a child as well (wasn't aiming for her, but she got hit by accident instead of the heckler).
So like Kenny then
I only recently saw the clip from earlier this year (or maybe last?) where they show young Kate from 2007 and Henry's face is like "😳... how in the fuck did I miss my shot at THAT?!"
It took me a while but I think I got it.
Brest = boobs, so when he says "a bit lopsided" it means the boobs are uneven, one boob is bigger than the other.
thanks for being the one asking for a translation, I felt the same
Same 🥲
Honka Honkas
Big. But a bit lopsided.
Dobonhonkeros
I have NBA League Pass but they don’t show the studio segments internationally and I have TNT Sports (ironically) which cover the Champions League in the UK. 

I like these guys but I’m not insane enough to watch choppy CL footy when I have the channel in HD, and I’m definitely not crazy enough to watch NBA games until 4am when I pay to watch them on demand!
He was great. Love Micah
Okay, having read in the comments about the "Princess Anne had one of these" in-joke, that's possibly the best Princess Diana joke I've heard since the 90s
Exactly what came to mind for me as well. You almost never hear the crew laugh, but it sounds like every single one of them lost it. When they weren't scripted, those three could all be hilarious.
This was the exact thing that came to mind. It's the only time I can remember on Top Gear that you can hear the camera crew laughing.
What a strange accusation to make to what is seemingly a completely genuine chuckle haha
Lopsided brest as a response to "it's gonna be a big one". He was absolutely taking the piss and executed flawlessly
Were you born yesterday
Big ole San Antonio women
I admit I like this CBS crew a lot but they're not touching the TNT squad. Chuck is the most entertaining sports media personality ever and all the extra segments the TNT guys do makes it the best sports show ever. It's leagues above anything else imo
Yes and it was a thing Micah started after he felt awkward about any weird topic they were discussing lmao. So it's super funny when any of them start doing that.
Or give them one of these 
https://media.tenor.com/YQxuByJ1TbcAAAAM/thierry-henry.gif
Tita is awesome, I’ve met him a few times and hung out with him. Fun fact: apparently he had no agent and was severely underpaid during his time in Leverkusen.
Just wanna give a shout out to Falco Götz, who scored in between those two.
That's straight up hall of fame material.
Oh Gesus Christ
[removed]
*very* freaky
This shit was everyones COD4 Clan tag back in the day I swear.
I happened to have seen that same statement just yesterday actually lol. Bit of a coincidence, but it is more prominent than you would think.
No, it’s 💦🍆✊🏽 Nice.
Turn it 90 degrees to the right, the O is his head, the G is his arms and dick and the C is his legs.  
We see him from the front, sitting down, legs spread holding his dick
Olympique Gymnaste Club. In the beginning football was just a section of the gymnastics club. I know the meaning is disappointing it's not funny at all
Yes but without Brest, Brassier has no job.
Proper Gang bang it was
Correct
The one thing I asked for for Christmas when I was 12 was fox soccer channel. I think it was kind of expensive to get that cable package. It changed my life though. I used to love the premiership roundup Sunday night. Really good highlights for every game. I’d watch it and then go play in the park (usually in the dark). Such good memories. I’ll never stop watching the prem because them
How I started watching football in 2009
I can hear them chanting FSC right now as I'm reading these comments
Used to always fall asleep to live Sky Sports reports and the Fox Soccer Report.
Hope this show rakes in the viewers so TNT will bring Ernie and co back
does this include australia
Every time he talks about a non big 6 club he’s clueless. Parrots whatever the narrative at the time is. Knowing a lot about Man U and Liverpool does not a good pundit make.
If by Shan you mean Shaq, then not really. Shaq gives away turkeys at Christmas but has bad takes, Carragher is a scumbag and has awful takes.
Lopsided in a football context also means one team is stronger on paper than the other
And here my interpretation was that the "big one" was hanging a bit "lopsided".
Hey, apparently that is a typical thing you know
Thx, now I get it.
Brest is kind of like breasts. Lopsided game because Leverkusen are a strong team and Brest are pretty weak. Lopsided breasts also means uneven breasts.
Titerinos
It was nice seeing a few more moments like this in the final special. Clarkson gesturing at the "camera car" and calling them dickheads only to find out it was just a car full of workmen got a good laugh out of the crew.
Young lad has probably never seen a tit in his life
"How they eathing Chuck??!?!??"
Only if you know who they are. For foreigners they're just random handball players on some American sports show. It's all about perspective!
True for Americans but the vast majority of people in Europe don't know who Chuck is and they don't watch basketball so I wouldn't call him an all time great as I think you have to transcend the sport for that.
Entertainment wise sure, but these CBS crew breakdown and analyze the game better than Inside the NBA. Besides Ernie no one is watching the game.
True but they have been together for how long now compared to CBS crew?
Not so fun for him 😞
There was some article years ago about them getting financial support after their stadium build got into trouble, headline was “Young Boys Wankdorf Erection Relief”
Wut da hale!?
I can't tell if this is a joke, but I rather believe it's true than look it up to find out it's not.
It’s even funnier: Virginius was the player that sealed their qualification to the CL
I will not have my friends ridiculed by the common soccery. Anybody else feel like a little... giggle... when I mention my friend... Virginius..
Me and my mates had a hearty chuckle when I saw him coming on. xD
Was also a "problematic" logo being used by a Government department here in the UK for a while:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Government_Commerce#Logo
No, US only. Stan Sports has the UEFA rights in Australia.
Oh my a typo! Shaq has a good PR team that’s for sure, but Carragher isn’t the son of a bitch you seems to imagine be, or there’s more to your relationship? 

And for awful take Shaq « What Wemby does that Bol Bol can’t do ?»… like Carragher they need one guy that has crazy takes you can only laugh about.
So Brest looks better on paper than the other team because Brest almost spells “breast” (boobs)?
"it's all them churros... Victoria ain't a secret over there!"

Respectable acknowledgment from the OGC spokesman saying “It is not inappropriate to an organisation that’s looking to have a firm grip on Government spend.”
> A spokesman for OGC said, “It is not inappropriate to an organisation that’s looking to have a firm grip on Government spend.”

He 100% chose this exact wording lmao
No. The match is lopsided because Brest are a small french team and Leverkusen are reigning German champions. The joke is that regular meaning combined with lopsided Brest.

Ah a fellow jerker I see
Final standing of Group E
What a cliffhanger. Tough luck, Ukraine. 
Now Belgium vs france here we go
It's really funny how a team with 4 points won't make it to the Ro16 due to being last in their group, but a few 3rd places with 3 points will.
Who expected Romania to top this group though? LETS GOO
If Italy hadn't scored that 98th minute goal, Hungary would have been eliminated. Crazy butterfly effect.
Romania on 1st place, as expected. HAI ROMANIAAAAAAAAAAA 🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴
Romania going from drawing vs. Liechtenstein to topping their group in less than 3 weeks is quite the turnaround.
did the Netherlands and Austria suck all the air out of the room? Only shit games since that one ended
the first game between Romania and Ukraine ( won 3-0 by Romania ) decided the 1st and 4th places
Ukraine’s disaster class against Romania cost them
Smiles all around, unless you are Ukraine.
perfectly balanced, as all things should be
Group of death but Dracula's sons do not fear death :)
Can't believe Spain Germany Portugal France Begium all ended up same side of draw
I hope I don't betray my age with this comment, but


 Ukraine really is the **bad luck Brian** of the group
Now, football gods give us England.
what a crazy group lmao (all on 4) 🤯. fair play/congrats to romania coming top, not many would have expected that. 

but that’s brutal for ukraine. got more points than others that are making it through. denmark and slovenia didn’t even win a game, and one less point than england 😭. that first game killed them tho.
How the hell did this group get to this?

Happy for Romania tho
Romania has been so fun to watch. They're organized, fast, willing to push forward and make runs. They play some very fun football and deservedly top the group based on their performance.
first time i’ve seen it
Hai baietiiiiiii
A 4pt team is eliminated, that's incredible considering how the other groups have been played
Romania played awesome. Great job neighbours!
Insane how much Ukraine match counted for us, we need that masterclass again for R16
Aduceti-ne adversari!!!!
ez game ez lyfe
Let Ukraine stay, send England home
Puscas > Lukaku
If this holds up it's either Slovenia, Romania, Turkey or Austria in the semis lmao
Group D(readful) and Group (E)pic.
This looks so surreal.
I've been waiting for this since 2000
Who do netherlands play next?
Every time I have watched Romania it's been a lot of fun
Every team finishes on same points

Romania wins group

What is this timeline?
Group of death.
Didn't realize the E stood for Equal
As expected of course
Dang, win the group and get Netherlands as a reward...
Thought head-to-head counted before GD, shouldn't Slovakia be ahead of Belgium?


Edit: Cannot happen because other head-to-head's in the group, go figure. 
SCREAM IF YOU LOVE ROMANIAAAAAAAAAAA💪🇷🇴💪🇷🇴💪🇷🇴💪🇷🇴💪🇷🇴💪🇷🇴
Romania will face Slovenia in the Round of 16, and the winner will face Austria/Turkey  in the QF...


...as long as Czechia and Georgia are eliminated.

Turkey, we re counting on you to eliminate the Czechs and give us an underdog in the Semi!
Romania for the win!
tbh I see a nil nil from Belgium vs France lol
Congratulations Romania , predicted them to reach quarter finals
Who will Romania face next in the knockouts?
Just according to keikaku
(Translator's note: keikaku means plan)
I cant fucking believe it.

For the first time in my life I'm gonna see Romania play outside the playoffs of a major tournament. 

We're probably gonna embarrass ourselves, but this is still a very emotional moment.
Ukraine were a lucky deflected goal or a lucky handball penalty away from topping the group.. instead, they be going home. Crazy group.. feel for them!
With all the heavyweights on one side of the bracket it would be really cool to see a brand new euros winner
I'd be fuming, Ukraine could easily qualify ahead of 3rd place teams with the 4 points
C'mon Romania! We also won the qualifications group. This is no mistake 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I fucking hate this life

Disaster after disaster
Now that Ukraine is out, hope Romania will shake things up there!!
lol it's almost like Group E in '94 world cup, 30 years later. Except in that group the goal difference was 0 for all 4 teams
Ok lads. We have actually won the group. What. I mean, what? I ve called it before the tournament but even I actually went Romania-Ukraine-Slovakia-Belgium instead and I thought this was just me being hopeful in a “shit football gets results look at England” kind of way but no, we ve been great. We literally drew to Belarus in the qualifiers. I mean hell, we drew to Bulgaria and Lichtenstein 2 weeks before the tournament too. I used to criticise the coach and the team so much during the qualifiers so much as the football really wasn’t there but they really have shut us up. Now, I have also called quarters. If we truly get Slovenia in the RO16 that is truly possible and even Austria/Turkey wouldn’t be as bad as it could be in the quarters, come on Romania!🇷🇴 🇷🇴
Oh lawd they having a mid-off
Try [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994\_FIFA\_World\_Cup\_Group\_E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_E) for a close group.
Bit out of context, why was KDB booed by his own fans after the match
I can see Team Ukraine feeling that they got screwed over
Never Seen a bigger bottling group than the Belgian golden generation. Honestly they didn't deserve that bunch. Croatia would have won at least 2/3 things with that same squad.
With eng-ned and fra-bel atleast 2 boring bad teams will leave the tournament.
Man I wish Ukraine scored just so another year goes by where Belgium is highly overrated by the coefficient thing and gets clowned
We were shit, but Belgium did not impress at all either.
YES YES YES WE SOMEHOW WON THE GROUP
We had that thread before the event asking for hot takes and both of mine came true: Romania in QF and Albania getting a point. 👋
Last time I remember this happening was in the 1994 world cup, Mexico, Italy, Ireland and Norway all finished level on 4 points and all had a GD of 0. Italy finished third and went on to the final only to lose to Brazil on Pks.
Ukraine has more points than some of the best 3rd places. Bitter
Glad Ukraine is out. Fuck em
lmao ukraine
The group of Draws
France will demolish this Belgian side
This Euro has delivered quite a lot of match ups with countries (or parts of it) that speak the same language:  

Germany vs Switzerland  

Switzerland vs Italy  

France vs Belgium
How is Belgium second? I'm confused about the tiebreakers
This some funny 💩
Jhin Mains unite
I'm tired

I honestly think I would rather go out swinging and at least try to win the group than go through like this and loose to France
Insane
Lukaka hattrick incoming vs France.
Has this ever happened before?
Just add 12 more nations ffs.
ROMÂNIA ALE! ROMÂNIA ALE! ROMÂNIA ALE! HOP HOP HOP
I picked Romania in my fantasy soccer pool!  I am killing it!
That's just crazy
4
As expected
Loooool
Perfectly balanced, brings tears to my eyes
Shades of Group E of the 94 World cup.
What bad luck for Ukraine to finish with 4 points and be last, tied on points with all the other teams, they tell me this at the beginning of the tournament and I don't believe it...
Locul 1 💪🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴
Is this the first time in history that this happens? All teams have the same number of points?
Ukraine getting fucked in sports too I see.
Damn, wtf have you been smoking Belgium 
can someone explain the +/-?
We were so fucking bad. Have 0 hope against France and honestly, with these displays it might be best it's our last match of the Euro. That being said, match against Ukraine was 50/50. Ofc on paper we should have won (but we sucked) but I didn't expect them to park the bus that much when they needed a win.
Damn, Ukraine ❌❌❌❌
Wild
**:)**
Belgium will be having a good opponent in France. A match to watch.
Mudryk is TRASH
Too bad we don't play England, our favorite victims ;))). QFs were guaranteed that way
vertical lines: IN

Horizontal lines: OUT (kinda)
One more reason to go down to 16 or up to 32 participants.
Hoping Austria go far they have been extremely fun to watch…rooting for the Swiss 🧀 to ram rod the pizza makers as they truly don’t have much substance or flair in their midfield and nothing up front!
!flair :Romania:
[deleted]
so we get beaten by France, AGAIN
Belgium will be put out of their misery
It's their fault tbh... They weren't even eager to score a goal..
Sure Belgium wants France. France "scored" only two goals as well. But theirs were an OG and a Pen. That is peak low quality.

How about England's two goals? While winning their group? 

What a (mostly) very boring group stage!
can they somehow both lose and drop out?
Gonna be at that game.

Super stoked.
Yeah if the "ranked 3rd-place teams" were changed to "ranked non-top-2 teams" then Ukraine would've made history as a rare 4th place team that made it to knockout stage
i dont like this 24 format... do 16 or do 32... i dont mind either version. or do groups with 6... but 24 teams like this sucks
I just hate how there is this invisible group of potential 3rd place teams that we're all somehow supposed to keep track of.
This format sucks….honestly 3rd place shouldnt go thru.
Was this an intentional result of the rule?  Are the powers that be saying "Ukraine is out, and rightly so"?      
       
Or did they just not foresee that a fourth place team could still be in position to qualify over enough 3rd place teams?
But you can then argue those 3pt teams had a tougher schedule and all sorts. I don't think the system is that flawed, this is just a freak outcome where the 1st seed in the group lost to the 3rd seed and the 2nd seed lost to the 4th, then the inverse of that happened, then the 1st and 2nd drew and 3rd and 4th drew. 

Usually each group has a whipping boy and/or a titan but in this group the weak teams stepped the fuck up and Belgium didn't do their duty. In reality Ukraine let in three goals against Romania and deserve that to be the deciding factor. Ok, they scraped more points than say Hungary, but I doubt Ukraine gets 4 points against Scotland Germany and Switzerland. Maybe they do? But I think they likely do exactly what Hungary did and beat Scotland and lose the other two. 

Maybe a "best 4 non-2nd teams" is the way to go, but I'm not sure how fair that is when the groups get seeded the way they are. On paper Ukraine should have come 2nd to Belgium, but underperformed.  
  
Maybe a 4 group system of 6 teams is the best, then bottom two of each group go out. That way it isn't wonky across groups, it's fixed in a way that every team plays 5 games against the rest in their group and they go through if they do enough. 

I'm sure whatever system is done will throw up weird results. If this was a WC group then two teams are out on 4 points, the same as two that go through on 4. The 3rd place thing actually saves one team (Slovakia) that also got the same number of points as the group winner.
Ended up being only one 3-point team but your point still stands.  And that's a team with 3 ties no less.
The tournament has been really tough for most teams.
Me everbody laughed when I said it🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴
I talked shit about the boys and now I am sorry. Better sorry than being right.
I thought decent chance for 2nd but definitely not first
I’d be lying if I said I did but hai România! 🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴
Why is România 1st place? Is it because the goals scored? Even though the goal differential is like Belgium’s and belgium has the direct game.

Also, why is Belgium playing France? They both finished second in their groups. I thought 2nd place must face a 1st place. Or is the rules all changed since we have 24 teams now?
It was a surprise to me. Let's know how they fare in their knockout game.
I mean if Czech Republic win today then Hungary are out anyways
And if Scotland hasn’t passed that ball to Switzerland, they see that game out and don’t need to press late against Hungary, they could’ve had 4 points and go through.  

A low scoring game with only 3 matches like tournament football always has lots of butterfly effect moments.
And if Hungary didnt score 97th minute Croatia would not be eliminated.
If Italy hadn't scored they would have been eliminated I think.
Never doubted the NT during the qualifiers!
Just like we drew it up
alo, salut....
Numa numa all day
blessed day
Congrats guys, well fucking done!
DA DA DUMLA DUMLA DA MADE IN ROMANIA
My brackets all fucked up
We're all romania on this blessed day
completely deserved honestly
Oh hai Romania
They really need to all dye their hair blonde and go all out now.
Why is România 1st place? Is the scored goals? And why Belgium from 2nd place is playing France who was also 2nd place in their group? I thought a 2nd place must play a 1st place
Congratulations to their fans. It is a huge feat.
We also topped our qualifying group lol
We took a page out of Sun Tzu: "appear weak when you are strong" :)))
England went from losing to Iceland to topping their group too. Also quite the turnaround!
At this point I'm rooting for Romania.
From Belgium with love.
Everybody is so cautious, that they rather go out with a goalless draw than take any risk prior to the 80th minute.
Romania-Slovakia was good until 80th min, the monsoon killed it.
…. Romania Slovakia was anything but shit; you’d think both needed to win the first like 80 minutes. Was anything but boring; rare case of both actually playing too risky given they only needed a draw but a loss would’ve eliminated them.
This entire round has been shit, we were the only 2 countries to score 2 or more goals

All other games from the third round ended 0-0 1-0 or 1-1
Romania vs Slovakia was pretty fun.
Euro started great with 2 first rounds, but this last round is very disappointing overall
Group F will be better because Czechia and Georgia will get eliminated if they don’t win
It's just the pressure of losing that's holding everyone back
Since the double matches at the time started, the only game that's been entertaining (at least for me) has been the Austria v Netherlands game. The rest have just been disappointing.
Georgia is about to play, a guaranteed banger
It's the problem with 3rd place advancing. 8 teams getting knocked out means most teams can play very conservatively.

Slovakia - Romania would have been so much more competitive if fewer teams advanced.
you mean Romania's masterclass
Poor Trubin didn't deserve this
It was just a meltdown. It happens. They did pretty well to recover from it. Sad they have to go.
Not quite, the goal differences are different. Group E in '94 World Cup had all teams on 4 points and 0 GD
The E stands for equality
What s death to an immortal being?
Group of death 🤣
Losing 3-0 to Romania was absolutely unacceptable, and there was no bad luck involved in that game.
u've betrayed your age, hag
Ukraine was lucky to get out of groups at the last Euros, as they only got 3 points from beating North Macedonia by 1 goal.
Damn you're old and damn I'm old
England instead of Spain AND the easier side of the bracket? Hell yeah
🤞 I’d rather not face Netherlands, even if they’ve been almost as underwhelming as us
Group C drawing all the games group E drawing all the standings.
Happened in '94 too, only that the positions were decided by goals in favor as they all had 4 points and a GD of 0. Norway got the boot that time around having beaten group leaders Mexico in the opening match.
If the opponents will do the same ukraine did, that is underestimate romanian team and expect you guys to roll over and take it deep. 


Id expect another banger 3-0 for Romania.
Good thing is going to be played on the Allianz Arena, as the game vs Ukraine
SA VINA BRAZILIA!
BRING US MESSI!!!! Hai Romania Ro Ro Ro!!!!
🇷🇴 L2p ty for tutorial 🇷🇴
Send France and Italy home as well
I rather send Hungary with their 3 points home...
Ik man😭😭😭. I actually wanted you to win against Belgium and Slovakia soo much. You deserved to top this group, guys.
The Romanian Puskas
Honestly Puscas really is a ... Lukaku if he was wayyy worse. His strong points are basically the same, hold up play and deflections. His weak points are the same, especially his first touch (edit) and reaction speed. But he's .... well, 1 Euro store Lukaku! XD
Austria made group D fun for me.
probably England but if group F produces a 3rd place team they face Romania.
Not known until last game.
Romania or England depending Group F outcome
We re the embodiment of “ sometimes good, sometimes maybe shit “ just that we do both in the same game or one extreme in one game and one extreme the very next. We re an unknown even for ourselves, that can t be not entertaining
the timeline of Dracula :)
Then Belgium should be above Romania, but Romania cannot be behind Slovakia. It's a catch-22, so they revert to other means of differentiation, i.e. scored goals.
can’t head to head if they’re all level on 4 points
It technically is H2H, it's just that it's between all 4 teams
How do you know who is most likely going to face each other in the R16? I refresh the EURO 2024 wiki for the knockout bracket, which refreshes swiftly, but only once results are confirmed.

Is there a source where I can play around with current projected matchups for EURO 2024 and whatnot with current results?

For example, it says on the wiki that ESP's opponent is 3rd place form either E/F (so could be Slovakia (E) Turkey (F) Czech Republic (F) or Georgia (F)), but what is the determining factor on which team from E or F drops through to face ESP?

Equally, ENG's opponent is either the 3rd place from either D/E (so could be either Netherlands (D) or Slovakia (E)), but what is the determining factor on which team from D or E drops through to face ENG?
OMG. Revenge for 2002!!!
If no one from Group F gets 3rd place, Slovenia, and the final table will have a semi-finalist from Romania / Slovenia vs Turkey / Austria. Truly the dankest timeline.

If Czechia beats Turkey than .... the Netherlands, puke. Netherlands would literally be awarded for losing to Austria in that case, as they'd get a really good bracket >.>
Slovenia from what i've seen

Edit: after the F group games, it's Netherlands
We might get Slovenia brother .... and the winner of Austria/Turkey after that. We actually could make the semis , with the cheapest and worst generation 'on paper' in our history XD

Dreams can't be buy!
Romania going to shine bro, gl to u and country.
We move on as always. Ще не вмерла Україна
Sorry lads but someone had to go out, would have picked Belgium if it were up to me, could have managed it had you won today but it is what it is:(
I feel sad for Ukraine. Going home with 4 points must suck ..
That was group E too? Group E really is built different
I was 8. I remember crying, and thinking it was so unfair.
Probably for holding up play to run out the clock near the corner flag at the end. We don't really like seeing anti-football like that.
Nah we did not, not at all. 

#tedescoout

But Ukraine was the only team that would not qualify with a draw, so I (and the Belgian team probably too) would have figured Ukraine would attack more and we could play on the counter. But it took until the final stage of the game before Ukraine would stop slowing down play and actually go for it.

Im not trying to talk up belgium but it was a bit weird.
romania isnt in the qf yet
Fuck off
In fact, only 2 draws :D   
  
England's group could have been the TRUE group of draws ... but they just had to score against Serbia! .... offensive assholes, what the fuck was Southgate smoking that game /s
Will they thou? They scored only one goal and that came from penalty.
When multiple team end up on same points, H2H doesn't matter. GD > GF> GC.
Same goal difference but more goals scored for Romania.
Goal difference

Edit: Goals scored - Goals conceded
Pathetic display 
France played like they wanted to play Belgium too. Best buds them lot
The way they've been playing it will end 0-0 after penalties.
Belgium has been garbage since Hazard left the team
bro u won vs the mighty romania, baguette is nothing
Join me and we will rule the EC for years to come. The UEFA will not tell you this tale, but Darth Lower Countries made it so that the other nations bowed to our superiority (without the Walloons of course).
So we just gonna act like France hasn’t been pretty ass too?
As if france were better, not one goal from open play
Yeah but then you're making teams even more dependent on games they have no control over.
I think this would be bad. It would make it possible for the fourth team of a group to qualify and not the third.

This would happen because head-to-head does not make sense in a multi-group untie criterium
I think the issue is that all the groups team could've technically just played it safe for a tie with everyone knowing they make it to the knockout
It would be open to match fixing unless you play all the matchday 3 games at the same time.
They still made history as the only team to be eliminated with four points
Yup. Top 2 from each group and then the next 4 best teams, would be so much better.
Bring in the 32 team Euros. 8 groups of 4 with top 2 going through. Yes qualification is then pointless, but it can be replaced by more Nations league games and qualifying through that.
Disagree honestly. 

The third game in a 32 team world cup is often a completely dead rubber for one team.

At least in this format, it's very difficult to be completely knocked out after 2 games.
I mean, this can happen regardless of the 3rd place rule. Denmark qualified in 2nd with 3 points.
That's just how groups work. If only two go through, you can also have the situation where a third placed team in one group has more points than a second placed team in another group
Probably the second, but everyone knew the rules when the tournament started so it’s only fair I guess? If you aren’t better than any team in your group then you are out - if you want a chance of making it be at least third. Makes sense I guess.
This is just UEFA nonsense they had to come up with to fit 24 teams into a round of 16 knock out. It’s not clever or particularly fair. 

Equally, you should be aiming to finish top 2 to qualify anyway so Ukraine can’t really complain as they’d be out anyway in the standard format. 

Horribly close though tbf
Let me ask Ceferin real quick
> Or did they just not foresee that a fourth place team could still be in position to qualify over enough 3rd place teams?

But Ukraine isn't in that position because it is placed 4th. The same "problem" occurs when only two teams advance. A 3rd place team could have more points than a 2nd place team.
I think it's the latter tbh
Nice call. Any stocks you’re looking at buying haha?
hell yeah, believe in your team!!!
Same here, my biggest hot take payed off
Talk yo shit king.
When all 4 teams are equal in points, their overall ranking counts aka goal difference. Belgium beat Romania, but they lost to Slovakia who lost to Ukraine who lost to Romania. 

Belgium faces France because a lot of 3rd spots play against 1st teams, this was decided before the group draw.
Unexpected Georgia 1-0 win incoming
Or Czech draw and Georgia defeat Portugal, then Hungary is eliminated for sure
After that Csoboth winner would be kinda brutal
Unless they absolutely dick Turkey (3-0 or more) resulting in Turkey having a worse goal difference than Hungary
Didn't expect 4 points with Switzerland. Pleasant surprise.
Mai ales dupa 0-0 cu Lichtenstein
After I saw that arid 1-1 draw against Israel in Arena Nationala...yeah, I doubted a bit. Thought the draw away vs the Swiss was a mirage.

Acum? HAI ROMANIA FRATE!
said spoon
Under his eye
be serious. Last 2 games were fucking atrocious. This is not a strong team at all.
That's what happens when third place finishers go through.
3rd place finish going thru in Euros has absolutely fucked the tournament in quality
Reminds me of South Africa 2010 World Cup.
A team with 3 games ending 0x0 is 99,9% sure to get a playoff spot. Money ruining National teams now, couldn't be stopped at club level.
yeah the ball was bouncing and rolling as if deflated. pretty funny considering it only rained for like 5-10 minutes
even mother nature wanted the draw :)
the game was ruined by the rain. The pitch got flooded so both teams stopped taking risks
It was better than any game of England at this EURO and nevermind me, but I do like that team
There is a big free (sponsored) betting game going on in Germany with millions playing. There is one user betting on a 0-0 every single game. The first 2400 players each Matchday win a 240€ travel gift card. That user is in the top 1000 rn.
That's genuinely shocking
Echoing the others, Romania vs Slovakia was a great game. Chances on both sides.

The rain really did kill it. As soon as I started seeing puddles every time someone hit the ball, I knew the game wasn't coming back the same way lol.
till God said "hey guys I'm gonna cause a downpour so yall chill"
They watched the start of the Copa America and went "Oh, so we were supposed to play like that?", and everything came fumbling down
Both
Yup. Don't want to see anything resembling Lunin in goal for a long time
Also two groups in that world cup ended with three teams at 6 points all. But that group E was \_weird\_
But going out with 4 points sucks
Not playing for a win today was also a pretty bad choice.  
 
People give us shit for not trying, but I wonder what match they watched. What I saw is Belgium attacking most of the game (except in injury time), just not being very good at it, and Ukraine parking the bus and relying on counters.  
Ukraine needed the win, and defended most of the game.
I desperately want to see England play Austria so the whole world can see how actually shit Southgate is; different style but Ragnick could legit embarrass them as bad as Iceland did he’s that much better of a manager and this Austria has that much better of a game plan.
Ireland beating eventual World Cup finalists Italy and qualifying through that group. Peak Ireland. 

>Norway got the boot that time around having beaten group leaders Mexico in the opening match.

Tbf everyone beat everyone else - Norway beat Mexico, Mexico beat Ireland, Ireland beat Italy, Italy beat Norway in a ouroboros of results. Ultimately Norway was done in by drawing goallessly against Ireland (even though a 1-1 wouldn't have saved it either, 2-2 would have seen Italy out)
Lol I think we are past underestimating us
Real Madrid sau nimic. Nu ne e frica de nimeni!
Sunt cam praf si aia, n au reusit decat egal cu Costa Rica (fara Navas) si sunt pe 6 in calificari:)))
Cum să fie Belgia peste noi! Ei sunt cu diavolul cu străzile de cocaină! Noi suntem grădina maicii domnului!
Georgia is on it
At least czechia can do it!
Even the dead one would be less offside.
Lukaku doesn t have the quick shift in pace, explosiveness, which is expected for his size, but he s fking rapid. I remember he even played wing sometimes and put in a great fking shift. Shooting is one of his strenghts, u dont score that many goals by fluke, he s in a meme side of his career due to his off the field antics, so every little shit he does is blown out of proportion, sure current situation doesn t help with 3 marginal offsides, but u d be a fool to think he s not a great striker…his first touch tho…yikes
Both scored zero (valid) goals so Puscas was a steal, I'd say.
Who do England play in that case?
Türkiye vs Czechia might be a very good game
Having a hard time with this. Why would Netherlands play romania if group F produces a 3rd place team?
Belgium and France really fucked up the brackets huh
2016 generation was much worse lol.

We actually have 4-5 players that are in the top 5 Championships of Europe now (they don't play that much, but still)

Remember when we had to rely on Maxim and Stancu?
Man it would be not that bad without a war also going on, i would take this as always

 But I'm just lacking a little bit of positive in this life, everything fucked up
I meant knockout haha
Thanks!
Imagine paying for a flight/train, tickets, hotel to watch KDB hold the ball in the corner to kill the game when it's 0-0. Absolutely shameful.
Early vacation
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
Brothers, nephews, lovers.

(the Dutch are jealous)
When you defeat merdenelele, you still have a shot at the baguettes.
To be fair our defense has been solid I would argue, especially when you consider 12 goals have been scored in the other 3 matches. This is by far the most important thing in KO stage.
Yeah, but we gotta check who was more ass between France and Belgium 😃
Yea but Deschamps France has a proven track record of looking exactly this pedestrian and then going deep.  

Their style is more effective when they play the better teams later in the tournament; the further up the field and more of the ball you have, the more space behind for Mbappe to counter.
France, even in their current state, is still leagues above this Belgium team. 

It will *not* be close IMO.
France were comfortable against Austria and dominated against Holland. They have been by far better than Belgium.
There is no extraordinary team in these Euros. France has more talent. As long as they don't capitulate, it would be hard for them not to win.
Indeed, team hasn't scored a goal outside of a penalty yet.
France will eat Belgium in a penalty shootout if it comes down to it. I don't see a way for Belgium to advance after watching them play.
But then it’s more like an actual wildcard. The top performing teams that didn’t get guaranteed spots should go, imo
Tbh competition with teams outside your group is annoying anyway. I like the good old fashioned top 2 go, bottom 2 don’t (a la Copa America).
How?
That is easy to fix just make the first untie criteria if on the same points group position and only goal difference after.
Yes this is what they should do. Because i doubt we are ever going back to 16 team format.
20 teams - 4 groups of 5. For the World Cup 40 teams - 8 groups of 5. Or really anything without "best third placed teams" nonsense.
uefa didn’t come up with it. That used to be the World Cup format. 

Argentina reached the 90 final while finishing 3rd in their group !
Us in the quater finals
Forever
…
This is all your fault
Hey
Well....
Who are you
Technically speaking it's not 1-0
JUST SCORED THE SECOND, WTF-
Absolute cinema 👐
Well I was wrong…
It's 2 0 for them rn sooo
That aged well
After going 3pts and -3 GD. Would be kinda normal
That ball hitting Puscas head on the 2-2 was goated (Mihaila too despite how bad he was vs Israel iirc)
Exact, a fost calculat ca sa ne subestimeze lumea ca sa ne putem îmbogăți la pariuri punand pe Romania:))
asta e tactica românească :)
i'm taking a piss.

It does not matter how we played. We don't have the talent but we do have spirit.

 Do you remember the 2001 games vs Slovenia and the 2003 game vs Denmark were we played very well and we did not qualify for WC2002 and Euro 2004? I'd rather we played like shit back then and made it.
Part of the problem is how set in stone the tournament tree & 3rd place table are at this point, it heavily influences what teams want to do. You're actually at an *insane* advantage the later your group plays on the final matchday, straight up designed to encourage matchfixing really. Teams won't really do it but realistically it's all the current system encourages.
36 games to eliminate Ukraine, Albania, Scotland and Georgia
I would rather they added 8 more teams to the groups than the third place shit
Terrible terrible system. I’ve seen way too many comments saying how competitive each game has been. The truth is that the system allows too much mediocrity by allowing 2/3rds of the field to advance. 

Change it back to 16 or expand it to 32. It’s made what’s usually entertaining part of the tournament into a dull affair.
Yeah, the downfall of football. Can barely wait for the next World Cup with hundreads of nations and an extra round of 32...

72 games on the group stage to eliminate Honduras, Curaçao, Guatemala, Qatar, Jordan, Sudan, Rwanda, Venezuela, Albania, North Macedonia, etc...

Fuck FIFA/UEFA/CONMEBOL! We, the fans, should unite and revolt.
But what a rain it was
Yea mutually agreed draw be damned they were both playing for the win until all the ponds on the field became too unpredictable to risk it.
Strange considering how good he was for Madrid
They did play well the last two games. Disappointing.
I would also like to see that but it would have to be in the semi final.
I mean it would definitely be an upset but I'd say this Austria is definitely more highly rated then that Iceland...
Să vină Costa Rica atunci.
Sa vina Brazilia

[UEFA EURO 2024 Group Stage Points Simulator - ULTRAZONE](https://ultra.zone/UEFA-EURO-2024-Group-Stage#group=f)
Fair enough, that really does suck
So many teams playing negative football for fear of going out at the group stage. What happened to going out with a bang and heads held high?
Exactly my thoughys - Abyssmal performance mentally
If my zero points or negative one points for 0-0 ties system were implemented, we would have very different games
Dutch only care about Germany
merdenele de la Piata Amzei ♥️
Lukaku and KDB could drop a masterclass and make it difficult regardless of how well France’s defense has been. They are due. I’d still bet on France.
I still think France is better but it’s not a foregone conclusion yet
They having a mid-off
Agreed Ass-to-Ass game
Bring Hazard out of retirement
We scored some non-pen goals of our own. Some even stood.
It will be a competition on who can score by luck...because so far France has not scored an actual goal (own goal and a PK)...and Lukaku on the other end...
France just drew against the most shitty Poland ever. Wtf are you even on about.
[deleted]
It’s gonna be 1-0 France with a Belgium own goal
But then you need all 6 groups to play at the same time.

Otherwise, you could face a situation where all 4 of the teams in group E would play for a draw.

Because that would guarantee they'd all qualify and were relatively content with the seeding, but didn't want to risk not qualifying - as a loss may cause that to happen.
The groups are not the same. We can't say that one team getting 4 points in an easy group performed better than a team getting 3 points in a group of death.
Or, you know, just delete this bullshit system and just go back to 16 teams were the 2 best teams go through the next round.
Problem with 5 teams is you need 2 extra matchdays as not all can play at the same time.
If we pass slovenia or netherlands i am happy with that performance.
Thanks bro, I'll bet 10 dollars on Romania for next game.
I wish Van Der Ven was starting for Netherlands, so we could Dragusin /Van Der Ven battle royal.
😭 Szobo
great pass lmao. yeah that ending was hilarious, couldn't believe it.
Lull them into a false sense of security
> 2001 games vs Slovenia

That game hit my dad quite hard, even though the pitch was absolute trash, but for me fuck Urs Meier what a absolute horrible cunt he was.
well , football is played for goals in the end. It doesn't matter how ugly your play is , if you can put the ball in the enemy's net.

But that being said , i was watching this game , and all i could think was how ugly our passing looks. We can't build an half decent attack if our life depended on it. I didn't actually saw the ucraine match , but i've seen both the one with belgium and the one today , and i legitimatly though we look lost on the pitch.
Romania and Slovenia both happy with a draw
You're exactly right. Teams should have been split into pots after final standings and a new draw be held (maybe include a rule so that you can't get matched against a team from your group in the first knockout round, and that's it)
What’s the alternative?  Invite 8 more teams to create a proper 8 groups?  I feel that would dilute the quality. I like having heavyweights play in the group stage.
Georgia’s not out yet, they advance if they beat Portugal.
To quote a classic: you forgot Poland (although it took way fewer games)
Typical Copa America tournament organization 
yh, is the world cup with 48 teams going to be a repeat of this shit show?
Idk, it's a huge deal for those nations just travelling to the World Cup stage. It's the opposite ofbthe Super League which 'the fans' also hated because it was only a few elite top teams clashing
that's true, but I think the nerves all these players go through in games like these when they're representing their own colors is a bit different, I'd say the own goals reflect that a bit maybe
You mean the last 1.5 games, the first half against Slovakia was terrible. Not deserved in my opinion.
Lol they did NOT play well today.

Oooh this is fantastic. Thank you
Having thirds qualify makes things more interesting for the final matchday but rewards defensive play. Like teams are going through with 3 draws
> What happened to going out with a bang and heads held high?

That has absolutely never been a trend
Football in general been more negative and result focussed. In the way they play but also the players. 
Guys like özil or berbatov are sorely missed imo.
At this point Spain is the most fun team and one of the few.
Croatia kept attacking against Italy.
Georgia did exactly that and were rewarded for it
Flame people in Belgium?
You've seen this Lukaku for the past 3 matches and you think he will magically perform a masterclass?
I mean nothing in foregone in KO stage. Last edition 3 of the 4 teams who finished best 3rd eliminated the 1st seed in RO16. Everything can happen from now on.
We'll join them as the truly terrible trio
Requiem For A Bad Dream
call up gignac again
You will be facing a ferocious team that has not scored a goal from open play in this tournament.
LISAN AL GHAIB
That’s some 9D chess
And we can’t say a team getting 3 points in an easy group is more deserving than a team that got 4 in a group of death. That logic works both ways
True, but that is pretty bearable compared to other "expansion-related problems". Also, the group stage would actually become interesting if instead of eliminating only 33% of the teams, it eliminated 60% of them.
Hopefully Slovenia netherlands can go play england
that name brings back ptsd.
Because both our CB can't pass under pressure and our DMC can't pass at all. That's why we had to resort to long balls from Nita. We just lack talent to implement a passing game like we used to do 20+ years ago. Outside of Dragusin we have 0 players at serious teams in Europe.

This is the least talented squad we had since 1990 when i started to watch football but what they do have is fighting spirit. If our 1994 squad had the same fighting spirtit we would have played the final in 1994. The 1990&1994 had tremendous talent in all areas but they had shit mentality. The 1990 team was the most talented but they did fuck all.
Could have just stayed at 16. But 💲....
hilarious
0-0, best I can do.
The main flaw of the super league was that you don’t have to earn your place tbh not the amount of teams
Getting through to the quarter finals of a world cup with only draws is my country's biggest achievement.  


Fuck Schillaci.
Looking forward to the next World Cup then! We’ll get 12 groups worth of defensive play, double what we’re getting now!
I reckon this tournament is defined by the lack of jepordary. And 3rd place qualifiers are to blame. I wish they would revert to 16 teams next euro
On that note - can someone explain to me why Denmark is advancing over Slovenia? They both had 3 draws and a goal differential of 0 while having scored and conceded 2 each.

What was the tiebreaker that put Denmark over them?
The Portugal special
For me it's absolutely made things less interesting on the final games. Austria netherlands would've been a virtual knock out game rather than both already through, so many teams have known a draw puts them through and played accordingly.
I actually think it makes things less interesting. Fewer do or die games
Meanwhile Ukraine..
Lmao I can't believe someone with an England flair said that. As if the English media and the country would applaud the team as they come home after getting knocked out in the group stage because they played some exciting football.
I actually think Austria have been the most entertaining. They’ve really gone after it for each match.
They’ve both been pretty ass tbh but he has had 3 offside goals in fairness. Counts for shit but it’s not outside the realm of possibility one or both of them drops a blinder. It’s more likely, however, that turtle bro drops a hat trick so people remember what he looks like in a France uni.
The Assix Powers
Are we invited ?
Napoleon derby
Not really.

All 4 group E teams know if they draw, they advance. If they win, they help their seeding.  But if they LOSE, they're OUT.

Belgium is probably confident enough that they won't lose, and so they'll try to win. But the other 3? I could see how they'd be happy with a draw, so all of them will be tentative.

Plus, it might not even start that way, but as teams continue playing and it's a tie, they may be content with it. They may simply not attack as much.
exactly that's why it makes no sense to compare points between the groups
It would also give a team except 1(who would get the advantage for ro16) each matchday double the rest for a game. Although it might seem quite fair, it depends on the matchups that get rest advantage especially the ro16
If we get Slovenia and lose tho... that would hurt more
😵‍💫
Lol already out of date.
Gregg licking his lips as we speak
On terrible and small fields as well.
tbh it wouldve been worse if they kept their original idea of having groups of 3.
Would make the qualifiers very boring, and largely unnecessary, but UEFA definitely has enough worthwhile teams to play a 32 team tournament. Think of all the (at least once) semi decent teams who missed out this time around:

Sweden, Norway, Wales, Ireland, Iceland, Bosnia, Greece, Finland (ish) (Russia, if they were ever allowed back in - however unlikely, rightfully, that is)
disciplinary records. slovenia had one more yellow card than denmark. both had six players booked over the group stage but slovenia also had their assistant coach booked.
https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/why-denmark-finish-second-group-c-euro-2024-tiebreaker-rules-slovenia/f11712f247ad071761468337

TL;DR Slovenia's assistant coach was booked for dissent making them have 1 more yellow card than Denmark.

For what it's worth, Slovenia will go through to the round of 16 as well for sure.
Imo Turkey have been great fun too
Spain and Austria both. They absolutely do not come off the gas pedal at any point in the game
Georgia have been my favourite
Yeah Austria have been playing some beautiful, entertaining football. They're absolutely my second choice for who to root for.
2 offside goals. The 3rd is cancelled because the ball barely grazes Openda's hand in the build-up as he's struggling for balance whilst being pulled.
Pretty rare though you get four teams on three points going into game 3
Yep, but in a 6 group tournament there will have to be some form of shitty point contest regardless, so you might as well choose the one that doesn't arbitrarily fuck over some teams for no reason.
But thats what is already happening.
That aged like milk
We couldn’t comprehend the 4D chess USSF and the English FA were playing when they hired the most boring, defensive mangers in Berhalter and Southgate. They foresaw how the future World Cup was going to be.
Small fields?
I totally agree, this is still the better solution. That groups of 3 idea was ridiculous.

Tbh I’d rather they just said fuck it, let’s have 16 groups of 4 and raise the total number of teams to 64. Bring on Venezuela vs Equatorial Guinea!
Great coaching, there
I thought Albania was fun to watch as well
Turkey have been great but have made some absolutely suicidal mistakes. If they can iron out the crap could be exciting going forward.
A bummer they will be playing to eliminate each other but hopefully a cracking game!
If this were to happen even once, teams like Slovenia would scream bloody murder that it’s not fair if this happened once and they got knocked out.
Everything fucks over someone arbitrarily.
Should just have made larger groups imo
Haha, isn't it even more ridiculous!
US stadiums are narrower. I think some are getting widened but not all. 

I don’t think they’re using the LA Coli for the WC but they’re raising the field up and taking out some seats to expand it
You'll be surprised. The Copa America is now underway and every day a new national team complains about the quality and narrowness of the pitch. Defensive teams are gonna feast.
Austria, Turkey and Albania have been my favourite to watch. Although Turkey aren't playing that well this half against Czechia.
Yeah agreed
8 more teams, 2 more groups, would be infinitely better
Marry me Juliet
I asked my girlfriend during love story in The eras tour RJ. 🥰🥰 I gave her a bracelet saying: would you like to marry me ? 


You pulled this off as smoothly as possible. The timing was perfect. Well done.
Look at the Swifties in front losing their minds
Wow your timing is immaculate. Beautiful background too! Congratulations!!!
the friendship bracelet is such a cute touch!!!
Oh man, her saying "no no!" as you went down on your knee had me worried, I'm so glad it had a happy ending!! Congratulations!!!
Aww, this is the sweetest thing I've seen today and I'm so happy for you! 🤩
That was pretty much perfect.  Well done.
CONGRATULATIONS! What a beautiful way to propose, and it was done so uniquely. Wishing you and your lovely fiancé a wonderful life together! 💛
CONGRATULATIONS!!! That's such a perfect proposal, with the friendship bracelet especially, and you nailed the timing! I love seeing it!

Best wishes always to the happy couple!! ❤️
This needs to be cross posted to made me smile cus it just made me cry a tear of happiness and I’m a straight male.
This is so smooth.
All I could think was omgggg it’s giving Lizzie McGuire the movie outfit 😍
Congrats. Technically Taylor Swift witnessed this (since you were in her field of view and she claims to be able to see everyone in the crowd).
EEEEEEE!!!!!  This so full of Joy on EVERY LEVEL!!!!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️. Congrats!!!!!!!!!
The girls in the front freaking out hahaha
Omg blue skirt in the front is gonna be telling this story for the rest of her life, I love her energy.
Why wouldn’t she take the ring?!
The kneeling and opening of the box was smooth
Congratulations!
Awww congratulations! What a great way to propose and talk about perfect timing :)
I've seen so many of the Love Story proposals, but they never get old. It's just so heart warming and makes me smile every time. Congrats!
Did she start off by saying no though?!
Congratulations! Beautiful couple. Wishing you a lifetime of happiness ❤️
So sweet! Congratulations!!! Amazing proposal.
So romantic! I'm over here crying and I don't even know y'all. Congrats and I hope you have a long, blessed life together 💜
I’m so here for this trend, it’s so sweet. Also, the way every time it happens, the swifties around freak out too. So heartwarming 🥰
Not me CRYING. This is so damn sweet
These proposals just never get old. ❤️
Well done bro. She will never stop telling this story her whole life.
is it just me or did she not say no to what she read?
This is so cute, and I'm so happy for you!
Good job man, good luck with everything.
Loved the bracelet touch!!!!! ❤️ This made my day 🥰

The reaction of the people around is everything. This made me cry. Congratulations ❤️❤️
Oh mah gah ❤️❤️❤️😢
It's almost like he's done this before.  Smooth.
I’m just imagining waiting for the song… hearing it start and knowing it is coming up… the anxiety you’re waiting beat after beat for the right moment. So touching!
Did she say yes? Did she put the ring on? lol
She didn’t want to put that ring on.  That was weird
She definitely looks like she is going to tell him no later
this is a woman who wants to say no but doesn't want to embarrass the guy. a conversation happened after the concert.
magical moment, but there’s a little uncertainty in her actions. i don’t feel like this is gonna last
I love this so much!!!!
That went perfect.
Oh this did make me smile!!! 

Congratulations 🎉!
We approve. 👍 

He's a keeper.
Well played!!!! And congratulations 🎉

Perfect execution!!! Congrats to you both!!
❤️😭🥹
IM CRYING OMG 
this is so cute!!! Congratulations! I hope your love story is long lived!
Man this warms my heart so much. I opened a little mint box I had with me while watching Eras in the theatre with my girl — she did the same thing with a snack box on our second watch! 😭😭😭🥺
Hurry up and put that ring on. Took too long.
The girls in the front need to be invited to the wedding!
She did NOT want to say yes, but he caught her in the best/worst time and place ever.

Put it on her hand idiot
Hm
Poor thing has been waiting for this concert for forever and missed some it because her bf chose this moment to propose.

Hahaha what the fuck this is so fucking cringe
might be cute for you but it is so uncreative. Seen this 20 times already. You made it yourself way to easy
Do this on your own time. So glad I wasn’t stuck sitting near someone trying to propose during the concert and taking away the attention from the real reason everyone is there
Did she kiss his teeth
I’ll admit, I came here to hate, but my goodness, I can’t. This is so wholesome :)🥰
This guy dudes
This is probably one of the only things I have seen on the internet that isn't staged, nice to actually see some magic in this world
Sorry she broke up with you, bud 😅
Do you think Travis will do this ? 😝

That's awesome bro

Stop it I'm crying 😭😭😭 this was so pure
This is amazing! Congrats!!! What night was this?
I think I've watched this 6 times in a row. This is so lovely!!! Congratulations!
This is soooo cute!!! The bracelet was a fantastic touch!!!

There was a proposal at my show right below me between two women. Tbh it was really distracting but so freaking cute I was so happy for them
Love this. Congrats 🎉
Awww. This made me smile. I love the accidental timing to the lyrics as well. ❤️
Congrats! Just curious, did you know the people behind you that filmed it all? If not, that was great timing on their part too!
I love swiftie traditions, congratulations!!!!!
Congratulations! I love these videos.
I love that you used a friendship bracelet and your timing was impeccable! Congrats!!
This is so wholesome. ❤️❤️ Congratulations.
Hey god, it’s me again….😭 

Congratulations a million times over!! Seems like a dream proposal. Wishing the best for you two.
I’m too pregnant for this, im SOBBING,
Congratulations!!! 💐💐💐

Congratulations on your upcoming marriage and on your impeccable timing!!!

THE WAY YOU TIMED IT PERFECTLY
The bracelet was SUCH a good way to do this!!!
And this is how you get Taylor Swift to pay for your wedding.
Wow
Way cute! Nice work
Congrats!! This is perfection 😍
Smooth as fuck. This is the best Love Story proposal I've seen. I hope Taylor sees this.
I didn’t see or hear a “yes”.
this is sooooooooo cute
Sana all
Omg so sweet!!
This is so wholesome. 😊
Not me crying for strangers at 2am. This is beautiful!!!
That was beautiful, smooth, great timing and wholesome!!!
That was beautiful.
Waw what a love
Wonder if there's a way to get stats on the amount of Love Story Proposals happen...
Best proposal ever!
this is so thoughtful and so cute. 10/10
omg the friendship bracelet was such an adorable touch!!!
I cried!!!
You come up with this all by yourself omg I’m crying
this is so cute 😭😭
I LOVE THIS!!!! Congrats to the happy couple!!!! 💖💖💖
This is adorable I’m in tears. Congratulations! 😭💛
Literally crying so cute
I also shouted "yes!"
I was like ok I’ve seen enough of the proposals during love story but then he whipped out the bracelet first and I just knew it said will you marry me 😭 such a sweet idea!!
I got to admit in seeing this photo, I would buy a number of CD's sooner than sit that far up in the nose bleed section.  I can listen then a whole lot more to a artists music.
Felicidades a los novios
She will divorce you for another man and take everything from ....
Congratulations to both of u in ur marriage.
Congratulations to both of u in ur marriage.
Aww that fantastic! Congratulations to you both!
I love these videos. I can’t deny it even a little bit. Just love them!
This is perfect. 🥹 Can't help but watch it over and over. 😋🫰
I can’t imagine the nerves before haha

This was perfectly executed wow. Amazing and so cute
My favorite part of the Love Story proposals is watching the fans around the couple lose their minds and cheering on the engagement while not losing a beat screaming the song while still dancing and bouncing up and down. It’s so chaotic in the best way.
Are swifties ever not losing their minds? Christ
I think it’s more than a friendship bracelet..
Probably said "will you marry me" on it. She looks at it and then it hits her what's going on.
Seriously though I 100% thought this video was going to go a different way lol. Tbh though given the circumstances, with a crowd of people losing their absolute minds as though you were a celebrity couple doing a proposal, is there much wiggle room for a no in the first place? 😅
And her ‘please don’t’ is just an afterthought.
Nothing wrong with a straight male tear of happiness
She knows when you are sleeping, she knows when you’re awake…
[removed]
Put the ring on, girl….
It might have been like a “no, no you can’t be serious” sort of thing?
I think she might have just thought it was a joke maybe?
Indeed. And it would definitely ruin the vibe for the rest of the concert since it's quite early into the show.
Could be the shock of the surprise and being thrown off because of the emotion of being at the concert, surrounded by a huge crowd, people filming you and just a general 'What is happening?' confusion. If it were me, my brain would've been scrambled and I wouldn't have been able to concentrate on anything else the rest of the night.
aw she was just caught off guard. she said on tiktok that they’ve been together for 6 years, have pets together and she just wasn’t in control of her emotions then lol
Yeah. This happened to a friend of mine. He surprised with a proposal at Christmas in front of the family. She said yes but said she felt pressured. They got divorced a year later. She tried though.
Right?? Everyone is saying this is so sweet/perfect/making them cry but like did anyone else watch the whole thing? Her reaction does not give me confidence.
That depends. Are we invited?
She’s got seven cameras on her and just got proposed to. 🤷‍♀️they’re fine. 😂
I’m thinking that’s not good
You do realize this is a costume? junior jewels from the YBWM music video?
Are you from Brazil?
Way to trauma dump. This is super weird btw.
Seriously, as an outsider working my way in, this is an incredibly wholesome fandom.
YESSSSSSS!!! 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
No, probably not. They’re too busy having fun and celebrating each other’s milestones. I’ll take it. 💥
Ok
A best friendship
[deleted]
It’s Nice to Have a Friend(ship bracelet)
The caption says it said "would you like to marry me"
Remember kids: If the answer isn't a forgone conclusion the question shouldn't be asked.

The where and how can be a surprise, the concept of "is this relationship is headed for marriage" shouldn't be broached by a ring.
Then it would have turned into Champagne Problems. 😬
They are my favorite! They are so sweet and full of so much joy!
she makes a list, she checks it once, then she checks it twice
I for one welcome our overlord Taylor swift
Dude, they were just making a nice comment.
This is why I don't like public proposals, especially ones in front of an entire crowd of people.  There's so much pressure.  I wish the best for them, but you can clearly see her uncertainty in the moment.  She even shakes her head and looks like she says "no, no" right before he brings out the ring.
I love the comment hahahaha. 
Would you come to Brazil? 🤣🤣🥰🥰🥰
- YBWM could mean "You Belong With Me", a track from *Fearless* (2008) by Taylor Swift.

They were roommates
*Fiancé With Bracelet 😏
Legally binding friendship bracelet
I see what you did there 😏
*OH!*
I just find this level of idolatry kind of exaggerated
I only give presents when I get to leave Travis Kelce’s town and travel to Brazil. 🤷
Mah gawd they were roommates😮
🥰♥️
That’s very important for everyone here to know.
Well the "comment" section is made to comment, so I think I did nothing wrong by expressing an opinion
No, it was extremely important for us to all know that you don’t like celebrity culture in a *checks notes* celebrity subreddit.
👏🏻
I didn't say I don't like it, I just said the remote possibility of Taylor having seen a proposal with the glimpse of an eye really doesn't matter here because it's THEIR moment and life
Yeah, we all heard you say that already. We know you’re determined to shit all over someone else’s nice moment. It’s getting boring.
My outfit for the eras tour London
MATCHED WITH HERRRR🩷🩷🩷🩷
“You look like…Taylor Swift” That is a great outfit
If I saw you in the crowd wearing that, I'd be doing a double/triple take. That is some strong resemblance!
You look like Taylor Swift in this light😅
Of course that’s your outfit for the show Taylor! It’s what you always wear! (Seriously you look just like her)
Stop your outfit is so good I thought you were actually Taylor Swift 😭🫶
At first I thought this was another wax figure post from r/YouBelongWithMemes but it looked *too* much like Taylor
For a split second i thought blondie had a new lover bodiesuit lmao. You look amazing.
Amazing!!! This literally looks professional, like it could be her exact bodysuit. 

I want to make this outfit so bad but have 0 idea on how to do so without like…. a sewing machine or mannequin that is the exact shape of my body LOL

Did you make this yourself (and if so, did you follow a tutorial ahahaha) or did you buy it somewhere?
Nice try Taylor, you can't just post yourself on here
(but fr i genuinely thought you were her for a moment)
The bodysuit looks professionally made!
I SAW YOU IN THE QUEUE!! You were the sweetest and me and my friends kept saying how great you looked! You made bracelets with some of the girls near us, too!!! ❤️
Ashley?
I love how similarly you've done your make-up as Taylor has this tour! You look absolutely gorgeous!
close enough, drop the eras tour documentary!!!
Mama Swift has some explaining to do. lol
Wow there for a minute….You have a strong resemblance to the woman herself. Beautiful bodysuit that your wearing.
You can do Taylor Swift lookalike competition and actually WIN
this is so beautiful!!! if I had this bodysuit I would wear it all the time 🤣
You could probably just walk on stage like that 😹
Omg you look so much like her!! Amazing outfit and everything. I would have loved for her to see you and do the biggest double take.
You certainly look enough like Taylor to persue it as a career.
LOVE!!!
Is that what your hair is normally like, or did you style it specifically for the show?

Either way, stunning - great job!
Fuck you look the image of girlie if you have a good voice you could do Taylor Swift tribute 

Outfit slaying ofc 🤌🏻🤌🏻
Omg I'm sure the swifties in the concert be like "What's Taylor doing at the floor and not on stage?"
Incredibly good outfit and match! Loved the pay of your effort!
I saw you on Addy Millers Instagram story! I love it!
Your outfit is perfect!!!! I see it and I already imagine you singing ‘Cruel Summer’
babes you are STUNNING !!!!
Becky?
“She said, ‘you look like an American singer’…” 🎶
I thought you're Taylor omfg (you looks absolutely stunning!!)
Perfection!
Amazing!!! Were you there on Thursday - I think I saw you go past my seat in Level 5 (or someone very similar looking hahaha)?
If I ever needed a reason to learn to sew, it’s this
Perfection! 🩷🩵
Wait were you in like the 3rd/4th row center on the 19th?
this takes "wearing the band shirt to the concert" to the next level
Ok gorgeous!! Looking like T Swift out there.
Becky????
Ashley? Si that you?
Awesome outfit!! 🫶
You look AMAZING. And yeah, you really do look like Taylor. I'd ask for your autograph if I saw you there.
Omg I think we saw you because my daughter and I were both like, she looks just like Taylor!
AMAZING!!!
It's just Ashley!
What lipstick are you wearing?? You look awesome!!!
I did a double take, you look a lot like her!
Holy shit! It’s Taylor Swift! I knew she was lurking on this subreddit
Taylor is that you?
omg hi taylor✨
Not sure if Taylor wants people to try to be her clone
You look like... Taylor Swift..in this light..
taylor, where are your security guards?? 🤭🥰
You are soooo Taylor Swift’s doppelgänger.
What colour fishnets is that?
Love the outfit. What tights are they? X
Totally smashed it, girlie!! Hope you had an awesome night
Wow this is amazing
Amazing!
Love it! Which shade leggings did you end up getting?
Gorgeous just gorgeous ❤️
Adorable!!!
No way!!
Close enough, release reptv
Wait is this not Taylor swift?
I saw you in the toilets and my friend and I told you how fab you looked! Such a great outfit! Hope you had a blast 💕
Omg queen! Have fun out there

Stunning!!!! OMG!!! 💜💜💜💜
That's... not her?
pretty!! Tylor number2![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1088)
Looks insane! love it.
you're literally taylor swift
This is fantastic! You look great and what an extraordinary job you did in the body suit. Phenomenal. ❤️
Ok aside from the obvious “you look like… Taylor Swift” jokes that body suit is amazing what the hell?? I’m not even a woman but I need it 😭
Awesome work!
Ayo ashley that u?
Close enough, come back to Liverpool
must’ve took so long!!
You are the spitting image of Taylor!!!
OMG you look stunning! If I were there and saw you, I would definitely want to take a picture with you!
Looks more like Taylor than shitty ASHLEY. I bet you’re nicer too!
"It's Ashley"
It’s slaying
We're loving it.
[deleted]
Taylor is that u??
Did you make this yourself?
It's so cool and you look sooo gooddd♥️♥️
Omg you could pass for her double. Apply for a job to help her escape the madness that is her fandom when she’s trying to be normal. Great 👍
Love it
AHHH YOU’RE TAYLOR’S TWIN!!!!!!! 🤯🤯🤯
Wow. You look amazing.
"You look like, Taylor Swift in this light, we're lovin' it!"

You could be her doppelganger!
Love Love Love it!!!!!
Found Taylor's reddit account
Girl… how many asked you for autographs and photos 😂
Honestly, this is just weird for a grown adult to be dressing up as Taylor Swift.
Omg I thought you were HER
Omg you’re her twin! So cute
Shouldn't you be on stage right now!?
Awesome! You friggin look just like her. Well done!
Can you sing too???
You idiots! You've captured her stunt double!
Taylor Swift trying to attend her own concert I see you Taylor
You could be her twin
Did a double take, absolutely love the outfit! 😍
Legit thought you were Taylor at first glance and I thought why does she have festival bracelets then I realised
you look so much like her! wow how lucky
Fabulous! You could easily be her body double, too!
Amazing outfit, genuinely thought you were the actual Taylor for a sec
Your cosplaying someone who cosplays a pop star!  It's popception!  Brilliant!
Close enough drop reputation tv
Taylor Swift has apparently reached the level of Stalin and now requires body doubles when she makes public appearances
Close enough drop Rep TV
If you can sing then you can make good money on the tribute scene 😂
Are you Taylor Swift? ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1082)
You're stunning!
YOU CANNOT TELL ME THAT ISNT TAYLOR ALISON FUCKING SWIFT
RIP your inbox
RIP your inbox
Get a life.
FUUUUUUCK WHY DID THIS GOT RECOMMENDED TO ME 

BAAAAN MEEEE

BAAAAANN MEEEEE NOWWWW
…in this light WERE LOVING IT!!
I had the exact same thought; OP looks amazing! I feel like I see 75% Taylor Swift with 25% Sabrina Carpenter mixed in, ha ha.
✨dazzling✨
You can sing this entire line 🤣
i'd take a pic with her lol i'd be like this is as close as i will ever get to meeting taylor swift
I was going to say, when she walks through the crowd there will be a few mini heart attacks.
We're loving it!!
I mean duh? She’s clearly aiming for that, it’s not a happy accident lol

Edit: yeah I’m a dumbass, I see it now
Is it giving wearing white to a wedding vibes
LOL TY🩷
I've seen people just buy the body as is, and either buy it in the right colour or dye it and then just bedazzle it! Depending on your skill and patience, it can look absolutely amazing! 

I'd wager a guess that OP used a standard body top as well. It's looks gorgeous!
A friend of mine made it!
OMGGGGGGGGGGGG🥹🩷🩷🩷 on the 19?
No, it's Becky 😀
THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING
That was my initial reaction, too!
Or maybe a careless man has another careful daughter lol
i have bangs but usually dont style it like that! just for the concert and tribute shows! 🩷
I actually do tribute shows🫣
instead of 'two hims' with Travis and Ross now it's 'two hers' with Taylor and OP 😂😂
nooo i went 16,17,19 and 20 🥹🩷
first row right standing pit (near the diamond area)
oh hiii ✨🥳
HOW IS THIS CLONING HER OSKSKZNZMNSNS this is just a look inspired by her 😭pls
It's a bit creepy
Very odd.
wtf? 🧍‍♀️ hope ur okay
omg really weird that 92.000 wore inspired outfits too 😨 this must be a sick world right?
i have one! you should try getting one, it’s really fun 🩷 (reddit does not count as one sadly but it’s really easy, hope this helps!!) have a nice day
OMG SABRINA
Listen to Clara Bow from TTPD

damn, I need better friends ahahaha😂
RIP Becky
I’d 100% go say your amazing :)
Must have been someone else - hope you had a great time!!
Lol, actually yes. But go ahead thinking this cult like behavior is normal.
Omg embarrassing. Thank you 🙏
The patience 😅
its actually pretty cool! ☺️🩷
Ofc 😊 Pls don’t feel too bad 🥲 None of us understand every reference we see
You’re too kind! I’m still early on this journey and the lore is deeeeeeep haha

Lukáš Hrádecký hands the Bundesliga trophy to the Leverkusen fans and lets them celebrate with it

Great to watch even if a bit risky.
That's one hell of a scene when the guy with the megaphone lofts it up infront of the fans
I remember we've done this once before in Morocco. As long as the fans demonstrate civility regularly you can definitely trust them with this type of gesture.
This is class! I love the connection between players and fans at German clubs! That's what Football is meant to be about!
He should have take Pfand for it first to make sure it's given back.
When Frankfurt won the Pokal in the season he left, we was also one of the first in contact with fans... and beers :D
This is fucking sick
So happy for Leverkusen and their fans.

I tuned into Matchweek 1 because I am a Xhaka fan and wanted to see how he did with his new club.  Exciting win and I got hooked on this club.  Caught almost every other match the rest of the season.

So many great players bound together with an incredible manager.  One for the ages!
Is it normal in Germany?
What a scene.
That’s fucking brilliant.
Luke probably got thirsty and needed both hands for beer.
Lukáš Hrádecký deserves a championship He really is a great guy.
well, that's not coming back, I guess
If it happened in Naples it would have disappeared real quick
In America they decide their champion by playoff format so the fans created the Supporters' Shield, awarded to the team with the most points (as it should be) - they often get to handle it because it's theirs.
Beautiful scenes
Such a beautiful and unique trophy
When you have 51 pc stake in your club!
This is gonna be the star of "EMOTIONAL RESPECT FOOTBALL MOMENTS #948"
The Bundesliga trophy is a hubcap?
Football in Germany is for the fans and that is beautiful
This is on another level of wholesomeness
Fucking commentators. I want to hear the stadium!
Damn, for whatever reason, this made me tear up. That’s hella cool!!
This is what it's all about. Should've passed it around a bit more, no one wants to damage the trophy and sure as shit no one is getting out of the stadium with it.
nahhh this leverkusen documentary gonna hit so hard for them, we witnessed history
When I was a kid playing for my local club competing for some Mickey Mouse u13 trophy my coach went absolutely mental on a team mate for touching the trophies as we were all walking by the table with them all lined up, screaming at him that you don't touch the trophy if you haven't won it yourself.  I wonder what his take on fans of the club that won the trophy touching it would be.  I'm pretty sure he's dead now anyway.  He was an asshole.
Class!
Neverkusen no more
Wow what a moment
What a fucking club. Where do I get official merch from?
This is the birth of a new superclub.
And the trophy was never seen again…
Risky
It's the capo, he is (most likely) respected enough for this job, so he will have enough control over the crowd.
I suppose this was planed given that they sealed the Meisterschaft for quite a while now.
This is Germany, even if someone tried to do something suspicious with the trophy he would be found pretty quickly and get into ostracism
its not like its gonna get stolen. for every person who wants to theres 100 thatll stop them.
Looks like they are the capos, nothing will happen they are respected by the crowds and know the players/club representatives personally (if it's like here)
A bit. Try that in Turkey.
Iconic picture potential
Absolute Kino
That looked so powerful
thats most probably their capo so its obvious he'll get to lift that
[Photo](https://ibb.co/tCWhwJt)
Problem is if you tried this at an English club I bet you'd have fans ripping it out of each others hands
lol
Hradecky is the reason I learned to open a beer bottle with another beer bottle. He was so proficient at it, I thought it was insanely cool.

The next day, when a visibly wasted KP Boateng asked who else was drunk during festivities at the Römer, Hradecky’s hand was the first to shoot up. 

The guy is immensely likeable. I’m super happy that he eventually won the Bundesliga. What a player!
Same with Finland and the Euro qualification, dude is the absolute life of the party. There's a reason why Finland, Frankfurt and Leverkusen have been going through their most successful periods with him as gk and captain.
Considering that it's normal for Bayern to win the trophy I doubt that it's normal to hand the trophy to Leverkusen fans.
When we won EL, Trapp also let the fans celebrate with it
Not to my knowledge, no. First time I've seen it happen, that's why I posted it. Thought it was rather unusual and kinda epic.
If that was England I think it would be on eBay as they were parading it to the rest of the crowd.
[Yes, even Bayern do it.](https://cdn.imago-images.de/bild/sp/1011915760/m.jpg) Fans and players in Germany have a much closer bond than anywhere else I've seen.
First I've ever seen it
Nah, normally it´s just the Major of the city who takes the trophy from the players.
yeah usually bayern travels to leverkusen after every season to let their fans touch the title, this year it means a little more since leverkusen actually won the league
His love for beer and geography is unmatched
Tbh that was very civilised, i was expecting a thousands hands squirming there way towards the dinner plate
It's not like he gave it to _someone_, the megaphone guy is probably a pretty known and reliable person within the ultras. Love to see it.
If it was a PL team, one of the fans would've quickly swapped it for a cheap replica or done something like this lol.

https://youtube.com/shorts/SdZCSoPcReg?si=PfLPnLiBznZ3ERiq
Hrádecký wents up and also Xabi few mins later to celebrate together with all of them and the Meisterschale
Ah it'll turn up eventually
The people he gave it to are organizers for the ultra fan groups and pretty well known, not just random fans
He gave it to the capos not some rando in the crowd lol
That is cool
You should see the 2. Bundesliga [Trophy](https://media.dfl.de/sites/2/2018/11/meisterschale-2bl-frontal-1200x675.jpg)
Only fitting for the nation that unleashed cars on the world
It's a salad bowl
Lmao
How is it risky? Even if someone decides to try and take it, they aren't getting anywhere surrounded by cameras and Leverkusen ultras
I'm curious, how are these guys seen in Germany? do they have bad reputation like ultras in many countries, or are they just "normal guys" and respected by fans? maybe something in between?
 I don't thinkt it was. If you ever saw a drunk crowd in unison united by a common cause, they can become quite civil
I'd hang it up on my wall it's that good

Hradecky comes from the city I live currently in Finland. The area he used to live is on the north east from city center, around 3-4 km, just next to industrial area. A “big” city for Finnish standard but small compared to other countries.

So happy for him winning the title, also for Leverkusen to change their nickname now.
Certain man with a mustache and a coke addiction in the 90s would have stolen the trophy if Bayern did that.
[deleted]
Yea Hrádecký went up to them with Alonso to celebrate with them and they got it back pretty quickly.
remember napoli fans last season trying to undress their players?
Mate kop don't just swarm a capo like that lol
I think there is a lot of respect for the title and trophy. Having it handed to the leaders of the fans is as close as we had hoped to get, but I would never have imagined that people grab for it
And if not....

Xabi Alonso *(in Walder Frey voice)*: "I'll just get another one"
Peak German efficiency to make their trophies in the same place they make their cars.
Drop. Dent. Ruined. Use your imagination bro, Jesus.
I think it really depends from club to club, some clubs ultras are very notorious or even criminal, some are truly good people
Depends who you ask. But at worst they are seen as hooligans, not mafia criminals like in other countries.

Matchgoing Fans probably view them more favorable as TV only or non football fans. Biggest points of conflict between them and the general public is pyro (which increased a lot since covid) and violence. But they mostly keep the violence out of the stadiums and between each other (and if only because security is to tight, which is expensive and also a point of critics) so it isn't really that visible.

I know older TV-Fans just calling them chaots but not viewing them only negatively, everybody knows they make the atmosphere which is mostly universally appreciated. So I would guess most view them kinda ambivalent and I would guess the younger and the more matchgoing the more they are respected.

There also were some big things catapulting them in the spotlight of national news which probably had some influence.

One big point was the escalation with Hopp right before covid, which was handled very poorly by the DFB and the media at first, espescially after later it became clear that the "spontanous" reaction and outpouring of solidarity with Hopp and disgust about the fans wasn't really as spontanous and everybody (DFL, Bayern, Hopp, Broadcasters) knew about the banners or at least about something happening before the game. So while I feel like in the beginning the ultras were villified the tone in the media changed after some while. Especially because the DFB didn't react to cases (especially one case a few weeks prior) of discrimination before with the same reaction (or any at all) and Schickera Munich (Group which held the banner causing the escalation) is a dedicated left-leaning group fighting racism in the stadium and was even awarded a prize for this from the DFB before. But still for most non-football intrested people it probably was viewed negatively

And Schickeria is not the only group. While in recent years a lot of Ultra groups are leaning or are open to the right there are (nearly) no open right-extremists politics in the stadium. The ultra culture was one of the biggest reason openly right-extremists hooligans aren't the bosses in the curves anymore.

The successfull protests against the DFL Investor this season probably also did some good work for their Public Relations.
Hertha's capo is amazing. He's slightly older, not sure but would guess early 40's. Incredible as a capo and has vibe around him that when he starts asking for more and more, you feel it in your gut and want to fight for the man. And yet he's a family man and often at club events or member meetings. He's been part of the leadership of the Harlekins (Ultra Group) and the Ostkurve in general for well over 10 years now. Not at all who you would imagine to be a Capo.

[He gave a very rare interview to Spiegel this year about the fan protests against the DFL investor deal. ](https://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/hertha-bsc-ultra-zu-fanprotesten-wie-ein-tsunami-in-dem-man-versucht-gegen-den-strom-zu-schwimmen-a-e5780550-85b6-4ec3-b462-ca991d394959)

[Here he is speaking to the players at the beginning of the year after a brutal 6-4 loss.](https://x.com/BlauRadler/status/1715039331222528435)

Hertha' Capo from 1998 to 2006 was Kay Bernstein who would later become the club President. There's a genuine feeling building about Kreisel one day running for the board or perhaps even the Presidency. Very well respected figure in German football generally. 

Perfect story to illustrate their power over the ultras. Last year after the game v. Freiburg, a mass brawl of 20 v. 20 broke out at the top of the stairs between our own ultras. The riot police came and just got sucked into it as well and kept fighting for 20-30 seconds. The Kreisel comes up the stairs and just casually looks down and hits the alarm button on his megaphone and it was like someone paused real life. Every single ultra stopped fighting and everyone just walked away, it was genuinely insane to see.
Their Image declines with the interest the other person has in football.

Among Fans they are mostly respected and appreciated, but for the average non-football Joe they are mostly just "Hooligans"
Hradecky is also the reason I know (almost) every flag :D Hradecky, FM and me being weird.
Impressive knowing all those flags then going wrong with Ireland
That was fascinating to watch
It's funny that he has very very slight accent when speaking Finnish, though his home city dialect is much stronger, but his German accent is super Finnish to my ears. What a guy, proper underdog player with Pokal for Frankfurt, Finnish men's first qualification to major tournament and now unbeaten title to Leverkusen, and he seems like very grounded and normal, good person.
Nah, he's a man with integrity and has a clear conscience.
That man won that trophy already in the early 90s with us if you have forgotten:)
Hitler died in the 1940s? Besides he was Schalke "Fan" and it was meth.
Yes, but why is that relevant?😅 It's not like Hradecky gifted the trophy to the fans or something, he just let the Capos lift it
Technically the Schale ist not the Buli trophy, it's the trophy for the German Football Champion and was awarded before Bundesliga even existed.

Ironically the Schale is not the original trophy, the Meisterschale was the replacement for the [Viktoria](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Pokal) ), which was awarded to the first ever German Champion in 1903. It got lost during WWII and reappeared after reunification. If the Meisterschale ever gets lost, we'll still have the original thing ...



^Ofc ^I ^don't ^want ^the ^Schale ^to ^get ^lost.
they didnt just try, they succeeded
Ngl back to back Bundesliga titles for Alonso and Leverkusen would make them Gods
Just adds character lol. Sergio Ramos special
Dropped, bus coming through, drives right over it, behind the bus comes a steamroller followed by an early July 4th parade trampling over it
this can happen anyway (and happens i imagine), it'll just get fixed/replaced.
Yeah but regardless whoever is their leader is most likely known by the club and has a ton of respect in the crowd so it is not really that risky
>some are truly good people

  
Shocked that you haven't been downvoted for this, this place absolutely hatet ultras with a passion. Seen comments saying "all ultras are scum of the earth" sitting in 4K upvotes

I guess there aren't as many English or Americans in here
Great insight, thanks. Really interesting, and refreshing compared to many other countries, particularly here in Argentina
Super interesting!  What is he saying to the players in that clip?
ngl, that sounds kinda sad

imagine spending your days as a whole ass adult directing a bunch of room temperature IQ bums fighting
What a non-take. It differs from club to club. Some ultras just want to have some fun while some ultras have neo nazi ties.
You can understand why when you see the [Cote D'Ivoire flag](https://cdn.britannica.com/48/5048-050-69610380/Flag-Cote-dIvoire.jpg) though
My way of remembering it is that the colour on the left is the same as the corresponding teams kit
He actually speaks fluent Finnish, Swedish, Danish, German, English and Slovakian.

What a guy, so happy he got to win the championship.
Hahahahahahaha
Dont think they mean Hitler. They are talking about Christoph Daum.
[deleted]
You’ve got a good imagination lol
Nah a lot of us just grew up in Cities with football teams and had to deal with the scourage that are ultras. In my city you weren't allowed to bring children to certain games for a long time because it was too risky. The whole city would shut down for a match, traffic would be fucked because they had to police escort buses of opposing team and fans in and out. Rivalry games almost always ended with a riot. 

Worst part is you could just be walking groceries back to your house and forget it's match day and get swallowed by the wave of people fighting each other and cops and get fucked up while completely just minding your own business. 

Hence why they get a lot of hate.
Ultras are what make football the best sport in the world

No, it does not really differ from club to club in this context.

Do you think the average Person knows the difference between Bremen and Rostock Ultras ?
For them, both are just drunk and loud troublemaker.
Oh yeah I know, but that's still a suprising thing for someone to get wrong when you remember something like Fiji. Especially considering he is from Europe and has played against Ireland.
Sure, but it's not like you're thinking "ahh this isn't a unique original anyways, let the fans have it" in the moment. You don't want to lose that trophy either, it's more about the trust you have in your fans
You can't separate ultras from hooligans
You from latin America bro?😂😂
Fantastic.  Thank you.
I'm from the UK and couldn't comfortably tell you which is which!
To be fair they could be talking about a few places, such as Glasgow or Belfast 30+ years ago. The old firm derby was historically not a place to bring young kids and in Northern Ireland there was a deeply rooted sectarian aspect to several teams fanbases.

The bar is so low when men are congratulated for not wanting to f*** minors or make sure they have consent 🫠 these are NORMAL THINGS GUYS
Our standards are real low for us to consider the bare minimum “wholesome” 💀
Of all the rappers in the world, you make these dudes the contenders for most wholesome lyric? Come on now
Booooo!!!!
The Lil Uzi Vert is not a positive thing. It's damn creepy and sounds like if it wasn't illegal he would do it.
That’s pretty basic though. That’s like congratulating someone for not committing murder. It’s a given lmao
lol look what makes you a good person. The bare fucking minimum
This a joke right

Some room temperature IQ lyrics.
Oh it’s so wholesome and good not to fuck minors
Boy, pretty low bar that not raping someone is considered wholesome.
Raping vs rapping doesn't happen too commonly :)
I could fuck your girl and make her nut for me then slut for me
Then kill for me then steal for me and of course it'll be your cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to your way

3. Special Ed I’m the Magnificent he’s says something super similar in the beginning of the song
None of these are rapping about being good people lmao. Literally the bare minimum
Uzi’s is weird because its like the only thing stopping him from fucking a teenager is that it’s illegal. Like he’s attracted to them but he just cant fuck them because they’re legally minors?
“I’m the shit I’m fartin, I dont know how to potty”
Matt Champions verse in Junky. Don't think it's wholesome, but for the whole respect women trope it's the least corny verse about it.
on the off chance this wasnt intended as a shitpost, the first two arent wholesome thats the bare minimum bruh
Is not raping teenagers the bar for wholesome?

“Take you babies, no harambe”- Quavo, Good Drank
Awww that’s good that lil baby is respectful towards women. Too bad he’s fucking racist and that probably only applies towards a certain race of women.
"Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school
Are makin' laws about what women can do
I gotta protect ya, I'm a made man, tied in, all the way, baby
So I gotta respect ya'

Drake is for protecting women's rights
The bar is low.

Call him corny, but I think his respect and love for his peers is admirable.

Might not be a lot of people’s cup of tea, but a lot Aussie rappers really seem to have plot in check. Bliss n eso, hilltop hoods, Seth sentry, horrorshow, 360, etc.

tf do u expect him to say, “I interacted with a female I initially thought was attractive, only to find out later in the conversation that she was, indeed, younger than the age of consent, and thus, on legal and ethical grounds, I terminated our conversation and ceased to pursue sexual contact with her” ????

She would have had to file a police report over it. Or I guess maybe her family could have if they had explicit proof of some kind. Both of which are obviously unlikely. 

Otherwise how could the State of California prove that they were having sex?
I'm yet to meet an underage girl that doesn't look underage. I've met many legal age women who look underage.
Lmao facts! Just saying stuff lmao

The Tortured Poets Department is a 30-somethings album
As I listened to both halves of the double album I couldn't get this thought out of my mind. It feels like she made this album without trying to cater to everyone all at once - there are no kidzbop tunes or spoonfed metaphors. She is being so honest and real about how she feels about her fame and her fans demanding things from her, she's not sugarcoating it for anyone. As a 32 year old fan who has been listening since debut, it feels like Taylor wasn't worried about alienating her fanbase with her work for maybe the first time ever (although you could make that argument for reputation, but TTPD has the advantage of a more grown up perspective).

This album IS what being in your 30s feels like. Being in your 30s doesn't stop you from feeling heartbreak any less than you did in your 20s - you're still messy and wild, but able to put on a brave face and deal with it a bit better. Being in your 30s is finally breaking free from giving a shit about other people's opinions and deciding you're going to live your life the way you want. Being in your 30s is looking around and wondering if you're the only one who still pretends what they know what they're doing half the time. 
As a thirty-eight-year-old who’s especially partial to folklore/evermore but has found something to love about pretty much all of the eras, TTPD feels like the best aspects of her last three albums in terms of the sound and songwriting, mixed with the very intimate emotional diary-like confessions of earlier works like Speak Now and Red, but with an added maturity and self-awareness that feels brand-new to her songs but deeply familiar to me in this stage of my life.

Oddly enough, I think that’s part of what makes the sweet nostalgia factor of “So High School” particularly effective because it’s such a contrast—not just in terms of happiness versus heartbreak, but also that absolute joy of discovering that even though you’re no longer the same person you were as a teenager, some of that is still a part of the person you are now.
oh yeah, "my friends all smell like weed and little babies" is a really specific 30s experience.

Edit: fastest I’ve ever gotten to 420 upvotes
I find it interesting that many younger fans think she's being immature on this album, while the older ones are like yep this is what being in your 30s is like lol
36 year old here and yeah..... Yeah this album is reminding me a lot of what I'm unpacking and learning and confronting in therapy. It's about realizing you lived your life for something else for three decades, and now it's your own turn and you don't know where to start, but you have years of experience you can and can't use??? It's a mess but it's you and you have to live with it.
THIS! 35 year old swiftie since debut. It's what 35 looks like. It doesn't matter if it's a relationship ending. It's about being in something for a LONG time.... so long it becomes who you are and then it seems to be at an end and you don't take the out and make it work for years more and then hit the nuke button to blow it all up in spectacular fashion in the end because you just can't take it anymore and the nuke feels like the only option at that point. Usually you do something totally nuts at that point. You've lost yourself and what you built your life around. When that all is gone, you do weird sh\*t. At least for a second. Then you remember you're an adult and come to your senses.

I'm happily married but I was in a job way longer than I should have been and ended up rage quitting my job with no plan, spent a hot second crazy-talking about all these really random ideas I had to do my own thing... creating a business for myself that was my teenage dream that I have NO training in,  and then after a few months snapped out of it and put my big girl panties on. (also like half my friends are on the rocks or getting divorced or divorced in the last year or so... so i do have empathy as well because they all pulled a weird one out as a rebound... like let's get with the guy from tinder who drives a harley because that seems like a brilliant idea weird)
I was just thinking that this morning. I’ve been a fan since debut and being within a year of her age, her albums have always been super on the nose and relatable for that moment in my life. This one especially so.
I think the advantage of Taylor's explosion, especially in the last few years, is that she doesn't need to be afraid of alienating her fanbase anymore. Fans are dedicated enough that whatever she puts out is pretty much guaranteed to be a success and that means she can be more honest, less mainstream, somewhat unfiltered, and generally explore with her music. And I personally think that that made for a really interesting album in TTPD.
I'm 29 and I completely agree. I've been with her since debut (about 13 or so) and I needed this album at 21 but I wouldn't have understood a single thing on it.
For me, it’s very relatable in terms of “when is it my turn?” You watch all your friends find their people, settle down, create families. And you’re out here like, did you forget about me? What am I doing wrong? And reflecting on all your life + relationships looking for clues. 

It’s her most relatable album in *years* for me.
Another poster commented that it seems younger fans are struggling with the idea that a short, toxic fling could fuck you up more than the end of a long-term relationship, and I think there's two layers to this:

1. Most of them are too young to have had the stable, long-term relationship yet

2. The number a toxic, emotionally charged relationship does on you in your thirties is a whole different kind of mindfuck than it is in your twenties. 

If my husband up and left me tomorrow I'd be devastated and wildly confused, but wouldn't have much material to pull from after six years of happiness and an honestly pretty easy relationship. 

Now, the guy I dated for three months before him.... He'd get a record's worth of words out of me.

It...hits different...when you're older and get fucked over like you did in your teens and twenties. Like, wait a minute, I'm THIRTY and you were able to get to me like this?? I left THIS happen in my THIRTIES???? It's a special kind of reflection, rage, bitterness, and honestly self-disappointment and self-loathing. And it's also just sad. Because you think you're past that point in life. But there you are, again. 

If the younger fans don't get this album now, they will in ten years.
Oh 100% she made this for the mature adult fans and not a care in the world what the critics or the so called “fans” that say it all sounds the same. Or it’s nothing new. It can’t be played on the radio or whatever bullshit thing you can think of. She said when she announced it the album was mostly a big therapy session that she absolutely needed and wanted to write. And she practiced what she preached and kept writing no matter whatever state of mind she was in. 

I’m not expecting people to get it or looking for something familiar that they can play on repeat or on the radio. People will be disappointed by that. I think this album is one where you’re at home chilling with your headphones on and just vibing or need to feel something. 

To me the album is great. I got down voted in another sub by just saying that. I loved the album. What else can I say. I’m excited to see what’s next. I think she’s not done yet. Very surprised by no lyric videos but those might come after the MV premiere. That in itself is going to be interesting. Especially from the way the song sounds and the 3 second teaser.
When I listened to it I definitely thought, oh this is not one for the kids
Def captured the vibe of being in a long term relationship for a good chunk of your 20s, a relationship that you thought was endgame, and then having the rug pulled out from under you and you’re like wtf do I do now? Work and make bad decisions
Yep. I am 40. My 30s were when I really started unpacking my baggage and traumas and started working through them
 Self discovery and self realization is messy and it is painful.
This is so accurate! Reading some comments today - is making me feel like an annoying old lady going “it’s okay young one, you’ll get it one day, I didn’t get this at 22 either.”
The biggest lie you get told by people in your 30's is that you'll be somehow freer and better able to handle your life once you cross that threshold. The truth is it's the decade where you learn how to be all those things, which means you make mistake after mistake you thought you were "too old for' and you think you're the only one fucking up so badly. I'm 38, and I just now think I might know how to navigate life. This album is for me!
Taylor continues aging with her music so gracefully, like a fine wine, I’m glad she took such a real, raw direction and didn’t just pander to the section of the fan base that demands Rep TV every time she says anything 😭
My first general note on the album was

Baby girl has grown up. I feel sorry for the youngest Swifties...they won't get a lot of this. It's complete heartbreak, bad choices, bad rebounds, brokenness and god dammit also hope and healing. Fucking masterpiece.
35 year old agrees. This albums brings back a lot of memories of those toxic relationships (even the short ones) from years passed and how I exactly feel about them now.
Only 24 here but this album is so raw and real. She’s bared her soul to us and listening feels like reading her personal diary
I love how she really doesn’t give a shit with her lyrics.

_I'm having his baby/ No, I'm not, but you should see your faces_ bahahaha, love it
41 year old old here and I agree. Oh I soooo identified with being in absolute manic love with someone that was the worst person ever and willing to absolutely destroy my life for him. This album brought it all back lol
Preach🫶 It's so perfect even to listen to, really nice melodies, thoughtful lyrics, messy situations, and the whole sound is just chaotic enough to experience the highs and lows of the topics and situations. An instant favourite for me.
[deleted]
100% what I’m thinking! I’m 31 and have been a fan since debut. Her albums have always been on the nose with where I was in my own life, for the most part, and I’ve always wondered what Taylor’s albums would look like as she/we got older. At some point she’s going to need to break from her traditional starry eyed, innocent heart vibe, right? What does that look like?? I feel like we saw a glimpse of that break in Midnights but it was also a very pop, digestible for the masses type album. I really like Midnights but it wasn’t as deep and cutting as some of her previous work overall (some songs were more than others, but I’m generalizing the album). 

And then we get TTPD and holy forking shirt this whole album hits deep. I honestly think this is my new favorite album of hers. There’s only two songs I don’t jive with (The Alchemy and I Can Fix Him). 29/31 is insane! I was initially annoyed by the people not “getting it” and kind of dogging her for it but I think she knew that was going to happen and she put it out there anyways because it’s honest and raw and just real. And she knew the ones who “got it” would really get it. This is not an album made for the masses and she put it out there knowing that. She had to. So if she’s okay with that, I’m going to have to let it go and be okay with it, too. 

For me, this album is so grown up and takes a look at this period of her life with a rawer, less idealistic lens and I think most of us in our 30s can relate to being in that place in our lives. We’re still the same teens and 20-something’s who cried and screamed and dreamed to Tears on My Guitar and White Horse and Love Story and Red and ATW and so many more, but now we’ve been through some shit by this point in our lives and have a hefty dose of reality under our belts. Even though the subject matter of a lot of these songs is heartbreak, it’s giving a far more introspective lens than most of her previous work ever did and I think that’s insanely relatable. 

I honestly could write an entire dissertation on my thoughts on this album. To me, it’s one of the best overall albums she’s ever done. And if you disagree, maybe you’re just 23 and will understand it better in 10 years and that’s okay 😆 Go listen to Red for now.
Yes! I’m turning 40 and leaving my 30s behind in a couple weeks and the 16 instances of “fuck it” (and one “fuck you”) in Down Bad is the most relatable thing ever.
>it feels like Taylor wasn't worried about alienating her fanbase with her work for maybe the first time ever

This is *exactly* the feeling I got too and I'm loving it! Like, good for her.
I'm 40 and I endorse this message 🫶
Could not have said it better! 30 is around the time I ran out of fucks to give re: other people's opinions. The lyrics, the chaos, the rollercoaster of emotions, the messiness (and feeling like I'm too old for this shit), and even just the overall sound could not have more perfectly captured what it feels like to be 30.

As much as I've been loving the nostalgia of the re-recordings and vault tracks and Midnights, I'm so grateful to get some new music that is relevant to my life right now.
The Florence + the Machine refeerences in Down Bad and Florida!!! 😛
100000%. Honestly it feels a little uncomfortable relating to this album because it’s so raw and I’ve been so good at bottling up all my past shit. I’m 32, married with an amazing child and have everything I’ve ever wanted. This album makes me feel all the pain I felt to get here. Sitting with it is cathartic but also vulnerable. That said, I fucking love my 30s
This is RED for 30-something-year-olds, says a 32 year old fan since debut
I liked Taylor, but being in Eastern Europe it was more of a I don't skip if she comes on shuffle type thing. Really got into her during the pandemic. 

Love the fact that our birthdays are just 4 days apart and though my journey is quite different to hers, I always relate to feeling things in a big way. 

With this album I feel like she let me read pages out of her intimate diaries and that makes me feel privileged and a keeper of her rosaries, her blues and secrets. 🤍🖤
This album(s) broke my heart a little. Finding out that her early Era’s tour wasn’t the happiest time in her life….she really faked it well for all of us

Damn. I guess you never really know
When I took a look at the track list and lyrics I initially was like this is too immature, I am going to turn 30 and probably I am not the target audience but then - 

1. I was literally down bad , crying at work ( instead of the gym ) over a guy I can’t have 😭
2. Unironically went but daddy I love him over the same guy ( in my mind not aloud ) 

.. I am looking forward to my 30s ( No I am not - to quote her again )
Totally agree with you! I feel this one DEEP.
1000 percent agree. This is album is raw, mature and really dives deep into how you interpret heartbreak and life in your 30s. LOVE this album. This won’t be a “Grammy” album but it will be healing for her and her fans dealing with similar situations.
I love hearing from all the Swfities in their 30s and beyond! I'm 32, and have been listening since debut (look at Taylor making me a mini poet :-)) but am so into this album. Especially the line in Florida!!! about half of your friends smelling like weed and half smelling like babies – that's SO 30s. (im in the first half haha)
I told my husband that it's clearly her "fuck it, if I am gonna get shit anyway, I might as well make exactly what I feel like." And I am here for no fucks Taylor.
I feel like Taylor needed to write this album for herself. It’s not perfectly curated like her other albums or super experimental. It feels like Taylor processing her emotions by writing diaristic songs which is something she’s always done best. It’s personal and cathartic.
[deleted]
As a late 20s girly this album is what I needed. I love how real she was in it. It’s extremely relatable. I cannot thank her enough for once again, putting all of my feelings and emotions into words that I can never seem to say!!
31 here and I think you hit the nail on the head! It really feels like Taylor made this album for once not giving a flying f what anyone thought or catering to anyone. And I adore it. It's similar to her mindset for Evermore I feel like (my other favorite album). It felt like Evermore was just this extra passion project that was more for her than anyone else. I adore when this side of Taylor comes out with all her imperfections and messiness and biting lyrics. This is her true artistry showing 
With this album she is not trying to be relatable. She is telling her story, a super famous woman having a breakdown and “maniac” episode. Being relatable is her brand so this may be a risk but I like that from her
Agreed. I’m turning 34 in June and it’s a MOOD.
It's about thinking you have your shit together in your 30's and realising you don't - especially if you haven't ticked off the conventional milestones expected from a 30+ woman however gargantuan your success is.




 So Taylor being this 34 year old who from the outside appears to have everything in the world and is powerful rich and influential beyond measure, actually revealing she is unhinged and messy, made some questionable choices and has all these dark thoughts - is well refreshing. Midnights also did this but then it cloaked it up in glitter and glam and tik tok friendly bops.
32 year old here and I agree
Lol the younger swifties can go then this album is insanely relatable as a 35 year old day one Swiftie. I’m not sure that it’s my favorite work but I do enjoy it more and more after every listen for sure. I also appreciate how unhinged it is. It’s real.
I agree and I have to say I'm so weirded out by all the comments here of "You're too old for this, Taylor!".

Since when a person at any age can't fall passionately in love, be heartbroken, experience emotional turmoil, existential crisis or mental health struggles? (mind you Van Gogh was 35 when he harmed his own ear)

I think Taylor is being uniquely raw in this album, knowing full well it won't be for everyone.
Hi fellow 30s Swifties 👋🏼
I feel so seen by this album. I can’t even talk about it yet. I will say it’s disappointing to see so many people rip on it, when this is a lived experience for so many 30s-something women.
[deleted]
I assume it’s different for everyone. I’m 30 and listening to this album made me so grateful I outgrew this stuff in my mid-twenties. 
This was my thought exactly 
I'm 31 and finally having songs that are more raw and direct is such a reward
This is definitely something from the last couple of years that she needed to get out and this is pretty much the only way she can. I see it as her personal journal of feelings, thoughts and experiences being put into music form. This album was more for herself, so she can release these things instead of holding them in. We just happen to be the recipients. 

She is in her 30s, so it makes sense that her recent experiences resonate with people in the same age bracket. That doesn't mean you have to be in that bracket for it to resonate.
As a 31 year old that has lived way too much life and still struggling most days.... I love every single song.
I am enjoying it more on my 3rd listen. I love that she doesn’t seem to give AF about who she pleases or not. Can’t wait for perimenopausal Taylor Swift to hit us with her genius in 15 years! 😂
I couldn’t agree more
The entire album feels so raw and open in a way she has never been. Reputation felt like a big f u to what had happened and wanted people to notice. This is truly I just don't give a fuck but also reflecting deeply about her past relationships that does come with experience.  I love that her music grows with her. Most music is made for early 20s, but this feels a lot like the stand-up special by Taylor Tomlinson. "Is this a permanent flaw or something I can fish out before winter comes?" Acknowledging your own self harm through toxic partners/not staying true to your values for the sake of a relationship, etc. I hope she continues to make music as she progresses deeper into life stages. I am so glad it's not super sad acoustic. "I can do it with a broken heart" feels so relatable. You can just mope when you have shit to do. It's fine when you're younger, but the older you get, everyone has their own shit and can't be listening to your sad sapping all the time. You gotta continue on, and you tend to be more resilient at least externally.
Turning 30 on the 30th and this is it..it's so good I can't 😭 she really spoke to me on this one
this album feel so honest and I love that
It’s very human album. It feels like she doesn’t restrict herself anymore and shows her truth colors. It’s raw and honest, it’s unhinged and dramatic, just very Taylor and I really love it.
I think this is not to cater anyone, it’s for her catharsis. The whole theme of this album seems to be coming from her depressed headspace. But that’s just how I’m reading into it.
It's interesting that you feel that way.  It still seems young and immature to me, but then I'm 50, not 30, so that makes sense.  It's awesome that it resonates with your generation that way, though.  I'm curious to know if younger generations feel that it's "old people" music the same way that I feel it's still immature (by immature, I mean that naive sense of "I've learned so much through my short life and my mistakes that I'm so much smarter now" that so many thirty-somethings tend to have, before realizing that they're still making mistakes and learning)
37, freshly divorced, and I feel this album in my booones
I agree. I have to say it’s not my favourite. There’s only a handful of songs I like a lot. But I feel so sorry for her listening to it. The issues she’s gone through are not really things younger people are likely to understand. I have been in a situation where I was engaged and ended the relationship - the loss of the person you thought you’d marry but also the loss of the settled future you thought you’d have is beyond traumatic. I’ve also had a years long on and off ‘obvious crush’ situ with a long term best friend, we tried dating and it crashed and burned horribly. Also traumatic. For me those things were years apart, but she had to deal with those two scenarios in quick succession…I’d be sectioned. The young people with no life experience calling her insane, psychotic etc haven’t got a fucking clue.
I just had this conversation with my best friend sitting in the backyard a moment ago. She's not being immature she's not being too in her feelings, she's being very raw and honest and it's so relatable. My 38th birthday is Sunday and this feels like an early birthday present lol
I have found this album is only “if you get it you get it”. Even some older people seem to think it’s a love song to MH and everyone who did the long term break and then spiral with some weird toxic person and/or used them as an escape from a long term relationship you were too afraid to leave is like “None of this is about MH he was just the vehicle”. It’s been wild reading both sides of the fence lol (I am the latter. God his name was Lehman and I don’t know the girl who decided THAT was a good idea even IS. Thank god she got into therapy)
I agree completely. I wasn’t always a solid Taylor swift fan but I have jumped back in and realized I missed so much. I found her recent break up and dating again in 30s relatable. Also broke up from a 8 year relationship and dating in 30s. 

Listened to the album all day. It’s definitely more older centered and relatable for us in her age group. It’s honest and clean.
My cousin told me all the kids in her youth group said this album was mid and I just laughed and said they don’t appreciate the lyrics because this is definitely a more “adult” album. I’m 32 and have been listening to Taylor since debut as well, the lyrics in this album are just hitting home so hard I’m loving it.
The album is brilliant!!! 
It’s the pain when you think you found the one!
One you may have children with.  
Then it’s gone!!  Real pain!!!!
💯 I was talking to a coworker today and we agreed—this is an ADULT album full-stop. Like even if people are saying Taylor is acting dramatic or not like a 34-year old…this album is OLDER. It’s not a teenage dream/teenage breakup…it’s for adults. 

ETA: I also think that she mentions how when she talks about her life it sounds like “teenage petulance” in down bad, but like…this is her life as a 30-something!! The album feels older and maybe a little less hopeful than her younger albums
Totally agree
I love this take. I would not have appreciated this album the way I do now ten years ago. It’s chaotic and unapologetic ❤️
I’m 43 (so old 👵🏻😂) and a lot of the songs on this album really resonated with me, I am loving it (some songs more than others of course) but there are some lines that are just gut punches 💔❤️
I may or may not have just stalked someone’s profile to figure out their age because their comments on one of the songs were just not making sense to me and yeah, they’re at university. I probably would’ve felt the same as them at 21/22 but I hardly remember what I was like at 22 at this stage so can’t really be sure. 🤣
very young compared to everyone here, i’m about to be a freshman in college, so i don’t fully get it. but that being said, there certainly were a few songs i could resonate with, and i just overall enjoyed the album. it was clear it’s what taylor needed to write. plus it’s a good listen, whether or not you want to listen mindlessly for the sounds or dissect the lyrics. i’m very happy with this album.
I’m a relatively newer fan, got into her music with Reputation and became obsessed with Folklore/Evermore. Those albums really helped me survive quarantine. I’m turning 31 in a couple of months, and this album is giving me those same vibes. I don’t have a lot of experience with heartbreak or love or whatever, but this album has spoken to parts of my soul that I forgot about. So many cathartic tears.
Like, I had an uneventful 20’s and have been in a very stable and healthy relationship since I was 22 (31 now) but even I feel connected, in a way, to it.

The 20’s were still messy and chaotic, even if my love life wasn’t. She resonates and also makes me feel feelings that I haven’t felt since high school— the intense highs and lows of crushes and emotions and then I feel the maturity of not giving a fuck. 

It’s a great, semi soothing album and I’m not even a super fan.
31 and Swiftie since debut and so many songs cut deep. I also felt the same listening to Kacey Musgraves’ Deeper Well when it came out last month. Sums up being in your 30s so well.
100%! I feel seen as a 30 year old who also has been with TS since debut. This is possibly my favorite album. 

Everyone is so busy dissecting whether a song is about Joe or Matty, or arguing about Jack vs. Andrew production, that they’re missing the point entirely. There are SO many different overarching themes happening besides it being a “breakup album”

And I’m not saying trying to figure out who a song is about or talking about the sound is inherently bad, but it just seems like they’re missing out on the opportunity to listen and experience / immerse themselves in the album fully
I'm 31. Only became a Swiftie in the past year, and relate so much to it
I'm a teen who understands Taylor's feelings because I'm neurodivergent.
I wish it wasn’t so slow. 😭
From a 41 soon-to-be 42 year old swifty, I have to say this is her truth laid down on wax. It’s as pivotal and monumental as the “check your head” album by three Jewish b boys from the Burroughs. I’m so proud of her for stepping out and doing something SO BRAVE! I am forever in love and can’t wait for the next album! Also, TK completes her, idc what anyone says.
I so agree. She's been charting the female experience since she started, and this is where she is (and some of us are.. though I'm a tad bit older...)!
Im so glad you posted this ♥️♥️ as a 30 year old fan I really related to the lyrics and they didn't feel dumbed down to cater to her younger fans.
100% - I’ve been a Day 1 Swiftie, we are the same age & I love growing up with her and hearing her words reflected for me at every album.
38 year old checking in. At 35, I left a very long term (14 years) relationship, fell into a short lived rebound that I wrote more than 80 poems about. 


Also, my friends in fact do smell like weed.
31 here, and coming out of a year long depression after my partner of six years cheated on me and left me. This album is everything I’ve felt. Angry, messy, depressed, hateful, still in love but in ruins. 

I think that younger fans are so used to the well-rehearsed, meticulously planned lyrics of her previous albums that make her seem like a calculating “mastermind,” but dislike this one because it’s more stream of consciousness. 

I wonder how many younger fans listening to this album know what it’s like to be settled down in your life, in a serious committed relationship in love and ready to have children and wake up to the same face every day, only to have that ripped away. I feel like they may understand this album more if they knew that feeling.
I am 31 and grew up with Taylor. I am absolutely in love this album so far compared to Midnights. The album is very intimate and a raw confessional her processing her relationships in her life. She is able to articulate so well the feeling of trying to fix a messy situations like navigating the loss of a long term relationship that you thought was going to be endgame and a situationship that you thought had unfulfilled potential.  This album couldn't have come at a better time at 2 months post break-up, it feels cathartic.
Alll my friends smell like weed and babies 
I said this exact thing to my friend last night!!! It’s so true!!! I’m just a couple years younger than her, but I have so loved that while listening to her through the years. The albums always relate to where I’m at in my life at that time too. She’s just amazing, ugh.
i cried while reading how y'all interpreted the album. this is what growing up feels i guess. absolutely love the album ☺️
This is exactly how I feel. That line from Florida about all my friends smelling like weed or young babies was like a wet fish to the face.
34 here.  Totally agree.  I LOVE this album. Her sound and the lyrics are so mature and well thought out.  
I turned 30 on release day and can’t get over the incredible timing.
I agree, as a 36 yo.
Wait until you reach your 70’s!
Oh yeah surely this is for a more mature mid-lifeish audience. 30s is the best way to put it. 

I am not there yet at 27 but I know I will appreciate it more when I am 35. There are a lot more experiences that I need to have before I get there.
You nailed it!! And honestly, that's why the album feels so much more vulnerable and raw because she truly did not give a flying fuck about watering things down or mincing her words for anyone.
35 and agreeing 🫶🏼
Also 32 year old listener since debut! I agree
I personally feel like there *are* a lot of spoon fed metaphors and not as much lyrically to dig through as folklore/evermore. but we are near the same age and i’ve loved growing up with her and having my experiences sung back to me over & over again.
I'm in my 30s and this album did not do it for me. If this is her true music style then I guess she isn't for me anymore. I'm glad everyone else seems to be enjoying it.
Yes! This is exactly how I feel as a 33 year old Swiftie who has grown up along with Taylor and her music ❤️
Totally agree! It’s grown up Taylor with a touch of millennial cringe. While many seem to hate the Charlie Puth lyric I kind of think of it like that’s her saying exactly how it was, no matter how cringe it sounds. She does not care, she has just reached that age.
Makes sense, the person who wrote it is in her 30's lol. Is this what the 30's is like? 
[deleted]
As a 17 year old fan, she is very mature in the album. Don’t know why younger fans are saying she isn’t. Her maturity is shining through in this album
This is really interesting…. I’m 30 in two months. And this is my least favorite album of hers. It feels disconnected. Trust me my mind is still plenty unhinged lol but to me she’s still in the mind of a high schooler. If we still have that mindset at 30something I think that’s an us problem 🤷🏻‍♀️
YESSSS so much this. As a 44yo who’s still seriously crushing on her husband, “So High School” resonated deeply with me, but so have so many of these songs! 

I happened upon a post in KUWTK today and they were straight trashing her song “thanK you aIMee” but I think it’s an interesting parallel to the bullying she’s talked about of her youth. I took it like “those times prepared me for this crap as an adult”. It’s actually really introspective and not as immature as some people (who probably haven’t even listened to it) are saying it is. 

It’s the kind of perspective you get with growth and unpacking all this baggage.

Edited to fix my age bc apparently I’m so old I now forget how old I am 🤣
Omg you took all the words right out of my brain. this IS the take.
> especially partial to folklore/evermore but has found something to love about pretty much all of the eras, TTPD feels like the best aspects of her last three albums in terms of the sound and songwriting, mixed with the very intimate emotional diary-like confessions of earlier works like Speak Now and Red, but with an added maturity and self-awareness that feels brand-new to her songs but deeply familiar to me in this stage of my life.

As a fellow thirty-eight year old who just finished her third listen, this has been my overall impression as well.
It also has SUCH a Patti Griffith in 1998 sound. 
Every single word you just wrote 💕
Absolutely!! also, "I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free"
I saw this line called out as cringe in a review and I was like... It's true though, as a woman in my 30s lol
That line just so perfectly encapsulates the experience of being a thirty-something Millennial.
Literally me at the moment. Asked my husband for a divorce on Saturday (the timing I know!) - but we’ve been together 10 years, and married 7. I’m turning 30 in August. Literally gave my youth for nothing.
“I’m down as crying in the gym”

Not crying with your girlfriends, not partying
Hell, I feel like that now at 23. Surprising amount of my peers are already married w kids , or have a kid on the way. Then the other half are stoner messes like me lmao
💯
Literally the split is unreal, half my friends are already having families whilst the other half still can’t let go of their early 20s and are still living bachelor/bachelorette lives.
Watching American Pie and “touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto” took me straight back to my late teens and early 20s in a way I didn’t expect from a Taylor Swift song…
that's because when you're in your teens and twenties you think entering your 30s magically turns you into this ultra mature person who doesn't feel things deeply or spiral into madness anymore lol
That’s because the youngins think 30 is essentially 75 lol until you go through it and realize no adult really has it all together ever. Even as a parent and a high responsibility role at work, I am always looking for the adult in the room and am routinely shocked when it’s always me lol
I noticed that with Evermore/Folklore, it was her starting that journey a lot of 30-something women take. It's when a lot of us really start to find ourselves. I actually became a true Swiftie because of how deeply I connected Evermore and Folklore. It felt like my life for once. While all her other work, whole fun, was nostalgic or a "yeah to be young" kind of thing. But my god, those albums gutted me. 

I was realizing how lost I had let myself become. The songs about relationships were tragically relatable. I mean, how could she not start doing that while in the process of the re-records? Bringing up everything from her past. Examining from a very different perspective. 

Since Midnights, I see her stepping more and more out of her superficial image. I honestly think she is preparing the fandom for a massive reveal or something that will alienate a large amount of them. Like becoming more politcal or not being as boppy or peppy or something. TTPD is getting a lot of hate, but it's my favorite album because it's not forced a "smile bitch". It's unhinged, manic, angry, standing up for herself, obsessive, sad and broken all in one. If that isn't your 30s, I don't know what is, haha.
I’m 41 & I think this album just made a Swiftie. Listening to these songs felt like reading a really good book & they’re all so cathartic.
How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room? - I think when you are younger you assume that in your 30s you will have grown out of these kind of over dramatic, self indulgent and ridiculous feelings but nope
As someone in their very early 30's... I agree. 

Reputation = welcome to late 20's

Tortured poets = welcome to early 30s

I didn't really like lover or midnights... in comparison this album is wowwwwwwww!
People think when you turn 30 you shrivel up and sink into the couch for the rest of your life. God forbid you experience heartbreak, have sex, have goals.
Yes! I’ve seen a lot about it being “immature” …I think it’s going over a lot of people’s heads. She  says on Down Bad  “everything comes out teenage petulance”
Yeah I don’t get it. Saw Some ppl saying it’s a teen album? Like huh lol, I think the complete opposite. I think her younger more impressionable fans will not relate to it.
Absolutely. The amount of younger fans that can’t comprehend how a short-term toxic fling could be more of a mindfuck and worthy of a larger ratio of songs than a long-term (overall healthy) relationship has been pretty amusing. I’m her age and I’ve never related to her more.
Yes! To me, this is her most mature album by far. I think a lot of the younger fans need a little more life experience to understand that.
Exactly. And by the time you get to your 30s, you have quite a bit of life experience and things to unpack.
I'm 23M, going 24 in a couple weeks' time. Personally I'm relating a lot to some of the songs on here with some rather unpleasant life experiences I've had in the last few months.

Unrequited love in I Hate It Here. (gosh I was never that starstruck with a crush and got let down so bad...not to mention she's a swiftie too)

Realising someone you liked isn't what you desired and you feel bad about it in Down Bad.

Struggling to make myself productive and staying professional when not in the right place of mind. I Can Do It With A Broken Heart.

This album very much feels like someone in their 30s (cue the fact Taylor is 34) relating these experiences to me. The themes resonate very well with the way I felt. It's hardly immature imo.
You know I think many ppl judging it as immature don’t take a close enough and honest look at their own inner workings and misjudge their own maturity. Especially taking into consideration the anthology that’s kind of the why to the main album
when the kids think adulthood turns you into a literal vulcan.
Huh that’s wild, which parts are people saying is immature?? I’m only halfway through the album but hearing her speak so candidly in The Prophecy and Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me has already got me 🥺
as someone in their late teens, i am the exception to this because my first impression of the album was that it was one of her most, if not her most mature so far
Younger fans have been saying she's cringe and immature for awhile and it drives me bonkers.
Delusional young fans. Ahh youth is wasted on the young 😂
This dead on. I’ve seen a few 20-25 year olds say that this is such an immature album. I think people are still under the illusion that 34 is old when it’s really not.
Couldn’t have said it better myself
I also think when you’re in your early 20’s everything seems so black and white, but in your 30’s you live within the gray. You stay in the relationship because you would be humiliated that the “counterfeit is dead.” And as a 30 something, I don’t judge it.
I genuinely want to know what they see as immature, because so much of it seems so mature and I have a hard time seeing it as a 38 year old.

Maybe the Kim beef revived out of left field, but most of it seemed like she was pouring her heart and soul out and describing some pretty complex feelings about a really chaotic time in her life.

If it's about wanting to be with Matty despite knowing his flaws, that's just the heart wanting what it wants (and rebounding hard after a long term relationship).  You can't magically control that at 35+ more than you could at 17.
Agreed! I think the younger gens feel as though it’s “immature”/“uncool” to let out your true feelings. They hide their inner child bc they are too busy trying to be “adults”. While older gens are too tired of hiding themselves as “adults” and have graduated to “zero fks given” 🥹 aaah life
I am in my late 40s and the whole time I'm listening I thought some of her younger fans are going to have a hard time relating to this record but as someone firmly in middle-age, ohhhh did some of this resonate hard. Especially the whole "self-destructive bad-decision rebound If-I-fix-him-it'll-fix-me" vibe. This is her most mature record yet and I think some people are being harsh because they've got her permanently pigeonholed as "music-4-teenz" and refuse to let her grow and make mistakes and grieve.
I’m 51 and haven’t listened/analyzed the entire thing yet.  I guess that’s because at 51, you know the album isn’t going anywhere; it will be there tomorrow and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, so there’s time. Yay 51. Now off to take my blood pressure medicine.
I feel like that might be because when you’re in your twenties you feel so mature and like you have everything figured out and have no fear, but then the thirties happen and it can be easy to feel along the way that you’re not getting anywhere, almost to the point of regression. You notice signs that you’re getting older but inside you might not feel you’ve “succeeded” at important things yet. 

I think Taylor seems to feel like this about her love relationships and getting married / having a family of her own, and it reflects in some of these songs. 

I agree older fans seem to be relating to this music more than younger ones.
Exactly! I’m 41 but feel like I’m 28. The venting that she’s doing on this album feels so real and I keep thinking that she’s got so much more to go through in her 30s. Wait until early stages of perimenopause starts kicking in and now you’re dealing with drama while hormones are outta whack. We will be here for her when she goes through the latter half of her 30s. I’m here for the mid-life glow ups and crisis. All of it.
That is an interesting perspective to me as well! I’m very close to turning 34 as well (few more weeks!) and I honestly related really well to both TTPD and midnights in a lot of ways. That and I so don’t feel like I have it all together at all, but also give wayyyyy fewer fucks than I ever did in my 20s.
I'm 16 and can clearly can could see how even tho there is emotional extremity expressed on the album, it's actually one of her most if not the most mature and sophisticated of her albums.
Young people lack perspective in general (by definition)

ETA: they literally have so much less experience than her! The nerve to say she’s immature ! lol… like she says… “you don’t get to tell me.” 


I remember being among a bunch of 19 yo a month before my 31st bday. When I said I was turning 31 soon they said “you don’t look 30!!” To which I said, I don’t think you’ve been around many 30 year olds.
From what I've heard so far she sounds mature to me! I guess I might count as an older fan (I think I'm right in the middle though) at 23, but I've been listening to her since i was 6. She sounds mature to me, like yes, she could've experienced this at 20 as well, but I don't think she could've articulated the feelings the same way. Like just compare it directly to Red or 1989. This SOUNDS like a more mature take on things. Like it was also a much more mature relationship that she's talking about CLEARLY. I haven't finished the album yet (I know, burn me at the stake but I'm busy) but just hearing So Long, London would prove maturity to me.
They'll find out eventually...
Wait people think she’s being IMmature? This is like, *mature* mature. 23y/o, big fan of album here.
Exactly. 


What's so weird for me, are the folks who say she's petty and should grow up and then talk about the maturity of someone like stevie nicks. Who literally sang killed Lindsay Buckingham in a 1997 live reunion performance. They'd been apart 20 years at that time, and she'd made a whole career about the trauma of dating him. 

It's a chronicle of a woman who gave her youth to a depressed person with no future ambitions other than to serve themselves. And that could apply to ANY of the relationships she's had.
Someone in another thread said this album feels like it is made for tiktok girlies?? I don’t even know what that means. This is made for the 30 somethings
44 year old here. In my early 30’s I had a six year relationship that was the great loss of my life, and knew before I listened to I had to be prepared for the lost love nostalgia. When I heard  “I’m pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free.” I felt it so deep in my soul. I almost cried. 

I saw someone critiquing the lyrics “I lived everyday like it was my birthday.”  He didn’t get it. Gave a sour face and was like “what is this. It’s horrible.” Well he hasn’t been there, because if he had, he would get it right away. My point to this is, these songs require some life experience that younger people just don’t have yet. And I really appreciate Taylor saying the things we all wish we could have said, and secretly hoping those exes hear it and get a little twinge of “That was me.”
Same here. It feels almost cathartic.
Exactly. You’re not magically some super evolved, perfect and matured person when you reach 30. You still have human experiences, you’re still trying to figure yourself and what you want out of life out. I’m so tired of the “I can’t believe she’s 34 still singing about relationships or *insert normal thing here*!”  

I love that Taylor acknowledges the messiness, the confusion, the heartbreak, but also the jubilation, love, and freedom of this experience. She didn’t care about appeasing anyone - just her thoughts and feelings, with no worries about shiny veneer or being palatable to the critics.
FUCK YES. Im also 36. My mid 30s have been about learning how to clean up after myself.
I also feel like in your 30s you realize you don’t have to be quiet and move on so your pettiness turns up a lot and you just own your feelings out loud. I’ve been singing ‘I cry a lot but i am so productive, it’s an art’ to my husband since last night.
YES. THIS. At 34, I’m old enough to have accepted the less pretty parts of my personality, but that has only come from living my life loudly and messily.
Absolute same… you explained it so perfectly. This album is so cathartic for all these reasons. And it’s also comforting in a way to know so many others are going through these things too because sometimes I feel alone with my feelings. Many times I’ve wondered if anyone is having the same experiences as me at our age or if I’m behind. But I feel like in my mid thirties I’m finally learning how to live, be healthy and hold myself accountable. I know I am still a mess but learning slowly how to be better
It perfectly expresses the overcorrection, IMO. You were one person in one place for so long that all of the sudden the world is open up to you and you run as fast as possible in the other direction. Most of the time, it's the wrong way and you have to find a path back to the middle.
This album is the story of a long term breakup, toxic short-term rebound fling, and then coming to terms with it, processing it, and moving on.
as a fellow mid-30s woman, i am kind of laughing/loving how women in their 30s to 40s seem to be responding so differently from... everyone else. when i listened to this album, i was like honestly, this is the most relatable she's been to me. i know that part of taylor's appeal was supposed to be her relatability, but from the beginning, i never found her *that* relatable -- don't get me wrong, she is definitely great at expressing and putting words to certain feelings that i could relate to, but i have such a different personality to hers that it was about a 50-50 split for me.

in some ways, this album is the same... i am very different from her. BUT i think this is the first time she's really captured the energy of what it feels like to be a woman in her mid-30s -- the type of resentment you have, accepting that you are kind of a mess, just being over a lot of things... she's always been diaristic but with a varnish; this is diaristic in a much more straightforward way. i actually think the lyrics that people are pointing to as "cringey" speak to this -- it's unfiltered word vomit. ironically, i think it's a lot less cringey than some of her earlier work! 

i honestly think this is something olivia rodrigo does really well for her age group (and why she's another artist who a lot of millennial women seem to be drawn to as they reflect back on their late teens/early 20s) -- she is so good at capturing and expressing the feeling of what it's like to be a woman of a certain age.
I must know if It's Time To Go is a fave of yours? I relate to what you said about staying in a job too long
I’m 35. I’m a long time Swiftie and I’ve never related to her music more than this album with the exception of the time I heard It’s Time to Go for the first time fifteen years into a relationship that was draining my soul and finally got the push I needed to leave. In the last two years, I got that divorce, quit the job that was slowly killing me, impulse moved to another state, lost my mom, made questionable choices on Tinder, and fell in love. It’s been a chaotic and unsettled time during the years that I expected to be stable and have my shit together. I’ve felt unhinged yet so productive. I’m healing. This album feels so real to me.
Me too. I was 11 when debut came out. I grew up with her; her music has always aligned with my life.🫶🏼
Absolutely 100% agree!
Yes this! I feel really fortunate that I got to experience her music this way. It’s just been special having every album perfectly align with that phase of life I was in.

I love this album. And I’m excited to see how her music continues to evolve and mature as she gets older, for however long she keeps releasing new music…
Honestly this! Someone asked me "why would she release a 31 song album??" Because of the fans. The fans will listen to it all lol
It's giving Lana Del Rey's Venice Beach, in defiance of the record label wanting her to give a faster summer song.
29 here too and i could've screamed these at 20/21. Of course she makes this album now that I'm in a happy, healthy, relationship lol love that for her though
Exactly what I thought. 21 year old me would have felt so seen with these lyrics, screaming them flying down the highway after a shitty breakup. 
32 year old me still feels seen with these lyrics, despite being married with a kid now
That is something I really appreciate about this album. Some of these songs I relate to relationships that happened in my early 20s but in a way where I’m looking back on them through my 31 year old lens. This album would not have made sense to me back then no matter how deep I thought I was.
yup - my catastrophic breakup was at 22, but now at 28 I feel like I can see who I was in these songs
I’m 28 and love this(these?) album(s) way more than Lover and Midnight! 🥹
Prophecy hurts me way way too much because despite what my therapist says, I can't help but feel as if I am prophesied to be unloved, unchosen, no matter how much I beg the world to make it different.
You hit the nail on the head with Prophecy. There’s something within yearning for a different legacy 
also for people who criticize songs like ATW or this album because they're about short relationships... ironically, these are the situations that often pull out the most intense emotions. in a long-term relationship, usually there will be those honeymoon highs in the beginning that will mellow out (or slowly fizzle out to death). in emotionally charged flings, you hit all those highs and then get rollercoaster-dropped. death by a thousand cuts over the course of years vs. a dagger to the heart.
Face it, she had a lot longer time to get used to the idea of leaving in the 6 year relationship and she was the one that chose it so she could process it smoother. 

The rebound ghosted her after a whirlwind romance where he promised her the moon and the stars and then just dipped with no word and no closure at all. That's way harsher than an amicable breakup with a 6 year relationship just because you gave him enough time to step up to the plate and he had cold feet commitment issues and it seems like major depressive disorder if i interpreted her lyrics right.   


Coast into a wall in your big safe reliable SUV and hit it going about 20mph... 

Now get in a ferrari and floor it to 90 before you hit the wall. 

Which impact is going to be more damaging?
Also with a 6 year that runs out of steam, you're just tired in the end and over it. With a shorter more volatile fling you have so many questions and part of the rub is you feel a little like hope is lost. Theyre too young to know what its like to feel like a door (marriage and kids) is maybe permanently closing.
Yes yes. I’m 26, had a situationship with someone for 3 months only and broke up during the same time as taylor. I had so much self loathing and thought there was something wrong with me for not getting over it as easily. My emotions were so intense. The breakup was so sudden and traumatizing, and the person I dated was also an addict so I relate a lot to this album.
This whole thread, and especially this comment, needs to be copied and pasted onto every "what is this album she's losing it" thread in this sub. The life experience she has now, as a woman in her mid-thirties, her younger fans in their teens and mid-twenties can't even comprehend what it feels like.
PREACH. All the feelings you described are compounded by the unique angst that comes from dating in your 30s when everyone else around you is married. You emerge from your 3 month situationship and hardly any of your friends, except maybe the other singles, can empathize with the weird feelings that result. It's bewildering and lonely as fuck.
>Oh 100% she made this for the mature adult fans and not a care in the world what the critics or the so called “fans” that say it all sounds the same. Or it’s nothing new. It can’t be played on the radio or whatever bullshit thing you can think of

she's mentioned before that she aware that EVERYTHING she does is polarizing - if you're going to upset people no matter what you might as well just do whatever makes you happy. this is a lesson you learn after your 20s!
YES!!! I’ve been telling people ALL day, it’s not a radio album, it’s a “lay on my bed and journal out my feelings” album.
>I got down voted in another sub by just saying that.

It was r/PopHeads, wasn't it? They have been particularly harsh on this album. When I saw all the negative comments, I was like: "Well, if PopHeads hates it, I'll probably love it", because the exact same thing happened with Midnights. 

I read all the comments the night Midnights came out and thought "oh, this album is gonna suck, isn't it", then I listened to it and while it took a couple listens to grow on me, I was like "maybe not her best, but this is perfectly fine". 

But that sub has had a particular hate boner for Jack Antonoff ever since he produced Lorde's poorly received album Solar Power a few years ago, so I think the hate is mostly coming from that.
💯💯 You said it perfectly! 

>Oh 100% she made this for the mature adult fans and not a care in the world what the critics or the so called “fans” that say it all sounds the same. Or it’s nothing new. It can’t be played on the radio or whatever bullshit thing you can think of. 

This is the exact vibe I got too and I love it!
I feel this too. After several listen I'm like, this album is great and I can feel the "masterpiece" vibes from it, but I haven't had any song stuck in my head or had any clear favorite, unlike when Midnights came out. Even compared to folklore and evermore this album is different. I also agree that people will be disappointed by this album, maybe even the most "hardcore" swiftie will find it difficult to listen to it too.

Lyric videos are definitely coming though, some canvases on Spotify have lyrics in it and they do look like their taken from lyric videos.
I teach middle school and my students know I’m a Swiftie. Several of them asked if I’d listened to it and shared their favorite songs. I’m so glad they like it but I did wonder as I listened today if they would relate to the album’s mature side. I’m 31 and some of these songs cut deep!
“work and make bad decisions” YES! haha. 
this. exactly.
totally. and I can't imagine how all of that is complicated by massive fame.
“I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling thirty two!”
For the record, I'm 54
I was just thinking, this is exactly the album I needed in my mid 20s. Worth the wait though.
im 23 and complete same!! i adore it, and even not having much relationship experience i can relate to the emotional highs and lows throughout
Lol absolutely. I don't know how I stayed for 3 years.
Mine lasted 2 months and literally the day after I was like "Damn, that was crazy, glad I go that out of my system." XD

I definitely feel like this one was for us, LOL.
>An instant favourite for me.

Same, I feel like I've already developed such a bond with this album and it hasn't even been 24 hours yet
And you may find lyrics in there that don't even resonate for a past or current lover, but do for some family members.  I did.  I love you but you're ruining my life hit me that way.  Actually most of Fortnight did.  Art is subjective and it's okay to feel something different than maybe you were meant to.  Or maybe you were meant to feel whatever it makes you feel, and the artist would love that for you and for their art.
> And if you disagree, maybe you’re just 23 and will understand it better in 10 years and that’s okay 😆 Go listen to Red for now.

This reminds me of when I turned 22 and I talked with my best friend about how we were really happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.

She really paints a picture that you understand as you turn the same age. Then you attach your own life to it and it becomes this symbiosis of your memories.

I love that about Taylor's music
>I'm so grateful to get some new music that is relevant to my life right now.

exactly how I feel. so grateful and feeling very raw after listening tbh.
I actually think performing for her fans was probably something that took her out of her hard times in the early part of the tour. She’d been waiting to perform so many of these songs and I bet having the chance to finally do it on such a grand scale was cathartic and maybe served as a distracting saving grace during the rough periods!
That being said, it is still very cool to be able to relate to some of the songs even though this album isn't written for my age anymore. Her art transcends gen gaps
Big fandoms problems
Yeah, I’m 37 and I feel the same way. It isn’t hitting the same way for me and that’s fine.
Same.
Truly the whole song is about being cringe and looking back and just being like....yep, that happened. Like they thought they were Dylan and Patty Smith but they were idiots!! It's extremely self aware.
If you want to tear my world apart. Just say you always wondered.
I'm 38 and I agree with you. I got divorced in my early 30s, so I relate to the pain of losing a long term relationship, but this album needed way more editing.
I gave my ex-husband 10 years, married for 5 (22-32).. for nothing. Oh, what person could I've been if I hadn't settled for him. It's an album for us, all around Taylor's age.
This lyric really hit me hard at 34. Spent 6 years of my 20s in a similar relationship. 
Gave up 15 years for him. Now I’m 36. This album hit hard.
When I heard that "for free", I feel like that line asks the most questions...  engages the listening in discussion more than anything else on the album...

what is the "cost" of a 6 year relationship that starts in the late 20's to early 30's for a woman?

We don't want to think of relationships as stark exchanges, like a purchase...  and yet, you are exchanging years of your life for??? 

What does anyone "want" from any given relationship?

And she uses "give" because she was a willing partner, and yet...
Those two lines are such personal attacks
Omg this line is SOOO relatable it hit deep lol
This was the first lyric on the new album (first of many!) that made me cry- I spent years in a relationship like this. It’s wild because I was just having a deep convo with a friend yesterday about how it hurts to feel like I gave him so much of my youth. I was floored when I heard her sing those words 🖤 I just love this album so much
That line makes me think of the pandemic, tbh. I’m 30. Covid stole the last couple years of my 20s
I’m 30 and divorced from a relationship that was through college and married for 6 years after college. Yup. This line is perfect.
Nah. You know what's sad? That nobody 'let' us give it for free, we decided to give it away, it's our doing.
That line hit hard. Spent my 20s and early 30s with someone who didn't deserve me.  And now I'm 43 and in an amazing relationship, but that youth was wasted and I regret not getting to spend it with my true love.

Yes, this album was very relatable 😅
There are a lot of lines worth calling out as cringe, but the review was totally wrong on that one
not for nothing. you’ll find out what it was for and what you learned from him. 29 *is* young. you’ve got a lot of life to live and good for you for starting over now, instead of in 10 more years.
You're still so young
Literally your 30s are some of your best years and now you are free to fully enjoy them
Women who didn’t finish college have a median age of first birth around 21-22.  Women who did earn a bachelors have a median of 26-32. I think if you broke it down further you’d see PhDs, professional degrees, etc sitting around 30-34 and 4 year degrees around 26-29. 

I had baby fever in grad school when my high school friends were all having their families.
depends on where you live probably, I’m 25 year old southern gal and that weed/babies line gagged me.
Yeah, I don't know exactly where it comes from, but when you're growing up you sort of expect there'll come a day when you magically turn into this Mature Person who's basically unrecognizable to you and who really has her shit together. I'm 26 now and I'm slowly discovering that maturing is actually leaning even more into exactly who you are but giving less and less of a fuck about what anybody thinks about it lol
The secret of adulthood that no one tells the youth is that you’re truly an adult once you realize we ALL have no fucking clue what we are doing. Everyone has that moment where they are looking for the more adultier adult in the room because surely I’m not adult enough to handle this?! Surely?! Surely there’s someone else I can call that can tell me what to do…
My highest highs and my lowest lows have all been in my 30's, and the person I started this decade at wouldn't recognize the person I'll end as... your 30's are the most life changing time.
You’re also just so unaware of your own immaturity in your teens and early 20s. I was genuinely a very grown up late teens/early 20s and I still look back like “eeeeesh baby girl you know like 1/4th of what you think you know 😬”. It’s a very self righteous stage of development. Something to be said for the fact that the adult escape fantasy was the guy she was seeing at that age.
Yeah, when you’re young, you think you’ll be magically different in your 30s and 40s. You get there…. and you’re still you.
30s allow you to step back and watch yourself spiral into madness and then intellectualize it.
Yeah seriously, I’ve also noticed it’s the younger fans who think she shouldn’t be singing pop / “glitter pen” songs anymore now that she’s in her 30s while those of us who are actually in our 30s enjoy them. Guess we’re all real immature lol.
I never knew less about the world and in many ways myself until my thirties 😂 that’s why I love the line in cardigan “cause I knew everything when I was young”
I’m in my 50’s and still waiting for the ultra maturity to kick in
I think when you're younger you also see the world in black and white FAR more than your thirties, when it's much more gray.  

I had far different opinions on many topics when I was in my twenties b/c i was more naive than I am now, at 38.
Exactly this! They seem to think feeling deeply and expressing it is immaturity.

I made the biggest mistakes in my late 30s because I not only didn't care about other people's opinions but I became nihilistic about life.  But when I was a teenager I was convinced that I'd have everything figured out by the time I was 30yo.  Even when you think you've figured it out, give it a year or 2...because you'll want something different and will have to decide if you maintain status quo or blow things up.
That’s a bingo.
i was thinking about this yesterday and i realised, i don't *want* her to become \~mature\~ because, well, that would be kind of boring lol. i don't want to listen to 31 songs about like, marriage and babies and taxes, i want the drama and heartbreak and the mental illness and all the other things i can relate to as one of the few unmarried 33 year olds in my peer group!
yep. i think in reality it's realising you don't become more "put together", you just accept yourself more that you don't view your mistakes and things with as much negative weight, just things that happen in the randomness of life
Very well put. I remember thinking, when I was 25, I always thought by 33, 34 or so, I’d be settled. Everything in place, very much rooted in who I am, over all of the dumb shit.

But the dumb shit evolves with you. We don’t stop being 19, we just have greater faculties and competencies to deal with greater problems, but those faculties are imperfect. If anything, our capacity for things like jealousy, pettiness, grudge holding, comparisons, etc also increases.
Very true. Honestly I feel like when I hit my late 30s my mind flipped a switch that started compelling me to reflect on everything in my life, and man did that make me feel like I was spiralling for a while. 

There’s a lot of chaos that comes with each “stage” of aging and I don’t think that’ll ever end until it ENDS. The definite upside is with each jump in stage you become a little more comfortable being who you’ve always been 🙂‍↔️
At 37… my 30s seem to have been more of a decent into madness 🫠
honestly i’m a mature student in university and the closer i get to 30 my younger classmates treat me like i have 1 foot in the grave so i don’t trust their judgment lol
Once when I was in high school, I asked my mom if you ever feel grown up, and she said told me that you never really completely stop feeling like you’re a teenager. I was not thrilled with that answer 🥲
40+ here. Turning thirthy does nothing. Age is just a number.
Sometimes I'm at the playground with my kid and some other kids ask me for something and I'm like...why on earth would you think I know what to do
Hey, I’m 75 and you ain’t seen nothing yet. Love Taylor Swift and her music. Love TTPD. Love your life, it’s the only one you’ll get.
This is exactly how I feel about it. Since folklore I think she has become more and more comfortable being more honest and raw and writing what she needs to write, not what the radio or a specific set of fans want to hear. This album feels so distinctly like Taylor the person, not the brand, with very little references to her typical narratives and celebrity image. It’s about how she feels about this machine she’s created from the inside.
I think you hit the nail on the head with evermore/folklore. I just turned 30 in September and really gave those a listen around that time and although I’ve always liked her that’s when I really became a swiftie. I’m only halfway through listening to tTPD (thanks a lot work) but I already resonate with it so much.
I just was telling someone how I didn’t like Folklore at first. I had to reach an age where it could really hit me the right way and, once that happened, it became my favorite album. I get shades of the same draw from Folklore in TTPD. Idk it’s so romantic, sensitive, and helps me forgive myself. Can’t help but to love it and the emotional release
Your 40’s are THE BEST! Enjoy them!!!
YES SAME! 43 and I was a fan after folklore, but this has made me a devotee. I’m obsessed. Never listened to an entire album 4 times through since I was a teenager.
41 here too and this is her first album I could relate to out of her whole discography. I wouldn't call myself a Swiftie but I can say I've learned more about her since last night than I ever cared to know about her in my entire life lol.
And what's worse, you have to go from crying in your room right to a business meeting, or into mom mode to pick up your kids at school, or to worrying about your retirement account. It's fucked up!
Taylor is 4 months older than me. People can talk trash all they want about her, but I felt like I grew up alongside with her... especially having those same type of awful relationships around the same time. Taylor will always be important to me, and I'll forever defend her.
And all the while having to show up daily for the ever increasing list of responsibilities!
I turned 30 last may and met the love of my life in June. I feel like my life is just beginning-- it's wild that young people think your life practically ends at 30! When you reach 30 you realize just how young 30 actually is. There's so much life ahead still!! And I actually know myself better now and am more comfortable with myself than I ever have been. 30 is awesome! 


Signed,


30 and flirty and thriving 🥰
Not me reading this comment in my 30th year while sunken into the couch 💀
Lmao
By like the fifth song I laughed and was like “this is for us and she DGAF”

I’m on vacation so haven’t dived in too far but I’ve seen a few reactions and I’m like - yeah you don’t get it
I think that’s just it. She has finally outgrown the teen fandom she cultivated 18 years ago and is now making music for women in their late 20s and 30s. She is no longer the girl singing Fifteen or Red. She has moved into these long form songs with wordy lyrics that aren’t everyone’s cup of tea.
I'm 39.  20 years ago, I was with someone for six weeks, and then we went back and forth for several several years, on and off and tried to be friends, were enemies, hurt each other, tried to fix each other, went to therapy together before he up and ghosted after two years of accountability and checking in every day.  I do not know if he is alive or dead.

That whole experience unequivocally fucked me up and this is the album that makes me think of him.
This. I cried more over my situationship than breaking up with my children’s father after 9 years. You tend to mourn while still in the long term relationship..
100% 
The relationships that have mess me up the most in life have been short term, intense, toxic relationships. I am 37, married and happy with my husband (been together 10 years, married 8) and have a daughter. I still deeply related to this album. 
I love my husband deeply but I could write way more intense songs about those toxic exes than I could about him.
I’m 32 and felt the same. I don’t think many people who haven’t been in and out of various relationships understand the absolute hold a super strong, intoxicating few month fling can hold over you. It leaves such a hole of emotion and “what could have been” romanticizing.
Yup 😅 aaaaaah good times ahahahahaha
For sure I’m 25 but I’ve kinda been through a lot and so I LOVED this album. It’s very real.  Some of the anxiety stream of consciousness in the lyrics are exactly what I felt when I had my mental break after my dad died.  People won’t truly get it until they’ve been through a life experience like that and that’s ok! But calling it immature is a whack take.
I think it's some of the casual critics, not the fans necessarily, who need more life experience.

I don't think it's her "best" album, but I agree it's her most "I don't care what you think, this is what is in my head" album...  and that's mostly maturity.
My sister is 36 and a mother of 3. Her oldest daughter is 16 and a HUGE Swiftie, she was so stoked for the album release. My sister listened to it and now she's angry lol. I don't think she's very happy that this album is about to be on non stop repeat in my niece's car for a while.

That being said, she totally misinterpreted the But Daddy I love him lyrics. She thought it was literally teaching kids to say "F you parents!" She didn't wanna hear my perception of the meanings of the different lyrics. I think she thinks Taylor is trying to make her daughter rebel now lol. 3 weeks ago she was listening to Taylor on repeat herself \*chuckles\*.

Our parenting styles are VERY different. I let my son listen to whatever he wants and he listens to some pretty wild stuff and I just guide him so he doesn't make the same terrible life choices I've made - he's gonna make some dumb choices too I'm sure, just hopefully not nearly as bad as mine. He's way more mature than I was at his age and already he's kept his "innocence" longer than I did. I was a very rebellious teenager punk. He already corrects my behaviors to more mature responses when we're discussing events that occur between me and say some random Karen.
I'm so sorry about your crush. That being said, however, I definitely feel like I can relate to this album as someone who's experienced unrequited love growing up. Upon entering college, I can't get over the last guy I went on a date with and I remembered literally sobbing because I felt so alone that all my friends had boyfriends and I haven't even had my first kiss nearing 20. This album really saved me when I needed it the most. I can definitely relate to Taylor's emotional peaks from when she goes from calm to screaming; its a reflection of how I feel.
I can't recount any comments word for word ofc, but the gist is that your 30s is too old to fall this hard for a "bad boy" douchebag and write all these songs about him and act defensive about it... Not saying that I agree just that I've seen this take online!
Teenagers love making fun of millennials these days. It’s whole thing on TikTok…
I’m a millennial and I teach high school, they think we’re all cringe. Little do they know that I think that THEY are the cringy ones 😆
When you're young, all you want to be is more mature and grown up...  you have an immature view of what maturity means...

that said, Smallest Man That Ever Lived is pretty juvenile thinking. But I don't doubt that it's honest to her experience, and a large part of maturity is not caring when other people judge you for your genuine emotions...  so ya know...  

she's also aggressively earnest, and I think the younger generation expects sarcasm and irony from just about anything.
Agreed! And I’ve seen a ton of discourse still on the Matty issues (and I get that he’s said many, MANY harmful things - I don’t want to dismiss that) but like… that’s the point. The album explores the “I actually don’t give a fuck” space you move into as you age, *especially* in your thirties (goddamn, it hit HARD in my 30’s). And it’s less about idgaf about him being terrible, but more about not giving a fuck if people see your flaws or the “ugly” parts of yourself. Being brave enough to not only explore the complexities that come with life’s nuance, but also being brave enough to reveal your true, complex, vastly flawed self to the world. 

It’s been really clear to me that the “fans” who are so bothered by this album/her Matty phase are also really young and haven’t yet learned to truly embrace the contradictions and flaws that come with being human and that even Taylor Swift (the human) has them.

Edit: some clarity
"I'm so depressed I act like every day is my birthday" is such a real line. Miserable but productive. Just come for my throat, Swift.
Yes! The birthday line was so true my stomach turned. The most unhinged-mad-happy I acted was my very last  vacation with my ex. For 10 whole days I was sending pictures to every soul I knew, shouting from the rooftops how much fun we're having, showing the beautiful places we were visiting, while in reality I had known that this will be our last ever trip together, because I just can't take it anymore after 9 years. 
These songs just cut to the bone.
Omg yes. That line gave me chills (and I was running while listening!) it reminded me of my marriage from 19-30.
Agreed! 39 here and the album is exactly the vibe I was hoping for. Definitely get that it's not for everyone, but that bittersweet, introspective tone is totally relatable to me. I feel like I've done so much unpacking over the past decade (much of it coming as a result of finally getting therapy and starting meditating). Can't really explain why this album connects with me so much but it's really cool to hear it resonated with so many other 30-somethings too.
I dint understand what they want from her, does she need to start singing about filing taxes or watching Grey's Anatomy reruns? 

Sorry, no, I know what they want from her. They want her to stop making *any music at all*, because she's "too old".
You also stop holding back from saying things out of a fear it will push him away or he’ll think of you negatively. You’re over making yourself smaller to appeal to him. So you say everything you want to say because it helps YOU heal.
💜 you're not alone bb. I think this is what the 30s ARE: the wisdom of hindsight, the maturity of accountability, and the tentative steps of hope and progress. It's hard work but we're worth every ounce of effort.
Omg yes. That is exactly why this album speaks so well to the experience of leaving a high-demand religion, too. Once you’re free, you wildly overcorrect with all the things that were “bad” or “sinful” before you finally figure out what a comfortable middle ground is.
Yeah I feel like I’m on the BRIM (VPR reference) of a life overcorrection and this album really spoke to me. I also dated an “edgy” loser for so long so that part also resonated lol
Yep. I got divorced when I was 31, and we'd been together since I was 19. I went so off the rails in the six months after the split it wasn't even funny, because it was that feeling of "I'm free, I can do what I want!" Like all of the steam I should have been blowing off in my 20s if I'd been single had to be released somehow. I'm doing well now and much more centred, but that line really brought all those feelings back.
Yes!! All the people mad that "this is a Matty album" have never been through this cycle. It isn't a Matty album - its an album detailing TAYLOR'S journey through it, which includes a Matty chapter. But even in the Matty songs, they are in the context of Joe and her grief over that relationship ending.
Yeah for sure. My point is that it doesn't have to be a long term breakup and a fling. In our 30s and 40s we can all find something we were in long term--jobs, friendships, etc that were not horrible in an obvious way but in a soul sucking way and you knew you needed a change and you let it get to a fever pitch and then just explode with a terrible decision (a rebound, a very bizarre chasing of a teenage career dream, or manically 'friend dating' a ton of other moms and latching on to the first one who seems to even mildly recreate the magic and trust you had with your previous bff).
same!! I'm bad with years and dates so sometimes I literally think about my life in terms of when an album came out. like "Oh i remember when _____ happened because it was during rep"
Same. 34 here, so about 4 months younger than Taylor. We’ve grown up with her and it’s so cathartic to hear these truths about our lives said out loud.
Flying down the highway is so real for 21
My last destruction was about that long ago too. It's kind of a sweet torture to hear it healed and have the feelings put into words for your past self. I don't Need to cry because I'm healed but I want to cry for that girl I was.
Oh yeah. I’m in my 40s. And a lot of youngins have a ton to learn still. 

The biggest take away from this album is really I’m going through it but let me live and fuck up on my own terms. Then, look back in regret later. She’s not a child anymore. She doesn’t have to answer to anybody anymore.
There’s a significant sea change that has occurred in the last 10-15 years with the rise of everyone having internet and social media. It used to be that the only people who had opinions on your life were in your school, your job, your family, your friends.

Now it’s everyone on earth who has a connection. And with that, a weird rise in entitled busybody behavior. Trying to control total strangers like they’re marionettes, only allowed to do and say what agrees with any particular fan or viewer. I don’t know if it’s an increasing behavior thing or a lack of healthy relationships IRL, but I can’t imagine feeling “unsafe” because a celebrity I like chooses to date an ill behaved dingus. 
Yeah. Even though the radio is playing it all day today but it’s going to be gone after at the very latest Sun and leave fortnight as the single.
Well the album is quite long and it’s brand new it’s going to take a little bit to learn lyrics and such. 

The only lyrics I have in my head is Lights. Camera. Bitch. Smile
I often end up making my own "versions" of the albums (not just hers but in general) because I often prefer the songs in a different order. But it also helps in processing them, especially with a whole bunch of brand new stuff.
Right? Like it is messy enough working through it on my own, if I had to do it while being so public (and having it all have been so public), well, I'd be writing some pretty messy songs too.
Taylor 2012: I'm young and dumb

Me: lmao girl same

Taylor 2024: nvm I'm not young anymore I'm just dumb

Me: lmao girl same
I wrote my own lyrics to turning 42 a couple years ago 🤣
This is why I can’t wait to dance to 22 at the Eras tour in June with no sense of shame whatsoever even though I can’t dance - but with all the confidence that I have at 34 that I certainly didn’t have when 22 came out!!!
I am the same age as you and feel the exact same way about it.
Stayed because I was scared of being alone in my late twenties and not married like my friends. I feel her pain so much
Same. I catch myself wanting to sing the words out loud, but I haven't yet memorized them so I can't😅
I'm so attached to this album that I'm taking criticism of it personally like I wrote it 😭 my son keeps asking why I'm crying, sweetie mommy is going THRU it okay 😭
It's my favorite album, and I didn't think anything would ever take that title from evermore.
You know what though, he's got your past frozen behind glass, but you've got you. Nothing stopping you for being that person now! Sending love.
Not for nothing. Nothing you do in your life is ever for nothing. It gave you experience, it gave you YOU. You might have ended up a different version of yourself but there’s no better version of you than you are now 🤍
Yep, I've spent almost 9. On that note, I felt every single second of The Prophecy hit so close to the heart it's crazy.
It is literally so daunting to date in your 30s after a long relationship bcus of the many preconceived misogynistic ideas we have about how we need to be married off by the time we're thirty and we're now "left on the shelf". I fully get where she's coming from with that.
Sameeeee. Met my ex a month after my 22nd birthday, broke up a week before my 28th. Just POOF all my twenties gone like that for a man that was never in love with me but too afraid to be alone. Sigh. Thank you Taylor lol
Same! With an older partner. This lyric hit hard.
Sameeee
Oof. Hit me hard, too; but at 38 with 18 years of my youth stolen from me.
Yep. I’m 35, but was in a relationship/married to someone from 19 to 28 and that line hit me so hard
Just got out of a 12 year marriage at age 34

Ow
I hope this album feels cathartic and healing for you. 🫶
I’m currently on year 20, trying to find the courage and wisdom to know if I should go
omg yes. My coworker and I always say we feel sometimes like we’re frozen at 25, the age we were when the pandemic hit, too old now to still live like we’re 25 but without enough late-20s experience to have turned us into almost-30 year olds successfully
"I get older but never any wiser."
No "lol", that's it, you've figured it out at 26, fucking revel it in! 

 From a 39 year old- Welcome!  Congrats and best wishes...
This is exactly it. With each decade that goes by, it gets worse and better in different ways. I personally love being in my early 40s because I’m exactly who I was in my 20s but more confident, make more money, and really stopped giving any fucks about what people think. It’s freeing. Downside is everything starts to physically hurt more. 😆
Yup. It is nice not giving a fuck about what people think. Rather freeing I think.
And hiding the crazy (that we all have) in many situations. We’re all immature and have no idea what we’re doing beneath the surface.
As an almost 42 year old, well done on getting this lesson at 26. Word of warning though: you’re still going to fuck up. A lot. You’ll think you know yourself and then you’ll get into a situation and realize, “fuck, I have no idea what to do, think, feel.” And, you’ll make a decisive you later regret. Don’t judge yourself. It’s a good thing. If you have it all figured out in your 20s, the next three-fourths of your life will be real fucking boring. Enjoy the ride. It only gets more interesting with more perspective and experience 🖤🩶🤍
I'm 27 now and asked my parents recently (both are 60) what age they feel because I don't feel 27, and both of them said they feel like they stopped aging in their 20s, and they're shocked when they look in the mirror. They still hold onto those feelings and we carry our childhoods with us our whole lives. You never magically mature, you just learn more. It's still you, from the day you're born to the day you die.
I’m 33 and just now figuring this out too! 

I may be cringe to some people, but oh well. That’s their issue to deal with.
It doesn’t change when you’re 36 (me!). You still are trying to figure things out, you still feel things deeply, but you know that these heartbreaks won’t kill you, you know that your life will continue, and you know that the only person living your life is you. That’s what this album feels like.
Welp you've cracked the code well ahead of schedule lol. 

That is so it. Don't automatically mature. Don't automatically get wiser. Mostly you just stop focusing much energy on what other people think. 

Life starts boiling down to things more simple like "I'm happy so who cares what they think?". 

Precisely why as a 42 year old Kiwi male that most people would describe as pretty burly and gruff I was hella hype to listed to the new album yesterday lol and why I'm looking forward to some time to do so again over the weekend :P
My 5 year old idolizes us. Kids need to know that a competent adult is in charge. But they want to be in charge too. Then one day, maybe when you move out or lose a parent or have a baby, you look around and you’re the most competent adult. Parenting is all about going on that journey with your child. 

I lost my mom at 28 and became a mom at 30, so my 30s have been all kinds of adulty. I love that TS’s music has grown up too.
I just turned 25 and can confirm this is it. I’m not even like an “old” 25, like my birthday was last week, I just feel this very much and have for a bit now.
I seamlessly went from my 20's into my 30's without a beat thinking I had to grow up and feel mature etc. i started not giving a fuck how people saw me as a person.  I believe by that time you are who you are basically. You don't like me fuck off who cares. Lol
I’m 41 and still don’t feel like an adult. I’m still a mess. I have no career. And don’t know where my current relationship is going. So this album is probably the best thing to happen to me.
I really stopped giving af early in life and in retrospect maybe that's why I was called an "old soul" so often lol. 
If there’s one verse from this album I think everyone needs to really hear, I think it’s this 

"I’ll tell you something right now, I’d rather burn my life down than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning, I’ll tell you something about my good name, It’s mine alone to disgrace, I don’t care to all these vipers dressed in pale dress groaning.”

Taylor is a 34 year old woman, she’s achieved more than she ever thought possible, and I think she’s truly so over doing what others want her to
>  I'm 26 now and I'm slowly discovering that maturing is actually leaning even more into exactly who you are but giving less and less of a fuck about what anybody thinks about it lol

Fair but don't forget about personal growth and self-awareness...  if you're just an asshole leaning more into it isn't the best plan.   Maybe that wisdom comes in your 40s and y'all will see it eventually.

All I know as an actual old person (60+) is that the work of maturing never ends and 'leaning even more into exactly who you are' is often a recipe for heartbreak and disaster if it doesn't come with introspection and a desire to be better
This just hit me face first with the weight of the universe
Congrats. You’re pretty much an honorary 30 year old 4 years early (in like, a good way, not an old way or whatever)

- signed, a 30 year old that also thought 30 was when you became a ✨real adult✨ only to find that you just kinda become yourself, but *more*.
So true. I’ll be 37 in June and half the time I still feel time I’m 17. I’m raising two kids and I’m like “Who then hell let me be an adult?!”
Oh my god all of this. I remember when I had my first job in mental health and I realized "oh my god I'm in charge of THIS? who let ME be in charge of THIS?" In my 30s and making a career pivot and I still feel like I dont know anything. And I don't.
My friends and I are all mid-30’s and had this exact realization over the holidays when we were talking about imposter syndrome at our jobs and realized that basically the global economy is being held up by 30 and 40 something’s that have no idea what the fuck we’re doing, being bossed around or ignored by 50-70 year olds that dgaf or are doing things incorrectly, and pretending to the 20 something’s like we know what’s going on.
I tell this to all my students and mentees. The truth is we are all faking it and everything is made up. There’s freedom in this.
>The secret of adulthood that no one tells the youth is that you’re truly an adult once you realize we ALL have no fucking clue what we are doing.

This is spot on. I'm 31 now but I had this exact realisation around the time I was turning 30. When I had this thought I felt almost, tricked? Like I wish that someone had told me that everyone is winging it. But in a way it also helped me begin to trust my own judgement more and see that I am doing fine, even though I still feel like a child playing dress up.
Right 😂 I still have to call my mom for shit I KNOW but I need that reassurance because, well, she’s the real adult here and I just have to make sure 😩😂
I'm about to turn 40 in a week and preach!! My 30s have held so many highs and lows, more than any other time. And I've come out of it just not giving a crap what anyone thinks anymore.
At 35, I'm feeling this so much. My 30s have also been where I've started to feel real loss (all of my grandparents, my heart dog is turning 12 and will probably pass away before I get to 40, my girl rotting companion cat is 20, my parents are about to be in their sixties) and where my depression got so bad I both contemplated k\*lling myself AND finally sought out help, but it's also the time where I'm doing solo traveling both in and out of the country by myself, it's where I've found hobbies that I love and enjoy, and where I've finally embraced my sexuality and the fact that I'm perfectly okay never having a real relationship and being a nerd and figuring out that I love the life I've made for myself.

30s are so effing life changing.
I thought I was soooo mature at 20… i definitely wasn’t haha. I just acted like I was, took stuff too seriously and cared too much about things I’ve realised don’t actually matter in the grand scheme of life. 30 year old me is NOT mature and I don’t pretend to me anymore. Life’s too short to not have a little fun whenever you can.
34 year old checking in! I’ve been reading the ✨discourse✨ today and rolling my eyes. They will all get to their 30s and realise that absolutely nothing changes and life simply continues.
i’m in my early 20s but my sister is in her 30s and yeah, we both still feel like we need to figure sooooo many things out while not knowing anything about anything

only difference is she’s had experience in handling those difficulties while i haven’t. but we’re able to bond over those moments

idk why people hate her glitter gel pens so much… those also have their own lessons and emotions
i think women artists (women in general too) feel immense pressure to delete certain parts of themselves because they're ""too old for that"" when in reality, women can be anything and don't have to change just because we age like human beings.
I'm 41 and prefer the dark, raw, deep stuff. Has more depth and I relate better than to the pop glitter pens stuff.
34 here and I’m just glad to have a traveling companion in Ms Swift (who I often refer to her completely unironically as T-Swift in my head). I’m here for what beautiful and/or catchy music our girl puts into the ether. And that it’s all hers now.

Will it ever come? 😭
47 and am regularly surprised when I realize I’m the adult people around me are looking at to fix the problems. 😳
I always used to think that getting old was getting more mature but now I’ve realized it’s more: “I’m too tired to fight about half the things other people would consider immature most days.”
46 and same
Omg! Me too. I still hear myself ask,”When will I learn?!?” Really thought by now I’d have it all figured out.
Not messier, just more self-aware.
My 80 yo mom lives in assisted living - even the 100+ year olds act like it's still high school.
Even at 40, you are not an adult. At least I am not and I just turned 43. 🙈
I didn't like folklore much at first either until I realized she called it folklore for a reason -she was able to craft legitimately good storytelling through two albums in particular that didn't come across as autobiographical (to me) as they usually are. I think that's why it threw me off initially. I've come to love it though, especially after seeing folklore/evermore songs in Eras Tour on Disney. 

I loved what I've heard of Poets thus far (will be buying it twice because Anthology is completely new stuff -yes I know the main album is on there too :). The thing with music is that so many people just go with their initial reactions to songs instead of giving them time to sink in and really listening to what she's talking about in the lyrics. To me, \*that's\* the point when things click and you're like, "OMG this is good," ya know?
60s are even better if you've still got your health. Which, of course is the rub.
This comment needs more upvotes. YES. This.
You can do it with a broken heart!
I see so many moms relating to ICDOWABH, because when you have you really do have to handle your shit and fake it, especially with small children.
I took  a break from responsibilities today to listen to this album and it somehow made me more stressed 😂😂😂
This! 😅 and usually it’s the rebounds get ya
A three month relationship in my late twenties royally fucked me up. It took years to start rebuilding. In my mid thirties now, still single, but finally in a place where I’m happy with who/where I am.

Wow similar story here. Im 29, was with someone for 5 weeks. We had been in and out of each other’s lives for 2 years prior to that. First met in lisbon, spent Christmas in germany, nye in lake como, summer in barcelona, different years, different seasons, different versions of ourselves. He’s stationed in Italy, I live in Brazil. 
He even bought us tickets to see the eras tour in Milan this summer, but we’re done for good this time so I won’t be going. 

Worked through SO.MUCH.CRAP together, (alcoholism, long distance, family issues, you name it). 
He ghosted after our last big fight, but I turned him into a swiftie and I know for a fact I crossed his mind today.
100%. I didn’t need therapy for my own “Joe” 8 year relationship and eventual breakup — but I did for a “Matty” of just a couple months. 

Good point about the mourning, too. *You’re Losing Me* comes to mind — she had time to process losing Joe and there was at least a sense of having at least some control. With Matty, it seems more like an outright betrayal and that is a whole different pain that brings it’s own rage.
I Can Do It With a Broken Heart reminded me of just living in the year/18 months after my dad died. The expectations to be fine when I was breaking every single fucking day. 
I'm sorry you lost your dad.

I'm quite a bit older that you, but also remember how hard it was to lose a parent, and how much that experience has impacted me, even years later. I agree that there is so much to this album that resonates when you've had more life experiences, and that \*everyone\* experiences heartbreak, anger, confusion and pain. I don't need to know "who the song is about" to have the feelings totally resonate within my own life.
Too real. If anything, that experience has helped me push towards greater self-love. It was painful but I feel like I've learnt a lot more about myself and if the opportunity comes, it comes :) 

I definitely empathise with you on the loneliness seeing your friends happily attached and it's awful. For me, I just tell myself to not forget to give myself some good loving and boosting my self-esteem by being good at the things I like to do. I started building my self-worth that way, may it work out for you too. 

Just keep moving! If anything, Taylor's a budget therapy option\~
That might be the problem for many - they're far too focused on analysing Taylor's personal life through the songs instead of just, like, *listening to it*, you know?
I think they were probably wanting something more like Kacey Musgraves new album, but that's just not where Taylor is at. Kacey is obviously feeling more settled and peaceful, Taylor is on this massive Eras tour, having lots of tumult in her life with the end of a long-term relationship and all the Matty stuff. Honestly I would say I relate more to Kacey's self-care and settledness but I can see the maturity in the lyrics in Taylor's album and wouldn't call it immature. I also think they forget she's still playing with the Five Stages of Grief in her lyrics and denial and bargaining are a thing. There's the person Taylor and then there's the songwriter Taylor Swift, she's always playing with literary devices and exaggerating for dramatic effect in her work. You can't read it like a diary word-for-word even though the writing feels diaristic.
LOL...these people haven't lived.  You can fall just as hard and wildly in your 50's and beyond and that is a good thing!
And sometimes things are more black and white when young and we grow older and realize the world is shades of gray.
She has satirical/ironic lines too, but your average popheads/fauxmoi whatever user will take them as earnest to paint her in a bad light
Proud of you for walking away when it wasn’t healthy for you anymore. That takes so much more strength than staying because you’re scared to be alone. You got this 🤍
Ooooh, it felt like reading my own diary. 

Sending hugs to you
I told my now husband - who held my hand through my divorce - "Ohhh this is her divorce album! She's even got the 'what the fuck was i thinking' section and EVERYTHING." XD
u/DoorInTheAir honestly the way you wrote this was so poetic I had to stop, save, and comment. You nailed this.  We always want to label the albums after the boys the songs are about... but truly its always been about Taylor and how she processes.  It's amazingly honest and raw and incredible that SO MANY people can relate to what she says.  Thank you for this comment truly, it helped remind me of the perspective I should be seeking in all of this <3
Omg so so so much this!!!! Like replace matty with any tries-to-be-edgy semi-love bombing guy and it’s the same lol, the matty songs are really just about being w someone who makes you feel something and promises what your long term partner never could, and the juxtaposition of those experiences making the new relationship feel so so much more intense!
SAME 😂😂
"One thing about my good name is that it's mine and mine alone to disgrace"
Sometimes it’s just about making it.
This one really is for the evermore girlies isn't it.
Twin soul ✌️🫶 same
This literally made me choke up
I spent over a decade on and off with my HS sweetheart and omg loml got me baaad. This whole album did. But it’s wild cause I’m in the healthiest, happiest, and EASIEST relationship of my entire life with an amazing boyfriend who I do plan to marry. He is mature, kind, funny, loves me for me and deals with all my crazy… Started dating him at 29 and thought he wasn’t the one cause it was too easy. I craved drama and chaos. I still have to be careful to not self sabotage cause this man is the best person I’ve ever known and I have never loved someone so much. 

I think it’s a good sign that I can’t relate most of these songs to my current bf. And healing to hear these lyrics for those awful exes
It really is. And you don't fully understand it the same was as when you're in your 20s either.
Yes! Exactly this. Dreading getting back into it.
If you’re contemplating leaving, it’s probably what’s best for you
‘Old enough to know better, too young to care’ lol.
I \*think\* it was Einstein that says every failure is one step closer to success and one more thing you learned that didn't work. She gained a little wisdom with each experience, she just hasn't felt more wise yet. It'll come.
That's reassuring to hear!! This realization def hasn't fully set in yet though, half the time I'm like "surely I should be more mature by now" and the other half the time I'm like "shut up you're literally 26" haha
This is beautiful, I loved this interaction. 🫶🥹
Yeah, no “lol”. You said what you said! I gotta work on that too and I’m 35.
I figured this out when I was 15, needless to say, I wasn't very popular. But also, I didn't care. Still don't.
Haha, wait til you get to your 60s like me.  You will really see what not giving a shit is like.
[deleted]
I just turned 45 and honestly felt like my "grow up button" is broken.  I don't feel any difference between being 45 and when I was in my 20s. The only thing that's different is looking back at my 19 year old self dating a 31 year old man makes me sick. I can see how he took advantage of me, but I did get my beautiful daughter out of it, so it wasn't a total loss. It just changed my future. Looking at my 19 year old self, I'd love to scream that I didn't need to feel the shame I felt at church and 6mo pregnant & single because nobody there was judging me but me. I rushed and married a stranger, but that gave me more beautiful children, but ended in divorce because of abuse. He was 10 years older than me.  So if anything all age brings is not caring what others think and self reflection of past mistakes. It's refreshing to see that it is normal to not have that magic grow up button that we all believe we have for some reason. Plus, my babies are all grown now, so it's me time. I still look like I'm in my early 30s and "get away" with dressing how I want, listening to what I want without much pushback. 
I swear I'm going to be 70, 80 or even 90 and still dressing in cute clothes that won't be considered age appropriate by the youngins lol 
I can't tell you how happy I am that Taylor brought pleated skirts back. Those have been my favorite since clueless years.  You know who's telling me to dress my age or wear my hair my age? Flipping men! 🤣🤦‍♀️
I love this bc at 39, I still care tooooo much what people think and it’s driving me crazy. Especially hitting menopause at 38. It’s like, I’m aging and aging and losing my mind and I love telling people about my life and how crazy I am. Makes me feel like they’re laughing with me instead of at me.
Right?! How am I supposed to keep these children alive and mother them when I still want to call MY mother?!
I'm 38 and just had that thought as I put my baby to bed last night. How have I successfully become a mother of 2, with both sleeping happy and fed all tucked into bed? How did I pull this off? (Both bedtime and life in general.) Not a young mom by any means but still feel like an imposter lol
I’m 53. Have four teenagers. I’ve lived and worked in three different continents. I have dogs and cats. I have a career. I’m on boards. My husband travels abroad for work often and at night when I get into bed I always think, shite, I’m the adult here, I’m the one in charge if anything happens! I still cannot fathom how I can be that responsible grown up?! Blows my mind daily!
It really is unfair.

I have to figure out dinner every night, can’t my child do it at least once?!?

Stupid adult bull.
I’m 42 and my oldest turned 19 today. I took him for his first tattoo and thought “how is this even possible, I’m barely old enough to get tattooed”.
🤣💀 I’m 42 and still feel like this at times. But the zero fks era is priceless 
That said… lord I hope TS eventually realizes that having someone on the back burner is a flag that screams “your not as down for the one next to you as you think” & rebounds 99% of the time never end well. 🫠 yall have noticed she has a habit of this right..? John for Taylor, Tom for Calvin, Joe for Tom, Matty for Joe come to mind but quick but likely there’s more
I’m a teacher and once a student fell off a climbing frame and very clearly broke their arm. I ran over to them but was looking around for an adultier adult, then I realized that adultier adult was supposed to be me. It felt surreal. “You mean I’VE got to deal with this very serious situation?!” lol
God. I'm a flight attendant. I started flying at 21, I'm now 30 years old.  I'll never forget the first time I stood in the aisle for the safety demo and thought how on earth ?????? am I in charge of all of these peoples safety right now ?????
Welcome to your best decade to come! Honestly, I’ve loved my 40s. I also love saying I’m in my 5th decade of life. I’ve seen shit. I’ve lived shit. I still have an entire life ahead of me and I’ve had an entire lifetime behind me. I still have so much to learn and I also have things I can teach. It’s a wonderful place
I have until mid June in my 30s and honestly, can't wait to turn 40.
But with more arthritis, pain, and bills (and often now you don’t have as many alive family members to help if the bills truly go to shit and your back is against the wall so all that is truly on you now).
I turned 30 a few weeks ago, and I had been dreading it because society told me to 😂 but over the last two years or so I’ve really started not giving a shit what people think, have done more things that scare me than I have ever before in my life, been more vulnerable with people and made some incredible friendships because I wasn’t worried whether they would like me or not. 

Am I still overly emotional, dramatic and sensitive and often spiral into madness? ✨ you betcha ✨
I’ll update if it ever does 😂
I think for me getting older has given me perspective (more ways of looking at things), and it for sure makes me care less what people think of me… but I still “feel” young in my brain. I’m not a different person in my 50’s than I was in my late 20’s, 30’s, 40’s; just older. With more money. Lol
maybe it's actually 50, 50 is when I figure out life right? _right?_
I’m almost there too. I think the decades that start with even numbers are better for me, so ages that start with 6 are something to look forward to
It does. I've cried after the gym after a rebound following a divorce. I've balled before meetings with executives in my bed because I work from home now. I've wiped tears from an office bathroom. You don't grow out of it, you have to grow into it
100% checks out.
Good for you for doing the work!  I'm married with kids, but I don't consider being single as needing a qualifier!  Plenty of married people aren't happy, so you're one up on them 😂
Or it's the whole same kind of pain that you had and hurts you from the long term relationship. But now you have *two* comparisons, only time as the difference. 

Like Taylor said, from the oven enter the microwave. They both cooked her in a bad way with the same result no matter how long it was. I think being with Matty just reinforces all her pains and bad perceptions more instead soothing them and it gives her hopeless impressions that *men and love* are all like this. It just hurts you *more* now when you're practically still broken (not healed yet). And the bluish scars are now bleeding again. That's why i think the muses are kinda blended in the entire album, even when it was a specific situation/reference.
I’m sorry you lost your dad but also SAME.  I lost my dad in 2020 to cancer and I literally had a mental break (it was really bad health anxiety) I went inpatient.  It’s crazy that even after a few months I was supposed to act normal again
Wow crazy to see how many ppl relate to this as I also lost my dad and have been in this phase of manic depression reaction after his death. This album spoke to me in so many ways
Sameeee. I remember just bawling in my car on the way to work for months after my dad passed. Then wiping my tears and going in and putting on a good show for everyone around me.
I lost my beloved father in law two weeks ago and this is my life right now. When I tell you how I wept at that song last night; which was so odd out of all the choice Taylor gave us to weep to!
i have been listening to that song on repeat. i am just coming out of a broken and numb couple of years. We lost a lot of loved ones in a very short time. After about a month everyone just expects you to go back to normal and not have it impact you constantly. The line about pretending it’s her birthday hit especially hard.
(Almost) flair twin just checking in to say I love this comment and you got this 💜
I think a huge part of the reason is that people don't like Matty Healy, which is literally it. If it was about someone else they'd feel differently.
They give her too much credit and not enough, all at the same time, it's funny.

Earlier they were complaining that her music is for 14yos...  then complaining that she was presumptuous for saying "bring a dictionary" to listen to the new album, because it was insulting that she thought they didn't know what precocious and soliloquy meant

I wanted to be like -"Well if her music is for 14yos, give them another month to finish their Shakespeare unit in English class, they DON'T know what soliloquy means yet!"

But whatever.
Aw, thank you! Must have been inspired by The Chairman:)
This song is one of my favorites on the album, and I have mixed feelings about the message. It absolutely is her name and her choice, and at the same time there’s a lot of resentment toward people who it seems could see what she couldn’t at the time. Fans who said it wasn’t right before are thrilled for her now with Travis, and I think it came more from love and wanting the best for her. I don’t think anyone wanted her life in (did she say graige? Beige/gray in one?)

That said, I didn’t follow that relationship at all and just catching up through articles now, so grains of salt.
Same 🥹
Garfunkel and Oates had a song called “29/30” that I think you’d like.
I'm 37 and I thought by this age I'd be a fully grown adult with a fully adult brain, is somehow think differently and have my shit together but I'm more of a mess now than I was at 18, 23 or 25. I think about my parents at my age and how I thought they could solve any problem, I was perfectly safe in their hands but now I realise they were just like me. I have a totally different perspective on some of the mistakes they both made and forgive them for it. We're all flawed humans, no matter what age we are.
I’m 56, still the same person I was at 26.   Just care about others opinions less, just more wrinkles, more grey hair and aches and pains.   Use sunscreen on your face !!!!
You're literally 26!  Enjoy the chaos, be as "you" as you're comfortable being...  your comfort will only grow with time.
I turned 40 today... And I still think I should be more mature.  I don't even feel like a grown up most of the time. It's crazy. Lol 
We're all out here faking it. 😂
Oh, I'm going through menopause too. It's not made me lash out in anger but boy has it turned me into a crybaby. I use to never cry and now everything makes me cry. I also cared way too much what others thought of me and I started asking myself who am I living for? People in my life who doesn't pay my bills, feed me or sleep with me? Stranger's on the internet who literally have zero power over my life? When I started asking myself those questions that's when I gave up caring about what other thought and started discovering who I was, what I liked, started speaking my mind even if others don't agree with me. I am a very loving person. I decided that I wasn't going to dislike anyone based on their opinions, race, gender, how they identify, who they love, their political beliefs, religious beliefs, at the end of the day they have the right to believe and speak on whatever they want just like I do and if I want my opinions at least respected than I had to give that to others as well, even when I didn't agree with them. The only things on that list I just put that I judged was religious and political beliefs. The rest I never cared about. 
I promise you that you're going to reach the freedom of not caring anymore. When you finally do, my God is it the best feeling. 🤍
I felt like the 30s are for having lots of questions about life and the 40s for discovering the bittersweet answers to those questions.
Almost 60 here and still wondering how anyone thinks I'm the adultiest adult in the room. 

Regarding the album, I think I need to listen to it a few more times with the lyrics in front of me, but first impressions are favorable. It's relatable and real and I agree with the folks saying the younger crowd just hasn't lived it yet to 'get' it. And that's OK. Folklore is still my favourite though ❤️
We will figure it out when we get there. 💀
And put the crying wherever it fits. My personal favorite is in the car on the way to pick up kids. 😘
Shoutout to the divorced Swifties. This album may also be for you!
Same girl. I lost a parent VERY suddenly (thx covid) two years ago on top of some other big life adjustments and...well, "stable" was not a word I'd use to describe my life after that. 
This album hit me so hard last night. 
Right back at you almost flair twin 👊
But that's exactly the parasocial aspect talking.

Like, it shouldn't be so important to know which particular person or relationship a song is about because you should instead relate to it (or not) through your own personal life first and foremost.
I wonder if these same fans hate songs like All Too Well and Would've Could've Should've for being about not too great men.
I was just thinking that a few songs have a 1989 vault vibe and that people would be loving them if they thought they were about Harry. I personally don’t think that the songs are all specifically about Matt, however it’s interesting to see the reactions.
I love Garfunkel and Oates!
We’re all just doing life for the VERY FIRST TIME! Also 37 and needed to learn this..
SAME. I don’t have kids and every time I think about having kids, the thought of being a teen Mom scares me. Then I remember I am 37!
Mid thirties was my messiest time period, I literally lost my mind and had to be hospitalized. Lost EVERYTHING because I was trying so very hard to maintain control while everything was spiraling. If I could have just loosened the reigns and "let go and let god" as they say, I probably could have recovered without losing it all. But it was my lesson and I'm hopefully a more evolved soul because of it. I had to do a lot of healing after that. I wish you peace and prosperity on your journey!
37 here too, I can’t believe I’m being trusted by society to raise two children. I am a child myself still, right? Right?
That’s so spot on, everyone is just trying their best I think but inside are like what the hell is going on. It’s comforting in a way, it’s just an illusion.
I just turned 30 and had a kind of messed up childhood but so did my mom. Getting older and better understanding why she is the way she is has been fascinating but aad.
And neck/chest!!!! And hands!!! And everywhere! And start taking collagen and calcium! 😆
[deleted]
Also 56yo here. I find that I’m still completely me, but I have finally learned to care a lot less about unwanted opinions and jerks. I still care and notice, but only the deep serious things cut deeply. Otherwise, I give a 50’s shrug and move on.  My great aunt is not many years from 100. She says her 60’s and 70’s were her favorite decades. The best is yet to come for us Gen X…
also 56. These are the years of "I have no fucks left to give" and it feels great.
I am 56 as well and remember my 30s too well. It was messy!
👏
Hi! Fellow 56 year old and yeah it took years but I'm comfortable with who and what I am. Don't care what others think and I wear my gray hair proudly! 🤍🖤
this! I was saying the exact same thing to my BFF at breakfast this morning.
Agree!!! from a 48 yr old that just blinked and she was 26 what felt like yesterday! The bad in you goes away or gets stronger. The good in you gets better. And you dont give a sh*t if anyone doesnt like you or is disappointed you are not living up to the standards they have for you(hehem, parents).And more confident than any other time before…It’s very freeing, but also crazy how time went so fast!!
That’s a perfect way of putting it.
Sending you love and hugs 🤍 it’s tough that’s for sure
I totally agree!
Exactly this! As a 38 yr old, I completely feel this. My husband and I sometimes will joke after the kids go to bed about how the hell we’ve been allowed to be parents. Half the time I’m like “where is the adult??”
[deleted]
Me too :). 39 here. I’m scared to death to have kids and won’t be able to now because I’m taking life day by day and trying still to figure out adulthood. I’ll be 40 in July and trapped in an 18 year old mind. I’m just as confused then as now.
I needed to read this today so much. I'm literally on the verge of a nervous breakdown and feel like I'm gonna end up hospitalised soon. I've just been diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia and they've had me on all sorts of medication that's messed my mental health up, keep having to go through withdrawal from one as I go onto another has been hell, aswell as being taken off my benzo script at the worst time. I was self medicating out of desperation for a while til I got diagnosed. I still don't know what's caused it til my MRI, and even then I don't know if it'll show anything. I hope it's only temporary and I haven't lost my mind forever because right now I'm totally not myself and can barely hold a conversation. I'm a paranoid wreck.
Right. I can't believe my kids don't think I'm cool af, coz I am. I'm still very young 😭 I suppose I'll have to wait til they're about 30 which is when I realised my parents were actually really cool compared to other people's. My dad is 68 and still has his own style. I used to be embarrassed by it but now I'm proud he never tried to be like everyone else and I inherited his love for music. A different type of music, he's into blues and I'm a Swiftie but we both play guitar.
hands! My hands look 75.
Omg yes the hands! Mine look like they’re leading me to the grave already 😅 wear your SPF and driving gloves, kids!
Oh the hands! My spotted hands agree, though I am not even sure age spots can be prevented by sunscreen 😩
Taking ownership of ourselves! 🙌
YES! I recently asked my mom when I will feel like an adult. I’m 35 with two kids aged 10 and 8 and I definitely don’t feel as old as I thought I would. My mom is only 19 years older than me so I very easily remember her being 35. She said she’s now almost 55 and she feels like a kid still sometimes 🤣
The Tortured Mid-30s Department. ♥️
Same! Oh well. We’ll forever be able to have consistent sleep 😂
That!!!! I still can’t get consistent sleep bc of the neighbors dogs and my partner but I will forever relish in the fact that I’m not in mental health facility because of worry about my children in this world. That gives me peace!

The story of adidon made drake go silent because pusha told everyone about his son and that was mean and savage, i think this has to be the end of it, because if drake does have a daughter and kdot just personally talked to her through this song and even plugged his album in it, man i feel bad for drake because theres nothing he can say now
We are so blessed right now
Unbelievable I'm in shock right now kendrick with the back to back then drake with the immediate response and its straight fire and thirty minutes later kendrick responds right back and it's incredibly good and savage
He cooked him
Very fast response. Thank You BasedGod
I feel like I'm living in a parallel universe right now.
It’s over for “the boy”.

He got played so hard. Kendrick dropped earlier today, forcing Drake to release a track that Kendrick already had a kill shot for.
Responding that quickly with a savage diss track is basically a TKO.  Kendrick didn't just win the round he just knocked Drakes teeth in.  Now Drake is gonna have to ask the rap gods for a rematch.
Does anyone know what the pill bottles are?
jesus im stressed imagine how drake feel lol
This has to be a top 10 diss of all time. This was such a hard listen. He absolutely murdered Drake on this track.
Kendrick is gonna force Drake into hiding on Diddy Island
Holy shit this is just disrespectful 
Whoever loses this is going to jail goddamn
Almost feel sorry for Drake on this one😭
Drake actually needs to just follow in Michael’s steps and become a POP artist 💀💀
Drake dropped 1 hr ago - 150k views
Kendrick dropped 30 min ago - 1M views 

Kdot killin this dude.
Drake is done
Yo they dropping left and right, we eatin’ today my brothas!!!!
Well... Drake just got killed.
It’s over. It’s done. Drake has to go into hiding. This is it. Head shot, dead.
omfg
Yikes 😂
Holy shit. I got shown the Kendrick video first before the drake response. I was a minute in before I saw that this was IN RESPONSE TO DRAKES NEW DISS. 

Is this the WW3 of rap at this point bc Kendrick surely launched some bombs at with this.
I heard Euphoria was 19 minutes long and he’s just dropping in parts
Kdot dropping a master opus
Beef not fun anymore. I need to go to sleep.

Kendrick is the goat
“You lied about them others kids that’s out there hoping that you’ll come” If these allegations are true then Drake’s cooked 😨
What’s the new term replacing Ether’d? Dotted?
This is getting good! Reviving hip hop
How am I supposed to play this song at the club?
Should have featured Pusha T
All the allegations aside, this really highlighted how different they are. Dot sounds like he really just hates Drake and coming at his head and Drake seems like he’s having fun with it. You can vibe to Drake’s but Kendrick’s is thought provoking.
WHAT
Okay this got out of hand real quick
It's early but... Hear me out tho... Tell me this not 2nd to Story of Addidon tho....
This Pusha T levels of disrespect. He was sparing him sooook many times and he took the bait and now..... Fuck.

I'm sorry but this one of the best disses so far and I STILL think this ain't even Kendricks most devastating blow
Kendrick proved there is a mole and says their is pedos in his camp now?? He has Aubrey's fuckin prescription. He came with the fuckin receipts. We said not to mess with Dot. Drake is over. Fuck that sucks I am gonna miss listening to his music.
![gif](giphy|H22hyf0K1Bsc)
The seething at the end of this track you could feel it

It's no knockout either way to me, but I just can't see Drake getting angry enough to want to keep upping it - and they might just start rehashing 

So I say decision win to K at this point
3 tracks in like 4 days is absolutely diabolical.
No one gonna mention how drake got sex offenders on payroll? Made it sound like it was kids too
RIP Drake.
Its brutal to. Drake should really stop. He is clearly the lesser of the two in terms of skill level for something like this.
Drake got too much skeletons in his closet, idk why the boy even want beef when he knows he ain’t live a righteous life
Family Matters was good. But man, Drake is dead.
He bodied that boy, its over
I love Kendrick, but is this too far? At a certain point it feels like watching a grown man beat up a toddler.
I love this shit im all in on this beef idc if its real or if theyre doing it to make money im into it 
this feels like pac vs biggie levels of hate
three peat > back 2 back
This man Kendrick Lamar straight hates Drake and wants him dead. Idk how many times my jaw dropped listening to this 😵
In Family Matters Drake says he knew it was smoke when Abel hit us with the Serenade makes a weird ad lib and says he almost reached for his waist 
Kendrick tells Adonis if a man ever pees on your leg shoot him in the head
Abel is the Weekends name 
Bro used a line from his own diss track to expose this man
Jesus, man. Somebody check on Drake.
Am I understanding this right, Drake thought he had Kendrick Lamar right where he wanted but didn’t realize Kendrick already had the high ground? RIP
this is just bullying at this point lol
Pedo vs. wife beater

MAD in effect.
What the fuck is today?! 
Bro i don’t even know what to think….are these allegations all true? How will we know?
[deleted]
This is Ether 2024, wow
This is the nastiest song I ever heard.
Talking directly to his kid and parents is FILTHY work.
The fact that Kendrick knew what Drake was going to say proves his fact when he said OVO has a leak. The zoom out on the full picture with the glove as album art is fucking ridiculous. This was all coming.
What the fuck was that. That felt dirty as fuck like that’s some shit people will try to silence. 
Holy shit! This is maybe the most listenable and hardest hitting diss track I have ever heard.
There is no coming back from this for Drake! Time to take a 3 year hiatus and try to possibly return humbly maybe with a Ma$e feature
Don’t get me wrong, this beef is crazy and entertaining but ya’ll really outing each other in public tho lol😂😂😂 you got people look at ya’ll weird with these Domestic violence, Lost kids, and pedo rings.l claims…FBI just waiting on the sidelines for more information 😂🤣😂
Good God
Aubrey is furiously contacting his ghost writers for a rebuttal..
I'm going to need someone to verify these accusations with some facts. Lot of stuff being thrown around. 

Enjoyed Family Matters. Drake's flow was really nice and I enjoyed each of the beats, will definitely throw that in the gym rotation. But Kendrick really took it to another level with how viciously he attacked him. 

Will say it is kind of weird seeing the internet react to this and think it's a bigger deal/diss to Drake that he has another kid instead of Kendrick potentially beating his wife.
Both this and Drake’s diss need proof or else it’s just shit throwing imo. One of the reasons Push’s diss was so powerful is because the veracity of it was undeniable. If you’re going to say someone is fathering a child that isn’t theirs and doing shitty things to their wife that’s heavy. Same for if you’re saying someone is hiding a child and sex trafficking

I think both might have a mix of real and fake. Kendrick moving away from Cali? Probably wasnt 100% faithful in NY. Beating her and fathering a kid that isn’t his? Needa see proof on that one. Drake having surgery, ozempic, ambien, liking underaged girls? Already been speculated on for a while, not surprising. Drake in organized sex trafficking and hiding a daughter that’s almost a teen? Yea that needs proof too
Made it seem like he‘s hiding multiple children near the end. Wtf. He also called him a predator and hinted at some pedo shit. Also dissed his whole crew and his parents. I honestly don‘t know how Drake can respond to this. Jesus
Bro is rapping to his family like holy fuck. Kendrick is a god damn legend
Yo this is gonna end messy and badly holy fuck is just up there
This is like one of those street fight videos where the dude is knocked out bust is still getting kicked in the head.  This is the first battle where I legit feel bad for the loser. Drake legit getting dragged through the streets at this point.
I'm only just in the loop now, I need the sequential order of all these diss tracks, lmao
Oh shit 😯😯😯
Nails in the coffin
Dis shit embarrassing  as fuck - k dot just made this true beef-once again 6 God was warned. Don't respond- now da world look at dude like a scumbag- while drake talking about height- clout- and kid shit- started from da bottom now your here- k dot just made you look in da fkn mirror
Nice Script
Kdot went immortal technique on his ass
faster than amazon delivery
Can't get caught listening to Drake Epstein no more.
Drake is a mess of a person, and this beef will fuck him up further
Man finna bury drake w a whole album
he ended Drake twice
I’m so out of the loop with these disses…what did these start?

*why
To be honest if this shit is true Drake is done for. But if k-dot is lying or got false info, kendrick is cooked, cus now he'll just look like a clown. Time will tell, but damn we getting drake and kendrick every 2 days? MASSIVE WIN FOR US
this track sounded like it's straight out of DAMN.
How did kendrick know about all the shit on Family Matters and have a whole damn song full of rebuttals ready to drop immediately?

Drake really got snakes around him. It’s over the six god got slumped.
Drakes newest song part two where he switches the flow, that shit was hot garbage. His wanna be UK accent Kendrick already made apparent is whack and then he goes back to it like wtf?! “Out in da streets they call it murdaaaa”
Euphoria - he took the fans away
6,16 - he took his team away
meet the grahams - he took his family away

What's next?
https://i.redd.it/fxuw491w4eyc1.gif
Bro that song is brutalllll
Who’s getting shot first?
Yeah you could've maybe debated who won before but this easily confirms it.
Wheel him back to Toronto it's ova
It's kinda hilarious Kendrick called drake a snitch but is up on a beef by working with an informant, rap is wild lmao
Drake being a pos dad makes Rey Mysterio look like father of the year
It’s been said lots, but god damn what a pro gamer move by J Cole getting the fuck outta dodge early.
Don't like Kendricks slow stuff in rap.  But had some good bars.  Euphoria probably the best diss still atm.
Honestly this might be an unpopular opinion, but as a long time Kendrick fan I have to say: Kendrick went too far on this one. He went down to the lowest most personal level, and accused Drake of shit that obviously isnt true. Yes Drake has had weird, somewhat problematic interactions with young women in the past, but to literally compare him to Weinstein and alleging that he is running some pedo ring or something (?) is just absurd. Drake kept it somewhat professional and entertaining and Kendrick is stooping down to an incredibly personal level, attacking not only his deepest character but also Drakes family. Tasteless in my opinion; and i love Kendricks music way more than Drakes.
Kendrick with the straight 🔥 this shit just went ☢️.
…always rapping like you about to get the slaves freed, you just acting like an activist it’s make believe, but you won’t go back to your hood and plant no money trees, you say you hate the girls I fuck but what you’re really mean, I’ve been with black and white and everything that’s in between, you the Black Messiah but you wifing up a mixed queen, and hit vanilla cream to help you with your self-esteem…
Jesus this is brutal
Drake’s ghost busters are gonna have to work overtime tonight 👻
[removed]
Can someone please tell me what order to listen to after "push ups"?
![gif](giphy|OxSA2yypkVASoAmYhW)
How is everyone in this comment section glossing over the fact that he called him a pedo in this song
The atom is splitting.
[deleted]
Drake is gonna have to just start sucking his thumb in public now.
[removed]
Not that good.
[deleted]
A daughter?!
https://x.com/ReignOfApril/status/1786625192258924925
He knew her name and age
A nick cannon in denial?
Bro forget the kids. Why everyone just stuck on the hidden kids? If the pedo allegations are true, holy shit, it make sense why drake moves like how he moves.
Do people actually care that Drake has another kid? Lol. Every rapper is out here sleeping around and has multiple baby mamas. It’s so weird that people pretend that this is shocking. Drake AND Kendrick will probably find out they have more kids in the coming years. These women straight up admit that they are trying to get pregnant by a rich rapper for a meal ticket!
I don’t think they drake hate is cause he’s hiding a kid. Listen again.
I have never seen this before & im dyingg at the possibilities of what this context is. Lmaooo
“Don’t tell no lies about me and I won’t tell no truths about you”
Science
https://i.redd.it/1tsjkf3q6fyc1.gif
Am I missing something? Didn’t Kendrick start that by bringing up Drake’s son?
What I haven't found out yet is what did Drake say about Kendrick to have him go off like this?
"I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle"
Heart prolly dropped into his ass
That’s wild cause he said in 6:16 in LA “let’s see have you ever thought that OVO was working for me?” So that definitely confirms it if kendrick got drakes diss leaked to him and posted the response immediately
It’s Drake’s Ozempic prescription 😭😭😭
Nardwuar
I was wondering how he had a bar about him mentioning his lady so fast. Seems obvious now that you mention it.
🤯
Dawg that's his Ozempic prescription in the bottom corner holy fuck
Dude.
Some people were saying that the 6:16 picture was a photo of Drake's Maybach glove lol. I wonder if that's true too. That's hilarious if so

A lot of people thought Kendrick would be all high brow but he's going as low as you need for a rap beef. And this is kind of a historic one. The internet makes it even crazier than the 90s ones because of how fast the turnaround is
That’s the only thing I want to know so badly lol, what’s the image about
The bottle says Aubrey graham.
the picture keeps zooming out, first it was just a glove now it's the shirt, receipts, pills. I think it's gonna be some significant stuff if it zooms out more.
Some of stuff was apparently from drakes dad’s stolen suitcase. Kendrick really be airing out the dirty laundry of the grahams.
I read it’s actually drakes dad’s suitcase that got stolen at an airport? But had drakes stuff in it idk
@Acevane predicted this
Naww that was some immediate return to sender shit 😂
back to toronto with the dip sauce
snip snip the man first, nick cannon ahh wannabe
playing border patrol lol
Allegedly. But I found this link

https://www.ibtimes.com/does-drake-have-secret-child-rihannas-boyfriend-agrees-pay-child-support-until-1891833

This article was written in 2015
Nah man don’t feel bad for a deadbeat pedo
How does he even respond to this?? Drakes diss didn’t say nearly anything this explosive. Would he even have anything to go at Kendrick with that equates to what he just served up?
Why would you feel bad for him?
It’s up there with rap beefs 💀. Especially cause it’s two of the best of their eras like pac vs biggie and nas vs Jay-z
[deleted]
This has to be the greatest beef of all time. I don't care what anyone says. We're witnessing the greatest beef in hip hop history..goddamn I'm in shock in both sides.
He knew Drake was gonna drop it, almost definitely. There's actual leaks, it seems
Real
Drake better respond tomorrow. And better answer the allegations.
ozempic bruh 😭
Two of them are used sometimes as rape drugs.
Was feeling good for 30 minutes after he dropped now he’s back to feeling like he has to do something. Wild.
does he have a history of self harm or suicid l inclination?
super scheisse
maybe even top 5.
If anything he said is true I can easily make it top 5
Top ten? This the greatest diss since Hit Em Up
I fucking love it.
I mean if Kendrick had an issue that was solved using a lot of counselors, cops or pr people, then no cops are coming. And why did Drake tell the VICTIM to twerk?? Those antics are all the proof I need.

But Kendrick has his fuckin prescription bottom saying 'Ozempic' and 'Aubrey'. Bro lost by a mile.
I want to see this end with someone's house getting raided. Diddy needs friends in prison.
*Almost*
At this point, just drop another Hotline Bling or something.
Keep makin’ me dance, wavin’ my hand, and it won’t be no threat
Drake has legit claimed to be the king of pop on songs he's put out in the past lol. Should've stayed in that lane
Maybe I'm Prince, and you're Mike! 😂 stupid ass I can't
Follow in Colson’s footsteps
Drake fans suddenly gonna not care about numbers
Drakes check didn’t clear for the bots yet. His will have 5 mil by the time you wake up
Drake has 3.2m plays on YouTube Music alone. For Family Matters.  Kendrick didn’t release his diss there.  Gotta add up all the plays bro not just YouTube.
Crazy part is he is going into hiding lol he said he is going on vacation now 😂
Imagine he mentions not wanting to drop it all at once since Drake doesn’t usually go for 18+
Kdot needs to drop proof though. These are strong allegations and have serious consequences, outside of rap.
literally. like okay bro you win go away.
Special K'd. 
K'd up. 
Getting Drizzied.
Done up like a Canadian.
Border patrolled.
What about getting Graham'd?
Getting good? If anything about Drake regarding a second kid or OVO being involved in any sort of sexual assault/trafficking is true this is game over 

Likewise if anything about Kendrick and the domestic violence claims are true
Lemme see you Push a TEE
I don't think Kendrick wants any features. He's not sharing this work.
"You can vibe to Drake's but Kendrick's is thought provoking"

Sums up their whole careers basically
You can vibe to Kendrick though. 

If your vibe was horror core.
He just said to Drake's mother "your son is a sexual predator and i want him to die"
If Kendrick still has more after this, then it's OVER over
Decision win? My man, Kendrick took full mount here and landed 10 flush shots to drakes jaw. This is a full on knockout.
Least surprising part of the track tbh. Even if they aren’t sex traffickers a lot of rappers hang with sex offenders sadly. A$AP crew had a guy who got booted when it surfaced that he’s a sex offender. Nicki Minaj’s man is a sex offender. Diddy obviously. Ross has that line on UOENO that’s basically flexing a sex crime
I mean he kissed a 17 yo after she told him in a video anybody can find. And people still need MORE receipts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-p1feEHJZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-p1feEHJZM)
need this drawn out so both of them can crank music, and so that we can have finality
Drake brought kendrick's family into it first talking about Whitney. Kendrick warned him and he didn't listen. Drake asked for this and made it personal
Drake could have just said "J Prince told me i cant respond" after 'euphoria' he brought this on himself
"Don't tell lies about me, and I won't tell truths about you"
This is too personal. Kendrick’s never been a bag chaser and Drake’s richer than god. No way this is for money.
Yeah, that's a weird way to end the Abel line by Drake. Not sure where he was going with it.

There was a rumour a while back that Drake got peed on (as part of hazing?) in a movie theater and there's a video of it in someone's safe. I think that was what Kendrick was referring to.

  
[https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/drake-ti-associate-cap-movie-theater-pee-6649371/](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/drake-ti-associate-cap-movie-theater-pee-6649371/)
He was straight trolling 4 people hard in No Vaseline. It's not cold, it's legit funny. 

This feels more like the Hit Em Up rant to me. 

"All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you, die slow, motherfucker
My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow"

It's that kinda cold here. This makes you look around concerned for people. This makes you think people might just get hurt over this.
Family Matters: 1. Kendrick's kid isn't really his (not really Kendrick's fault), 2. Kendrick beats his wife (wife can come out and verify, otherwise it's hearsay), and 3. Kendrick has marriage problems (who doesn't)

  
Meet the Grahams: 1. Drake has an 11 year old daughter (hearsay again, but Drake has past history) and 2. Drake sex traffics minors (hearsay again, but Drake has sus history).

  
The difference is that Kendrick is well respected for not only being a talented rapper but also for being "righteous". The allegation he beats his wife is out of character and is hard to believe. 

On the other hand, it's not hard to believe that Drake is hiding another child if he did have another child, which isn't unlikely. Drake's grooming also supports the child sex trafficking allegations. If he is willing to groom minors who are well known to the public, what about minors who aren't known to the public? Of course, it's hearsay again, but it's a super sensitive issue and Drake has shown signs of that possibly happening.

Your reputation really affects what people believe about you. Also, Kendrick has proved that he does have insider info from OVO, so it's not too far-fetched that Kendrick has a valid source for this.
People don't think it's a bigger deal, they just think it's more probable. Drake has his a secret kid before, so him hiding another one isn't as far fetched of an allegation as wife beating.
He has another kid but more importantly he’s a predator
I would feel bad for Drake except if the allegations of sex trafficking is true, Kendrick is right. He deserves to die.
[deleted]
It was just a friendly fade, drake should've kept it that way
If neither can prove their statements, K-Dot still walks away with a KO win though. This was brutal.
All that’s left is him, drake either gotta pull something fucking crazy or k dot is gonna just keep laying stuff out like this
We don't want him
Nah I think the Gunna line might be him referring to himself. 

Like he knows shit that if he snitched would make Gunna look like a saint.
It's always been about love and hate
This bout to age like milk 🤣

*Eleven*th birthday? We getting close to the Millie name drop next time or does he actually have a fkn 11 year old daughter out there he's ignoring, smh
Quick, who was Drake banging in 2013
Deny deny deny
If it’s true Kendrick won, if not he’s down 3-1. Metro and future really saved him tbh.
He might. Someone posted about an article from 2015 about a two year old girl he was paying child support for. We’re 9 years later which makes her 11.
Kendrick Lamar is the Katt Williams of Rap nothing but truth Bombs Katt Said all Liars will be exposed in 2024
Am I the only one thinking drake might be leaking false info to kendrick, through a false mole? Can someone fact check. If Kdot is spitting facts, its a wrap.
He didn't mention a name, did he?
Nick Cannon acknowledges his 27 children, at least.
Gunnas cookin
"I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle"

Drake releases Family Matters.

Kendrick releases Meet the Grahams - he *deliberately* planted the "you're not 'black enough' to use the N-word" narrative as others have done before. Drake brings up his wife's mixed race - Kendrick directly addresses Adonis that he should not be fake like his father and accept his blackness. This is a pre-recorded track, btw, he releases like 4 minutes after Family Matters. Kendrick brought up how manipulative Drake is and used it against Drake.

It's over.
Ya, the first two tracks were mild but critical.  This one is fucking *nuclear*.
Nope. Drake brought family into it when he mentioned Kendrick's wife Whitney on push ups. 

That's why on both Euphoria and 6:16 in LA Kendrick said it Drake likes to bring peoples family into beef and that it would have been strictly a friendly fade if he didn't go there first. Now all gloves are off, so we got Meet the Graham's
Like fat with a bbl
Also, the fact that Drake's track title was a sitcom reference and so is this one (Meet the Graham's = Meet the Jefferson's) which given the fact they released essentially simultaneously he must've known the title in advance I'd imagine?
How can u see that?  I can read the zolpidem but the other bottle is mad fuzzy
Most of Hollywood is on that shit
He knows all
It’s Aubrey graham’s prescription for insomnia. Don’t know what the other bottle is.

Just zoom in.
[deleted]
Don’t cheese fam 
Thats also fair but then if the DV allegations are true then itd be tough to feel good about a kendrick fan as well so im waiting for receipts
He cant. I dont think drake can do anything anymore. Ive heard meet the grahams thrice now and im still getting only half the shit he said. He literally said to drakes mom and dad that you need to sit down and listen to what im telling you, your son should die. And the last verse where hes directly addressing drake, my god. I live a boring ass life but if someone sat me down and spoke to me like that, id just break down crying and get my ass to therapy. Holy fuck
Apparently he asked for someone to find his daughter on IG.
Personally, I’d rather have a secret kid I’m paying child support to than be a person who beats their wife, but that’s just me.
You don't think beating your partner and your former label owner having a child with her isn't anything explosive? cmon
Second hand embarrassment mate😂😂😂
Facts this feel like Pac Vs Biggie I lives d through that whole beef History repeats itself and people lost their lives over that beef dudes was seriously hurt 
Kendrick is the quiet person they tell you leave them Quiet people alone because they got hands and will put hell on you
To me, this might be the most savage beef rap ever. Kendrick nuked Drake.
Drake sells but he’s fucking trash compared to PAC or Biggie (or Kendrick for that matter)
Cole lured Drake into the deep water for Kenny to feed on him. Then dipped. I bet his album The Fall Off is actually about Drake lol
Drake is getting slaughtered
Drakes camp really snaked him and been feeding Kendrick up to date info like he on gps
Drake was so confident he had it won with this one 😂
Bottom right is Ozempic with Drakes name on it

Idk what the pills are
Ozempic ain’t a pill
what's the second one
crazy how he dropped and people freaked out for a second then went SILENT when kendrick dropped.
Check his instagram he making memes to send him this suppose daughter he seem alright lol
Tbh I’d make an argument for it, but for it to certify Itself it needs to alter drakes career.
Yeah for sure. My list rn is:

1. Hit em up
2. Real muthaphukking G’s
3. Hailie’s Revenge
4. meet the grahams
5. Killshot
If drake has a daughter, it might be the best.
Hit Em Up is still my all time fave.  

>Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie  
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfuckin' crew  
And if you want to be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too  
Chino XL, fuck you too  
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too  
All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you, die slow, motherfucker  
My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow
"Can't Toosie Slide your way outta this"
That line literally summarizes drakes music to me hahahaha
Drake doesn’t either if it’s an age
Drake makes the numbers though, drake fans is going to listen to the diss and Kendrick fans going to listen to the diss.
They’re starting to bug out on insta I argued w a Drake fan who was making absolutely no sense
Yeah, that checks. Has to go get his daughter
no way he can't its too wide open! he has an hr left to respond
He thought Kendrick wasn't gonna respond right away... let alone ether him just 15 mins later. lol
Same for Drake
Bro there are literal receipts in the cover art of the diss track
He’s a little too good, it’s annoying
Graham’d makes it sound like Drake won.
Drakes soft ass fans will support him no matter what. If they didn’t he would have been done after push.
Spot on truly, not a knock on either just an interesting observation.
Sums up their fanbases too. Only caring about beats for Drake, Kendricks are surgical.
Easily one of the craziest parts of the song. But I mean think about it. As a woman you should be disgusted if your son is grooming sixteen year old girls
I think it's the hinting it might be on kids that makes it way different. Someone said drake was on epsteins list, any idea if that's true?
If you think Nicki's man is the only sex offender in her orbit...wait till you hear about her brother
THIS IS CRAZY 💀
Another kid is drake serious another kid I thought it was groundhog day when we heard that we liked Drake so we  let the first kid slide. I'm done with drake because 
Girls nerd they fathers in their Lives to protect them from predators like himself I loved when Kenny said all you do is hyper sexualize black women and prey on them
T.I friend Cap, or Casper was rumored to have pissed on Drake
So basically, everything is hearsay except Kendrick's kid not being his?  Did I get that right?
kendrick has built this “righteous” image yet he was still cheating lmfao
Yeah, which really wouldn't shock me at all, especially since he did it before. But Kendrick potentially beating his wife is more surprising to me and a bigger revelation since we never considered that. 

Overall, Kendrick's response was more visceral, while it felt like Drake's was more for the radio.
Yeah why is nobody mentioning the predator part
Should add Taylor Made in there between 3 and 4
That's my whole workout session!
Kendrick showed he knew shit that would make Gunna Wunna look like a saint.
That's one way too look at it

He implies Drake has several kids he just never sees.
There was a rumor Drake slid into 11 from Stranger Things’ DMs when she was still underage. There have been a few rumors about Drake with young kids.
Drake name dropped Millie himself 💀 Bro is cooked
Someone posted another thread, there’s a 2015 article “woman claims 2 year old daughter is his” trying to get a paternity test. 

It also mentioned another woman claimed a baby was his, and she shortly after got rid of al her social media. Take that how you will. 
Who wasn't he banging
Drake’s such a fuck boy.  And not in a good way.
Ahhh the 3 D’s of life
All of these big dick deviants is all catching hell in 2024
I highly doubt Kendrick would jump to these conclusions with false evidence. He’s too calculated, but I may be wrong.
Fr everyone’s losing their minds with no receipts. Also pretty sure he’s pissed off for being exposed as a wife beater and trying to play it off that he isn’t. That’s why he got mad when he heard there was a song about it and that’s why he’s clearly pissed now. It’s a great diss though def feels very personal though and more than family. If drake has another kid that’s wild but as I said with Adonis I can completely respect you not wanting your kids in the spot light and as big as he is he can’t really move around without people finding out. Idk I’m enjoying this though
A lot of it seems legit.
What would drake gain by lying that he has a daughter?
Nah Family Matters ended with him saying anyone who calls right would know he won. If Drake had something in the chamber left, he would've been the first one to say it. 

I do think he's fuelling the leaking false info narrative though. That doubt would hold the lines until any receipts are shown.
No he didn’t, I thought he called her Grace
Love is Eternity
still could use the snip snip
It’s over when Kendrick buried drake 5 mins after family matters and all drake could do is make a insta story about it
Nahhhhhh, Kendrick is actually a tactical genius.
Bruh, it's just The Jeffersons, not Meet the Jeffersons lmao wtf.


The most painful thing about this beef is watching y'all dissect shit and not understanding any of the references.
I thought Meet the Grahams was a play on Meet the Parents (Movie with Ben Stiller and Robert Dinero).
Or this is brilliant marketing and they're making bank off this "beef'
https://x.com/kurrco/status/1786618454826512848?s=46&t=miwuUoQJEu8GhFtNBOzH7Q
Also super easy to photoshop whatever the hell you want on there honestly
The ozempic isn’t the pill bottle, it’s the box in the bottom corner. Zolpidem is Ambien, and a third prescription is blurred out.
yeah being on a sleeping pill is not a big revelation, if that is what kendrick is using to say drake is addicted to popping pills, that’s weak. the addicts use benzos to sleep instead of zolpidem

and there’s legitimate evidence for z-drugs (the class zolpidem is in) for jet lag. his travel/touring schedule with the wild time zone changes makes it a reasonable prescription to have 

idk what the other bottle is though, nobody seems to have been able to read it yet
Ozempic
Fuck that’s sick, thanks
You cheesing fum
Kdot son’d him. Lol
He denied Adonis at first too and had multiple DNA tests before he admitted it.
That line about the embassy getting raided is going age like fine wine. Diddy pt.2
I feel like the pedo allegations are the worst part and people keep glossing over this fact. Drake is damn near Nickelodeon if that’s true
Thats not even true, it's been debunked and there's no real evidence. He even said in Euphoria, "Fabricating Stories on the story front cause you heard Mr Morale"
What about the pedo claims?
That’s if he’s even paying child support, but I 100% agree. Given how both sides have essentially been debasing each other, however, I think the more important thing is to see who actually has the receipts to back it up.
Hopefully that’s just you
This ain’t comparable to Tupac and biggies beef. That was violent.
Real shit, I thought the same...I mean dot questioning his man hood, his race, him as a father...I mean he shitted on him in every disrespectful way possible. If it were any other respectable guy, shit would be getting real serious, even with the posses, but your not seeing that because Drake ain't that guy.
I don't know. Wife assault allegations are greater than another child. Drake has a history of issues we don't know of. One thing can ruin Kendricks career.
Unless they placed fake evidence! This shit is so spicy
Ambien
ohh shit my bad 🤦‍♂️
He says percs in turks
Zolpidem is Ambien
Zolpidem
I'm not saying he is stressed, but a meme doesn't confirm he isn't. Only he knows rn but if his closest are leaking he most certainly would be upset with those guys
It absolutely will. If Adonis cancelled the Adidas deal, this is absolutely going to cause endorsement losses. But also like the social ramifications, he called out Lebron and Curry. Will families send their kids over to Drake's house to hang out with Adonis? Family friends still come over? 

Idk how much it will alter his fanbase. But I feel like this will already have social and monetary impact to him. And that impact will skyrocket if any of this is substantiated.
i think no vaseline is 6!
🤣🤣🤣
Most of them don’t
Drake fans don't make sense because a large sum of them aren't rap culture, they're pop. They don't understand it.


"I'm what the culture feelin."
Drake got slump bodied again Kendrick just rocked his snot box and turned his TV Off
He said there's no big 3, drake didn't listen
Fair.
Getting Met?
The mfer literally released an album cover full of pregnant women.

Dude got kids. Let's be fucking forreal.
That's hearsay too. Just explaining why people are reacting differently to allegations against Drake vs allegations against Kendrick.
And he outed himself. 

Which adds to the image in a way. Like, "if he was being slimey he would tell us since he said that" way. 

I don't know if he's being extra slimey there, but as of now Kendrick has far more credibility than Drake when it comes to being honest.
No one really believes the wife beating allegation, because this is the first time hearing about it. Drake has a history so it's believable.
For real he just got accused of sex trafficking
Was Certified Lover Boy’s album cover art or just a confession at this point.
And had to be publicly shamed into hanging with the one we do see lol it's wild because Drake put that picture up of his kid with a Mirror.
That ain't no rumour, they were well documented to be creepily close when she was underage and she has talked about them texting each other shit like 'miss you' etc whilst she was uncomfortably underage. Shit even if that was the height of what went on its still wildly creepy and inappropriate to be messaging a child 'I miss you' when that child ain't yours or your close relation. He needs to text his daughter he misses her
Not a rumor it’s a well documented fact
Possible ties to pdiddler?
(Tinfoil hat)
It’s North West who turns 11 on 6:16
Theres a leak in OVO camp. Because he quickly rebuttal Family Matters fast . And then released a tease in 6:16. Had it planned out.
I think both are big enough and past caring enough to make up lies.
Unless he’s mad about the whole wife beating thing and fucked up
What makes you say he’s too calculated?
Strategic* he had a very good idea on how this would turn out in the long run.
It was 'Meet the Parents' (the DeNiro and Ben Stiller flick) as the other poster mentioned. I flubbed the film, but both are family-oriented comedies.


I indeed fucked it up. 
Ah shit, you're right. Still, both family-centric comedies though I suppose.
I think it's a play on  the song "Meet the Frownies" which is a song he sampled way back.
Nah, no way, wayyyy too personal
Nah the allegations on Drake is going to follow him for life. This isn't marketing.
Having one of the most well known artists in your genre publicly accuse you of being a pedophile sure would be one of the marketing moves of all time.
You would have to be insane to secretly be cool with someone calling you a pedo.
They definitely are, but what are they marketing? Only rumors of a Kendrick album this month. The allegations they’re both throwing are too heavy to just be a PR stunt.
K dot said it, started as a rap exhibition till drake had a line about kendrick's family
You don't accuse each other of domestic abuse and pedophilia for a fun pop beef to boost sales
This is why you ain't advising any celebrities on marketing
if it's photoshop, it's top tier
Fucking deadbeat
Wasn’t degrassi on like a Nickelodeon extension tv channel if I remember correctly?
People aren’t glossing over the fact. Kendrick says Drake employs sex offenders and pedos, which he apparently does with the Baka Not Nice guy. The grooming allegations have followed Drake for years now so it’s not really like he brought forward Earth shattering news. 

Think ab the kid thing logistically. We’re in the age of social media where NDAs are being broken all the time, where women are coming out and exposing men for being sexual deviants and deadbeats all the time. Drake couldn’t keep the news about Adonis under wraps until the press release, so how in the hell has he managed to keep an 11 year daughter under wraps? Drake having a kid that he privately acknowledges and provides financial support to isn’t some earth shattering thing, half the industry are deadbeats. 

Kendrick’s Black Power persona being put into question, cheating on his mixed fiancé and beating on her is much more of a stain, relatively.
If both sides got receipts and back up the allegations, Cole might end up with the crown by default because these two just nuked eachother
Cmon. No woman alive would have a baby by Drake and not get paid.
Give it time this one might just be too
Multiple 50 bags in the streets. Weeknd’s manager’s house got shot up last week. The war just went hot.
Also, biggie never acknowledged the beef and never had a real track. Who shot ya might have been a subliminal....
I agree with you but in a different way

Drake name is already tied to lame/bad/corny shit so another bullet point on the list won’t really change his likability in the long run. 

Kendrick on the other hand does not have much tied to his name so being a woman beater( light skin wife) but also preaching about love for his melanated queens would be far more damaging.
Having sex offenders on payroll???
I’d wager pedo wins over assault
Drake is a literal pedo
Someone on Twitter zoomed in and it was zolpidem

Which is ambien
It's definitely Ambien, generic cause I took them before for sleep but that shit is a trip
Im a Turk what does mean in the Song dont get it? Did he means the Folk Turks?, no native Speaker
Yeah both are savage af, and I’d assume liable for libel if patently false, imagine a Johnny Depp-style trial, getting the facts out there if it isn’t true and getting the other guy to pay you is an auto-win, but any meat to the bones we were offered and it’s fair game.
Chris Berman?
kendrick has always had this “holier than thou” mindset so ofc he’ll out himself, let’s see if he admits to beating his wife
His own people just mocking him in his face without him getting it
Everything is subliminal man. They “hide” the truth in plain sight from us to make a mockery of the people. It goes deeper than that. Kenny calls out Drake for being a child predator and groomer. Drake leaked his own nude photo as a predatory technique called “The Lover boy Method” The 'lover boy' technique is widely used by criminals to recruit victims into forced prostitution. The suspects prey on their victims' vulnerabilities, enticing them with expensive gifts or promises of a better life. Hense “Certified Loverboy” Trust me, this sh*t runs deeper than we will ever know
Not only that but MBB confessed to getting text from him, and when asked about what they talked about, she sheepishly said; boys, he gives me advice. What grown man is advising little girls about boys? Of course a father would to his daughter, but this man isn't.
Yea you right. I didnt know it was confirmed but thats essentially what I heard. Idk if Drake gonna survive this one
If only she wasn’t a Kanye clone
I’m pretty sure Kendrick knew what was gonna be on Family Matters before he even released Euphoria. His callbacks and connections between all three tracks he dropped in those 24 hours are absolutely insane
I mean the fact push ups leaked shows there’s already a leak. Push told us this a while back in how he knew about the child.
The phrase “6:16 in L.A.” is suspiciously similar to how a birth time would be written on a certificate.  I may be reaching but…

There are layers to this shit.
I think one of them is. Clue its not the deadbeat dad.
I was really thinking they planned it together before euphoria dropped, then went to thinking it might be planned after euphoria dropped, then to thinking we might need to stop this before they actually start getting violent.
Both are possible.   


Dot seems a little mad though.   I got a child tv star trying to check my credibility.  Naw fuck that.
One of, if not the, marketing moves of all time
Meh, If I basically had unlimited money like drake, you really wouldn't give a fuck about it.
In this space these rappers can go on a shooting spree and they'd still have masses buying their shit. They're dealing with some of the most complacent consumer base, any attention is good attention for them.
In the US it ran on The-N which turned into Teen Nick. But they only had rights to broadcast. They weren't involved in production. It was produced by Wild Brain.

While it was running, Nick Cannon became a big part of the network so that's also a thing.
Cole hiding in a bunker rn
I wouldn't be surprised if Drake becomes a sore loser and call in some mob ties.
Source????
Facts
The accusations are ten years old and were addressed on the breakfast club at that time, ten years ago.
I wanna know who it is. They both got some expanding to do. Id so it's neck and neck. As someone who loves Drake I didn't think it'd be this close
Is rumored that Drake uses ambien spike the drinks.
No, he meant Turks and Caicos in the Bahamas
Ya that’s very true. Damn. Probably one way or the other there’s gonna be a court case from this. Whether defamation, some pedophilia shit, or some other behind the scenes thing that’s been hinted at. That’s actually insane
I'm pretty sure for the Drake to win that hypothetical Drake would have to prove Kendrick knew he was lying and it's very hard to prove intent
I feel like suing somebody for libel ain't really hip-hop. Like I see it making both parties look like they're on Judge Judy. It's obviously better than looking like a pedo or woman beater but imagine if Jay and Nas ended with a libel lawsuit.
Holy shit new hhcj copypasta material?
Billie Eilish, Bella Harris, Hailey Bieber too

He’s got a long list of minors in his life.

He’s _on video_ telling a 17 year old girl he likes the way her breasts feel and hopes he doesn’t go to jail.
That’s faxxx, shit is insane
Not only that I heard “Kendrick reappear” part of Family Matters on Tuesday in Twitter while I was scrolling Europhia responses. I saw only 5 people discuss the Kendrick bit and some thought it was AI
Cole is currently sipping champagne and celebrating his new lease on life
That’s the whole point. He doesn’t have any. It’s all fake.
https://torontosun.com/2015/05/12/drake-entourage-member-guilty-of-assaulting-woman

His name is Baka Not Nice
He does. He's just didn't grow up in that lifestyle. J Prince was the one who squashed the Kanye beef.
Some things never change 🥹🫶🏼

Taylor & Ed’s era. 🫶, it truly was, cheers 🥂 to what was a great night.

It is like the Wembley folk already knew 😊

That was so special.
When he came out onstage

https://preview.redd.it/h69mpuw7dwid1.jpeg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64f19c0fb4f99db7c9cc16880fc389d0ec719775
I still can not get over that performance with the to of them coming together. It really was special, something that I am sure many will never forget.
This is great. But what I really want to know is - when does Florence make an appearance? And before anyone says ‘Miami’, Florence is a homebody, so I don’t see her flying across the Atlantic for just five minutes on stage. She would have to have something else going on…
And Ed performed in Austria just yesterday. He must have immediately taken a flight home.
It’s nice to have a friend
I just love Ed… everyone loves Ed… i don’t trust people who don’t love Ed…
WAIT WHERE CAN I WATCH THIS? 😭
Amazing night

https://preview.redd.it/i32hz67tuwid1.jpeg?width=1986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c216168216dff85f0594c48a781c32df98ab2e97
Omg 😭 she really baited us with Rep tonight
Legit love this! ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1072)

Two of the most genuine artists today.
IM CRYING NOOO
I seriously love their friendship so much 🥺
Is it even a Taylor tour if she doesn’t bring Ed out at least once?
I hate how some swifties absolutely trash on Ed Sheeran. They’re are best friends and it’s completely rude to be calling him “ugly” or “weird”. let them be friends and let them be happy. their relationship is sooo wholesome, and I’m tired of some swifties ruining that. I love him and think he’s awesome.
Her friendship with Ed is actually the proof that she's not the mean evil queen who sits on her throne and barks orders at her squad like the haters/media try to paint her as. Ed literally has been close with Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun for years and he still is. And if I'm not wrong Ed even attended a birthday party of 🛴 last year. So if Taylor was truly the petty vindictive person they paint her to be, she would've cut Ed from her life a long time ago. This is why I didn't get the jokes that Taylor was going to be mad at Sabrina for taking part into Kim's Skim campaign. It was even more annoying that Sabrina was asked about it in an interview and had to explain that no Taylor wasn't mad about it. Seriously, a lot of things that Taylor gets accused of is purely projection. 
I love both of them and their friendship so much 🫶 ngl I'm quite jealous of London N4 attendees since they are my top 2 favorite artists but I hoped everyone has fun!
I love their friendship so much, it's just so wholesome 🥹
I love their friendship so much 🥰
My 2 favorites ever!!
Omg I can’t handle this I love him
And they're trying to tell us Everything Has Changed!?? 😉
https://preview.redd.it/7mhnugxymxid1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72f3a108f510423dbd1af9552191e6fdd7ad1d47

I was there. Can confirm it is hands down the best concert ever.
OK y'all so my first dance song at my wedding is Thinking Out Loud because yes it's beautiful but also all the examples are our lives: both our moms have neurological diseases impacting the ability to walk that could be genetic, my husband plays guitar, and I was 23 when I got married. Hearing her sing it with him on the videos I'm seeing on Instagram is just TUGGGGINGGG at my heart strings fuhhhhhh.
The night was pure perfection. It was literally faultless and then Ed came out and blew off the roof.
If I had a nickel every time Ed Sheeran showed up as a surprise guest at a concert in the last year, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
I’m sat in the car park on the way out. I’m not an Ed fan, but I love Everything has Changed. It’s the song that made me LOVE Taylor. I’m really happy.
Cutieeeeees I love them
😭 this is so sweet
I didn’t catch this stream, what’d they play?!
I love them so much 🥰
NO WAY
WAIT WAS HE THERE?! I love their friendship so very much!
I saw them on the Red tour. I was on the edge of the pit. Ed was absolutely dripping sweat while he played haha
The audience here are so luckyyyy 😭😭😭
Awwww sooo sweeetttt!!! :)
i was supposed to see taylor this last friday and ed on saturday 😭 only saturday happened 💔
I love their frienship! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
I forgot how good of a song Thinking Out Loud is.
I was there last night. My first ever TS show after being a fan for 18 years!!! When she brought him out, I was bawling my eyes out but ofc I still took a full video of the performance (with shaky hands) 😭🫶🏽
Love their musical chemistry and their friendship so much
Will Rep TV be coming this week? 🖤🐍
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE WATCHED THE LIVE STREAM

I was missing my amazing first concert (Munich N1) and a bit sad about my second concert (Vienna N1) so I thought I'd take one day off...

Last time I didn't pay attention to live stream was when Travis came to the stage.

Bet my ass I'll be clued to my screen tomorrow!
They were on the same hotel floor too.
she's a clock
[deleted]
i was in the crowd and omg the cheers were deafening!!!! when they sang thinking out loud i was nearly in tears bc i never thought i’d see ed sheeran in concert and i love his old music, it’s basically my childhood
With his beat and small guitar, wearing the same old jeans 🩷
OMG its been like 11 years time goes sooo fast.
I was so happy to see them together on the stage. 🥺
I was there!! One of the best nights and such a treat to see ed 🪩🫶🎸
And yet, Everything Has Changed ❤️
Haha I always love seeing Ed’s tiny guitar( I have one) but it looks extra tiny next to her grand auditorium.
I \*bawled\* when they started singing Thinking Out Loud. I would love it if Taylor did more songs that were not her own for the surprise set, cause goodness. That was one for the history books
Was this last night? What did they sing?
Ed’s shoes surely changed for the better.
2013
.
Tbh I’m not hating at all but their collabs are not my favs so I’m not mad we lost these songs tonight. The lovey dovey mashup of KOMH & alchemy are fine too. I’m forever grateful to my perfect surprise songs on Amsterdam N2
So she did just move on like vienna never happened? not a word?
why does 2024 photo have terrrible quality?
Did camera quality go downhill between 2013 and 2024? If so, _that_ has changed.
The facts that the 1st pic is so clear but then the second is so grainy
so you're saying the only thing that changes is camera technology has gotten worse?
War… war never changes.
Cameras are getting worse apparently
Done still like these ppl?
I'm glad I was at another London show as those songs with Ed Sheeran are toe curlingly cringe.

Bet the crowd went bonkers though when he came out
Ya they do, these people got blurrier and fatter 😂
She’s still bad
[removed]
>second brother

I keep forgetting she has an actual brother until reminders like these lol
Bros 10 year plan did not work 😭💗
I was watching it on the livestream and feeling very jealous haha
Were you next to me? 😂

https://preview.redd.it/i2np8ksqkwid1.jpeg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad991cea911880f117210f44699c21c5ad9b05cc
Oh woah this is an amazing photo!!
I can’t watching the ed suprise song set! It was such a highlight for this tour since they have made some beautiful songs together!
Hey me and my wife are in that photo!
OMG FREDDIE MERCURY ON N5 CONFIRMED!!!
Omg. The joker and the Queens… 🤘🏽👌🏽❣️
That was an egg!!!😱
HAHAHA
Best comment😂
She also let him play one of HIS songs which i think is very significant. She hasn’t done that yet with any other artist. Gracie’s song featured her so that doesn’t count to what i mean.
She's talked about getting stage fright & anxiety performing, she may just not want to do a stadium show. Same reason I'm not sure we'll see Lana. It would be great though!!
Last night of London? Because Taylor will then be "taken to Florida"
Good point, I guess she might have a surprise guest on the last London show too? These London shows are so highly anticipated, I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if she has a surprise guest every night 😅
Florence was at the show tonight 👀
PRAYING she comes out on saturday 😭
I thought she lived in LA too?
Posty will def be Miami
I was front row at the concert last night and saw someone running in a robe (dressing gown) with their head covered…I was praying it was Florence but the body shape was screaming Ed or Post Malone.
Hello!!! Florida!!! got a full production it deserved!!!
She did a little speech about how tired he must be and how badly he wanted to be out there.
To be fair, even on Ryan air the Vienna to London flight is two hours. I just did it a week ago. lol. 

Europe is so small and it’s so amazing. I’ve lived most of my adult life in Texas and it’s so spread out.
It's barely a 2 hour flight. He could've slept in and still made it in time 🤣
Unpopular opinion: I don't mind him but apart from a couple songs I'm not a fan of his music, and this goes way back. They feel so bland.
Even my husband likes him and took me to one of his shows! He’s so extremely talented! Also thinking out loud was my wedding song💚
Frfr. If you don’t love Ed, like what are you doing with your life?
Agree so much to this
I like some of his songs but he did write a really sexist song about a girl who decided to date someone else over him that really was gross...
I recently found out he’s actually a pretty terrible person and I was really disappointed. Allegedly he has a huge toxic masculinity problem.
I'm sure u/seraberra will have a video of it for us soon
It was at tonight’s London concert! There are loads of videos on twitter and TikTok 😄
DEFINITELY! 3 rep songs?!? The eggs are loud right now!🐍🤡🤪
Exactly what I was thinking before the show!!! I can’t believe it finally happened!
I don't understand in general how people trash other artists! Don't like them? Just don't pay attention to them. 

Also thanks to Taylor I got into Sabrina Carpenter and Gracie Abrams, so I'm glad she brings other people with her to the tour in general

I'm not so familiar with Ed's music, but I like some songs and I think he seems like such a nice person in general
Her crew works for her for such a long time, have health insurance and get awesome bonuses and gifts. The media cannot handle nice successful people and women must be mean because something something. Her character and humor shows in every interview. Just because she is hard working and ambitious some think that she is not kind. Anyway she is simply the best. Sabrina had been working and writing songs for over 10 years due to Taylor we suddenly are paying attention to her. Love that. And so many other artists too because Taylor paid attention to them. She really is the music business.
But don’t people need to make it their life’s mission to preach about how evil she is so they can feel that they have a purpose? What would they have without that?
Then king of my heart with alchemy?!?🥹💜
Can concur. The scream I let out when it happened was unearthly. I can’t believe I had that in me.
I was just watching one he did with hozier recently! It was stunning!
Everything Has Changed + End Game + Thinking Out Loud
3 rep songs tonight!!! 💚🤡 I definitely think this is happening, I’m hoping she plays another rep song tomorrow
so what you are saying is everytime you skip the stream something awesome happens?

how do you feel about taking one for the team, bestie? 😂😂
It’s actually the song that got me into T! My hubby and I listened to it a lot when we first married ❤️😭
Yes, they sang everything has changed + end game + thinking out loud
I understand being disappointed and having grief but she is probably keeping quiet for safety reasons. It’s not only her but the entire team has been quiet. This was a very big thing, it was a terrorist threat. Not a show malfunction. She is grieving too, she has feelings too. We have no idea what she is facing as well. And she still has a life as a singer to preform. She can’t put her whole career on pause. It is heartbreaking, but we will hear from her when she believes it’s time.
Cuz it’s a screenshot from a livestream of tonight’s concert 😅
Give it some time, it only happened tonight 😂
how did you even get to this post in the first place?
There was some behind the scenes pics of him at stage checks at the beginning of the tour. That was when I learned she had a brother.
Neither of them are written into the will
For some reason she has only child energy
Yeah, I read that and fully just thought, "Yeah, Ed's a second brother after Jack," lol.
Bro married with 2 daughters
Poor guy really thought that writing a mega hit love song and singing it in duets with andrea bocelli would get him out of the friend zone with taylor...

Taylor's like wow that's a really great song Ed, who's it about? "Oh...you know...nobody in particular..."
I was too. Wembley Stadium tweeted out that amazing photo.
I missed the live stream and feeling very jealous of those that didn’t lmao
My daughter was there with her dad, I took her to Liverpool. He wouldn’t sell me the spare ticket he got. The ticket he only got because I got him a presale code!! I am wounded.
Where can I watch the live stream? Thank you!
Unfortunately no, the picture was tweeted out by Wembley Stadium.
Elvis closes it out with her.
While in Vienna, she must have found a witch to summon Freddy for one of her London nights.
haha please 😭😭
Eyyyyyyyyyyyy oh!
Underrated comment
Well, it's true! 😁
She played I miss you, I’m sorry with Gracie! I believe that’s the only other time she’s done someone else’s song
I thought that too about Lana and she’s been playing huge festivals, so it could be possible!
Imagine seeing all three in one night? Ahhhhhhh!!!
Yeah!
I don't see it, she wouldn't take away the attention from the reputation announcement 🤡
Your prediction was so on point!
>every night

*cries in London N1*
She had a few days in london last time! Hayley and her sang castles crumbling, Gracie joined her for us, and then of course the tayvis performance!
That would be amazing for guests each night!  That was my fave part of 1989 tour
Great call!!!!
😮😮😮 Is it only a matter of time?? I mean, they both know Aristotle!
Are you going!?!?
Her primary residence is in South London.
At first glance, I thought you meant Ed Kelce, and I’m like ‘whaaaaattt’? 🤣
Hell, yes! And what a production it was! Fabulous.
Haha yeah Austria being relatively central is great. You don't even have to fly to visit a lot of great countries.
I don’t usually spend the time, but as a swiftie You should get this- his radio hits are easily, without a doubt, objectively, his WORST songs. Shape of you is a bottom 5. 

Swifties I imagine would love Divide. I still think it’s his best full album. Even if perfect is overplayed- it’s the best of the radio hits. Dive is better. Nancy Milligan is fire. Bibe Ya be Yeye is everything. 

Blow is genuinely one of the greatest pieces of artistry to happen and only Ed could’ve gotten Chris Stapleton and Bruno mars together like that. 

Aside from Divide, I’d recommend Plus, or loose change. Because Cold Coffee, little bird, little lady, and You need me are just straight bangers.
Same, I don’t love his music, but I don’t actively dislike him. I’m not gonna turn the station if he comes on the radio. 
You don’t have to be a big fan of his music to just simply like the guy
That’s so cute
Are we the same person because same on all counts🥰
🫣
You must be evil if you can’t love the goodness himself… 

The man writes the most romantic lyrics in human history… it’s kinda insane

You cannot hate him
The “girl” is Ellie Goulding and we can tell you don’t know the full situation by your comment but look it up because it’s not remotely sexist…
What is sexist about that song? 

It’s mostly about two people who were just terrible at communicating with one another

They're posted! Just waiting for moderator approval. ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1072)
I hope someone post here bc I don't have twitter or tik tok anymore. lol
Didn’t she plan one of the tour breaks so one of her band member’s could be home for the birth of his child? How do people go from that to bitch, I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♀️
Exactly, at this point it's sort of became a part of their life mission to prove that Taylor is an evil witch who pretends to be nice and that they're going to expose her. But she's been in this industry for 20 years now and the closest these people got was an edited phone call to make her seem like a manipulative liar. And since that didn't work, now they're scrambling to find the next big thing. 
The scream everyone let out was like something I’ve never heard before. I didn’t know it was possible for something to be that loud
DAAAAYUM
I had told a friend that Rep is coming this week for several reasons!

The Rep has references to London and it is one of the cities she loves very much. The video for End Game shows her and the dancers in London and the song LWMMD has an interpolation of the song by the British band Right Said Fred. She loves the city so much that she added more shows than other foreign countries, after this show she takes a break for 2 months and Rep will definitely be released in November. At the release of 1989, she also took a break afterwards.
If I keep skipping long enough, will we get Debut TV?! For that I'd gladly keep sacrificing 😂

(Rep, too, but I feel especially passionate about debut TV)

/ edit: damn I just remembered a friend of my boyfriend is visiting tomorrow so I might have to take one for the team anyway
Besides my other comment, on the other hand - am I mentally ready to watch these surprise song videos?! I have such nostalgic memories of Ed + Taylor songs I have not yet decided if I can handle it 😂
Thank you!
On the Popular Tab.
Look up Jack Leopards & The Dolphin Club on Spotify. Their only song is a cover of Look What You Made Me Do. Taylor produced it with Jack Antonoff under her Nils Sjöberg alias and her brother Austin does the vocals. I believe it was made for a TV show or movie.
"Cats don't even like the beach!"
She’s laughing up at us from hell
Forgotten like Evermore
It's probably about his wife?
I’m so sorry :( some people are just awful
what a dick
But, like, you could have bought that ticket?
tessdear on TikTok does it every show :)  also folkleric and Ammir Shah 2 on YouTube!
Colonel Parker won't allow it! 😭  IYKYK
Elvis isn't from England lol
Well she does witchcraft every night on stage during willow (according to some unhinged Christian nutjobs) so all that power must be going into something.
Ig it should remain underrated : )
Was this when she couldn’t perform her opener? Not trying to contradict you just trying to remember :)
Haha. Will that announcement *ever* happen? 😬
If it’s any comfort, my one and only show was Vienna Night 1. 

(I get it tho!)
Didn't you guys get the Travis performance?
Haha thanks! London N1 and N8 got everything, lucky them!
yes!!! i’m so bloody excited today!!
Yeah, I was just pointing out that she may not be there until the next LA show (if there is one, I can’t remember rn)
Haha I would have loved that honestly
Yeah, it's like "ok fine sing shape of you for the 500 gazillionth time"
Frfr. Honestly. And it seems like he’s best friends with everyone. Because he has been very very close with Harry and Louis for YEARS and hung out with both of them at the Euros just a few weeks ago.
It looks like the actual article has been taken down, so it may have just been someone who didn’t like him, I’m not sure.
Thank you so much for always sharing these with us ❤️ as someone who doesn't frequent tiktok or insta it means the world to me
Yay! Thank you!
We have a wonderful resident swiftie who finds and shares high quality videos of the surprise songs!
Because they made it a part of their identity that she's evil and a terrible person. It's like the hill they've decided to die on and no matter what they'll never question it. She could literally cure cancer at this point and these people would say she's only doing it because of her personal gain because she's going to sell the cure and get money, therefore she's bad as they've always thought 🙄 
Lol it was so loud I didn’t even realize what has happening for a few seconds. Then I saw ed pop up and I was like OH 👀
What made you open it and leave a comment, rather than ignoring it and going on with your day?
that was soooo good!!
I Forgot That You Existed (Both Brothers' version)
Don't be ridiculous
He bought a spare for me incase I didn’t get a ticket to Liverpool. But because I got to go to Liverpool he wouldn’t sell it to me. I gave him the access code so my daughter could go for definite, she’s gotten to go twice and I’m so happy for her as she is obsessed. 

It’s been a whole thing. He’s in general a great person, just a bit annoying at times. The annoying point for me was that he insisted on going to foo fighters in June with myself and my son. 

I know it’s a very privileged problem to have but at one point he was talking about giving it to a stranger. Only decided in the last month to ask my daughters best friend if she would like to go. So I’m happy my daughters best friend got to go at least
Thank you :)
Neither is Freddie!  (He was British but not from England).
I was going more with the “dead but some people think he is alive” theme.
Yes!
Oh no! Sorry to hear that.
That was n3
Have a MARVELOUS time!
I think it’s just Miami, Indy and New Orleans left in the US. I’ll take their duet wherever I can, I just want to see it!
If you read one article… it’s often not the (full) truth

You know how many articles have been written about Taylor Swift being pregnant or having relationships with other people that all turned out to be false…?

You didn’t recently found out… you read an article and probably not looked at the sources of that article
Aww, you're very welcome! I love sharing them! ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1067)
My thought process every surprise song section: "can't wait to go on reddit and see the HQ video seraberra found!"
Taylor living rent free in their heads🤷🏽‍♀️
Because people should spread awareness about Cults
Riiiight, because it’s so ridiculous to write a song about a girl you’ve known since childhood, dated for four years, have been married to for 5, and have two kids with
Sorry
Huh. That story got weirder than I thought. Bummer you didn’t get to go. Could have been worse, we went on a whole vacation to see the Vienna show. Kids are pretty bummed about it but better safe than dead.
Correct. He’s from Tanzania
Ah! My bad.
I hope you get to!!!!
I swear there was more than one up when I was reading them because I remember being upset because I genuinely liked his music. But I don’t have the greatest memory so I’m not sure where they were from.
Just cause people are fans and talk about their favorite artist, doesn't mean they are in a cult. You wouldn't like someone to say you were in a cult for being a fan of someone. Instead of wasting your time spreading negativity just cause you don't like someone, you can just ignore it. It's really easy to do and is free. You should try it one day.
imagine being this miserable in your life. 

couldn't be me.
Oh god, I am so sorry to hear that. I know what you mean though. I was supposed to see REM when the London bombings happened years ago and although it was rescheduled I did not go. I wasn’t living in England at the time so it was too much to travel again but I don’t think I would have gone anyway
The person you’re going back and forth with finds meaning in their life by trying to spread the word about how bad Taylor and her fans are. They need this narrative in their lives to make themselves feel meaningful and that they have a purpose. Your responses and questions are good and thoughtful, but they will never change until some deeper need is met in their lives.
Yikes! The bummer for my kids is that me and the wifey went to Amsterdam by ourselves already. It was great show but I’m not even a swifty. So I feel bad about that.
I know, I just like to mess with them.
Sophie Turner calls Taylor an “absolute hero” for providing her and her children with an apartment
Taylor was an absolute hero to me this year,” says Sophie Turner, who first met Taylor Swift 10 years ago. “I’ve never been more grateful to anyone than I am for her because she took my children and me, and provided us with a home and a safe space.

[Article link](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/sophie-turner-british-vogue-interview?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned)
She really said “picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife”
>“Taylor was an absolute hero to me this year,” says Turner, who first met Swift around a decade prior but, for obvious reasons, hadn’t felt she was able to cultivate the friendship. When she found herself in New York last September without a place to stay, she reached out to Swift in hopes the pop star might know someone renting. Swift immediately offered up her place for free. “I’ve never been more grateful to anyone than I am for her because she took my children and me, and provided us with a home and a safe space,” she says. “She really has a heart of gold.”

Really sweet of her 💖
For those who don’t know, Sophie Turner had a (messy) divorce process with Joe Jonas, and Taylor Swift publicly supported her and provided her with an apartment to stay at with her children in the US (Sophie is from the UK).
Oh, this is amazing! Props for Taylor Swift for going out of her way to help Sophie Turner. 

A bunch of people thought this was out of pettiness against Joe Jonas, but I think Taylor Swift really did want to help Sophie Turner.
"I see here you wore a Mr. Perfectly Fine friendship bracelet? In that case, just take my apartment for the time being."
Anyone who has been fan of Tsylor's for any length of time will not be surprised by this story. There are numerous stories of similar generosity going all the way back to the start of her career. It's not an act it's who she is.
She has consistently been highly praised as a good generous person by people who know her well.
Funny how the tabloids never wanna' talk about things like this, lol. Doesn't shock me in the least. I don't think folks realize how genuinely generous she actually is.
Is this thread being infiltrated or something lmao these comments are so odd??? 

Taylor helped out a friend in need when she didn’t have to do that. It was a wonderfully lovely thing of her to do, especially considering Sophie had her children with her and likely didn’t have many other friends or family members around in the states. 

Taylor offered her home to take away the burden of Sophie having to suddenly figure out where to go, how long they could stay there, and where to keep her children secure and safe while she also dealt with the legal stuff with JJ. She didn’t have to, but she did, and Sophie is grateful to her for it. 

I’m failing to see why Sophie thanking her and saying she’s grateful is an issue 🤷🏼‍♀️
This is so sweet. What a wonderful friend.
Truly a heroine with an e!
Taylor is a girls girl. I will always love that about her.
Siri play “vigilante shit” please
Why is this thread getting brigaded by unempathetic dickheads?
Hmm... I wonder if any songs on TTPD are actually about Joe Jones 🤔 I'm just flashing back to that pic of her listening to Sophie at dinner
[removed]
I find it hard to believe she couldn’t find a place. Very nice of Taylor obviously, again just struggling to believe she couldn’t find anywhere to rent. It’s not like money is an issue
Why couldn’t Sophie get her own apartment? (I don’t mean this snarky, I genuinely don’t understand the logistics of this being necessary)
While this is nice, sure, Sophie Turner is rich…can she not afford her own place? There was certainly no chance she and her kids were going to be sleeping on the street.
That is not Emily Blunt in the photo?
Not to detract from this story, but is Sophie not in a place financially where she could get an apartment for her and her kids?

Edit: Y’all can chill out lmao
I mean that's great of her but it doesn't make her a hero lol 😅😆.
[removed]
[removed]
She’s a billionaire, she could buy her an apartment if she wanted
Isn’t Sophie also loaded though? Surely she could afford an appartment
I don’t like Sophie because she’s supported some really hateful/racist stuff about Meghan Markle – that being said, I also think the ongoing divorce case is pretty messed up, so good on Taylor to literally open her home to her family! 
i send their babies presents ❌

i let their babies stay with me while their wife drops their ass ✅
To be precise she let her stay downstairs in her apartment!  Ie Taylor voluntarily lived with a 4 year old… she’s a saint (To be clear… this is parent humor) 
Taylor showed up to Travis' football game, thus confirming she was dating Travis, shortly after the news of Sophie's divorce was a big story in the news.  The Taylor-Travis news was a bigger story for most news outlets and social media, so Sophie's divorce got less coverage.  
  
   
I don't think this is a coincidence.  I think Taylor chose to go public when she did so that she could protect her friend from the tabloids.     
 
That's just speculation on my part though.
Wow that's awesome, I didn't know that
But I thought Taylor was just inserting herself because she wants attention all the time /s
I read a headline where Sophie spoke why they got divorced. Why?
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Taylor is helping out her friend. 

But isn't Sophie worth like $10 million? Or more if Joe has to pay up. Calling Taylor a hero for this comes off as just a little funny, I'm sure Sophie wouldn't have had issue renting anywhere lol
I think some of The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived (especially the bridge) could apply to Joe Jonas too after all the shady PR tactics he pulled against Sophie to make her look like a bad mom and a party animal during the divorce.
It wasn’t pettiness against JJ because it helped him stay close to the kids while they sorted the divorce.

A kind thing to do that helped everyone involved
even I thought it was a bit odd taylor was involving herself. sorry I doubted your golden heart tay princess 🥹
Some of them did, but thought it was pettiness against Joe Jonas.
That’s the smallest man who ever lived. He’s an inch taller than me and I’m a female😂
I think it’s not that - she reached out asking references to get a place. But it’s much easier when you can stay at someone else’s fully furnished house and don’t have to think if you have pans when the kid wants Kraft Mac and cheese.
It’s more like having to find a secure place overnight for your kids (and figure out schooling arrangements) is really hard. Also she was probably paying exorbitant legal expenses (and not sure how long the divorce will take to finalize). That legal process could’ve genuinely taken most of what she had available at the time, especially if her and Joe’s assets were entwined in any way. Her immediately getting a place to stay that comes with Taylor’s security was probably immensely relieving, financially and mentally.
She probably could have, and she probably would have been fine, but Taylor decided to make Sophie’s life 10x easier at one of the worst points. She basically needed accommodation over night with two little kids. Do you know how much work it is to keep two little kids alive *without* anything else to do?
Timing is also an issue. I believe there were time constraints.
I think real estate in NYC is tight for everyone.
[Link to a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/s/teoQdpIsrQ) earlier asking the same question. You can read the responses to it there!
Definitely not, but I’m sure Taylor’s place is super secure which means it’s one less thing for Sophie to worry about since attention was on her during that time.
Maybe her cash/assets were tied with Joe it reveals her privacy to him and also paps? I don't think she was insinuating she would've been homeless, but at the time sje needed a safe haven. 

I don't think she was planning to stay in the U.S. she could've maybe rented a place, but again you still go through paperwork/legal trouble with strangers.
Omg I see it. She looks a bit like Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada in that picture
She probably could, and she initially approached Taylor for information on vacant places she could get, and it was Taylor who offered her own apartment for free. An apartment with security and furnished with food and entertainment available in short order must have been a godsend.
She didn’t donate a penthouse apartment, she helped a friend who reached out for her assistance during a difficult time.
yeah I don't really get the whole Taylor saved her thing. Obviously what Taylor did was really nice but she's a billionaire, she couldn't just rent an apartment?
She probably could, and she went to Taylor for information on somewhere available for rent, and it was Taylor who offered her own apartment.
I haven’t heard about this. Do you have a source? (Genuinely asking I promise)
Having raised three kids, I understand your humor.
I assume that it was the townhouse because she owns two other units in the building and one is basically access to the townhouse next door.
Wait, her kid can't possibly be 4 already. She was just (game of thrones season 8 spoilers) >!crowned queen of the north!<
I have raised 3 kids and my best friend has a 4yo.

You're not at all wrong
Not being a parent but having friends and relatives that have children, I get you!
Apparently (and this is all based on stuff I’ve read), Joe said that he was willing to move to the UK to be closer to Sophie and her family/friends but then changed his mind about it and filed for divorce. This would’ve been okay if he didn’t get his PR to write many articles about how she was a bad mother because she’s a party animal (which is completely untrue since she’s known to be an introverted homebody). 

Basically he was dragging her name through the mud to get custody of their kids and finally only stopped once he realized that the negative PR against her wasn’t working since she actually had a lot of public support.
it’s probably more about the speed and security of getting a place. even celebrities have to sign leases, which would take time
The non-truncated quote explains that Turner originally contacted Swift to ask about who in her network might have something to rent and then Swift offered her own place rent-free:

> “Taylor was an absolute hero to me this year,” says Turner, who first met Swift around a decade prior but, for obvious reasons, hadn’t felt she was able to cultivate the friendship. When she found herself in New York last September without a place to stay, she reached out to Swift in hopes the pop star might know someone renting. Swift immediately offered up her place for free. “I’ve never been more grateful to anyone than I am for her because she took my children and me, and provided us with a home and a safe space,” she says. “She really has a heart of gold.”
Celebrity net worths are often heavily inflated online, several have said they’re nowhere near as rich as people believe, also a lot celebs money is tied up in investments, property and just general possessions, plus divorces are costly. 

Sophie probably doesn’t have anywhere close to $10 million cash on hand plus it’s the relief of not quickly having to find somewhere to rent, that’s also suitable for young children.
Setting aside finances, when you’re getting a divorce you’re not in the best headspace, you’re overwhelmed stressed and then she still has to parent her kids through this. Taylor Swift offering her an easy place to crash, probably with very tight security, probably felt like such a relief. Not to mention the emotional support that one feels when someone opens their home to you. Celebrities are still humans
I vaguely recall that sometimes assets can be frozen when divorce proceedings start so a lot of her money may not be accessible even if it is there.
I think she mainly only has GoT money (and it’s been years since that show ended) and it’s also nice to not worry about finding a place to live in when you’re fighting a messy divorce. In the article it states that she just asked Taylor if she knew of any available places to rent and she offered Sophie her apartment for free. I believe getting that kind of worry off your shoulders is very relieving during a difficult time like that.
I think finding a place to rent with appropriate security (since there was a lot of public interest in the divorce) while also running up expensive legal bills is bound to be incredibly stressful, even for a person with money. A friend just taking that off your plate would be huge for anyone I think
She’s better suited than pretty much anyone else in that situation.

But she’s still a mother of two going through a divorce, and money can be sometimes hard to access during a divorce. What Taylor did was incredibly kind.
Aside from the very wealthy not necessarily having enough liquidity to just get a new place quickly, I'm sure the concern was mostly with finding some place safe/secure from paparazzi, fans, potential stalkers, etc. Taylor obviously has security locked down on any of her properties, so Sophie/the kids would be able to quickly move in without worrying about the logistics of arranging all that.
Sophie would have 0 issue finding a place to stay, but, it would probably have to be a hotel and with kids, that's not homey.

Also, Taylor offering allowed a more homey/comfy vibe for Sophie and her kids. In addition, it's nice to have a support system.
She’s probably having legal troubles and that kind of stuff and can’t move back yet
Kind of a funny contrast:

“So dignified in your well-pressed suit”

Vs.

“In your Jehovah's Witness suit”
Ooooo that never occurred to me, but as someone dealing with a similar situation, this hit deep. I'm going to have to go relisten now.
I never thought of it that way but true. I completely agree with the analogy that joe is the smallest man that ever lived. Not just physically but also figuratively. Fuck that loser.
How was she involving herself when she’s literally been friends with Sophie for years?
Oh yes, she couldn't have done it because she's literally sent his kid's presents and had a semi-friendship with Sophie for years now, absolutely not.

As if she's literally not allowed to grow up and grow out of old feelings.

For the record, the sarcasm is 100% aimed at the media, not you lol.
Most people just dont really want to read about millionaires helping other millionaires.
Why does this matter at all
Hardest part about leaving a crappy situation is almost always money.
Imagine the rest of us in the real world who just have to get a hotel 😅 This was nice of Taylor (and completely unnecessary) but Sophie absolutely didn’t need it. She’s a millionaire and it’s absurd she had to call TS for help.
It’s funny to me that people think this is about rent money and not security 
[removed]
People don’t get that on a couple years, Taylor may release an album called poop.  Entirely consisting of songs about poop.

It will be the most relatable album she’s ever made.
I’ll use this comment to talk about a recent dad joke/parent humor that was not understanded (lol) and made me look bad. 

We were talking about the pains of childbirth and I said “I’ve had a cold before”. The joke being about men being babies when they are sick (and of course *not* about childbirth being easy). Maybe I’m just chronically online 

My wife’s family did not laugh 😭
Nods solemnly
To make matters worse he waited until she was out of the country working in the UK to spring a divorce on her so she had to come back to the U.S. to settle it and the kids were in his physical care. 

She wasn't out there wilding it up and abandoning the kids, she was working as an actor and he had asked her for the kids to remain in the U.S. with him while she was busy.
WHAT THE HELL

honestly Taylor had a blessing in disguise there
I always knew that Joe Jonas was up to no good. Once a scum, always a scum.
Also if she’s in the midst of a divorce, she probably doesn’t want to put her name on anything that could then be included in the divorce
And not every apartment wants a celebrity living there. Other residents would have to contend with paparazzi hanging out that they didn't agree to. Taylor's already got security and her neighbors are used to her by now
Sure, but I'm pretty sure she could afford a very nice hotel room in the meantime.
Right...  "Net worth" does not mean that's the amount of cash they have on hand.
Probably some X-men $ as well
I’m sorry and I hope things get better for you 🤍
I didn’t know how deep their friendship was or how close they actually were. all I saw was joe and sophie getting a divorce and her suddenly stepping out with tay. it looked like a fuck you to joe, which was weird since taylor and joe was a teenage thing. just goes to show people shouldn’t make assumptions.
Yeah and not to mention, she was also friends with Gigi when she was with Joe, this isn't the first time it's happened.

And especially since Sophie is also such a huge Swiftie! Taylor is always so thankful to the people who support her and I’m sure she was more than happy to help Sophie during such a hard time.
It's just a joke about the smallest man who's ever lived song title being about him, since he's shorter than average
Research backs that up, at least on the DV side of things Not saying Joe Jonas is abusive although there are multiple things making me side-eye him.
I know right? I struggled to find an apartment to live in because there’s a rental crisis in my city. I would’ve loved for a friend of mine to be like “here you can live in my spare apartment for free” lol 

Some people I know found an apartment MONTHS after searching because there’s such a high demand and low supply of rental units where I live. 

Not saying this would’ve been the case for Sophie but it’s nice to not have to worry about such things during a child custody battle.
[removed]
“And my friends all smell like weed or little babies”
I joked with my husband that my boy only breaks his favorite toys is for her younger audience. kids can relate lmao
And it will be a surprise triple album.

The second album has songs about snot rockets, refusing to put clothes on, rocks and sticks, and asking existential questions and corresponding meltdowns at bedtime. There will be a song where it is just screaming and crying (Blank Space - Taylor's Tots Remix?).

The third album will be the most popular song with the under 5 crowd, but repeating over and over so parents don't have to remember to press the repeat/rewind/go back button at the end of the song before leaving the driveway.
That niche is taken by The Odd Man Who Sings About Pee and Poop. My god I have listened to way too many of his songs!!
Lol. As a guy, I don't make such jokes. Too much chance of a misfire.
Taylor is also a huge GoT girlie. Of course she’s going to raise her banners for the Queen in the North 😆
Yup, I got here from /r/all but my s/o's largest struggle has been finances because her abusive ex basically vanished without a trace when she asked for a divorce, leaving both her and her child to fend for themselves.  He also attempted to empty all their bank accounts but she thought ahead for that one, and locked him out (they were in her name only because his credit and bank history are trash).

But I don’t know, I wake up in a malaise, and I walk here and there… at night I…I sometimes wake up and I turn to some old lady in my bed that’s on my arm. A lady that I once loved, doc. I don’t know where to turn to. My youngest, Alexendria, she fell in the…in the cold of last year. The cold took her down, as it did many of us. And my other boy, and this is the hardest pill to swallow, doc. My other boy, Gregarro Ivinalititavitch… I no longer love him. As much as it pains me to say, when I look in his eyes, all I see is the same cowardice that I… that I catch when I take a glimpse of my own face in the mirror. If only I wasn’t such a coward, then perhaps…perhaps I could bring myself to reach over to that cocked and loaded gun that lays on the bedside behind me and end this hellish facade once and for all…Doc, sometimes I feel like a spider, even though I’m a moth, just barely hanging on to my web with an everlasting fire underneath me. I’m not feeling good. And so the doctor says, “Moth, man, you’re troubled. But you should be seeing a psychiatrist. Why on earth did you come here?”
There’s no fucking way
Klopp if he'd stayed one more season at Liverpool:
I knew Klopp couldn’t stay away from the game. 

Nice try, Jurgen.
You sure?
And still people say that Ocean’s 12 is unrealistic.

This looks like those stupid AI pictures they make of a player wearing the shirt of their rumored future team

"SOURCES: Jurgen Klopp to join Shaktar Donetsk!"
My grandma took a job as the traffic controller at the local school. She did not even need the money, just something to give her purpose to get out of the house each day.

I can see Klopp fullfilling his life long dream of being a rehab therapist To have something to do in retirement.
Hmm that's exactly what someone hiding Jurgen Klopp would say!
When you order Klopp from Wish
He looks more like Klopp than Klopp looks like Klopp.
That's an AI image of Jurgen Klopp and you can't convince me otherwise

Damm they really do look alike
Igor Grshkloppvych
they should’ve tried to tell us his name was Klurgen Jopp
Jürgeyev Klopsky.
He just could stay away from the game
thought it was an AI generated image
The Klopp look is so HOT right now!
He should open a rehabilitation studio by this time 😅
Naw this is his dad
Uncanny valley Klopp
Everything looks like klopp except his nipples, gotcha
Looks like an AI image of old Klopp lmao

Man goes to coach. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, 'Treatment is simple. Great coach Gryshkovych is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.' Man bursts into tears. Says, 'But doctor…I am Gryshkovych'

Huh... out of all the people to have a doppelgänger i never expected Klopp somehow.
I heard what that guy did in the 90's... with cable... HUGE
European names throw me for a loop sometimes. 10 letters and only 1 being a vowel is crazy.
I refuse to believe that’s not Klopp
lmao he looks so similar
Say what you want but I have never seen Igor Grshkovych and Jurgen Klopp in the same room at the same time
If Klopp's age filter was a person..
Ok holy f*ck that’s eerie in similarity
This is Jurgi Kloppovich.


Put some respect on the man's name!
Does he have the pearly white teeth?
Grisha Yeager
Always knew Klopp would try to sneak back into football😁
I believe this is what Klopp would look like if he had joined United instead
I wholeheartedly believe every person has a doppelganger for a Billion people. That is 8 people who all look eerily similar to each other.
Still better than Southgate

It doesn't, but this is exactly like that.

It’s temu now
Grshkovych is much better quality
Stole the joke from down there lol
If you photoshop the Shaktar dude on the right, you'll have young Klopp, Klopp and old Klopp.
It's like the footballing version of [carcinisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation) except instead of everything ending up as crabs, all managers end up as Klopps and Peps.
Not anymore 🥲
damn he looks so young there
This is unironically 2018 Klopp, even the jacket he's wearing looks similar to the jackets we used to have around that period.
*When I go to the Klopp I wanna hear those Klopp Classics 🎶*
This is Klopp when he was released back in 2010, when the character design was still a bit clunky

It’s not exactly unthinkable, but too right, this guy just replied to an unrelated top comment with the same thing and has around 900% more engagement lmao
Oh my God!   The universe!  It’s Klopps all the way down!
Here a Klopp, there a Klopp, everywhere a Klopp Klopp
It's a style called Kloppocore, otherwise known as Klopp Chic
I googled it "Klopp 2018" and you are right, second picture is almost exactly like this, the glasses, the jacket, the length of hair, the beard trim and somehwat also the beards color. Amazing.

You absolute Brat you
That would’ve been a sick chant

Wouldn't say the comment is unrelated at all.
>  900% more engagement lmao

Fucking hell, social media/influencer brainrot is real. People need to cure themselves of constantly worrying about 'engagement' in every online interaction.
[removed]
Didn't manage at all... This is just him after he was linked to the job
Nanoseconds
[deleted]
Possibly yea, but it was just to illustrate the point more hyperbolically

Because often times replies to top comments aren’t particularly related at all, we’ve all been either guilty or witnesses to it
Hum, o-kay, apparently pointing out a figure to show how stark the difference is between two differently positioned equivalent comments is worthy of needing a cure for smth 🤷‍♀️

Plus never did I even *worry* about it, like…?

But btw engagement is a real and useful metric in the real world besides social media, many businesses do well to track it
Hansel is that you?
It's the thought that ages you
Ugly ugly ugly ewww so ugly
I mean it was just a joke, so I tacked it on another joke, it’s quite an old one actually since Klopp is German and so is the word doppelgänger, I should imagine there’s a few people that made it in the thread.
> But btw engagement is a real and useful metric in the real world besides social media, many businesses do well to track it

It's a dumb copy and pasted joke on reddit. Who gives a shit which copy and pasted joke has more 'engagement'?
There’s no issue at all, don’t feel the need to justify yourself, they were just a couple of observations
Well if you want to dive into it, I think there’s some conclusions to draw, eg just how much more difficult it is to get perspectives across by burying it in the thread vs using the top comment for visibility, because it’s such a huge difference

About this particularly, it’s fucking irrelevant and obviously idc about the actual content, then again, was just quantifying the difference at the time…
Oh hey no it’s cool, I get the optics, something I’ve learnt from Reddit is there is very rarely an original thought, not that people necessarily copy each other, just that if a thousand people comment on something, an awful lot of that is gonna be the same as someone else has put, especially when it comes to puns, especially when they are about a famous person and extra extra especially when that person has a one syllable name.  If you want an example, type Kloppelgänger into Google and see how many results pop up.
Damn, you must be bored.
> something I've learnt from Reddit is there is very rarely an original thought

Welcome to the internet
Not enough to so resolutely complain about the concept of “engagement” though

Original comment was a “Dune” (Frank Herbert novel) reference. The fan in the video looks just like  the character “Baron Harkonnen” from Dune and one of his famous lines is “This is my desert. My Arrakis. My Dune.”

Dune shares a lot of similarities with Heart of Darkness, so you are getting downvoted for missing the more obvious reference for a deep cut.

What an interesting name for an album and a new era!!! I thought all the black and white was related to Reputation. Or is this also in black and white now because of Reputation and it won’t be black and white? I don’t know what to do, I thought she was announcing Reputation, what do I do with my hands???

I questioned if I was clowning too hard but guess not! Sometimes it works!!
I was not expecting a new album before the re-recordings came out. I’m shocked
I keep mentally calling it the Dead Poets Society lmao
Does she ever stop?! Incredible
WHAT A TWIST
Tortured poet?? Ohh this is gonna be EMOTIONAL AF

especially after all her experiences in the last 2-3 years since midnights was conceived you know we’re up for a wild ride!!
I WAS HERE
Whoever called out the *Rerecord, Rerecord, Album* pattern in that one post I read a month ago won tonight.
Red herring indeed with all the supposed Rep references lol. This was the last thing I expected to hear tonight but BOY am I hyped

Taylor’s new Instagram profile photo.
WTF
APRIL 19 IS NATIONAL CAT LADY DAY
Don’t let anything distract you from the fact that this is her first album title since Speak Now to be more than one word long.

Also, I’m pretty sure I have finals around the time the current release date is, which sucks, so I may have to listen after my finals are over.
I’M IN THIS THREAD FOR THE HISTORY
I thought she was joking.
The cover!!!!
Where were you when taylor swift announced
I have never been this excited to be miserable
If I learned one thing from Midnights, it’s not to take the photos/aesthetics as an indication of what it’ll sound like
This album will destroy me

petition to rename this sub to The Tortured Swifties Department until April
Did anyone catch the embedded words in the source code when her website was briefly “down” - CHAIRMAN, BRUISES, VEINS, CADENCE, APPLE CAKE, TALISMAN, LOVE BOMBS, MUSE, INK, EVIDENCE and FAKE.  

Could they be TPD song titles?  Some of these words also appear in the hand written note in the new album post…
PLOT TWIST. WAS NOT EXPECTING A WHOLE BRAND NEW ALBUM
Guys I'm just so worried about what she's going to do when the album is out. She only has ten fingers but she'll have eleven albums. How is she going to do her nails?????? Get a eleventh finger? Paint over the debut fingernail??? I NEED TO KNOW.
can i just say, i love the soft sunlight coming through in this cover. quite literally midnight is over and the morning is here

Yessss I love dramatic English department Taylor!! Manifesting more Aaron Dessner on this one 🙏
The cover is so hot

And yeah she made us all clowns yet again

But also Rep TV when 😭
She said Reputation? Nah we got bigger things going on! Always pulling the rug out from under us! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO!
My neighbors probably hate me OMG I WAS SCREAMING I DID NOT EXPECT THAT
I'm hoping for the vibes of This Is Me Trying/Mirrorball/Happiness/Evermore/You're On Your Own Kid/The Great War. Like I want to be emotionally destroyed.
Two years ago is right around when “You’re Losing Me” was recorded 🤔🤔
There’s no way this isn’t *the* breakup album
The title instantly reminded me of Dead Poets Society. And it was released in 1989...
We are so lucky to be Taylor Swift fans. I really feel like no other artist is consistently releasing so much quality music back to back. Quality over quantity, but she literally gives us both. And she looks like she’s having so much fun with it too. 

(Obviously haven’t heard the album yet, but come on, it’s Taylor. We know it’s going to be good!)
Wait...track 5 is called So Long, London?!

OH BOY 😳
SHE FUCKING DID It AGAIN OH MY GOD
I'm a grown ass man who works in farming and construction and here I am not being able to sleep because Taylor just announced a brand new album
This is going to be confessional as fuck. I think we are in for a wild ride. I'm so excited!

If this is going to be a combination of The Lakes’ lyrical style with a clean pop sound I’ll die more dead than I’ve ever died 🪦
oh this is the album she wrote at the lakes where all the poets went to die
SCREAMING CRYING THROWING UP
OK IF SHE HAS BEEN KEEPING THIS A SECRET FOR 2 YEARS

This is pre-Travis

And is it pre-Joe breakup????????????
This title feels very Aaron Dessner!!
Every time there is a big announcement like this, I am blown away by how she manages to keep it a secret. I’m sure she keeps it close but even so, there’s SO MANY people on her team involved in coordinating photo shoot, recording, production, marketing… just so wild and honestly impressive that it’s not leaked that she’s about to drop a new album
Here are all my jumbled thoughts so far- the album design and name make me think of university lit courses- musically and vibes wise I’m thinking songs are going to sound like The Lakes, Dear Reader, False God, Slut! Artsy and jazzy, singer-songwriter but not “folky.” I’m also agreeing with people that think this could be a very collaborative album- probably Jack Antanoff, Lana, Kelsea Ballerini, Aaron Dessner making appearances on the album.

ETA- I feel like this album is going to sound very different from most of her previous work and will be polarizing for fans.
I feel like this would be the breakup album that people thought Midnights was. The second true breakup album after Red. I am excited, I hope it is focusing on the lyricism more than the heavy synth sounds.
So for everyone waking up… how you feeling? 😂
I'm struggling to fully form this thought but I'm thinking this whole tortured poets thing is going to be satire. Somehow I feel like she's going to twist it and be like hey it's okay you can be an artist and also live a life, with an indirect connection to Joe for (me assuming here) being a tortured artist. 

Idk maybe this makes no sense. It's giving "everybody is an art bro lately" especially given the timing of 2 years and the releasing of the date of you're losing me. 

Anyway I can't wait!
For anyone who has seen the Eras Tour Concert Movie, she literally said, "I remember people would come up to me and be like, 'So you put out like 5 albums that you haven't done tours for, so what's your plan? What are you going to do? You gonna just like, do a show with all the albums in it? And it'll be what, like a 3 and a half hour long show?' And I was like, 'Yeah. It's going to be called the Eras Tour. See you there.'"  


Lover, folklore, evermore, Midnights? What was the 5th? 

The Tortured Poets Department
here is my submission for what this album should sound like if i get my way:

- false god
- you’re losing me 
- illicit affairs
- dancing with our hands tied 
- glitch 
- you’re not sorry
YALL HEAR ME OUT HEAR ME OUT

she said 2 years she’s been working on this album so around February 2022

What if this album is the project she had started working on with Aaron before she went into midnights???? Remember Aaron did an interview a while ago saying they were working on new music? I’m telling you that’s what it is I CAN FEEL IT. Didn’t they start working on new music around the time of the Grammys 2022?????????
HOLY SHIT NEW ALBUM NEW ERA
Looks like a "morning after" Midnights kind of album. Can't wait.
So was her academic/collegiate style of streetwear a hint to this album this whole past year?
The fact that the colour seems to be white is very much symbolic of this being a blank slate - like she wants a grown up minimal aesthetic and I’m very here for it. It also feels a little less like an era and more just like a rebrand for her - like this is a more simple, paired back style for her moving forwards with her music and everything that comes along with it. Blank slate baby!
Oh my god.
I am unwell
 Is she actually human???? I really cannot comprehend her ability to continually outdo herself over and over and over again. Just mind blowing really.
Funny theory but hear me out! 
What if the tortured poets department is basically an album of collabs with her songwriting idols? How cool would it be? I feel like Lana is already gonna play (has played) a part in TTPD.
Someone in the popculture sub mentioned that Joe was in a group with Paul Mescal called The Tortured Man Club. I'm sure that's a coincidence tho... 🤡
I’m waiting ten minutes because that damn clock chocker has me thinking something is at midnight lmao
Waking up in the UK like WHAT
This is going to be the soundtrack to every dark academia girlie’s life.
Her recent fashion makes sense now. I’ve thought these past several pap walk photos she’s looked very academia with dark tones, maroon, plaid, leather. We might’ve been too hasty with the black = Rep.
this subreddit in particular owes me an apology for doggin me for saying we're getting ts11 after 1989
That album art is really giving me False God vibes, slow, sultry and jazzy.
My boyfriend causally says to me, “Taylor announced she’s releasing a new album at the Grammys” like there was no prep. No enthusiasm, no bracing myself. I literally just watched long pond earlier. I don’t even want to speculate what the sound of this album will be after my 70’s vibe of midnights was way off
Hold up. If this is a secret she’s kept for two years, that means it was written around the same time as “You’re Losing Me” in late 2021…….. this is the breakup album!!!
This is the weirdest album title in her entire discography and I love it
This is her longest album title.

All her other albums are 1 or 2 words.
It makes sense she’s been wearing so many preppy outfits in NYC over the last 6 months!!! She was hinting all along.
Ok so 
1. THATS what red herring meant
2. My theory is there will be a lot of collabs on this album…. Poets department!!
3. This cover… I’m not sure about it, it feels too similar to midnights with the white border for an album that came right after midnights. But the more I look at it I also see rep (b&w), 1989 (face crop she loved so much), and folklore (b&w…… and poets???)
Her femme fatale Grammy look, and the black and white theme are very film noir. The evidence labels are also very fitting of that theme. I am curious if we see more of this aesthetic with this album.

Also the fact that she signed it “chariman” and plural “poets” makes me think there will be more collaborations.
I am legitimately in shock. The album cover is amazing. This album sounds like it's going to be amazing. I can't believe we're only two months away from so much more new Taylor music!

(Also, these next two months are going to be The Tortured Swifties Department waiting for this to drop)
Literally begging on my hands and knees this is a collab with Aaron Dessner. PLS MORE CONEY ISLAND AND RENEGADE VIBES 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is such a weird amount of merch for a bonus track! Stickers, a bookmark, a special file? Either she has strong reason to believe it'll be iconic, or there's something tricky about "The Manuscript"...

In her time portrait, there are 4 letters from friendship bracelet beads scattered. They are…

P..O..E..T
Can we talk album name- her albums have mostly been one word with Taylor Swift and Speak Now being 2. This is a real change up. Do we think that will be the new trend going forward or os this a one off?
I hope this album is the gut wrenching, make cry and feel depressed style album I was expecting from midnights
Anyone notice this ?

https://preview.redd.it/7gynt7ypqsgc1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d58e69e76ccc35718948217cbd486fc3dd5765a
She said this was a 2 year secret. So, this is the same timeline as when "You're Losing Me" was written. This album will be torture on our souls!
First friendship bracelet :)

Joe Alwyn having a group chat called "The Tortured Man Club" is KILLING ME
Taylor Swift: recorded an entire fucking album while on tour and also doing the Taylor's Version re-recordings.

Me: I was going to vacuum today, but I already did laundry, and that's just too much for one day.
I’m sorry did she actually announce an album at the Grammys?! She really is unpredictable omg. That TITLE AND ALBUM COVER THO 🩶🩶🩶
She out Easter egged on everyone. What a bad B. I love her
https://preview.redd.it/sauhw2icqogc1.jpeg?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc595e0fed498f8a3abdde7f5c065b45ee21d712

acted fast
i love this soft sensual album look its so out of box for her and so much different from her other albums. Its new and fresh
We are being fed. It’s so good being a Taylor fan.
This is the hottest album cover of Taylor's career.

crazy.
It's giving The National mixed with Lana vibes. The artwork and the title. Maybe some Dessner magic with this one?! That'd be phenomenal. Super exciting news all around!!
Please be a really emotional fueled album. Folklore was so good!
Anyone else immediately think about the group chat Joe was in with Paul Mescal called “The Tortured Man Club” ?
TOTALLY SHOOK! love that we were all clowning for rep and i really feel that if this black and white is really the “white” album to reps “black” then this album serves as an inversion of rep— so her reputation is at its best but her love (with joe ig) is destroyed. 

Either way very excited! Think that the cover is so beautiful and im predicting its gonna be very folklore sounding with more rock-y instrumentals maybe a little more alt thrown in there but who knows!
🎶 Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die 🎶
There will be no explanation.. there will just be tortured poets
Not pre-ordering because I fully expect a whole lineup of different variations unfortunately.
Is no one talking about the fact that the Vinyl edition is a full on book?

I think we’ll get a “manuscript edition” that will come with an actual poetry book.
Ok but the pattern is now 100% confirmed. So like… 2 TVs, and a new album, 2 TVs, a new album, 2 TVs left, and then another new album?!?!
i’m being very normal and regular about this
okay this is so specific but i feel like this album will be a mix of would’ve could’ve should’ve, last kiss, death by a thousand cuts, seven, and invisible string
reminder to anyone scrambling to pre-order... there will be other drops, don't let fomo get the best of you. even better, support your local record stores and get it from them instead of Taylor's store!
Okay so we are thinking like sultry dark pop, right? Like a false god, dress kinda feel?
Me with eras tickets for Oct 25 wondering what this drop means for the setlist 👁️👄👁️
The font used is Caslon or Big Caslon for anyone interested.
the title is really fascinating to me, one of my favorites of hers

it gives 'dead poets society' as well as ['tortured man club'](https://twitter.com/icourtneycries/status/1754338572235116856) but a department is not a society or a club, it's a thing at a job. i hope thus the record goes into like the commoditization of pain being an artist like her
April 19 is apparently National “Poetry and the Creative Mind” Day in the US. 
😳😳😳
I don’t want this to be a collab album! Please don’t let it be a collab album. 
!!! I just know this will be folklore/evermore vibes and I’m so excited for it
[deleted]
I am soooooo conflicted right now. Like, YAY NEW ALBUM but she’s also in the middle of a huge tour so how does it fit in. I do think it was a bit strange to announce it while accepting a Grammy, but she is literally a handful of artists ever that can get away with it. 

What is it going to sound like?! Two years?! Is it a Folklore/Evermore fictional world? Or more autobiographical? I can’t deny, I need to hear some Travis songs but I don’t think there will be too many, if any on it. UGHHHHH I DONT KNOW HOW TO FEEL
Also, April 19th is the same day last year that she went to dinner with friends (I think Blake, Gigi, and Haim sisters?) and they all unfollowed Joe afterwards on that same day 👀
Theory- it’s the breakup album. You’re Losing Me was the bridge song hinting at the next era, which is why it dropped so late
OH MY GOD
Loving the album cover. I’m here for this era.
SHE HAS GOT TO BE KIDDING LMAO no kidding it’s a red herring

TAYLOR!!!

The cover omfg what
Wow.  Clown car for Reputation derailed.

April 19th!!
the fact that she said she kept this a secret for 2 years makes me think this is a folklore/evermore situation again but w midnights

which means im FREAKING OUT BECAUSE EVERMORE IS MY FAVORITE OUT OF THE TWO
She’s been keeping this secret FOR THE LAST 2 YEARS?! If it’s that old, will the album be mostly centred around her last relationship, or something more fictional?

I wonder if and how it’ll be incorporated into The Eras Tour?!
Same exact energy as when Peeta said "If it weren't for the baby" during Catching Fire
it confirms my theory every two rerecordings is an album
I love the title, and I'm hoping the songwriting destroys me.
Oh my god she’s insane
As a Dear Reader and folkmore stan, I think this album is definitely for me! So excited!
What the actual fuck like are you fucking kidding me like what the fuck are we supposed to do like holy fuck like oh my fucking god
Given the title, I'm thinking concept record with a lot of "tortured poet" collabs. She's the "chairman" so that implies there are members. (Unless members are the fans?)
And to know Travis was privy to all of this 👀👀
Totally just realized that the extras for the deluxe CD are called “artifacts”. Like finding the artifacts in hits different??
I can immediately tell I will be SUCH a ho for this one
We’re on a one album per award show schedule now 💀💀💀
Honestly, I am not surprised. We know she's been working on this for ages. We've seen her go in and out of the studio plenty of times. We know she pretty much doesn't stop writing. She wrote, recorded and made an entire album (folklore) in a few months when she had time to focus. She just doesn't stop apparently!
https://preview.redd.it/fa3y7dd65qgc1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4655ee769dca9faa33828ac9d8a934ec8080758e

Omg it was the new album title backwards😱
I'm SO HERE for the folkloreXrep photoshoot vibes CRYING rn
Love that she’s releasing this during national poetry month
It makes sense now that she has no tour dates in April.

This has been planned for so freaking long
I hope this album sounds like Midnights+ Folklore + Evermore just so the gatekeepers here of what a good TS album should be can whine some more. /s
I just know imma be saying torture poets society
My guess to why the timing is now is because it’s the close to that chapter of her life. She seems a lot happier now so it would be weird to put out a tortured album months later.
It seems like she’s hinting the era color is white…opposite of black and if Reputation is her love album for Joe then this is the opposite of reputation and is the breakup album 😭
Hear me out. The Tortured Poets Department, poets plural. She’s seated tonight with poets (Lana, Ed, etc). Her note is signed “Chairman of the Tortured poets.”

I think it is a group of them.

I think this album is collaborative.

I think many tortured poets will be featured

!!!!!!!

Coincidence?
Hot take. And I’m sorry but- this is my favourite album cover yet. It’s so sensual
NO WAY
The way I choked when it wasn’t rep tv my bf literally thought I was in a medical emergency
And to think merely 5 hours ago, I was forcing my 46 year old coworker to listen to my rambles about how I just KNEW Taylor was going to announce an album tonight
The album name reminds me of Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers by the National, I wonder if she'll be working with Aaron on this
Album title reminds me of Dead Poets Society
My ex is getting married this month.  It’s almost like she knew I needed this
I started the third trimester of my pregnancy today and there will be a new Taylor Swift album before I give birth I literally cannot.

EDIT: first Folklore surprise drops during my maternity leave with my first kid and now this what even is my life
What amazes me is that Taylor still manages to surprise me. Wasn't expecting this AT ALL
Guys we’re literally so spoiled with all the releases we get lmao
https://preview.redd.it/q54ert4zqogc1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc3ebca44721164f62683155b30c823e2ab6fde4
Looking back at it now, her outfit tonight really feels like the intersection of classy and demure, with a slight sensuality to it.
this is way out of left field but imagine if it sounds like cigarettes after sex? it’s always fun when she dips into different genres
THE WAY SHE GAVE US “RED HERRING” ON HER WEBSITE WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE THING
It's giving "False God" and I'm here for it
she mentioned she’s been keeping this a secret for the past two years. it kinda sounds like she’s been writing and producing these songs way before the Joe breakup
YALL MY FACE WHEN SHE SAID ALBUM AND HOLY SHIT THE BIGGEST PLOT TWIST EVER
u know what?? we clowned but we still won!!!
We all knew she was working on TS11 (TTPD) but I thought she wouldn’t release it until after the end of the Eras Tour in late 2024. Very surprised she releases it on 19 April 2024.
So, "Red Herring" is definitely a track on The Tortured Poets Department, right?!

We were all completely and utterly gagged by this announcement. Everything led to reputation (Taylor's Version), but here we are in the midst of Taylor's strangest album announcement, strangest album cover, strangest album name. 

The main clue of the last 24 hours that we all really grasped onto was "Red Herring" from the secret code in her shop when it was shut down (wink wink (it wasn't actually shut down)). 

Do we think that this phrase is related to TTPD at all?
There's no multiple variants announced (so far), kinda makes me think that it's a "small" release like evermore. I like evermore so this album has a potential to dethrone evermore as my top album.
this is real omg i am  s c r e a m i n g

https://preview.redd.it/mwgw9dn1wogc1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e040643305866b8a63a29609f7e1273eb1f7cc5
What's our theory on the emphasis on clocks? She's wearing a watch on her choker and her instagram highlighted the phrase "tick tick tick"...
Can we just appreciate the time and effort Taylor has put into trolling us for the last few months?
ARE WE OKAY????
This is her longest album name yet (only including the original album titles)
I hope it’s Aaron dessner produced.
it's giving mysterious librarian, it's giving english class, it's giving philosopher office hours, it's giving!!!!! What a time to be a swiftie!
It’s screaming revenge with a quill pen
Strong feeling this is going to be like folklore + reputation.. lyrically supreme like folklore but sounds like rep!!! But then with Taylor anything can happen... literally all of us were clowning a day back that she's announcing rep tv but instead announces TS11!!!
There’s already a detailed entry on Wikipedia. Well done Wikipedia Swifties 🫡
Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die . . . Ahhh I’m so excited!
I'm assuming this is an Aaron Dessner produced project ... part 3 of the Folkmore project.
Not sure if this was mentioned already, but her release date of April 19th is “cat lady day” but was also the start of the American Revelation from the British….. I think the delulu has finally claimed me 😅
this is giving folklore and evermore’s sexy older cousin. like it couldn’t be more perfect
The fact Taylor had to release the tracklist over a month early because some idiot on tiktok leaked it first 
🎶This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things🎶
I just put it together... in Dear Reader she says "burn all the files, desert all your past lives"... and then she burned the Lover house down and wrote TTPD. She has been leading us down this road for a looooong while and we totally missed it.
Well she did it…
calling it now this is the breakup album we didn’t get that was written when they briefly split before the big one which was also the time that inspired hits different and i really try to not make her music about her muses but she calls out muses straight up in the album teaser so i think she’s not even being coy about it IN THIS ESSAY I WILL-
Okay so I have some thoughts! 
1. She totally did this once before too. 2022 MTV music awards she showed up in a jewelry dress. Everyone thought that it was reputation being released because of the jewelry bathtub reference in Look What You Made Me Do. HOWEVER we learned that the dress was really referencing the song ~bejeweled~. Tonight, everyone thought she was releasing reputation because her inner circle and even Taylor herself changed her profile picture to black and white photos of themselves on their Instagram profile picture. We were like omgggg reputation TV is coming! WRONG AGAIN! Ok… so then I wonder if the dress has anything to do with a song on the album. What does the dress look like? A WEDDING DRESS.  {insert you’re losing me “I wouldn’t marry me either, pathological people pleaser”}. Okay, so as we know she just went through a breakup after 6.5 years. A theme in midnights was marriage and how it just wasn’t happening with Joe. I think that means that this album is going to be a breakup album at its core. It’s going to talk about marriage. It’s going to talk about heartbreak. But then, it’s going to talk about falling in love again. 
2. TWOOOO. Ok as you guys know, I’ve always thought folklore was a trilogy. I am a BIG BELIEVER IN THE BRAID THEORY (three strands, three albums & using hair to foreshadow music) My first thought tonight was “wow, she’s wearing a braid tonight!!!” We know that it takes 3 strands to make a braid…… I wonder if it’s going to be folklorey vibes….. ??!!!!
3. I also have a gut feeling it’s going to be a lot of songs similar to the song “dear reader” because that was very ~poetic~ with a different vibe than folklore if she’s going in a different direction. 

These are my initial thoughts that nobody asked for 🖤🤍
It’s black and white. Reputation and Folklore, my top 2 favorite albums, are black and white. THIS IS GONNA BE GOD TIER!
Sexy cover, the CHAIRMAN.

This might get sexy and it might be a concept album (Taylor constantly does concept albums). I don't want it to be another pop album, I want a different sound. But if it's a pop album I'd still like it. I'm thrilled to see her next step.
I’ve just woken up what on earth is happening TAYLOR NOT AGAIN PLEASE WITH THE TIME DIFFERENCE HAVE SOME THOUGHT FOR YOUR EUROPEAN SWIFTIES WE CANT HANDLE IT
https://preview.redd.it/b0ols3pwztgc1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=727bf6fd8684238601b8b5011b73478629045e34
what the fuck
THAT COVER. OMG OMG OMG
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, that’s my due date 😭🥹 confirmed baby swiftie
I know most of us didn't thought she would release any new material (besides the vaults) until the end of the eras tour but I mean... she's on top of the world right now, I hope this album has a lot of experimental tracks (as experimental as she wants at least).
PLEASE MORE AARON
There’s 37k of us online rn I can’t
This makes me think of fan theory that I think might be right. There is an interesting pattern where she released evermore, then the first 2 re recordings. Then midnight, 2 re releases. Now, ttpd, then the last 2 re recordings.
the scream i scrumpt
Pre-ordered!  Have to admit TS11 was not on my radar at all.  Of course we've all been expecting the Rep TV announcement at any minute.  Can't wait for TTPD!
Now why the hell am I in an hour long Taylor Swift merch queue because I have FOMO over a novelty bookmark?
If these are among the lines of you’re losing me… RIP me
I just know this album is going to wreck me emotionally
So it is the two re-records then a new album pattern; interesting! Not mad at all.

Clock and nail polish easter egg still works I feel since black is heavily used on this cover. She's always so many steps ahead of us haha.

I'm starting to wonder if perhaps the Debut TV announcement will be at the final show of The Eras Tour. Shes toured the world and broken all the records, and ends it with getting her name back.
HOLY FUCK WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!!!
You've thrown us into a bit of a loop Taylor! I didn't expect we'd be getting TS11 anytime soon, especially since Debut (TV) and Reputation (TV) haven't been released yet, but I'm not complaining! And what a standout title from all the others! This is going to be a truly unique Taylor Swift album, I can already tell.
It makes sense that this album was two years in the making. 

There are probably songs on there about her and Joe that she wasn’t ready to share when Midnights was also in development and their relationship was hanging by a thread.
Who needs sleep?
Okay but if she hadn't won her 13th Grammy tonight (unlikely, i know but still), would she not have announced TS11?
Tbh I’m getting sexy vibes but also moody. I think it’s gonna be a dark dance pop album with really deep ballads sprinkled. Overall, thoughtful and insightful lyrics.
I fully thought it would be folkmore themed from the name but the album cover is giving i don’t wanna live forever sexy vibes idkkkkkkk
I was so certain her outfits screamed new era, but even then I'm so shocked by it. I still can't believe it. 

(Also, there was this theory that Rep TV and Debut TV would only come out next year, since the pattern had been new album/two rerecords/new album/two records per year (mostly) and 2025 is the year of snake... I've strongly believed in this, but I'm still surprised)
Waited 40 mins and the collectors edition is sold out 😭😭 will there be a restock?
So just re-watched the announcement. Blondie was trying so hard not to laugh. She knew exactly what she had just done to us 😂
Holy shit, I didn’t really put it together, but this is likely going to be a breakup album right? Alls fair in love and pottery kinda has me thinking that. 
AND SHE WON AOTY HOLY CRAP!!!!!
I wonder if she announced TPD early because she felt she may not win AOTY a 4th time (Which she did, the mad woman pulled it off)
Album announcement and she mad history as the only artist to win AOTY 4 times!! Is there anything this woman can’t do 🤯
The lakes vibes for sure
https://preview.redd.it/n7rn2yfgapgc1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e38f345290164a91ea1b3bdc1d6dfe2b5bafb814

Surprising amount of TS on their tik Tok.
This album sounds like I’ll like it. It sounds like it’s gonna be a little but if everything, primarily soft like folklore, but with a theme of each a little. “Alls fair in love and poetry”, so this could really be about anything. I’m so excited!!
Holy crap, I just realized this is only 2 months away, lol.
I have a feeling this is going to be a largely Dessner produced album!! Ahh I’m so excited!
this is so exciting! She said she has been working on this album for 2 years, so might get actual breakup songs about Joe! Or songs about how and why she was with matty healy and their very quick breakup. And if we're lucky she might include travis love songs as well
I love that we’re getting a new album (looking like a folklore/evermore sister) but what about the Eras Tour? is Taylor gonna be touring about her previous Eras while a new album is out? and that was exactly why I thought she’d ruin the pattern (1 album-2 rerecords, 1 album-2 rerecords) and release rep TV and debut TV. idk just a thought
I really wish scalping was completely illegal. Out of curiosity, I checked Ebay. There's already 57 individual listings for the collector's edition cd (asking $60 - $160, most around $100,  for an item originally priced at $17.99). The absurdity of listing preorders is insane. Even though the seller does not have the product in hand, Ebay allows it as long as it's specified. Ridiculous.

I probably would have been able to get one myself off of Taylor's store had these people not greedily scooped up copies 10 at a time.
besties, wait. this is giving so much lana?!
also, um what was the last album she had half of her face to look intriguing? YES, THE ICONIC 1989! i have a feeling we are at another turning point of her career, and genre. Especially with a new longer title, mother gonna switch things up fr i fear, HELPPP!😭
💚💛💜❤️🩵🖤🩷🩶🤎💙+🤍!!!
I'm kinda feeling like this has Dear Reader vibes? Like the fact that that was the last track on Midnights technically was probably a lead in to the inspiration for this album? This photo and the lyrics she posed in the announcement feel very dear reader to me.
i feel like it's going to be evermore + rep + midnights sorta vibe
I'm really curious about the genre. Hopefully we get some hints about that soon
I think this could be like the child of folklore's writing style and Afterglow, False God, and AOFTYLB's sound
i’m just going to say that i really hope this album sounds like rep + folkmore + maroon

She just posted the track list! Includes features from Post Malone and Florence + The Machine
I am actually very shocked that we have a title track for this one. I wonder what The Tortured Poets Department (the song) will sound like.
it releases on WORLD POETRY DAY YALL
Joe Alwyn apparently had a group chat with friends called "The Tortured Man Club" 👀
Snakes OUT quill pens IN

The thought that keeps circulating in my mind is where did she find the time in the middle of the Eras tour and prep for the tour to complete and do all the work that goes into releasing a new album.
My ex fiancé who hails from London broke up with me after six years last year. If this album is the breakup album I think it is, I am so fucking ready
I firmly believe this is an EMO POP PUNK album. I acknowledge that I am a 🤡, but please consider the following:


- the title of this album and released lyrics perfectly align with emo-era poetic indulgence (I write sins not tragedies/a fever you can’t sweat out, from under the cork tree, the young and the hopeless, life’s not out to get you)… the fact that there isn’t already a PATD album titled “the tortured poet’s department” is a miracle. 


- Taylor has long referenced the genre as an inspiration and one of her faves, has collaborated with Brandon Urie recently, recent music she’s supported like Griff and girl in red have that vibe, and she’s been longtime friends w Hayley Williams


- Our girl is ALWAYS on trend, and everything 2000s is back again: ugg boots, low-rise jeans, plaid… 


- emo & pop-punk music has been influencing high-end artists recently … notably, Olivia Rodrigo, who has been crushing in the reinvented version of the genre. Taylor has also “liked” covers of her music in the genre on TikTok. 



Thank you for listening. I look forward to being proven wrong after vehemently defending my  theory on the internet. But if our girl goes out in checkered vans, WATCH OUT ☠️💗🖤
My take is this album is to set the record straight on “Joever” before the release of rep. Maybe even retell some of the narratives from rep, with years of perspective. I also think there will be blood on this album. The word that “poetry” replaces after all is “war” (in all is fair in love and war).
WHEN DOES THIS WOMAN SLEEP
April 19th being National Cat Lady Day 😭
I already LOVE the vibe of this album it’s kinda giving dark academia !! I already know the majority of it is gonna be quill pen songs I’m so excited this is right up my alley
I’m thinking folklore lyrics with midnights vibes. False god? Dress? This is for us millennials in our 30s. Can feel it

The wait to check out!!! I’ll go back tomorrow when there will surely be 4 new limited edition versions to choose from
https://preview.redd.it/qlcafcwcmogc1.jpeg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0edc281410e162dc31fbd822abcfdf6d147f8712

Ok but how much inspiration do we think this album is gunna have from this film? She’s been very into film-like production/storytelling, esp with Folklore/Evermore and this film came out in *checks notes* 1989 by a writer with initials T.S.!
i thought it was a reputation outfit at the Grammy's but i guess it was an outfit for "the tortured poets department" 🤭
I love how a total amount of 0 people expected this and a total amount of 100% of all who saw this just collectively thought WTF
Anyone else numb? I immediately ran over to the merch store to pre-order the album but I’m still like no she did not just do that???? At the Grammys???
forty minutes later, i have managed to make it through checkout and purchase my vinyl. here's to there being some QC for these pressings ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1087)
APRIL ALBUM DROP??? HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!!!
I know a folklore cousin when i see one !
Okay but…. Does this mean she will add this era to the eras tour for the dates after the release?
Bring on Indie Taylor again, so excited
I really hope this is a mix of midnights and folklore
Her description says it all. Vulnerably putting out her experiences (torture) to the world, in true taylor poet fashion. Pop for sure. But I think raw and ethereal vs bangers.
I love the title already!!!! I really hope that Aaron is involved with the production!!!!!!!!!
So this technically adds a new era? So what does that mean for tour
Taylor giving me a reason to exist after Eras omg I was meant to wfh this afternoon but... have I? no
So is this new Era…. Or are we done with Eras? Basically bottom line is I NEED more information
Do yall think she's adding this current album to the Eras tour? I don't see her in 2025 doing a full-blown tour for this album. She has to make her movie at some point. She would be on tour for 3 years of the row.
HEAR ME OUT 2.0

THE BRAID SHE STARTED USING AGAIN

IT HAAAS TO BE WOODVALE
Never been happier being a swiftie like she keeps on giving I love this woman sooo much and I appreciate her never ending artistic drive and that she WILL keep making music as long as she feels inspired, and we’ll be here for every single second of it. 

genuinely blessed Taylor is honestly artist of this generation nobody does it like her
Ao if she worte this over the last two years. This is The relationship breakdown / break up album, right?
saw that it’s apparently listed as synth pop but this album cover and title does not give synth pop vibes at all. if that’s the case i’m very confused
What does this mean for the eras tour setlist?!?
U serious
We always clown but she clowns us harder
Explains the DPT error from the website earlier.
Now everyone’s gonna be a poet and that aesthetic is what I’m here forrrrr
I hate being in Europe because I always miss announcements due to the timezones but today the universe has summoned me awake in the middle of the night for this!
How’s your 2024 Taylor Swift bingo going guys?

I am so glad I randomly decided to watch the Grammys live this year, was truly shook lol
Jesus this woman has to have the most hardcore work ethic in human history to put out 4 original studio albums, 4 re-recorded full studio albums, an acoustic album, and put on the biggest tour inhistory all in the space of 4 and a half years.
its giving dress x the lakes
The white vinyl on her site is called Ghosted, track title, lyrics, ooor both???
[deleted]
I can’t believe this is real life 
This seems like a continuation of The Lakes.

It's 13 lines long???
Me going to bed fully convinced we're getting Rep tv vs. Me waking up and fully convinced this is a joke because HOW THE HELL. oh my god she's insane I love her
Anyone else already on the bracelet-making?!

It was honestly kind of tough to design without yet knowing the vibes of the album, but it's what I imagine it could be (which would be an evolution of Midnights, my favorite album and now Album of the Year 🤩).

https://preview.redd.it/7m45vf5skpgc1.png?width=8234&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a5d190955e26340775f6efcc0b18ff8bad5229a
Woah, time flies, I can't believe it's already been over a year since Midnights.
This album gotta be something else entirely, when the title is 4 words.
It’s such a long title compared to the others!!
So do we think this new album is somehow related to that release party at at Electric Lady last year? I'd just about die if I can actually dream of a Taylor x FATM Collab.
Wow I did not expect a new album!
I thought she was going to announce Rep TV at the Grammys if she won AotY. Not a whole NEW album ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1082)
This is my cake day present
Wait... so does that mean that we will have a new era added to the concert?! To say that I am shocked and excited is an understatement!!
This woman is a machine!! How does she make a brand new album during the eras tour!?!
She clowned us again!!!! I really thought it was going to be rep TV help
I kind of wonder if this has anything to do with her screenplay bc of manuscript. At first glance, it seems crazy that she would put out a new album in the middle of the eras tour. She still has two albums to rerelease and I thought for sure the second leg was going to be changed up a bit to add these in. But trying to add a whole new album to the Eras tour-there’s just not room for that. 

So, if this were to hype her screenplay I could see her not wanting to tour for it. But also-when would she even have time to direct and film it? I mean, we all know she’s doing the most, but does she just NEVER sleep…no wonder its called tortured poets department
Sibling to Evermore and Folklore?
As The Lakes girlie, I'm freaking excited!!! 🤍
The vinyl preorder says there’s TWO GHOSTED WHITE VINYLS.
Do we think one of the tracks is called Ghosted?
Anyone else feel like "The Manuscript" is gonna be hella long? Given the title and also that it appears to be all of Side A of the cassette? I could be wrong and it could just be advertised like that but idk!
I’m getting sad but cozy vibes. Taylor said we rlly need an era we can dress comfy for at the eras tour 🤣
[deleted]
I love the inclusion of Department in the title. "The Tortured Poets" sounds a bit too pretentious, but the "The Tortured Poets Department" feels a bit tongue in cheek, like there's self awareness. I'm expecting the lyrical craft of folkmore but a bit of a more fun sound.
Odds they restock the deluxe edition? I didn't think it would be *that* limited
https://preview.redd.it/4u488mozgtgc1.png?width=125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aaf7d9a0506f18d1680da64544cd76b80f31406c

New monogram style from the mailing list
💚💛💜❤️🩵🖤🩷🩶🤎💛❤️💙💜🩵🤍
Wow this is her most liked instagram post! 13 million +
I feel like there's significance to her saying this is a secret she's been keeping for the past 2 years. That seems very odd to say if it's just a regular album. Having several friends have black and white photos, red herring as a clue, matching with Lana at the Grammys... There's something she's got up her sleeve.
Swift is just endlessly creative. I’m a new fan. Eras tour won me over. Former Lana Del Rey obsessed. ❤️ both!
OK so can we talk about the cover art? Like OK MISS SWIFT!!
Think she's going back to a more indie sound with this album? The title & even the cover kinda has that vibe to me, I could be wrong but we'll see come April or sooner if she releases a single before the album this time around I guess.
I don't know if this makes any sense, but have we considered the "department" could be her love life? She's dated a lot of tortured poet types in her life and I wonder if she's saying that she feels sort of like a communal gathering spot for them at this point.
I’m so excited for a Florence & The Machine!
Oh this is really some sad girl shit
She just announced the track list on Instagram too. Which one do you claim? 

Fortnight (ft. Post Malone) /
The Tortured Poets Department /
My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys /
Down Bad /
So Long, London /
But Daddy I Love Him /
Fresh Out the Slammer /
Florida!!! (ft. Florence + The Machine) /
Guilty as Sin? /
Who's Afraid of Little Old Me? /
I Can Fix Him (No Really | Can) /
loml /
I Can Do It With a Broken Heart /
The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived /
The Alchemy /
Clara Bow /
The Manuscipt (Bonus Track)

Edit: considering all of the 4s involved, and how that’s my favorite number. I really can’t let Down Bad pass me by, that song is going to be sick and completely wreck me 💯🥰🤍 1-17 I now need to breathe. Honorable mentions to Guilty as Sin? ICDIWABH, I Can Fix Him (No I Really Can), But Daddy I Love Him, I can just keep naming them though because they literally have slayed me already. And the way that loml is probably love of my life 🫣 I preordered immediately and it put me in an hour long line 🤣🤯😋

She said she’s been working on it for 2 years. She recorded You’re Losing Me 2 years and 2 months ago. Yeah Joe is toast
Great, now I have to do that thing where I’m anxious for a couple months worrying that I might die before the album comes out. Lol. 😂
The cover art is giving “Folklore but make it sex” and I am HERE FOR IT!
6 signs the new album will be Dessner-heavy:

1. The absence of Dessner from the main tracklist of Midnights despite his presence on 3am and vault tracks - as though some new Dessner-produced tracks had been deliberately held back, as part of a deliberate choice to make that album an Antonoff-produced one.
2. Lack of any major continuation (so far) of the sound TS developed with Dessner post-evermore, e.g. on songs like Renegade; All Too Well Ten Minute Version (Sad Girl Autumn Version); Would've, Could've, Should've; and High Infidelity - even though it is clearly a great, great sound, not just B-side material.
3. Title and cover art reminiscent of The National and other Dessner collabs.
4. Dessner's really enthusiastic and sustained support for Midnights even though he was left off the main tracklist (as though he knew his turn was coming).
5. TS wanting to promote other Dessner-linked artists like Gracie Abrams, suggesting an ongoing close connection.
6. The release of "You're Losing Me" - this may be an odd-one out (because it was Antonoff-produced) that did not fit on the new album and so was instead released as a "Midnights vault track".

I actually suspect, for these reasons, that TS and AD probably recorded a lot of unreleased material in 2021 and 2022, contemporaneously with the Midnights sessions, and that Tortured Poets will give us that material.
The ‘red herring’ easter egg: she made us believe it was rep tv while plotting something else…… this woman!!
This woman is unhinged. 

'Mad Woman' is autobiographical
Does this mean all her friends having black and white profile pics on Instagram was actually an easter egg?? I thought that was just swifties being overexcited
Y'all, I'm having a hard time understanding the timeline of this album... Did she mean she's kept it for two years (as in already written and finished by 2022) or that she's been working on it for the last two years? I feel like this is an important distinction
just want to remind everyone that Joe Alwyn had a groupchat named “The Tortured Man Club” with Paul Mescal! I wonder if there could be a Phoebe Bridgers feature as well as if the title is a callback to the groupchat
Girl what about our nails? We don’t have 11 fingers to paint.
TRACKLIST SPECULATION:

Convinced I can fix him is actually about Matty Healy…. yall remember all those terrible PR pieces tree was spending so much energy putting out
[deleted]
I keep wanting to call it Dead Poets Society. Anyone else?
I thought it was reputation 😭
Guys we gotta talk about this. (Not my photo - reposted from Discord!)

This is the Joe album y'all
It’s giving folklore but sexy

She was definitely hunting her 11th studio album with this post! But we were just so obsessed with Rep TV that we never thought this would happen!!! So exited about this album!! Don’t know what to expect! I think lyrically it would definitely be something like folkmore, but I’m not sure about the genre 🧐🧐🧐
i just cant believe this many people thought she was going to the studios every day even in the middle of touring to do re-recordings. she's clearly been finished with those for a long time, i think it's safe to say that when we see taylor at the studio she's making new music.
https://preview.redd.it/8gbhhkq53pgc1.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a1d7b9fa50e3cb2b7a8f3cadf40cb61db2ea3f

Mindblown!
Theory that all the people who changed their profile pics to B&W when Taylor did are involved with the album (since we’re maybe thinking collab vibes). I know they’re not all singers, but this is my feeling.
She's in her “poetry” era and judging by its title, I feel like this album is her most experimental to date. It's interesting, deeply concerning, and intriguing at the same time. I'm SO excited for this new era.
Even though she started it 2 years ago, and even though a little jarring, I’m thinking the long title signifies entering a new eras era with it being her 11th album and first one that’s not part of the Eras concept
https://preview.redd.it/5wth4bw2wsgc1.png?width=864&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1ef68f93a4658987da9fdb5ec6e87ba5233ce11

I find the ARTIFACTS, cried over a hat, cursed the space that I needed 😭
This is honestly the most gorgeous album cover. Flawless. 

Also, roughly two months left before the release, thank you for not torturing (no pun intended) us for longer than that! ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1063)
GUYS SORRY FOR YELLING BUT HAS ANYONE TALKED ABOUT “YOUVE RUINED MY LIFE BY NOT BEING MINE” ➡️ “I LOVE YOU, ITS RUINING MY LIFE”
does anyone else feel like this album could expose a lot of people/events in her life...? like she says all's fair in love and poetry (when it's typically war) but Taylor could wage war on someone via poetry/songwriting
I hope it's going to be a lyrical masterpiece like Folklore and evermore but with the sound mixed smth between Rep and Midnights.

Also, I personally would prefer her not changing much at the Eras Tour in accordance to the new album, because I kinda wanna see the original setlist live (going in August)... So surprise songs maybe? We will see 😅
Was not expecting that. Almost felt odd.
Omfg
WHATTT
My jaw dropped when I opened Instagram!!!! Not what I was expecting AT ALL
This Queen is wild fr fr
I think I blacked out…. Did that just happen??
I DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD ERASE THIS CLOWN MAKE UP OR NOT 😭😍
anyone else still clowning and think rep will drop at midnight tonight or just me
The cut to the dead eyes and stale smiles of Miley and Olivia lol

Apparently, the album will have 16 songs + 1 bonus song! How has she kept this a secret for TWO years? Also, I think they just released this pic in relation to the news!
This is giving “the Great War” vibes. Mixed with “you’re losing me” and a lil sprinkle of “false god” and I am SOOOO ready for it. I feel like it will be her most emotional album yet.
Please please please let Aaron be elbows deep in this album 😭😭😭
Initial thoughts:

- title feels very Lana Del Rey
- I have absolutely no idea of what to expect of this album
- crazy that a new album is out during the eras tour: will she add TPD stuff to the set??
- this woman is unhinged and we should know by now to always expect the unexpected: CONSTANT VIGILANCE 
- dying to look for retroactive easter eggs 
- dying to know if she’s keeping jack and aaron or branching out
- feels very VERY sexy and sex oriented while the lyrics feel of course very poetic
Completely baseless speculation: 

I don’t think this will be added as a full era to the tour for logistical reasons. I think songs will probably be used as surprise songs, then she’ll take a break from touring until after re-records and TS12 are done. Then do a full tour for TS11 and 12 together. Especially if TS11 is a breakup album and 12 is a love album. That would pair together nicely. AND leaves TS13 to be a big standalone milestone album
Dude the checkout line to preorder the album is 45 minutes long…
Idk I know I'm reaching but the first thing that came to my mind is if her new album will have some references from Dead Poets Society 

*off to the clown car I go
Past two years!!! So much had happened, but I totally believe this could include more storytelling. I just want some Aaron Dessner tracks in this one!
not setting expectations for the sound,but LIVING for this cover, and the profile picture is gorgeous. so excited for the next adventure!
When Taylor first announced her intention to rerecord her Big Machine albums, early in the Lover era, I had a very vague and unformed idea that she would take some time off to get it all done and then release rerecordings of her biggest hits, then drop a boxset of everything, and then we'd go back to business as usual on a two-year release cycle.

Instead we got two brand-new albums, then two rerecorded albums (with vault songs!), then a brand new album, then two rerecorded albums, and now another brand-new album. In (checks calendar) under five years.

I'm so blown away by her.

(Also I love the title and cover of this so, so much. So much.)
I feel like it’s gonna be somewhere between Reputation and Folklore. I just get those vibes from it. Anyway, I’M SO FUCKING EXCITED!!!!!!! I’m obsessed with the cover and the whole aesthetic. Also, I love the line, “All’s fair in love and poetry, the Chairman of the Tortured Poets Society.” I just love this so much!!!!!!!!
so i guess we are going with the 2 tvs + new album + 2 tvs + new album + 2 tvs thing 
Y’all what color is this album now? Is folklore gray now so this is white?
Do we think this is her only announcement of the night? 🧐
has she ever done so much promo for an album with the bonus track?? the manuscript seems to be all over the album yet it’s a bonus track. have a feeling we’ll be getting that as a single
Did anyone catch Jay’s rant? It did kinda resemble Kanye’s anger over B’s snub
I'll be in the car on my way to the airport for my honeymoon at the moment this drops so I hope it's not too soul crushing because I'll be trapped on a plane with it for 11 hours and I can't sob that whole time and I don't want to be sad the whole trip!!
The fact that there is a line to preorder the cd is wild.
I love that she knew we were all clowning and gave this to us
THIS ALBUM COVER IS GIVING. What do we think the mood is here? Ahhhhh
So is this going to be the gray era? The white era? Is this going to be our The Beatles White album where we get a little folk, country, and pop and maybe some blues?? A mix of all the genres she's done before?? 
Fuck my shit UP let’s fucking GOOOOO
Dying at everyone thinking the black-and-white profile pic change was for Reputation TV when it was really for this

She never had a long ass album title, this is going to be something totally new
I legit thought she was joking at first lmfao

She’s in her sultry era and I’m here for it!!
IS THIS GONNA BE A EVERMORE X REPUTATION ALBUM LIKE ITS GIVING
I’m crying. I’m part of the tortured fans department
Obsessed with this cover already
Oh shit!!! That’s different
The BEAUTY of this
All the words from the source code are in the post!
OH MY GOD LOOK AT HERRRR
This feels softer grayscale while Rep feels stark black and white if that makes any sense?
It’s me. Hi.
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?????
Omg you were so right, the white heart 🤍 is the one for this era as shown on her instagram
Truly iconic
I at least thought she’d wait until the eras tour was over!
I didn't think she'd announce anything before the tour ends because regardless of what she does with the eras tour after April people will get upset
Doing whatever the hell she wants era is accurate I guess lol
No literally?!?!!?!! Like ????????? She has been on tour for a year released a new album and two re-records in less than two years and now another she’s insane 😭😭😭😭
WHAT IS HAPPENKNG
This is going to be so fun after Midnights 🥹I can’t wait
This is everything I ever wanted. Poetry. Drama.
She’s back to folkmore 🥹
IM SO FUCKING EXCITED EEK
IT WAS RARE I WAS THERE
Ik!! She’s always ahead of us 😂
Wow you need an award lol
Gorgeous!
She kept fucking with us with the Rep stuff 😂🫠
I love how this was everyone’s collective reaction ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1082)
Me too. I thought she was going to lead us to IG only to say… “jk, it’s reputation.”
The album title is so different it took me a second to register it as an album title

~~Why did this comment get 100+ upvotes but the one I'm replying to got 1~~
I know she’s looking hot asf
I am unwell.
I'm thinking possible lyrics, but they could be song titles! Apple cake is really intriguing me 🤣
I fully believe you're joking but this is so funny like she just grew a new finger every time an album dropped lol
Waaa. Okay but tbh when said two years I immediately knew their might be some Joe writing
this is going to keep me up at night
This is some fantastic tea, thank you.
I had forgotten about this group chat name, but when I first heard the album name, my first thought was Joe and Taylor’s professed shared love for sad songs. So yeah, this tracks.
RIP Joe. She found your GC. 😅
I hope from the title it’ll be like everlore 🥹🥹🥹
Oh 100% 

The muses/bruises line is very Joe coded. She called him her muse in the lakes
I CAN MAKE ALL THE CLOWNS COME OUT 🤡 
PUNCH ME IN THE FACE
That's why I'm not too sure it's a collab album. More artists you bring into the mix, the bigger chance it has of getting out
… this woman.
I thought it was referring to her TV  🫠
I just re watched the eras tour last night and when she said that part I was questioning the 5 albums thing and then thought maybe she meant a rerelease and I didn’t count right but omg she got us
Yesssss, I commented the same a few minutes ago. I'm convinced this is the brother album to folklore and evermore that many of us clowned for on 4/30/21
WHAT IS HAPPENING
There were so many plaid skirts! I was like .... this is so not rep, but I just didn't know what to make of it!
i am sorry 🙏
Someone replied to my comment about me expecting ts11 at the Grammys with “No 💀”. How about “Yes 💀”
I really hope we get more False God vibes. It’s one of my favourite songs
The most shocking part about this, to me, was the price. It seemed oddly reasonable considering the prices her merch store typically has.
I’m so ashamed to say this but when the breakup was announced I remember thinking “ts11 is going to be my new favorite album of hers”
Fast fashion works fast but swifties work faster
She warned us when she said it was her 13th Grammy. UNHINGED & I love her
It's also Cat Lady Day 🐈
That’s what I thought too but it’s also quite sensual compared to her others so maybe some more sexy songs on this album?? 👀
If I had to guess, I don't think Tortured Poets Department is gonna get its own "era" in the Eras tour setlist due to the logistics involved in majorly rearranging the setlist and needing new setpieces for an entire new section of a show that's already 3 and a half hours long, ESPECIALLY whilst touring internationally. I do think they'll be fair game for surprise songs though, and maybe get their own tour down the line?

I believe this was the day you're talking about. All of them, including Taylor's brother Austin and Ryan Reynolds unfollowed Joe. April 19th definitely means something, but what? Lol
A features album 👀
I think it's going to be lyrically dense and I'm SO here for it
Plus re-releases. 

And have a new relationship.

I'm happy I loaded the dishwasher and did a load of laundry today lol
I think nothing really. This tour is a celebration of her first 10 albums.
Tortured Poets Department. DPT: 321, the numbers showed the correct order of the letters.
None of this makes sense, but I would hope the rest of the TVs would release before the Eras tour ends. It would be odd to end the Eras tour and still not own the last of her eras.
Time for the toes
Everybody did
The red herring note on her website was so damn cheeky!! She knew what she was doing.
Literally thought I was watching the live announcement of Rep TV and I was SHOCKED!! What a moment
LMAO ME i fell victim to the black and white pfp change!!! Even better tho this is amazingggg
This has all the words that were hidden in different languages in the source code while the site was showing the "Error" today!!!!
All’s fair in love and poetry.
It’s giving Fall Out Boy song titles
No literally Miley’s face was me too LMFAO total disbelief
I think a lot of people didn’t know how to react lol
No I thought when she said the title she was fucking with us LMFAO
No like her tone was NOT serious at all I didn’t believe her 😭😭
Those are my two favorite albums, so I hope so lol
Same! Like, is she going to reconfigure the whole show?!
Like I low key imagined she’d release new music as soon as Eras tour was over, but during???? Unbelievable
You guys say this and then are gonna freak out when it’s a pop album
We clowned so hard but still won 🙌🏻
Same !! I thought she was like jk, it’s reputation!
Same. I'm tripping over this album title. All her album titles are usually simple and short!
Yes, the moment she said it‘s her 13th Grammy I knew something is coming but THIS? Oh my heart!
It looks like it’s going to be sexy AND SAD, yessssss
Give me more False Goddddd
Oooh I missed that, what was the note on her website?
This Ain’t a Fan Club, It’s a God Damn Clown Car
It's giving Lana Del Ray too 😭
Same! My face is frozen in shock 😂
I’m more wondering about what happens for the NEXT tour at this point. Like she can’t just immediately go from eras to a new tour without a break right? Maybe we just don’t get a tour for this album. Or maybe she adds more dates in countries she’s already done shows in?
Probably not. Maybe as surprise songs? But imo she might want to save this album for a future tour.
I really don’t think she’ll add this as an era, outside of heavy representation during the acoustic set. The cover and title make me think it’s not gonna have a bunch of pop bangers and if it’s a devastating album that’s not a vibe she’d want for a whole set at Eras
This definitely doesn’t give the Folkmore vibes just from the cover.
She’s hanging around Lana too much lol
✨erotic depression✨
She had a scrambled error code screen with an anagram for red herring which I also wonder is a song title because I could see her doing that
I like the idea of her finishing current Eras as-is, taking an extended break from touring while she keeps releasing albums, and then doing an Eras pt 2 in like 5-10 years with TS11 and beyond
This should go on my headstone
Totally wouldn't be surprised if 'Red Herring' pops up as a bonus track or a secret session gem given her love for easter eggs and cryptic clues. She's all about the layered meanings and keeping us on our toes, am I right?
The housemates of amateur player Tim Pieters all bet €15 on him to score and for Hercules to knock Ajax out of the cup. They won €11.265 each, amounting to a total of €150.000+. “It is going to be a nice vacation”

Wow, can you imagine the scenes….
How many housemates does he have?
That's crazy
Feel good story of the day.
Hey at least its a small dent in their studentloans debt lmao
I’m surprised they only won that amount. Seems like the odds would have been crazy.
Uncut gems vibe
They’ll talk about that for the rest of their lives. That’s so cool I can only imagine the celebrations after
I don't quite understand. Can someone do that math?
Me as an American saw 11.265 and thought wtf they lost money.....
Writing with comma decimal signs in English is confusing considering no English language country uses them.
Game's not dead
BREAKING NEWS: Tim Pieters suspended for 10 months for breaking gambling rules
Feature film potential
Feature length film potential.
If they all did the bet seperatly on their account it wouldnt suprise me if the bookie tried to void it under syndicate betting.
Why do they use decimals instead of a comma? Are they stupid?
I dont think this is exactly correct. I was watching the aftershow last night and there were odds of 1:150 for the scoring and winning of Hercules. 
They said they got screenshors of that. 

I believe the 11,265 comes from the fact that people were saying some persons were betting 100 euros. While a lot, i dont think someone actually bet that.

More the fact that the student house won around 11,625 total
Tim Pieters doesn't sound like a dutch name to me.
Want this luck
Does he live in a covenant?
I want to know how much Ajax's homies bet...
I can't imagine what it's like living with this many people
***It's lit.***
wow this guy has a lot of roommates
The news stories in the NL only said that 1 person won that amount. The rest only smaller amount, coming up to ~20k according to the NOS.
That's awesome
  7   =95787066
There were screenshots posted of a gc in which one of his frat mates said: “lol I did ketamine with him last Thursday” 😭
How can you get that many people in one house
it's so rare that it actually happens that it makes the fucking news when it does
When one of the lads made his debut in League One we all lumped on the opposition. Well I say "lumped" we included them in our accas...

Keeper scored an equaliser in the last minute, only result that my friend needed to get something like £12k. Sickening.
I don't know if i'd survive those celebrations. A mate scoring against Ajax, them beating Ajax AND on top of all bet on the whole thing? Holy fucking shit i'd be wasted so hard.
They're going to recreate Project X but with a bigger budget
He is part of a student fraternity and thus lives with around 12 others
13,315.5 housemates
I really would have thought the odds to be much longer. I would have thought the odds of them winning alone would have been like +100,000 (bet 100 to win 100g). 

Then a specific player scoring in the game alone for a d side against an A side should have been around 1 in 20ish.
You have to take student loans to study in the netherlands?
that’s 751 times what they bet
He lives in a frat house with a lot of housemates
12+ people bet €15 each and won a total of €150,000+
The whole system is weird in Europe. They structure numbers like this €15.234,75.

Ridiculous
In the interest of pedantry, South Africa and Zimbabwe are both English-language countries (albeit with many other co-official languages) and both use commas for decimals. Still confusing to see in English though
is it tho...
Confusing to native speakers of English.
How is it confusing in this case?
Most Catalan Barcelona fan
Most local barca fan
Because some countries use decimals and other commas, doesn't make any of them stupid?
Before the game the odds of him scoring and Hercules winning was 750-1.

https://imgur.com/RXZGmlS

So if around 12-14 of his housemates did the same bet the 150k is about right
The screenshot from toto i saw on dutch twitter was Tim Pieters to score and win for 751. Someone betted 15 on it and won 11.250. Later it turned out a lot of housemates had done the exact same thing.
Tim Pieters sounds like one of the most dutch names i can imagine lmao
I'd actually argue it sounds very Dutch. That spelling of Pieters is basically limited to Belgium, the Netherlands, and South Africa
Don’t think it could sound more Dutch
You must be trolling, right?
Doesn't get much Dutch than that, except maybe Gregory Van Der Wiel
It's actually a lot of fun. Maybe a bit noisy sometimes
Frat house
Dude this has to be one of the best days of all their lives
Not just scoring, but an absolute banger of a goal. He definitely earned the celebrations!
Like when someone takes one to the balls, all men in the vicinity feel some kind of phantom pain and sympathy for the afflicted.

It's like that, these boys are drinking for all of us and we should be grateful to our heroes.
EUR11.265 worth of wastage each?
Damn 150k of hookers and blow
]150/11.265[ = 14
775/1 for a goalscorer and win is crazy high for betting standards, no chance are they ever giving 1000/1 for a straight win. The bookies aren't daft unfortunately, they protect themselves against rare things happening still. They've shortened the odds of outsiders winning the Premier League since Leicester won it.
Lol what? Why would they give a 1:100 for something that can only go 2 ways?
If you haven't got rich parents paying your way and you want to live in the city study in, almost certainly. Tuition is about 2300 euro a year but living in a city is ridiculously expensive these days so a lot of people end up taking out a student loan just to pay rent (and alcohol probably).
Millenials also were part of the 'unlucky generation' here. Im not a part of them luckely, but from what I can tell they were made to borrow for their studies instead of being given the 'basisbeurs'. It was HORRIFICALLY managed by our neo-lib government and alot of people are tens of thousands of euros in debt

I studied right after the basisbeurs came back into effect. I think im around 5K in debt mainly from travel costs for my 'free' public transport but that only becomes actually owed if i dont graduate within 10 years
People who live in student housing either have parents paying or high loans on top of work.
am i stupid or it’s only like 10x what they bet. They bet  €11 and won €150? 13.64x the original amount.
The simple way to look at it would be if only 10 people made the bet

10 people × €15 = €150

€150 at 1000/1 = €150k

So they had odds of *around* 1000/1 and maybe a tad higher
Thats a hell of a fact. I like a good fact so thanks for sharing that!
Yes.
Or Indians, Chinese, Nigerians, Japanese etc.
So the majority of this sub?

I mean if its alright for european clubs to have brazillian players and saudi owners why draw the line on fans

You're saying that like it's a bad thing
In Karim Benzema terms, it is two hookers and one bathroom trip of blow then?
Just make sure it ain't some brown powder
It’s a bit weird they shortened odds, since they made a killing that year. Had to pay out a few dedicated Leicester fans, and pocketed the cash of every other sucker. Absolute dream scenario for the bookies, especially considering the amount of fans who would’ve chucked a tenner on, for arguments sake, Crystal Palace the following season.
Well in betting there is actually three ways it can go. The bets are generally for regulation. 

NCAA lines can get to +2000 or so. I can see the lines being even greater for a rec league team vs. a top tier team
Is Utrecht as expensive at Amsterdam? Curious how expensive it would be to live downtown.

If you room with 12 other people surely it would be a lot cheaper
2300 a year lmao, can't even get out of the bookshop for the semester for 2300 in america.
>Tuition is about 2300 euro a year

So less than 1 month average salary
I have a full scholarship and still pay $3000 in administration fees yearly in the US, not including thousands in housing.

Without those it would be ~60k a year.
Cheap tuition there, UK its £9k per year and then usually around £4-6k to live depending on what you can apply for. Ours is done as more of a tax though and automatically is taken as a percentage of wages when you earn over £25k per year so you don't notice it as much when you're starting out
2300/ a year? That’s dirt cheap
I mean it sounds like there's 13 people living together. It can't be that expensive.
Fyi we aren't millenials, I started studying the year after the basisbeurs was scrapped and then I just graduated the year before it was reintroduced (i.e. this year). I was born in 1999 so technically that's early gen-z.
Yeah I’m part of it. Whenever I log in to do something, I avoid looking at the debt unless I absolutely need to because it will completely ruin my day. And that is more the norm than an exception among the people I know. 

In the long term I’ll probably be fine because I can just pay off a small sum every month until I’m 60+, but it still sucks. Especially given that you can’t get a mortgage since they’ll judge your debt including student debt nowadays. So getting a house before I’m like 45 will be a massive task. 

But hey, the rich get richer and the rest can go fuck themselves
> It was HORRIFICALLY managed by our neo-lib government

This describes effectively everything Rutte & friends did the past 12 years. They've turned everything they touched into a big problem and turned every big problem into a crisis.

And now we get racist, reality denying populists in government,yaaaay!
10k debt lol. my girlfriend in america will be 250,000 in debt when she finishes school
They bet €15 and won €11,265
Instead of €150.000, think €150,000
150.000 € thats 150 thousand
You are stupid :)
Nah it says in the title they bet 15 and won 11,265
They bet €15 each (a total of around €210), and won just over €11,000 each (a total of over €150,000). 

Europeans use full stops for thousands instead of commas.
They bet 15. They won 150k. Their split is 11k.
Using full-stops to break up currency like this is absolutely idiotic. Don't blame you.
In Europe they use “.” instead of “,” to determine thousands, millions, billions, etc. So 150,000 is 150.000 for them.

Don’t mind the geniuses that are calling you an idiot, it’s just different ways of writing big numbers. 

Personally i think it’s confusing to use “.” instead of “,” for large numbers since adding decimals can then make it confusing to looks at

The odds were 751 on this one

It's not, I don't think there's a single person with 'van Pieters' as surname in Belgium or NL. Pieters on the other hand is e very common surname
Pretty sure the hangover is already taken though
it's bad for me because I didn't bet on him
No, 15 hookers. Just google Benzema 15 for more information.
If you're punting on a long shot, you're usually not that concerned whether the odds are 10000:1, 5000:1 or 1000:1. By dropping from 5000 to 1000, the bookies massively limit their risk without losing a substantial amount of bettors
The problem is that following that there would be a surge of people betting on outsiders.
Bookies said Leicester winning the league was a big loss for them. About 25 million quid.
Didn’t one company go under because of the Leicester win?
It's because now that it's happened, you'll see a hell of a lot more people lumping on similar teams if they kept the odds the same
Soccer is a much higher variance game than basketball.
Not as expensive but still crazy high for students
Knew a few people studying there and there’s a massive shortage of housing in the city that will accept students as renters which is driving prices up
living with more people doesnt matter here, i used to rent a room with 5 others and we all payed roughly 550 each. which was way before inflation. most studies are in the big citiess which means 2300 yearly school tuition with roughly 8k rent a year, groceries/healthcare etc. just like the guy above me said, no rich parents means your usually kinda fucked
Prices are nearly identical in all major (student)cities. Utrecht is a nice city, btw.
Americans really do exist purely to be milked for every single penny they earn lmao damn
2300 sounds genuinely pretty expensive to me, it's 60$ in Norway
i pay around ~600€ a year for university in germany.

i can travel for free within my state(Hessen) and have access to all the books and papers that the university bought a license for...
2300 gets you a mildly decent apartment in nyc for….. one month
In Denmark, tuition is 0 USD and you get paid 930 USD per month to study.
I was friends with an American girl, and for some reason we went to a pub one day and her father joined us because he visited that weekend. I talked to the guy, and he said he absolutely loved his daughter's decision to study in the Netherlands, because it was more expensive to spent 1 month in the US than it was to spend a year in The Netherlands.

That's how I got to know how fucked the US system for it is.

Fun/Depressing addition, that girl kept partying so much she dropped out and is now studying in the US after a year anyway. Still, the idea was nice.
The most I ever spent on books in a semester was like $450 lol, still absurd but $2300? You couldn't hit that taking two full-time courseloads at once.

edit: $450 including bullshit online access fees
what idiot pays for books
England is the same, £9000 a year just for tuition then you have to pay for rent ans books etc on top
The average school debt in the US is just over 20k, the exaggeration on Reddit is crazy just because the Reddit hive mind goes for worthless expensive social arts degrees that in the end make you have to work for $10 an hour.  As for the books you don't need them, it's never a requirement, bring a laptop and have it all for free on it.
€2300 for the students, but the other part is paid by the government. Or actually from taxes. It makes studying more doable for everyone.
That's normal here. I'm guessing they're paying around €400-€500 rent a month each, given they live in (what from a news clip looked like) Utrecht city centre. May be even higher since my estimation is based on my time as a student ~5 years ago
Yeah especially the mortgage part sucks. If you're competing for a house with someone a couple years older and someone a couple years younger, you may have the same education, same job and same income but out of those three you're the only one with tens of thousands of euros student debt... Guess who's not getting the house :/
The difference in debt with or without basisbeurs is 'only' 12-13k. Yeah it sucks, but it's nowhere near as life ruining as your generation likes to vent while rolling in their victim hood.
I swear to god sometimes i dont understand why we dont just riot and take everything from the 1%
First of all, ive seen people with 40-50K in debts and im pretty sure theres people with higher debts even. Secondly, the US dollar is worth less (albeit marginally)

Most importantly tho: this isnt the fucking Pain Olympics. 10K in debt is still fucking substantial and makes it most people will not own a home before theyre like 50. Yeah the US is fucked up but that doesnt minimise other peoples suffering and hardship. Your gfs debt doesnt minimise the debt of people here
source?
Don't the 3 0's signifiy that we're talking about thousands here? I don't get how it's confusing for some people. No one writes out 3 decimal points when talking about money.
Just say 15 • 10⁴ so you don’t have to bother with the comma or dot problem
Ye. Difference between US and EU
>Europeans use full stops for thousands instead of commas.

Not all of us do!
Yeah, it completely subverts the purpose of the Full. Stop. as a punctuation tool (i.e. stop whole numbers, go to decimals). And commas splitting groups of three makes sense since the comma is a soft pause for convenience/legibility.
America flips the decimal and comma.  He thought they 150 bucks not 150 thousand.
The odds were 750/1. 
As they won they got their stake back.
So 1.786.234 could mean 1.7 million as well as 1 thousand 7 hundred 86 point 234
Well, I see it as skill issue
This. Plus it became clear odds like 5000/1 are probably +EV in a lot of cases for the bettor, sure the bookie will still win most of the time but they’ll be plenty of gamblers looking out for these kind of +EV odds across various leagues and when they find them they’ll lump on them. The bookies will hardly make much off these bets because they’ll be small, but the payouts will be huge if you have a lot of people betting on them and one of them comes off.
What a load of horseshit. These companies clear hundreds of millions a year as a conservative estimate lol
They made 25 mill less from their total profit. Oh what a loss.

It's the same with corporate earnings. Project linear growth year on year, make a little less money one year and burn the place down in panic.
That just means they paid out £25m to people who backed Leicester. It doesn't account for the money they earned from people backing Man City, Liverpool, Spurs, Arsenal etc. They definitely made money that season.
sauce pls
You would think Ajax could beat a sat morning league team
What does crazy high mean? How much would you pay for rent?
This was ten years ago, but we visited a friend who was finishing her Ph.D. there.  She lived in a tiny space in the attic.  It felt like typical housing in Japan.  I remember her saying it took forever for her to find this space.
True, but most actual white collar, the kind you'd go to University for, earn way more than anywhere else. I spend a decent amount of time on /r/accounting and out of school in the UK I think starting salary is 42k GBP, Canada (where I live) is somewhere around 60k CAD, but in the US it should be about 65-70k USD, all for similar COL cities. Except housing in the US is a fraction of what it is in Canada and the UK, so yes their quality of life when they are reimbursing student loans early on in their career isn't great, but they then have decades of being ahead afterwards.
it's true but you shouldn't say it
The American Dream is to be milking a group of people for money like you got milked in your teens and 20s.
That's a third the price of a single textbook in the US
Well a degree in Reindeer Management shouldn't be too costly
I have spent 100 dollars for a class just to be able to do the homework online
And as of the new year there will be the deutschlandweite Semesterticket finaly
…does it though? For anything under $3k per month in NYC you’re either sharing a spot with roommates or you share a bathroom with everyone on your floor, or you’re living in a studio apartment the size of a small walk-in closet.
Not in Manhattan, 2300 will be an old studio, or shared flex apt with a roommate or two
Your country is expensive
no way, can barely get a decent apartment in new haven for that
If I lived there and had to pay extra taxes for someone to major in the History of Nintendo or something, I would grumble
I mean, I was being hyperbolic, but it's genuinely ridiculous to hear about basically every other country's postsecondary education situation.
Lot of the time you need an online access code from the book company to do homework, and the code on its own is only slightly less expensive than code+book together.
Used to be about £3k per year when I was at uni, it rose lot long after I graduated. I remember wondering who would pay £9k a year unless they had a solid career path/plan.
A friend of me has both an older brother and younger sister. He’s the only one with a giant debt due to those reasons. Imagine trying to talk about it to your siblings who don’t differ that much in age but neither of them really understands it.
The most successful rioters would immediately entrench themselves as the new 1% and the cycle would repeat anew.
People also *vastly* overestimate the amount that the 1% have as any sort of useful, liquid asset. 

I remember someone saying that Biden should nationalize Elon's net worth and use that to make college and university in the U.S. tuition free. 

They weren't thrilled to learn that doing that would fund the U.S. collegiate system for.................. a little less than 1 year. 

And that's the richest guy in the world.
10k in debt is not substatial if the average house price is 420k atm.

Our goverment screwed up a lot and housing shortages create massive house price inflation for the median households. But to say 10k makes you unable to buy a house before 50 is just not true.
This post
For some people, they'd never use a decimal like that to signify hundreds of thousands, so they probably were just caught in two minds. It made me pause for a second when scrolling through.
The other half of the world also uses that decimal point seperator system, not just the US.
In Australia we write $150'000 🙃
Which is 751 in decimal odds
No? 1.7 million would be 1.786.234 like you said and 1 thousand 7 hundred 86 point 234 would be 1.786,234
No, because 1,786,234 would mean 1.7 million. 1.786.234 doesn't exist because after the 1. It becomes decimals, so it would be 1,786234.
Yeah honestly we talk about Leicesters win being unlikely, but 5000:1 is A LOT
5000/1 is insane. There have only been 30 years of premier league, and already one super surprise win.
They do yes, football isn’t the only thing they take bets on. I’m not sure you understand that they mean they took a loss that season on bets as far as winning the premier league is concerned. No suggestion that they took a loss on their entire years takings as a result.
Rent for a small room in such fraternity type houses are usually around 400-500 a month if you are lucky. But it’s very common to pay 600 to 700
A single person estimated monthly costs are 824.5£ (949.5€) without rent ([Source](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Utrecht)).

So, you'd need about €1600 per month to live somewhat modestly and pay rent in Utrecht. A student assistant can make about €16/hr as a student assistant. Depending on how many hours they work, they ***might*** be able to get away without a loan. But, more likely, they will take a loan, but one more modest than the UK (about £40k) or US students (silly money) may need.

That is roughly what a Student Assistent might make. A PhD student would make more like €30k.
Visiting any US sub about finance is absolutely wild. People would be saying "80k/year ? You're getting exploited, what are you, a child in a coal mine ? Get a better job !" While over here you'd be among the 5%
42k GBP is 7k0 CAD and 52k USD.

Also, knock off the cost of health insurance and cut dental by like 60%.


Unless you are a software engineer but not living in Silicon Valley area then effective wages aren't that much higher in the US.
Not sure if I'm quite following here, so apologies if I have my wires crossed. Are you saying that the average graduate salary is 42k in the UK? A quick search says it's £23.5k, with a range of 21-29k depending on experience. 

For reference you'd earn around 20k working in McDonald's if the hours were equal
Yeah this is true. I say this as a Dutchman that moved to the states and now back in NL with an American job. The US salary is significantly higher. I mean, once everything is accounted for, maybe not, but being able to have an American salary in the Netherlands is really nice.
yeah americans are super defensive about that, we're definitely not the first people to say that we're getting fleeced at every step of our lives.
Nah, you can get some 1brs around that. Maybe not in most of manhattan, but plenty of stuff in brooklyn. Shit, I know some people that live in a 3br place for less than 1k/mo per person in brooklyn.
I lived in a studio loft in Manhattan for 2400 a month by myself
The Danish unemployment rate is lower than the American despite everyone majoring in the history of Nintendo so it must be working

Same here. Was at ubu when lib dens got in power die to saying they would make sure fees didn't  rise. Then as soon as they got in power with tories they did nothing and let the fees triple. Felt bad for the students after me
It would even end up worse, like Stalin's Russia or Mao's China
Guys I'm just gonna hold onto all this stuff for safekeeping until we figure out how to fairly distribute it.
Reminds me of the people that seem to think we can simply fix everything if we just reduce our military budget.  Not saying we don't overspend there, but the fed budget already allocates more on healthcare than military.
You cant get a mortgage with that amount of debt here, its nearly impossible. Were in a massive housing crisis regardless but no bank is willing to give mortgages to people with college debt like that
lol was meant to be tongue in cheek, guess it didn’t translate through to text
Bloody commiss and their metric system
It can exist because decimal point also means comma
Math doesn't add up, there are only 20 teams in the league..
That still sounds fine tbh, I paid more in Cologne
Man these comments made it out to be some impossible absurd high cost. That’s not unreasonable at all
Lol that's not crazy high at all, they have high salaries
I also spend some time on /r/PersonalFinanceCanada and every other day there's a post asking "I work in X field, should I just move to the US?" and it isn't just software engineers.
No, /r/accounting is mostly for CPAs, I think you call ACCA in the UK. But anyways, a 3-4 year degree plus a professional designation (CA/CPA) gets you a modest increase over an average graduate.
My neighbor will complain about how expensive gas is before climbing into one of their family's 3 massive SUVs to go to work down a mile. They're a family of 4 with 2 adult children who both work remotely (only the dad works more than a 5 min drive). We're all a bunch of suckers here
I didn't say everyone, was giving an extreme example -- but getting paid for uni studies doesn't seem a sustainable policy model for most countries, it may work there though, so kudos.
bless your professors, who probably could have picked that type of book
Lol if you can't pay off 10k debt waaay before you're 50, you shouldn't even be smelling at mortgages.
Sure, but the amount is so small compared to buying a house, if you can buy the house you can also just pay off the debt.
No, it doesn't.

1,500,000.25 would be 1.500.000,25. Both would mean 1 million, 500 thousand and point 25.
Yeah exactly, it’s 50/50 for each team you either win the league or you don’t!
Even though you're getting down voted you're exactly correct. Every single team has 0 points at the start of the season. And has as much opportunity as any other team to get more points in order to place higher. If you're getting 5000 to 1 odds in a competition with only 20 participants you're getting great odds to bet on the underdogs
Student jobs pay very little
It's just perspective, for us in the Netherlands it is seen as an expensive room and likely only like 10-13m2.
Yeh and i've looked into it, and while the base pay is higher, when you factor in other costs its nowhere near as worth it as it seems.

Especially if you have kids and want them on your health insurance.

And then you've got Copays and deductables whereas in the UK everything is free, Prescriptions are £10 no matter what the medication and max out at £150 a year if you have a consistent medication.

If you have a mild car crash or break a bone and have to pay a copay that can be a big chunk of the extra money from the year gone.

In certain instances it can be better, if you manage to get a job in a very low cost of living area in the US but have high pay it can be worth it.

But unless you get a high paying job at FANG etc the benefits are not as high as they seem.


Like you basically have to be earning at least 50% more in real terms and then again, if you have kids its going to be much cheaper to send them to uni in the UK than in the US.
thats mostly because CAD is extremely weak relatively, and pay is very low for professionals. Getting paid the same salary just in USD is already effectively 30% raise.

There are a lot of hidden costs to moving that aren't really thought about when someone makes a post like that, and that's exactly why they make that post. To make sure the hidden costs will still be low enough to benefit.

Proximity is also a massive factor. A lot of the times you can find a job in your field for the same salary (in usd) and its only a 2 hour drive south. You're barely upending your life at all at that point.
It's incredibly sustainable. Education is literally the best possible long term investment for a country. Even if you study ostensibly useless subjects like the History of Nintendo, you'll learn plenty of useful skills like critical thinking, communicating complicated abstract theories and analysing media. Society is richer for it.
never even heard of that tbh xd

>And has as much opportunity as any other team to get more points in order to place higher

If this were true league tables would look radically different from year to year. In the PL and a lot of other top leagues, they don't.
8 people cannot pick up on a joke.
The basic salary is similar to Germany isn't it?
> And then you've got Copays and deductables whereas in the UK everything is free

This is nonsense. My health condition costs me over £100 a month and the NHS doesn't do a damn thing.

Last week, I had to go for an eye test and buy new glasses and it cost me over £240. 

If I want to actually get a dentist appointment, then that's more money.

It's a complete myth that "everything is free" on the NHS. You end up paying out of pocket half the time by things they don't cover, or having to go private to get problems sorted because their waiting lists are too long.
£10 for a prescription??  That’s £10 more than I’ve ever paid and who ran you over and gave you an invoice? 😂
Sometimes the professor is the one who wrote the book.
[Instagram] Argentina NT posted these pictures after their 2-0 win in response to Drake betting against them in the SF
Drake keeps getting L’s and I’m all for it
Canada: Not gonna lie, this shit was some good exercise.
kendrick handed out a generational ass-beating
As soon as Drake posted that, what little hope I had for a result evaporated lol
How many opps he really got? mean, it's too many options...
Say Drake…..
Imagine fucking up so bad that the reigning World Cup champions indirectly call you a pedophile
It's just a matter of time until He bets on Spain, given that there's a 16 year old there
“5’7, I’m Messi, girl”
~Kendrick Lamar, The Hillbillies, 2023
I don’t blame Drake for backing his home country, but cmon, everyone knew the result before the game started.
Drakes L has transcended music itself
Drake must get a thrill out of losing
You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
*You got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems*
gambling glorificatiing nonce need to shut up
Kendrick caused irreparable damage to Drake’s stock and it’s amazing to watch
Not Like Us is the easiest gotcha victory lap thing ever known to mankind
Messi on the ball hoe
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-Minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Not a minor mistake but a big one by Drake.
Does the Drake betting curse even exist atm?
Gamblers are crazy people but who in their right mind thought Canada had a chance.
LMAO
Do people still think these bets are real? Even if the bets are real, it’s Drake’s (or any other celebrity promoting these betting companies) money?

It’s just an ad and I hate the commentators for bringing it up like it’s supposed to mean something.
I love the internet
ffs drake can’t stop catching Ls
NGL this is high key hilarious 🤣 
drake getting cooked in every sport ffs
The fact that drake put $300k on argentina losing makes this 10x funnier
loool that’s jokes
I thought he'd be more interested in Spain since they have a 16 year old one.
Tough year for the 69 god.
Drake keeps getting owned lmao. What a fuckin clown.
He a fan he a fan he a fan
The curse of Drake. 


He bets on the Edmonton Oilers to win the Stanley Cup...

He bets on Canada to beat Argentina....


A fool and his money are soon parted.
Bullying Drake is child’s play at this point.
How many L’s can a Drake take ?
Drake taking Ls all 2024. Gods plan
Drake just fell to his knees on epsteins island
I wouldn’t be surprised if Drake straight up ends it all
Drake is a walking L. Certified PDF file 👎
The 2024 Canadian Missile Crisis will be an all-timer.
I love it and I think we deserve it
Yo any graphic design chef knows what is the exact font?
Pedo degen already did it to the Oilers, so thanks for the inverse bet.
I mean fFS as if Drake was already a joke in the Americas of the North.. 

They went and bet against the king in the raining champions as a publicity stunt to represent Canada where the majority of people probably want nothing to do with OVO and their sad crew, now they got the best their ever was and his team being like... 
They not like us. 

How embarrassing
Betting is an absolute nonce's game and my, how it shows...
fantastic. get this celeb shit out of the football subreddit tho
Everything that came out of this beef is next-level. It really feels like all the years of Drake sneak-dissing everyone came back to bite him in the ass thousandfold, and it's great to see.
r/drizzy takes yet another L
Anybody who follows r/MMA is very familiar with the Drake curse, he has this knack for choosing the loser of any given fight.
Drake must not watch soccer because it was blatantly obvious that Argentina would win just by watching the first half. 
You think Argentina gonna let you disrespect Messi, crodie? That Buenos Aires show might be your last, crodie :)
Noo not them also nooo
I saw it and had no idea what was the meaning of the phrase and the gothic font... initially looked like a clothes brand ad, now I get it. 
 
Looks like the CM is drinking too much US culture... unnecessary and probably not relevant for Argentinian fans.
The Drake curse strikes again
They should be happy he bet against them lol
No way lmao
*Great banter!*
He can’t catch a break! Hahaha
Everyone loved that.
People really turned on Drake huh
That’s actually awesome
ive never seen someone get internationally fried like this lmao
Did they delete it? Post not there anymore
Yeah....ive seen enough now 😭. If i go blind i wont even be mad. 2024 is full of random shit
Of course they won. Drake never wins his bets 
Godtier level post
Holy savagery batman 😳.  Argentina just ripped Drake and his 300k apart
Drake's gotten hammered so hard, even the DJs at his own concerts are playing Kendrick. I seriously don't think there's ever been this one sided of a beef in the history of hip hop.
Drake doesn’t watch football… y did he think Canada would beat Argentina… plz Canadians should only put money on hockey…
It’s outrageous how bad he is at picking winners in basically all sports. Might even be worse than Clay Travis.
Always bet the opposite of whatever Drake is betting on.
This is a planetary prank at this point.
What a coincidence, listening to the same song while reading this post.
Dude what’s with every single adidas kit currently having that line that goes down the side and connects to the shorts ?!

They’re literally all the exact same design !
This is an incredibly funny thing for the whitest nation in the Americas to post.
When Argentinian fans claim someone is not like them, they usually mean something else, if you know what I mean
Who the heck is Drake?
Because I live under a rock and don't follow celebs I literally don't get this post? I'm aware there was some btec battle with both these people, but I just see a picture  with a group lads celebrating after a goal / result.
Drake curse strikes again!
Hahahah
Did they take it down??
Who the fuck is drake?
Good. That's what Drake gets for cosplaying as a gangster for 10 years.
This is like Canada dunking on Barbados in a World Cup hockey final.
Amazing
oh jimmy…
Another L for Drake.
Dang, savage mode engaged!
Messi on the beat yo
Fair play to them 😆
It’s not real
I’m pretty sure this being said but he is from Canada.  Why wouldn’t he back his home country to win?  The come up would be way more than betting on Argentina too.
Drake's shit-covered owl feathers are getting all over our national team.
I mean he could’ve just gave me that money. Canada never had a shot 😂
Drake should have known tbh.
I would have gone with "Get fucked you smug over-rated hack" but sure, you do you fellas.
LMAOOOO
The irony of them positing this is wild.
Hhh
Argentina is definitely “not like us” in Latin America…
Drake is paid by Stake to promote their website. He didn't bet 300k on Canada, not really.
Are Endrick Lama and Drake enemies? (I don't know nothing about Ami rap)
Super ironic
Not the Latin American team with the whitest team in S/N America even over USA.
Drake frequently bets millions of dollars on sporting events. Him putting $300K on Canada is him just having a taste, taking a chance on what were likely really long odds on the off chance Canada pulled of a shock.
Mans can’t put a casual bet on his own country anymore 😂 Lol at Argentina acting like this wasn’t a walk for them
The racist country using not like us

Cringe.
Well this wasn’t on my bingo card for 2024 lmao
this funny a song saying if not black / from the culture, you not like us… when Argentina got rid most other thier black population 🤣….  what black culture Argentina got ??
Kendrick released arguably the greatest diss track in rap history. It will be remembered forever. He keeps getting Ls from everywhere. He just can't stop losing.
on a side note, didn’t argentina like basically displace its whole black population in favor of the nazi’s???
Cheesy
It’s good to get out, get the legs workin
CONMEBOL: "Get up, you are not done yet"
I mean Drake losing money was my only consolation prize from all this
😂😂😂💀💀💀
Oh, come on! We host the game, get kicked out, and now Canada is playing Argentina? Hey Canada, this isn’t bad at all! Can we at least share the poutine during halftime?
Cabada should be proud they made it this far and had enough to show for. They have a good future if they keep on working on it. The coach also had good tactics.
They might have been a worthy competitor if Canada were really predators and Messi wasn't paying every blogger and editor but it is what it is
Drake got warned at still pulled the trigger (on himself)
After Pusha T, I thought that there was no way that anyone could ever body another rapper like that.

Turns out they very much can.
Drake keeps getting Ls and it's great to watch. But I wonder what actually happens to him in terms of money, influence, fame, etc...

Is he really affected?
”I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that’s something none of you want”
There's a version of this saying in most Asian countries, 'when your parents don't teach you manners as a kid, someone else eventually will when you're an adult' and I love it
[removed]
Transcends nations and languages
J Cole bowed out at the right time.
Canada has been taking multiple L's since Drake came after Kendrick

Leafs knocked out of the Stanley Cup

Edmonton loses the Stanley Cup 

Blue Jays have a losing record since the beef started.

Canada knocked out of the Copa
We should have tried to summon u/AnuloMufa once we saw what was going on. But they've been quiet since we booked our place in the semi against Argentina. smh my head
Take consolation in the fact that at least you are not the biggest loser today
I said the same thing. As soon as the commentators said Drake made a sizable bet, I said "shit, Argentina is winning this game".
Drake bet for the Oilers, and I knew immediately we were gonna lose Game 7.
He did the same thing to the Oilers.
[deleted]
yea
The first 25 maybe 30 minutes Canada had some REAL chances on goal and decent looks. They looked fast and up for it. They were dangerous with balls over the top but noting came of it. After that though the tone shifted. I lost hope for yall then. 

Semis ain't bad.
Certified Lover Boy? Certified loser now!
I here you like them young 
The whole world’s just taking potshots at him at this point and it’s just incredible to watch.
Drake's whole career has been "look at this diss I put out I'm so random teeheee 😜" to which the response always was "You're a cancer to society. You're a deadbeat dad. You're a pedophile. Your friends are pedophiles. Go die in a hole."

Everyone hates this man and I don't blame them.
It's kind of poetic for me that it's Messi's Argentina too. Great year couple of years for short kings cementing their place above their rivals.
Kinda out of the loop, what happened to Drake?
How? I dont get it.
Curious how this plays out in a year from now. How long will every single Canadian sporting event that Drake inevitably publicly bets on, thus further proving Kendrick's criticisms as valid, immediately tie the nation of Canada to pedophilia? Like will this stuff be happening in a year?
Too old?
Yamal turns 17 before the next game, fortunately for Spain the Drake window has passed
He bet on the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals.  I assume it was because they had a Kidd.
It’s kinda funny that Kendrick and Baby Keem compared themselves to Messi and Neymar in that song 🤣
He has a STAKE deal. Basically when he makes these big bets it is a free shot at nothing.  Free bet. And considering he is Canadian and the odds are better, obviously betting on Canada was hardly a strange move, nor a risky one.

It's promotion for STAKE.
Yup which is why if you are rich as fuck and looking for some excitement betting on Canada makes sense, the odds on Argentina would be shit but if Canada randomly pull an upset your bet on them will be huge!
[deleted]
Humiliation kink is a thing
He gets a thrill out of grooming as well.
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angles
**OV HOE**
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
I see what you did there
Even before the beef. Madrid vs OVO Barcelona comes to mind.
He's sponsored by betting companies, so he gets the money for the bet for free, if he wins, he gets paid, if he loses betting company got advertisement for "free" basically.
People who try to bet long-term on expected payout instead of individual situations. 


Canada probably wouldn't win. But let's say if the odds-makers gave you a 1 to 100 payout on Canada then it's worth taking probably. You're moreso betting on betting companies setting the true odds of many games slightly wrong long-term. A lot of people also probably bet on Messi, so I wouldn't be surprised if the odds were more skewed towards Argentina than they should be. 


It's not what Drake did because he's sponsored, and known for stupid bets. Just describing how people who actually make money gambling do (but very few people do actually make money, it's pretty hard to have a good betting strategy like this).
Nobody. That’s what makes it fun.
He has a STAKE deal.Paid to promote gambling. Basically when he makes these big bets it is a free shot at nothing.  Free bet. And considering he is Canadian and the odds are better, obviously betting on Canada was hardly a strange move, never mind a risky one.
That’s just too funny 🤣 
The problem isn't the betting or the money. The problem Drake should be making himself scarce since it's proven he chases minors and hires people who are convicted pedos. Ryan Reynolds could bet on Canada without a fuss.
It does mean something. It means advertising for betting companies that is allowed to run during a game
Not his own money. He gets paid to make bets in order to advertise STAKE. That 300k might as well be monopoly money.
He knows a little something about child's play
You ain’t wrong.

Shit just get stale at this point.
Cause of the Internet? You guys need to go outside lmao
Quite relevant in music circles even here. Drake isn't very liked by many music lovers here because he's shown pretty shitty attitude when doing shows in Argentina. Not entirely out of nowhere


Edit: also worth noting Kendrick also has his history with Argentina and it's completely opposite with him preferring to hang around less posh areas when he came and showing a lot of down to earth-ness
Argentinians won’t care, but since they’re in NA, well it suits hehe
it's there, at least the one on twitter 
https://x.com/AFASeleccionEN/status/1810857896940290442
What?
'Not Like Us' is probably going to be one of, if not the biggest song of the year, and it is a diss track against Drake.  Drake bet against Argentina (and for Canada) in that game.  

Argentinian social media manager's just having some fun.
They are referencing Kendrick's diss song towards drake 
why lol
These comments are funny to me because black Argentines were winning continental titles when those other countries banned them from professional leagues or even the sport. There's simply not many of them
It’s silly banter on Argentina’s part, but yeah it’s hilariously cringe.
Cope.
cry
Hit ‘em up is still clear unfortunately.
About 5% of Argentine are German descended, which obviously not all are Nazis. For comparison Argentina is 43% Italian descent and 29% Spanish. 


It's true that some Nazis went to Argentina and that was wrong but we are talking about a small small group. 


The US took in many many Nazis and has tons of German descended people and no one says the entire country are Nazis 
Wth?
Nope, that's just the latest case of xenophobic rethoric against us (kinda like American pop culture using the junta as some moral failing of the Argentine people when it was part of a yank plot) 



Colonial Argentina didn't have many black people to start with because the Spanish viceroyalty preferred using indigenous labour because they continued local pre -colonial practices. Then a mix of the million wars we faced in the early days and the fact segregation was never a thing here (leading to normalized interracial relationships) but above all the fact the VAST majority of the population being immigrants because Spain kept an extremely barebones population and African immigration only started becoming common in the past two decades made the % drop
You could drop a hundred more goals, I'll see you later
It’s a good consolation prize though. All we get is kids shit posting Greg memes.
Look I get it, Drakes a bit of a tool with the whole diss track battle with Kendrick  

But a little respect right, Drakes Canadian so why wouldn’t he throw some money and support his own home team.
As much as Kendrick dunked on Drake, Pusha's clap was harder and forced Drake into fatherhood lol. Also Pusha was loaded and ready to go all the way with the diss but Drake chickened out. Nothing will ever top the level of smackdown Pusha executed on Drake in 2018.
On the same dude lmao
Kendrick is more famous but Pusha T is a better rapper and made an entire diss album produced by Kanye West
I think it affects his overall “legacy” if he would have one but the main things is his ego which is definitely hurt, he is a goofy that responds to people on social media, I’m sure he is depressed right now.
He's primarily a popstar so it's unlikely to affect his bottom line. His stock goes down from a hip hop perspective but most of his fanbase are there for the love songs n shit.

The damage is primarily to his pride, and the guy has an ego so that surely hurts. But if he lays low for a bit and sticks to his pop music I doubt there will be a significant impact to his career.
No cause he’s a superstar artist and the majority of his fans are casual that don’t really care about a rap beef or morally corrupted artist.

He’s gonna drop one good ass track and everything will be back to normal.
Not really, he's still one of the most streamed artists around and most of his fans probably weren't even aware there's a rap beef going on.

He doesn't even make his crazy numbers from his actual "rap" songs - it's primarily from songs like One Dance and Passionfruit and those kind pop/dancehall/pop rap songs. Kdot is quite clearly a better rapper than him, but I doubt it's the end of Drake.
No but it's worse IMO. I think he clearly wanted this fight to show he was the big boss of hip hop and he isn't. Once you're that rich is having a bit more money that big of a difference? I think he would rather have taken the respect and pride than the money.
Drake and Ronaldo with the same karma it feels like
he has no street cred to begin with.

so for him, as long as people buy his music, I don't think he cares that much.
He’s gonna be this generation’s ja rule. A much more successful version, but still the same level of beat down.
It will help him. There's no such thing as bad publicity.
We have a similar saying in Swahili.

"Asiyefunzwa na mamaye hufunzwa na ulimwengu."
Metro capitalizing on that and basically starting an open-source dissing project was such a golden move.
What's the matter with this Drake guy? I just know him from the meme format.
The Drake curse might be stronger
👀
Anulo mufa
I mean. hes a big time loser

but the guy bets on low probabilities in events because its good pr for gambling sponsors who pay him to do it. the whole point is he's putting down big bucks to win bigger bucks, which means these bets are way more likely to lose

hes not betting on like, -190 lines
Off the top of my head, 2019 when he supported the Toronto Raptors in the NBA finals was the last time
Wah Wah Wah Wah wah
Very clever
You better never got to La Masia
Someone hide Yamal
The internet has become Drake’s purgatory.
It's been a long time coming.  I'm surprised that it took this long to reach a tiping point.
if they are world champions where's their superbowl? /s
Pusha T: Adonis is your son. Dead beat motherfucker playing border patrol, yughhh. Kendrick: Certified Lover Boy Certified Pedophile 

Drake can’t catch a break, goddamn.

Edit: [as for Pusha, he did diss Birdman, Lil Wayne and to a certain extent Drake in some of his previous songs.](https://www.spin.com/2018/05/pusha-t-infrared-drake-lil-wayne-diss/) Drake dropped a full track against Pusha’s Infrared with Duppy Freestyle, and then Pusha T dropped the story of adidon.
> Everyone hates this man

Well everyone except Camila Cabello apparently
I dislike Drake but not everyone hates him. He’s extremely popular still, you just don’t hang in circles where you would know those people.

>Everyone hates this man and I don't blame them.

I get your point but he's one of the most listened to artists in the world year after year, everyone does not hate him lol
The funniest one had to be the Fantano beef.  How the fuck do you take an L to a music review Youtuber?
Now they gotta face Colombia or Uruguay. Colombia look better than ever
In short, Kendrick Lamar happened. There was a war of diss tracks and Drake got whooped like nobody’s ever been whooped before
Kendrick handed him a generational fade. 

Check out What's The Dirt's videos for the backstory.
Walked into a rap beef with Kendrick Lamar, got completely destroyed, and Kendrick's been dancing on his grave for like a month.  
  
The biggest song of the year, 'Not Like Us', is basically Kendrick calling Drake a pedophile.  
  
It's been immensely entertaining to follow, ngl.
https://www.billboard.com/lists/drake-kendrick-lamar-beef-timeline/
Pretty funny summary: https://youtu.be/K3uWj2MpydI
Not Like Us is a song about how Drake is a pedophile, among various other accusations levied at him
Hey, if it is below 18, Drake gon do his thing
Imma pass it to Neymar he got time for yo bestie girl
>  considering he is Canadian and the odds are better, obviously betting on Canada was hardly a strange move


I don't bet on games. But I have always been of the opposite idea. Bet on your opponent.

If your team wins, you are happy because that's what you wanted. If your teams loses, at least you won some money.
Yup, there is somewhere screenshots of Drake's stake account history, he he has lost like 2 billion... It's crazy how such fake advertising is allowed because he isn't playing with real money.
i regret nothing about putting $20 on Canada to win the last world cup
I don't know why you got downvoted, it's absolutely true, no one was expecting a Saudi win. Canada's chances yesterday were low but we played badly against Ecuador and only won through pen shootout so it wasn't a given that we'd go through.
Exactly. If we always know who’s going to win why do we even play the games?
Why did they say that? Because most of the time, Argentina would win. 

Just because Saudi Arabia won once that's not a good reason to think the underdog wins every time or to argue that betting on the underdog is reasonable.
He's a masochist.
Then he must be on an all time buzz these last weeks
Fabricating stories on the family front cause you heard Mr Morales.
i had no idea OVO was a drake thing (because i'm old) and now it cracks me up whenever i see people wearing it

lmao
You think the bay gonna let you disrespect pac n****?
I saw him place two cricket bets. KKR to win the IPL final against SRH, and India to beat Pakistan in the T20 World Cup. Got both of them right.
Damn, just another example of him being an all round shitty person.
What a goddamn scam artist.
That’s just extremely shitty.
I have been telling people this and they don't believe me. He's sponsored, majority of his "bets" are fake. It's all advertising. 

But no they think he is actually making bets and they are just allowed to search his account and advertise it.......
Yeah at this odds it’s not *that* dumb of a bet to make. 100 to 1 means more or less that Canada has a 1% chance to win according to the bookies, so if you think they would win at least once if the game is played 100 times, it’s technically „worth” it
Maybe it’s different here as gambling has been in my state here in the US for less than a year, but it’s actually pretty easy to make money imo.

You can simply stick to promos, weeding out the shit ones that aren’t +ev. You don’t make much at all; the amount of money you can place on those bets is limited. Still, you will be up long term. 

To be fair, I’m probably reading too much into your comment as I know that betting +ev without promos is significantly more challenging, but even then, I’d argue that the more difficult part is avoiding being limited by the books. There are plenty of tools out there that data scrape lines and point you in the right direction.
Yes, the pun was intended.
Quite relevant? I think we're living on a different country or it's something generational, because neither me or my friends know anything about Drake, I just know the song passionfruit... but just that.
It make some sense to have it in the official English account, but for me is a little childish to answer somebody in particular and totally irrelevant. Seems like a cool move from a young CM/admin who wanted to have fun
Oh ok. OP is from instagram and it's not there!
Because.... 


You're almost there.
I'm not sure NLU is even the best diss track against Drake, simply because Adidon was so brutal.  

NLU is probably the biggest mainstream hit among all the diss tracks though.
why are acting like argentina is not racist towards black people? literally if you ask black folks in argentina how it is they’ll tell you.
so you want to comment on the fuckery that’s going on now with argentina’s team, your vp, etc?
Now they're gonna go on holiday lol they'd probably watch the highlights if Argentina weren't doing that scoring bullshit.
he's not betting his own money, he is being staked by a betting site to promote them
Because it is performative. He is subsidised by a gambling company to make bets, and he has made this bet as marketing for them, not because he thought it was a sensible thing he would have done with his own money.

Kendrick doesn’t just call Drake a pedo. The latter verses more specifically go into how Drake’s corporatisation and commodification of rap music and successful artists is parasitic and predatory. That Drake, an outsider worth nearly a billion dollars, goes into some of the most deprived communities in North America, takes what he can to further his career, and then screws over large numbers of the people that helped him.

Supporting a gambling company is a great example of this. They are rich not because they provide a good or service, but because they exploit people. That is how they get the money to pay Drake, a billionaire, who is offering nothing but his fans as a sacrifice to the almighty dollar.

That is why it was powerful that Kendrick went to LA and United the black community, including most street gangs, into a single night of fun, coming together to collectively call Drake a pedo.
"A little respect" for a mid rapper, underage child groomer, not for me thanks.
Even if he thinks he is, Drake is not the patron saint of Canada
Drake is a notorious bandwagon fan. In the NBA he'll support whichever team and player is in the limelight and will get him the most media attention. Man swaps jerseys on the daily. He'll be in the club celebrating with whichever team wins.
Because fuck Drake. He likes minors.
No respect for pedophiles
There are betters way to show support on your team then betting, he could send a message through IG.
I bet you he didn't. He probably bet against them. Dude is a vulture who's been scavenging on anyone and anything.
All respect for Canadians, but that guy is a certified pedophile
Push destroyed him but I think Kendrick's diss has a bigger lasting impact.


It's the biggest song in the world for 2 months now. Even non rap fans are playing it.


He'll never escape Not Like Us
Pusha absolutely destroyed him but he didn't have the commercial reach Kendrick does. Drake could just brush it off and move on a few months later. I honestly don't see him coming back from this in the next months.
I think Drake really thought he would be able to beat either of them and was just absolutely destroyed in both.

Pusha might have bullied him into fatherhood, but Kendrick questioned his place in the culture in a way that no one else has ever been able to. Both "Not Like Us" and "euphoria" questioned that way more than any other song, even ones as brutal as "meet the grahams" or "6:16 in LA".
Kendrick literally attacked his entire family, called him a colonizer, took away his n-word pass, and also mentioned another (multiple?) secret kid. Not to mention he beat Drake at his own game, making a club banger and a worldwide appealing song. I think Kendrick is just a tad more hurtful and impactful. Both Pusha P and Kendrick killed Drake, though.
This is absolutely facts.. Dude couldnt even acknowledge his name as if he was Voldemort to drake himself..
Pusha Thanos made the dude be a father to a kid that diss was INCREDIBLE.

Cover photo for the song was also insane
>Nothing will ever top the level of smackdown Pusha executed on Drake in 2018.

While it will never stop being funny that Push basically bullied Drake into being a father, Kendrick's basically put out the biggest song of the year, a club banger which will be played everywhere for like the next decade, and it's explicitly calling Drake a pedo. 'Adidon' was big in rap circles, but NLU is big everywhere. It's entered the cultural mainstream in a way Adidon never did, and the idea of Drake being a predator has hit the mainstream. 

I think Kendrick has this.
The thing with Drake's kid that's wild to me is that adidas supposedly were going to feature Adonis in an ad campaign. Which is fucking crazy. The world didn't even know he had a kid and he was going to get announced like a summer transfer. If that's true Drake is a fucking moron
I think people will be reluctant to work with a guy that has a number 1 song calling him and everyone at his label pedophiles
drake fans 🤝 chris brown fans
>most of his fans probably weren't even aware there's a rap beef going on.

Yeah exactly. Most of his fans aren't aware they are following a pedophile. Probably they don't even care.
>"Asiyefunzwa na mamaye hufunzwa na ulimwengu."


i agree
I made my own saying, how's my grammar? 


>Ambaye hajafunzwa kuhusu maisha na mama yake ni lazima afunzwe na mpira
Latin America too:

"Lo que no se aprende en la casa, te lo enseñan en la calle "
Drake was getting dissed by 17 year old Soundcloud rappers from around the world.  It was glorious.
He is a middle class guy from Toronto. He makes catchy and inherently shallow radio hits, while trying to capitalize on American/Caribbean/British music and street culture. He is a sex addict, who started his career by capitalizing on feminism, destroyed the long-term relationships of multiple of his former friends, hid a son for a long time because he was embarrassed of the child's mother. He is a gambling addict. He is known for practically stealing demos from smaller artists and releasing the songs as his own. He is a groomer. And that's only some of the stuff that's fairly well-documented.

He would have been left alone, but he is very touchy about his status as the biggest selling hip hop artist and will continuously diss other people in his songs without saying their names (i.e. sneak dissing), which is essentially trying to build plausible deniability. This year essentially everyone who was slighted by him came together to beat his ass and Kendrick led the charge.

Listen to the songs from the beef, it's all laid out.
Insane the raptors managed to win a title with Drake on the bandwagon
Nah Drake bet on Argentina to win the 22 World Cup final. Anulo Mufa / Messi aura is stronger.
dot fuck em up
Pusha really got the ball rolling, but he wasn't a commercially big artist so it did not have as huge of an effect (though it did make Drake reveal he had a son which is crazy). Meek was already known as corny, so it wasn't going to go well for him in a battle against Drake
I don't think it's really going anywhere though, is it? What's the tipping point?

People who like Drake (clowns) still like Drake. People who don't, continue not to.
It's in Miami.
These aren't strays
He shouldn't have signed with Young Money tbh lol. Dude was running hot off his mixtapes Comeback Season and So Far Gone, where he wasn't this "tough guy" persona. Imagine if he had joined 1st and 15(Lupe's label) instead, would've been a whole different outcome I bet. 

Fun fact: it was down to Young Money and 1st and 15 that tabled offers to him to sign him. Obviously, his work with Lil Wayne influenced the decision but yeah.
I still think Pusha T did a better job at dissing Drake even though they weren't as popular
Well she's a racist who's career is in the gutter. She needs all the help she can get.
and thank god i don't
Yeah but people still listen to chris brown after he beat rihanna into the hospital.
Not only that but its hardly been his entire career….
Everyone that KNOWS him seems to hate him tho
has there been proof of him being a pedo other than Kendrick making a diss track?
Hold up. We've seen guys careers actually ended from rap beefs. ATK v KTA has like a dozen deaths. Drake is still one of the most popular artists. He got bodied here, but next summer every Starbucks chick is gonna still be bumping the newest pop song he puts out.
correct me in this but the pedophile was from millie bobby brown?
~~Drizzy~~ Diddy Drake
Hedging happiness
This way no matter the outcome, you're also suffering a loss. I'd rather go high risk high reward
Unless of course you’re so unlucky that it ends in a draw and your team gets dumped out on pens.
cowardly
Technically you always lose instead of always win its just how you see it
A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now
I have a generic brand shirt with some knockoff looking owl brand icon on it.  

I've started calling it my "OV HOE" shirt after that song dropped.
The Oakland show is gonna be your last stop n****.
Promoting addiction with no risk to his own skin, if it ain't peak capitalism I dunno what is
Gambling problems, drinking problems, pill-popping and spending problems, bad with money, whorehouse, soliciting women problems
Tbf, that example wasn’t using actual odds. Iirc, Canada was +440 (5.4) to advance, which isn’t anything close to 100 to 1. The 3-way-line had ‘em at a little better than 10 to 1 (again iirc, could be a bit off).

100 to 1 would have been a ridiculously good bet that I would’ve hammered for my max bet size. If you bet +ev in the long run, you win. Period. If you don’t, you lose. 

I’m not the most sophisticated bettor out there and mostly stick to promos with low $$ in max bets, but still, learning the math and using it is really not that difficult.
To be clear, idk what the actual odds given were, I just gave an extreme example to show the point.
How many times do you have to bet the promo money to be allowed to cash out? Most people are pretty bad at betting, which is why companies give away "free" money. 


I don't bet because I don't like losing money and don't really have time to scrape through how to actually make money doing it, I'm just curious about strategies because I understand statistics at a decent level.
It's probably generational and the fact I know a lot of people quite into current music. Drake came to a festival and was extremely shitty to fans, cut the show short randomly and was the only artist to refuse the rights to televise his show (a decision he made minutes before) 


Among music fans it had almost the same effect as Bieber wiping the floor with the Argentine flag in the mid 2010s so in social media (which is what content managers have to look to for their posts) people were joking en masse about the bet, it was an easy choice to make a throwaway joke about it
Right now, most of the CMs of brands I follow are Gen Z. Ryanair for example, and many other football teams
you're right, I thought it was from twitter.

I found it on @afaseleccionen instagram https://www.instagram.com/p/C9OYnlquViy/
Yeah I hear that, debatable whether it’s even the best one Kendrick put out either. Had a much bigger impact though, a song calling him and his entourage a group of pedos going this viral has basically ruined his image, and without that, he doesn’t really have anything(as a rapper).

Hit ‘em up is just a classic for me. Can tell it’s just  straight up hatred, he genuinely wanted to kill all of them when he made that.
hehehe "staked by"
And still zero people give a shit about his bets or Stake.
Indeed, they give a bunch of money for famous people to bet. Anuel AA is always posting his bets on Stake too
Did it for the Oilers too during the Stanley Cup Finals. He’s from TO, he has zero reason to care about the Oilers.
It's funny that I learned more about this beef on a football sub than anywhere else. Lol
Why they call Drake a pedo?
> not because he thought it was a sensible thing he would have done with his own money.

Thats false. Before he was partnered with stake he was a normal player and yes he did absolute degen bets at the time :-)
I'm kinda peeved that Drake even "represents" us tbh.  I want Toronto or Canada to have nothing to do with him, and that was before the Kendrick beef.
Majority of us dislike him…. We have loads of better musicians we should celebrate over that clown
Also don't forget Drake has a job with the Toronto Raptors (NBA team) as their "Global Ambassador".  Funny thing is he's been to our home games like maybe twice in the last year.  Some ambassador he is.
Kendrick's song has transcended the genre, it's truly a generational beat down.
One thing to mention is that Pusha T never cleared the sample of his diss track so it could never be distributed like Kendricks song.

6:16 in LA has the same issue.
Yeah, Push doesn't have the fame to do what Kenny did. But Drake was one step away from a proper execution after "Story of Adidon" dropped, that shit was so insane, Drake had it taken down ASAP
At least drake got a couple good hits in on kendrick. Even if kendrick beat him push ups and family matters are both good diss tricks. Against push it was an absolute massacre.
[Kendrick's literally reached that level in Drake's mind as well lmaoooo](https://x.com/peterealgriffin/status/1807402611340964041/photo/2). Bro has two Voldemorts now.
Cocaine's Dr Seuss does not fuck about lmao
He's one ghost-written hook away from a number 1 himself and all sins will be forgotten, lol
Chris Brown still gets collabs despite beating the shit out of one of the biggest female artists in the world and having the photographic evidence on every corner of the Internet.

The general public is willing to forgive a lot of things as long as you can write a catchy hook.
Chris Brown one is a crazy situation for me cause he beat te shit out of Rihanna, another superstar and got away with it. 

I think if it happened now in the social media era he would definitely be canceled and faded.
Kinda like Chris Brown still having somewhat success.
Yeah pretty much, I don't see the needle moving unless there are actual convictions that come out. Even without that, it's pretty unsavoury for a 32 year old to be texting a 14 year old and it is wild that just got brushed aside at the time.
Just go on the drake sub and you see the mental gymnastic and goal post moving 

He still has his money and fame, he not gonna go anywhere

But he gonna be the internet punching bag for a while. He gonna be the uncool artist like Nickelback or something

Really? I think it's a little too generalized, personally. In my opinion a better saying would be: 


"Ambaye hajafunzwa kuhusu maisha na mama yake ni lazima afunzwe na mpira."


But that's just me.
Your version translates to, "who hasn't been taught about life by his mother, must be taught by ball"

Ambaye is a pronoun. You should probably have it as 'mtu ambaye...' i.e 'someone who... '

Mpira is ball. 

Not a bad attempt at making your own though.
Ha well if you recall, that was the one time he purposefully wore the opponent's jersey to reverse the power of the curse. He was wearing bucks shorts for the conference finals.
Drake bet on regular time win. Going to penalty shootout meant he actually lost iirc.
I think be bet for them to win the game in regulation (momeyline)
The only time I've seen drake get what he wants in a high stakes sports game is when he wore Milwaukee Bucks shorts to help the Raptors, which worked. So even in that instance the drake curse was effective.
He probably might garner some more respect within the Hip Hop circle, but he probably won’t be as hot as he is right now.
No shit. Man basically bullied him to fatherhood.
Kendrick hurt him the most in the public's eye. Pusha T hurt him personally the most
How is she a racist?
Honestly Chris Brown is a more pronounced POS.
For the same reason, many people don't care or dislike him for it
Among others, it's Been A Thing
Drake's creep lore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUuSSXfViKw&pp=ygUSZHJha2UncyBjcmVlcCBsb3Jl
There's been kind of a lot, but that's one of the more famous ones, yeah.
Happiness doesnt exist in the betting world
I guess you are one of those half empty kinda guys
I think you can bet on final outcome as well, not just who wins the game though.
you're not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted
I mean, this would happen in any free society with currency regardless of ownership of the means of production
I think they were around 10 to 1 actually, you could still make a case for this Canadian team to beat Argentina once out of ten games 
The kind of promo money you’re describing varies from book to book but generally isn’t very restricted. For example, if you get a promo to sign up, bet $5, and receive $150 in bonus bets, you can bet that $150 and withdraw whatever you win. You don’t get the “stake” back w bonus bets ofc, but you can usually do something simple like bet $75 against itself and take the free $68. [Here’s](https://youtu.be/NlShSEX89aQ?si=8kg8qurMfnrGmcPK) a walkthrough of a slightly more sophisticated strategy for one sign up promo. 

These are actually ridiculous and I encourage anyone who despises gambling to take advantage of them. The sign up promos are essentially customer acquisition strategies; the books know that x amount of people who sign up will use the promos and get hooked. If you withdraw the money and close your account, you’re set. 

Anyways, the promos I was referring to are the daily ones that the books will put up. For example, sometimes you’ll see a 50% boost in winnings with a max $20 bet. Most of the time though, there will be specific bets (again with limited max bets) that have odds boosts. For example, let’s say that the promo was Argentina. Instead of -300, maybe it would be boosted to -150. They’re usually a little more complicated than that, but [this tool](http://crazyninjamike.com/public/sportsbooks/sportsbook_devigger.aspx) can help with the math.

Some promos are phenomenal. Many still favor the books after the boost. You have to figure out what’s worth it and what isn’t. There’s a daily thread over on r/sportsbook that people contribute to, although it’s important to double check things. Lines change. Promos change. People make mistakes. 

Regardless, it’s more of a hobby for me than anything. Apart from the sign ups, the promos aren’t usually that great. But then again, money is money.
Thanks for the context, seems like quite an unlikable guy.

On the other side, I get the comparison with what Bieber did (which is much more offensive and controversial, probably deserved jail for some days), but I'm just complaining because of the lack of professionalism posting that on an Argentinian official account.
But Ryanair is an airline. Argentinian NT is not a brand per se, it's a national football team...

It looks more childish as we got deep into the post.
Ohhh it's just burried in their page. Didn't realize they posted so much lol
Only way to kill vampires.
Stakes booming, they've blown up and made millions from their advertising already
I wish that were the case, gambling is a widespread illness.
I doubt Drake even likes hockey like that lol. He probably just bet the Canadian team. He’s always been more of a basketball guy.
Take a look at Josh Johnson on YouTube. His stand up bit on explaining the Drake/Kendrick beef to white people is hilarious and informative.
so concise 🤌
There's a NPR Podcast called "Louder Than A Riot" (the first season is amazing) that has an episode on iLoveMakonnen that perfectly shows Drake's MO. 

Makonnen has a hit song in Atlanta, Drake signs him and adds a guest verse. Drake stifles his career and Makonnen can't release anything to build on his buzz. 

Bonus points for Drake seeing him in a club and doing a "hold me back" to try and act hard.
Because he was grooming Milly Bobby Brown when she was a teenager and has some questionable situations apart from that.
A loooong history of questionable behaviour with young girls. [https://youtu.be/nUuSSXfViKw](https://youtu.be/nUuSSXfViKw)

Kissing a 17 year old fan on stage, learning she's 17, then kissing her again and telling her he likes the touch of her breasts.

Texting Millie Bobby Brown relationship advice when she was 14 (he was 31).

Numerous instances of dating girls the moment they turn 18, many of whom he knew when they were still minors.

And that's just what we know, because Millie, Bella Harris, Kylie Jenner, Hailey Bieber etc are all public figures. I shudder to think what the rest of the iceberg looks like.
How can you not enjoy him trying to make it all about himself when Raptors getting their ring and then immediately disappear once they aren't good anymore?
Celine Fucking Dion
Rush are the patron saints of Canada, with Neil Peart standing at the gates of Heaven.
Looking forward to that Kendrick collab with Celine Dion and the remaining members of the Tragically Hip
Like Justin Bieber!
Aye
I wish our good rappers made it big. I feel like Shad is too wholesome to be marketable.
Do you guys like Abel?
This is projecting because streaming numbers disagree with your statement
Y’all have Deadmau5
So I am in no way defending Drake. But an ambassador is usually... Not there? They're like. Somewhere else. Ambassadoring
Meanwhile, Jack Harlow goes to Racing Louisville (NWSL) games and Louisville City games regularly. Can't imagine Drake going to NWSL and USL games for his hometown teams.
What's funny is that it's not even the most savage of the diss tracks during the beef, it's just the one with the catchy beat and quotable lyrics. Meet The Grahams is, in my opinion, way more vicious. He calls out every person in Drake's family by name and basically goes "Drake's a piece of shit and you should feel bad," all under an incredibly eerie beat.
I've seen the tweet saying "Family Matters is basically Liverpool getting 97 points and not winning the league", shit is the best Drake song in years and it's still an afterthought because of Kendrick.
Nah, people were saying Drake's diss on Push was good before The Story of Adidon dropped too.
If he did it today I doubt he would get away with it the same way
its baffling to me how CB has so many fans gawking over him and even paying 1K to get a picture with him
Agreed. It's actually insane how he was nearly universally acclaimed for a while, while all of this was happening. Worse is that it was an open secret within the industry, apparently.
when millie bobby brown offhand mentioned that he gave her a lot of advice "about boys" my skin fucking crawled. dude is at absolute minimum a groomer if not a full pdf
Oh good, it got my message across 😂


Thank you for the corrections. I totally did not just use Google translate. 


I have visited Kenya about 8 years ago, and loved it. There are of course problems, but you have a beautiful country!
Oh for sure, the Young Money machine was unstoppable at that time with the roster they had which definitely elevated him to success.
Yeah Adonis will be thankful to Pusha once he grows up, it'll be hilarious if he makes him his best man or something at his wedding lol
That's a fair take, but we can't really quantify a diss so good that made a deadbeat reconsider his stance on fatherhood, can We?
She had a history of using the N word and interacting with a lot of racist post on tumblr.
She got in trouble for being racist and calling black fellow members of fifth harmony the nword and other things.
Hell some of those rappers that hopped on Kendricks bandwagon got real questionable shit around them too. And Dr. Dre introducing Not Like Us is extremely questionable considering he goes at Drake and his crew for treating women bad
Wouldn’t call it glass half empty, I just accept the risk of a bet. If I wanted to hedge then I just wouldn’t bet.

And betting against your team is nasty work
Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection
I guess the promos are better in the USA, it reminds me of how you guys had extreme couponing, but where I live everything is "only redeem one offer per item" to prevent stacking.


Sportsbooks signup bonuses I've seen heavily advertised usually have complicated play-through requirements (with very long Terms and Conditions) that make sure most people will never see any of that bonus money. I did just check a couple that have simpler ones like you said.


I took a quick glance now and saw that some have simpler bonus bets where you can do that betting against itself thing, but I just checked one sportsbook's ToC's and they say they reserve the right to ban you and not give you winnings when you make weird value-bets, and that contradictory bets don't count towards the bonus (so if you bet $75 against itself, that would count in their system as a $0 bet).
Its also a play on the company name: Stake. Which is the betting company. Its Stake, they own Kick, the new competitor to twitch, the streaming service owned by amazon.
Can’t wait for Audi to replace them in Stake-Sauber
So you're saying Stakes Is High?
The shit we know about Drake in public is weird (texting teenagers, lyrics about liking high school pics, kissing a teenager on stage).

If that's what we know, what we don't know is weirder. Always is.

One can only assume Kendrick has heard enough rumours (and that exaggerated them for their beef)
Not only her. Billy Eilish and some more were also groomed by him. Billie said „he was the nice  she met“. Ironically enough that got caught vibing to that song in L.A.
Texting a child... Perhaps the Strangest Thing of all...
The Holy Trinity!
Kendrick + Broken Social Scene when
Please, we need a We are the World but Kendrick + Canadian artists edition dedicated to dunking on Drake the chode.
Speaking of grooming…. Celine
Billy Talent Kdot collab would be fire
He’s such a good dude. I interviewed him for a university project. Super humble
But he's not doing that either.

He's either touring or going on kick streaming himself gambling money on Stake.
Addresses Drake's mum and says Your sons a sick man I think he should die 😂😂

Got some real Hit Em Up energy on that track and I'm all for it
It flew a bit under the radar because it's not on spotify but "6:16 in LA" is an amazing track altogether even without the disses. 

>Remember when picked up a pen, lyrics that I can trust

>Timid soul, stare in the mirror, askin' where I was from

>Often, I know this type of power is gon' cost

>But I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star

>The mannerisms of Raphael, I can heal and give you art

>But the industry's cooked as I pick the carcass apart

I honestly can't understand how he was able to write something like this in a matter of days.
That’s part of what makes Kendrick so great. He laid down one of the meanest most vicious tracks in Meet the Grahams, but knew it wouldnt have pop appeal, so he made Not Like Us specifically to show up Drake and make something long lasting.
That beat on Meet the Grahams is so great. Great beat to burry someone to. Not Like Us is a great beat to dance on his grave.
Liverpool catching strays lmao
Family matters was good against everyone but Kendrick imo. Especially the part where he explains why Whitney would shake her ass for free (for Dave). Ruined the whole verse lol. Also wow Kendrick is short, cool.
Yeah it’s called Not Like Us. You’re literally in a thread talking about it right now.
I looked it up and it occurred when she was young. She apologised and deeply regretted it. 
I mean, majority of the people on that stage were either active or "retired" gang members. A lot of biggest West Coast rappers are or have been gang members. They all got questionable shit around them, but nobody really cares.
Kendrick just wanted to diss Drake and that's the best way he could do it, it was never about the women.
I make music that electrify ‘em, you make music that pacify ‘em
Lost all your money gambling now you bend over for Stake
I’ll be glad to get rid of the gloss green Sauber, I’m all for green cars in F1 but fuck me it’s awful. Striking, but awful.
He literally sang about how a girl looked hot when she was in high school
Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl hits different
Kendrick + Colter Wall when
smart as hell too
Dude a basketball team called a rapper an "ambassador". I'm pretty sure if he just wears their hat sometimes when he's out at middle schools or wherever the fuck he chills, that's holding up his end of the bargain. Again, I do not like Drake. I just don't think you get what an ambassador is
Because he’s a generational poet and Pulitzer wining artist having a battle of words with a child actor turned pop star lmao.
6:16 in LA is just incredible.  The fact that he's praying to God in the song before destroying Drake is generational hater behavior.
Its on spotify, listed artist is kendr cole, kendrickk
If shake that ass for Free ruined the verse wtf was that whole part about Drake’s secret daughter then lol
And I was pointing out that the story of Addidon was a better diss since it made Drake accept fatherhood
> She apologised and deeply regretted it

She supports a pedophile, so safe to say her morals and ethics are still trash.
Hey man I know that. And I love kendricks music. But I cant say that to people without being called a Drake glazer lol. Hip Hop and the music industry has never given a shit about women or black women but I dont like how some people are trying to crown a kendrick a champion of womens rights or black women
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that’s random acts of kindness
Yeah, I miss the old Alfa Romeo paint scheme, and I’m excited for the Audi one.
And the thing with that model and her birthday
That's crazy , he should be in prison
That part is fine. The part where he explains “but not that kind of free…I’m talking about my n Dave” is what ruins that verse.. like yeah…we got it
She also did a song with a woman beater as well
know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
according to drake:

>If I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested

>I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested
Don't tell no lies about me and i won't tell truths about you
Germany's U17 goalkeeper Konstantin Heide was unable to attend school on Tuesday. He was leading his team into the World Cup final by saving two penalties. This is how his classmates reacted.

Reminds me of Vietnam's run in the 2018 U23  Asian Cup, every classroom stopped what they were doing and tried to find the nearest room with live TVs. We ended up flooding the teachers' lounge and celebrated like there was no tomorrow.
Lovely, they will all remember this for a long time!
Based school and classmates
thank god 8 of them were recording the screen
I sat and watched a rugby game on the TV in the halls of residence at uni and someone was making their international debut who was from the same school as someone in the room. Apparently the debutant was a douchebag so we were willing him to do badly.

Unfortunately, he was the penalty kicker and they were playing a terrible side and the debutant broke some scoring records.

I should look up who that was...
wie geil.
those are the oldest looking teenagers I've ever seen
I love this stupid game
lmfao they really say "heilige Scheiße" 😂😂😂
My teenage ass would be sitting in the corner, fuming with jealousy. Good to see those young lads being so excited!
Old teacher: "Where's Konstantin?"

Student: "He's trying to become World Champion."

Old teacher: "Oh yes, we tried that when I was 17. Sadly we failed."
Proud moment.
Is that an all boys class?
This is super cool, and pretty insane their classmate is playing in the u17 World Cup.

hear quite a bit of "oh my god" and "what the fuck"

Is it common for foreigners to use English phrases like that on a day to day?
Bloody typical, the one day you're missing school they get to watch TV in class
German high schoolers are exactly like Hollywood American high schoolers
From reffing a good number of U17 matches in America, I'm guessing those kids in the school are yelling something like, "Lass uns verdammt noch mal gehen!"?

That's just further proof it's a class room. :D
And I used to hate it when the teacher left the mouse cursor on the screen. This would drive me nuts
My wife watches youtube and tv series on her phone. Keeping it vertical so it's not fullscreen. Fucking drives me nuts.
the problem is once you full screen it starts lagging
Some streams are HELL to keep from devolving into endless add clicking etc...windowed makes sense in the pragmatic way
Sometimes it makes it easier to refresh if you have a bad stream. Justin tv days

full screening causes it to buffer*.

I remember when Trinidad played against Bahrain for a spot in the World Cup, my entire school was allowed to watch the game in the auditorium on the projector lol these moments are just that big for these groups
We were allowed watch the 2002 World Cup in primary school in Ireland.

The whole country stopped anyway, so might as well let us watch!
I'm having flashbacks of the 2002 World Cup right now. One day our teacher let us watch Germany v USA in the middle of class, another time we were sent home early so we could watch a game that day.

Good times.
The teacher knows it's either that or two thirds of the class has their head buried in their phone.
I remember watching a bunch of matches during school. 

-Arg vs South Korea 2010

-Arg vs Switzerland 2014

-All Arg matches in 2018

It was a cool experience. I'm glad the teachers let us come together regardless of the age to enjoy the WC
Looks more like they're just using a room with a TV, probably on a break/not having a lesson at that moment. Would be very weird if this was in class, both because there doesn't seem to be a teacher and there's not a single girl in there (which makes it much more likely this is just a group of boys who commandeered a video room)
If world cup hit school time in France, everybody was listening to the radio in class during my middle school, watching on screen in highschool, nobody there in uni days and when I was working the boss arranged the screened outside and get beers for everyone to watch. 

U17 is almost not watched but if it's your classmate... nobody gonna pay attention to class anyway
Tunisia-Australia from the last World Cup was broadcast in my university's auditorium. They also stopped all classes at that time to allow us to watch the match.

And goddamn I just reminded myself of that painful loss
Different sport, but when Canada plays hockey in the olympics basically everything shuts down. Schools used to wheel tv's into he classrooms and gymnasiums, and everybody just watched the game. It was the best of times.
I remember watching the USA v I think Portugal back in 2014 in my music class. I'm in New Zealand
In 1995 Ajax played Gremio for the world cup for clubteams in Japan. The match starten around 10 am local time (Netherlands). Lots of schools in my region showed the match during class, we listened to the radio broadcast, in the school break I managed to watch the remaining of the game at home. 

Ajax won in the penalty shootout
Depending on my teacher I would watch all the World Cup games I could, people in the hallways watching on their phones too
When I was in grade 5 my math teacher would put World Cup games on the projector. Not because our country was in the World Cup thought lol, just because he was a big World Cup fan.
We were able to arrange a screening in med school for Ind vs Aus cricket finals🥲
During the 2002 WC, our German school's PA system constantly announced all goals of all matches happening during the day.
In 2010 all classes had a tv with the matches running while teaching was continuing.
Watched Mexico vs Cameroon in class during the 2014 WC, I was in primary school in Mexico then
The entire 2008 Olympics were streamed live in the cafeteria at our school and everyone was watching between classes! It was awesome.
Bro last year we got to watch Canada play its WC games but we lost both of them 😭
Yeah but they all watched it vertically filmed on their phones so joke was on them.
It's not that uncommon in Germany. you either watch the games in school or you can go home earlier.

Like during World Cup 2002 we could go home earlier when Germany played at like 12:30.

Was it RTZ? Vibing with SF these days 8)
Seeing them all holding their phones up at the screen like that gave me really creepy vibes like black mirror or something. It's not enough to enjoy something but they have to make sure everybody else knows that they are enjoying it. The future is going to be very weird. Life will just be a performance.
Don’t you know that babies are born with those things (I think they used to be called smartphones) glued to their hands? You die if you drop it.
I think they're some kinda sports related class, because those guys look way bigger than me and my mates did at that age
These kids been eating they Wheaties.
That doesn't make any sense. When you get older people look younger... Like you look at someone ten years younger and they are you ten years ago yet they look like babies despite being grown ups, thus making you feel old. I'm curious to hear your logic here
Really? They look 15 to me and I'm only 34 :/
 well they're near adult age so
Because it's filmed from 27 slightly different angles?
I know there are a few comments in here making fun of them for that, but for what it’s worth, I’m grateful that the moment was recorded because it’s a really cool moment for these kids and seeing their support and their reactions put a smile on my face.
My guess is Charlie Hodgson vs Romania, 2001 (I'm old)
I’m guessing holy shit
Girls prolly don't care enough or cba watching with a group of loud and annoying guys screaming their lungs out haha
I thought that at first but I see it now as everyone just wanting to capture the moment for their best bud

Then again, this is just a video clip so we strangers won't know for sure
embarassing isn't it.
They are saying "oh mein gott". Wtf is fairly common, yes.
I don't think they use any English in the video, actually.

"Oh, mein Gott!" sounds a lot like "Oh my God!".
There‘s a decent amount of English slang from social media, but full English sentences with each other? Rare
Yep, but the title says he "was leading his team into the World Cup final"

To go to the final you have to win the semi-final first lmao
It was free to watch on fifa+
peep url
No need for illegal streams here. The U17 cup games are all for free on FIFA+ anyway. Two or three ads ahead of the game, and that's it.
Nah, you can see the URL. They're streaming from Sky's website.
Semi final is grim?
Got ours already
I'm just glad they didn't watch it frame by frame on an Overheadprojektor.
but where's the cursor in the middle of the screen?
I had a friend who would do this anytime he did a youtube video and he would shoot me a dirty look when I would go over and move the mouse out of screen. Literally every time. Drove me crazy too cause he was "OCD" about so many other things.
I’m pretty sure this is grounds for divorce
Is she short sighted? I do this on my phone sometimes so I don’t have to hold the phone away.

if you venture out in the wild without an adblocker, it's only you who's to blame
If only there was some sort of ad blocking software
There have been a lot of videos on TikTok claiming to be friends of the players. I would take it with a grain of salt.
Berichte uns später wies gelaufen ist
When Germany was playing Serbia in the middle of the day at the 2010 World Cup, our teacher put the game on a projector and let us watch it instead of giving his lesson. We lost the game but the vibes were great. Everyone was dressed up in Germany colors and merch, it was good fun.
Japan World Cup my school opened up the massive gym area, had a projector and provided breakfast for the kids if they came early to watch the game. First time seeing how passionate kids were for soccer when I saw 12/13 year olds crying openly when we got knocked out.
Remember watching Brazil vs Belgium here in class.
Tbf it was just the one game iirc, but my god what a game. I'll never forget the mad celebration for Robbie's last minute equaliser vs Germany.
In Brazil everyone stops to watch the world cup: schools, shops, factories, everything. Even when your classmates or coworkers aren't playing!
In 2002, many of my classmates would listen to games on the radio. Usually, when teachers noticed them, they would ask them to keep them updated with the score.

Fortunately for our productivity, we were quickly eliminated.
Same in Italy
I remember watching it in the school hall on a tiny telly. It makes me sad that we haven't qualified since and today's schoolchildren aren't getting the same experience.
I remember England Nigeria was put on in the school hall, and because kick off was like… 0730 they gave us all a bacon sandwich too.
I watched England lose to Brazil in the 2002 WC and then going into my Maths GCSE that afternoon
They let you have phones in class nowadays?
These active-boards are the replacement for the classic blackboard in a lot of German schools. We have the exact same models at the school I work at.

So probably just an empty class-room they took over during a free period.
Dont wanna say who it was but he didnt last long in the pro scene. His team played against Navi with Dendi.
Must've been notail lmao. He's the one who looks most like a kid. At least 5 years ago he was. Now the dudes for a moustache.
but also, *why* are they filming the match? the video (in much better quality) already exists. if they were filming reactions, that's another thing.
This is nonsense
the present is already weird, the future is going to be downright horrifying.
I find it infuriating when people do this at special events and their devices block the view for others or overall spoils the experience for others. 

The worst time this happened to me was for the fireworks and light show at Disney World Florida. 

Phones and tablets raised in the air to film it, bright screens blocking the actual view for everyone else. 

Just take in the moment and enjoy the moment, you've spent your money to experience this, why spend the entire time filming it to show it to friends and family that will pretend to enjoy watching it.
I was like that as a teen too. Glad I'm over it. But here I am telling you about my experience and watching them watch another's. Life is weird
They are probably attending some kindnof Sportgymnasium. You don't attend the national team without being in some kind of program
I think they only have to be younger than 17 at the Start of the Qualifying. And thats maybe two years ago.

Atleast at the u21 its that way
Could also been Berufsschule. There you get a big age range
Thank you.
27 vertical angles
Romania definitely checks out as a terrible rugby side
Speak for yourself mate
Filming a once in a lifetime moment seems fair enough if I'm honest
oh im stupid
Fuck FIFA, I will always pirate their stuff even if they give it away.
One of the old ones where you have to draw each frame with a marker, not those fancy new digital ones.
That's not how you spell Polylux

No, she literally doesn't care. She will watch a movie with a cursor and seekbar visible and chair blocking half of TV and a vacuum cleaner working nearby and won't complain. I don't get it.

Will never forget Germany - Saudi Arabia on the tiny old school tv during science class in the school basement in 2002.
I am pretty sure it was a Thursday or Friday? We were en route to Hurricane Festival listening on the Radio while drinking 5,0. 

Also nice Felix reference. :D
When i got older i realized the teachers didnt "let us" watch the game. They probably wanted to watch it just as much.
Absolutely, we must be the same age.
Saudi game was definitely on a weekday too, I remember being in school for that as well! Cameroon was a Saturday morning early I think. One of my vivid early memories!
Yeah Germany also. Pretty sure that half the class would pretend to be sick otherwise anyway
"They can use them to learn" is a hell of a gateway drug. Tbh like I imagine you're technically not supposed to? But for something like this no one who wants to watch it is going to follow the rules.
I know I'm old, no need to rub my face in it. I also know that sadly, the standards between schools vary a lot, so this may either be a normal classroom or a dedicated video/internet room
Probably cuz this post now has 4.3K upvotes? We are literally just proving their point...
Idk how to explain it but I kind of get it, even as someone a decade older. Sometimes it's just nice to have your own version of something on your own phone from your own hand from your own viewpoint. Posting it is maybe a whole different question, but I have tons of videos I took of moments where I wasn't even looking at my phone just holding it because I knew I'd want to relive it again later. And asking for/saving someone else's video isn't quite the same. I know it's dumb but I kind of understand the urge to do it.
The way they look on social media is more important to them than living in the present moment. That the film consists of a bunch of other social media addicts filming the screen too doesn't matter for the likes you receive apparently.

If it was a classroom they should also ban mobile phones there. That's luckily what they did in my country.

Don't blame these kids because mobile phones and social media are super addictive and it takes strong determination to withstand and free yourself of the useless dependence. And if you do withstand you probably get rewarded with becoming an outcast in high school life. Perhaps there are a few other souls to connect with who have freed themselves from the shackles too.
I mean, a quick google search will tell you that Heide is indeed 17 years of age (about to turn 18 in Janurary)
too little Monster, too little vapes, nobody sitting in the trunk of a shitty tuned Golf, nobody chatting up a 14yo girl

definitely not Berufsschule
Yep, I looked it up and the record still stands. That was the year I started uni - I wasn't sure whether it might have been spring 2002, but it was autumn 2001.

We were hoping for him to mess up, but he clearly didn't.

By the looks of it the guy at uni must have also gone to Bradford Grammar School

(Source: all from Wikipedia)
But it's already filmed. That's how they are watching it.
weren't there some studies that showed that you remember events worse if you record them?

I rather have a better memory than a file in the cloud i will never watch again
I mean you just need 1 person filming.   Send the clip out after.

Idk they can live how they want, but thats how I handle filmable moments like these. Its great because you get to live in the moment and get the video
Ich habe erst in der Uni gelernt dass das ein Ostwort ist und nicht der offizielle Name

Redditor finds out what it's like to be popular
Lmao if you’re 16 years old playing on a national team for your country’s favorite sport you’d be the most popular kid in school by a country mile. Of course he’s got a ton of friends
The point is to that with so many people posting videos claiming to be his friend it’s unlikely that the one video you stumble across will be the one posted by his actual best friend or a friend in general. They aren’t saying he doesn’t have any friends
Im not saying that all of them are fake. But there have been videos from different schools about the same guy.
Man, that was a great match. Actually that whole world cup was very memorable.
You had school on a Saturday afternoon? ([match started 13:30](https://www.dfb.de/datencenter/weltmeisterschaft/2002-in-japan-suedkorea/gruppe-e/deutschland-saudi-arabien-137382)).  
I just remember it, cause I was at a LAN and we watched the game together.
Felix beschde ;D
No way 5,0 was already around back then.

Edit: Okay, looked it up. Oettinger bought the brand from Carlsberg in 2009. Couldn't find information about when Carlsberg started brewing it. Still it exist longer then I expected.
I remember the cameroon one as well tbf. I can't remember if they let us watch the Saudi match or not. Probably not since it was clearly not going to be as pivotal as the others. But ya I'll never forget that Matty Holland goal. Great times. Wish we could have another memorable journey like that again. The closest we've gotten to magical moments like that is Robbie Brady vs a very weak Italy team.
People have a really snotty attitude, I'm with you. It's like saying, why ever film or photograph anything that somebody else already has?
true
The once in a lifetime moment is their collective experience, watching the highlights clearly isn't the same thing.
Gerade zum ersten Mal gehört/gelesen, wäre aber dafür den Namen für die restlichen 50 Jahre, wo die Dinger noch verwendet werden, zu benutzen.

Kürzer, und geht besser ins Ohr.
"No way someone could have more friends than me"
What, no :D

They celebrate him because they like him. Not because he is a u17 player for the NT. 

Athletes get a bump in popularity, for sure. But if you are a dick, not many give a shit really and wont celebrate in any way. 

Im german by the way and as someone who played at a CL academy club and was surrounded by "great prospects", its not like a movie and you are the quarterback. People are more interested initially but if you aint got the personality to back the interest up, its not a big deal.
unless your team played against south korea
Because of the fucking robbery by the refs
Pretty sure they had a Black-red-gold Edition in 2010 for the Worldcup...
A more efficient solution would be to prop a camera, or even two, in the corner somewhere. And then forget about it and enjoy
US jocks wrecked lol
I wonder how Byron Moreno is doing. Last time I heard about him he was being arrested, lol.
Even the group who’s winners would qualify to play against Korea got shafted lol.
Nah, still pretty cool as a German
Yeah, I just misread everything here. Thought it was about 2002. Forget what I said.
lmao or maybe they don't need an 'efficient solution' and can just hold their phones like they are?

They seem to be enjoying it just fine, it's only Redditors that are worried about it.
Yes, maybe. I always feel bad for people who are preoccupied with their phones and watching important moments through them, but I may be projecting how I would feel. For some people it may be absolutely fine, and no detraction at all from their experience or capacity to be present, I don't know. As long as it doesn't disrupt other people (like holding phones up to film at gigs), then all is fine, each to their own
Eminem has one of the corniest fan bases OAT 
You mfs for real make me embarrassed to be a fan of him. It's either you think he's the only good rapper, you only like him cause he's controversial and the "kiddos are soft" (most of us grew up on Em too), or you lowkey have a certain closested mindset that I'm not gonna say outloud but iykyk. Y'all mfs really said "Hip-hop is back" after we just had one of the greatest beefs in rap history. Get yo stupid asses on bro.
The older I get the weirder I find fandoms, I mean Houdini got me in Stan mode but that goes to the extent of being excited, some people take it way too serious.
Ye Stans laughing in the corner
Ye stans : yeah.

That's basically all fanbases of big artists, it's corn overdose and you better just ignore them and have fun.
Stop giving a shit about fanbases
The fact that Eminem coined the term Stans solidified this for them
[deleted]
Nah the worst are XXX and Juice superfans. they aint the goats stfu lol
Honestly nobody rides dick more than rap fans as a whole.
I think a lot of his fans don’t listen to rap (anymore).
As a fan of Em, I agree 💀
Eminem fans I think vary a ton over lots of different groups, but this is the fan base that quite literally, provided em with the material to write Stan lol.

I'm a millenial fan and seem to fall in the middle. Eminem was on the radio a lot back in the late 90s and early 2000s. Even on rock stations, alternative stations, everywhere. Hearing him on the alternative station my parents listened to when I was younger was my first exposure to modern rap, and is what initially got me interested in hearing more.

That being said, I don't really listen to much after the Eminem show, it's just not my taste after that. I think some of his youngest fans don't know anything lol they've decided he's the goat (which is fair ig) and the actual God of rap. They're crazy and terminally online lol. The gatekeeping, edgy for the sake of edgy, "you kids are so soft you couldn't possibly understand slim shady" gen x fans though? That's a whole other level
Who really actually gives a fuck lmao at this post
Drakes fan base is worse but both are nuts
You spoke about the beef, you been on either rappers subreddit recently? Because what you describe Eminem's fans fits perfectly for r/drizzy and r/kendricklamar
Yea!! Fuck them people for being excited…how dare they  use hyperbole and say “hip hop is back” in the middle of the thrill and emotion of it all!!
his sub on reddit is ok. It's the "stans" on tik tok/youtube, who never listened to one of his albums front to back, only know him from his hit singles, yet have the audacity to make some clueless, pretentious claims about hip-hop, while not knowing shit about hip-hop - they are the corniest dudes
So I grew up as a pretty rabid Eminem fan through my teen years and definitely can agree they're pretty corny speaking from experience. That said as I get older, I can speak to this on saying absolutely every fanbase is just as annoying and corny. 

Kendrick fans basically treat him like Rap Jesus and while yes he is probably the most universally regarded as best in this generation it is annoying how much they worship him. 

Kanye fans are absolutely delusional. It's fine if you like his music. Even his....questionable newer stuff, but the way they even try and defend his shitty actions is ridiculous. 

Old school purists are all super annoying too. The Biggie, Pac, etc fans who think rap hasn't been good for 20 years.  

Basically they're all just as bad as each other. Eminems is definitely NOT any worse than the others. They're all equally terrible the deeper you delve into their respective fanbases.
As a diehard eminem fan, I agree. Some of these fucks are totally obsessed in a bad way
Couldn't be me, the recent rap beef was insane, Grippy was hilarious, that trashy snowday song by drake was so bad it hurt my ears, and now Em, within 1 month of the beef releases his intro for his new album, and I gotta say I'm just so excited to hear a few bars about the shit thats been going on in the industry recently.
I'm a die hard Eminem Stan but the middle aged blonde hos crowing about how "you kids aren't ready for Slim Shady!!!!!!" like the biggest rap song this year wasn't a dance song about paedophilia makes me want to suck an exhaust pipe. Do they not realise how young a lot of Em's fans are? I'm going to kill myself before I turn 35
U right...they remind me of the Maga cult...they believe Eminem is a rap God diss every other artist and won't say one negative thing about him
Stop stanning and saying he is the best battle rapper alive. 

Eminem is not a battle rapper. 
Diss tracks are not battle rap.
Winning a series of battles in your own movie does not make you the greatest battle rapper.

There is an entire subculture of people who have dedicated themselves to advancing this shit in the 22 years since he was a participant.

Eminem was good then but has not battled  despite being able to do that at any time.

So stop minimizing the accomplishments of the many amazing artists forging a subculture you know nothing about just to impress a guy online who does not know you exist.
Facts. I love Eminem as a rapper but god damn does it feel hard to say that sometimes because of the fear that one of the bad ones will leap up and make me regret it by agreeing with me.
Anyone else sick of seeing the term “corny” and “cringe” in every fucking post
Kendrick fans after the beef is over and they’re on some Q Anon type shit  comes to mind
Bro everyone online (instagram and tiktok) is saying that gen z isnt ready for slim shady to come back after he dropped the most tame shit ive ever heard under his slim shady persona. its like if he made the slim shady lp while sober. Everyones freaking out but all he did was say everything is gay and that he has a transgender cat like that shit is not as offensive as they think bruh 😭
Saying Eminem fans are corny is corny by now. People have been saying this since what? Recovery?
Agreed.  And they usually don't listen to any other rappers or rap 

But "Em is the GOAT" LMAO
Drake fanbase is currently the worst I’ve seen

The whole subreddit is people trying to convince themselves that Drake blah blah blah. Could be anything 

They constantly need validation from others. It’s pathetic

Go to the subreddit rn, at least 50% of the posts are people upset about something someone else said about Drake, or them being so insecure they post an opinion just to get pats on the back from strangers online. 

The Eminem subreddit is similar, I literally wrote a comment just like this to someone (who obviously didn’t take it well and then pretended I deleted my comments to “win” the argument). 

Like if you’re so confident in your opinion, you don’t need random strangers online to agree with you constantly. 

It’s sad. It’s pathetic. It screams insecurity.  And honestly shows me that these people have to be under the age of like 14. Because I cannot imagine a grown adult caring about this shit at all.
So true!

Rap has become some sort of dick measuring contest amongst the fans. Like they're using their favs dick to do it though 🤣🤣🤣 

It's borderline romantic..
the bigger a fanbase, the more douchebags it will have.
I think haters and trolls are more corny then fans.
Greatest beefs in rap history it was one of the worst and probably all formulated for clicks and views 😂
why they mad em #1
Bro get off the internet
Nah you’re generalizing one take way too hard.
I am sorry that someone hurt you with their opinion about a rapper, so much that you have to accuse a fan base of racism(almost, you almost had the balls), or being edgelords. I’ll bet in your vast time on this planet you’ve been exposed to many new/old things, and just aren’t easily impressed by the lamest most commercial rapper since vanilla ice, and a guy who’s almost good sometimes, distracting us from pre-election gaza bombing, and Biden doing border theatrics. I am sorry we Em fans make you embarrassed. Sounds like some soft ass kid shit to me, but I have an ass to get on, stupid style.
I'm ngl, it's posts like these that make it harder to be eminem fans. Just be quiet dude. Also, if you're gonna call people racists, just do it. You're probably wrong, but don't be wrong and a coward.
I've watched Drake and Kendrick Stans embarrass themselves for weeks now
Slim Shady haters are even cornier. All of them act like the arbiters of "good" rap and bars and absolutely hate that people enjoy the new single 

Or you get the fucking wack ass takes about how he shouldn't speak on certain subjects from the lamest woke adjacent content creators 

I think Houdini is enjoyable. Nothing groundbreaking and nothing nearly as biting as his old material. It's a fun song when you don't have some little bitch telling you "you're cooked" for listening to it
Rent free
As an Em stan...I agree. Fuck them fuck dre fuck Jimmy fuck my kids to theyre brats
"One of the greatest beefs in rap history" hahahahhahshhahahah
You think Drake/Kendrick is one of the best rap beefs in history? Maybe you need perspective.
Cry some more lol.
Anyone who says corny is lame.
My bum is in your lips. My bum is on your lips. And if you something something might give it a little kiss
That Houdini track isn't even _that_ good
The oldheads are weird af
Every Eminem sub post that has appeared on my feed because of algorithm recommendation still comes off as something penned by some 20+ white guy with repressed rage issues
Love Eminem, literally listened to him my whole life. These Eminem fans are… something. Why can’t we enjoy music?
Thank you bro. Couldn’t have said it better myself. 

I grew up listening to Em back during the Slim Shady & Marshall Mathers LPs when I was in high school. He kind of lost me after that with Encore & Eminem Show as he was clearly leaning into a gimmick. His music became very camp/corny around that time but it’s ultimately what propelled his career. It felt like he was making music specifically for MTV but the numbers showed that it worked.

Then over time he (after MTV died) he tried to reset his career in a more serious path which ultimately led to a long string of seriously mid, 5.0/10-rated releases. At this point the people who preferred his more serious music already moved on because they had to deal with 3-4 straight cornball albums in a row. The popular radio crowd who only liked him for his campiness also didn’t vibe with his more serious style so they also kind of fell off. But then, you have this third type of fan… the *riders*. 

Look, I don’t hate Eminem. While I don’t listen to his music anymore, I respect what he’s done for himself in such a competitive industry. His awards aren’t unrecognized by me. But that third group, the *riders*, are so fucking cringe that it inadvertently makes me dislike him by proxy. 

They believe that he is objectively the best rapper to ever exist, that the industry is just out to get him, that he’s some Messiah that’s going to uproot the genre in his 40’s, that he’s the most offensive rapper, and so on. Let me be blunt, though —

Eminem’s lyrics were never deep. Never. Everything he says is so baseline that a random stranger completely unfamiliar with him could listen to any song and turn their brain off while still fully understanding the exact meaning behind each of his lyrics. He raps fast, rhymes a lot, and makes pop culture references aaaand that’s… about it. His actual lyricism is pretty weak, but the *riders* hear a lot of words fast, some of which rhyme, and they shit their fucking pants in excitement.

The industry is out to get him? Uhhh no bro the industry is out to profit off of him. People think because he said faggot a lot in the early 2000s and got censored by the FCC on television for it (as they would for ANYONE), that the industry hates him? People really don’t understand that *the industry* are the labels and their masters and they want nothing more than to see him succeed as he was once their copy+paste=$ breadwinner. The industry != the culture != censorship bureaus.

“He’s ‘too offensive’ for today’s listeners” is also straight cope cap. They make it seem like people are *literally shaking* when they listen to him because he’s sooo edgy xD. Bruh his shit is so fucking mild. The only thing he ever did that was “offensive” was say faggot a few times over 20 years ago. Nothing he can say will even come close to the **standard** of rap music today and there’s no shot he’s gonna start dropping f-bombs again (not that I want him too but that would actually be impressive and show he is that “idgaf” boy they all claim him to be). 

There’s so much more but I already wrote a novel so ima just leave it there. TL;DR: Eminem is fine as an artist but his dickriders are unbearable fantasy dwellers.
Thank you for pointing it out! I can imagine Em would cringe hard if he saw how corny these mfs are. Like bro enjoy the rhymes and the music but just stop riding dick please
He's considered at the least a top 5 rapper of all time. I think they have the right to be "corny."
Well my biggest issue with Eminem fans are most Eminem fans don't listen to rap music they just listen to him. Also they are delusional in his fall off when it comes to the quality of his music. Some of my favorite rappers I've listened to over the last 3 decades I can pinpoint exactly when they fell off. As far as Eminem fans he's never fell off and the sales confirm it for them
I like Eminem because he's just good at rapping, has songs I really enjoy listening to and I also envy his comeup. To this day his words about his critics seem to reign true. It's hard for me to sympathize with the controversial stuff he's said since I guess I wasn't there when some of it was released so it never makes me "wow" when I hear it is I guess. 

There's a ton of rappers I enjoy listening to much more than Eminem though, I just respect his talent and personality as well.
To be fair, "Hip-hop is back!" was said before Em dropped Houdini BECAUSE OF the beef and all the eyes it turned toward it from the outside, not to mention the records Kendrick was breaking. Saying it after Houdini drops doesn't negate the first part, just further fuels the discourse that was already going on about this being a great year for Hip-hop so far.

Or the classic “they only don’t like the song because the bars go over their head”. No is because the bar was shit and i don’t need every bar to have triple meaning especially when the setup doesn’t even make sense.
Dumbass take
I still can't believe that eminem fans are trying to force the idea of people being insanely offended by his new track. Like I have seen so many posts about "gen z is too sensitive for this" but nothing about people actually being offended
Kanye fans and Eminem fans competing for who is cornier
They’re saying stuff like Kamikaze is a classic when almost every song got several lines about Em having gay sex and I’m gay and don’t need it to be in every song it’s like all he raps about now is having detailed gay sex
Im embarrassed I ever was an Eminem Stan
one visit to r/drizzy will change your mind
Bro, Eminem is so stuck in being his hyper-controversial form of himself it's sad. He is like the Pauly Shore of hip hop.


Dude was legitimately the most hated man in music, now going all fuck cancel culture in 2024, it's just lame, he has become those same type of reactionary dad rock dudes that lament how shits so soft nowadays. He reads closer to Tom MacDonald now then the cultural icon he was.
He really does ......
Also this is their home. Lol. 
Agreed.
There are a lot of racial undertones to the “hip hop is back” thing.
Anyone who stans hard for a singular artist is too narrow minded to even have an opinion worth caring about
That’s an awfully hot coffee pot!
Eminem fans are the COAT
Kendrick Stan’s quickly shot to the top 😂
Majority of people are fucking stupid. Shouldn’t be a surprise. Doesn’t matter the fan base.
People need to realize every big fan base got crazy fans...  (even more in a subreddit where the mods don't doo nothing beside promoting songs)

Of course some are corny and cringe but damn its the same with sports fans , he still got cool fans 😅
Eminem’s fanbase is bigger than any other rapper’s. It’s going to have some annoying folks just like every single other artist.

Kanye’s fanbase went along with his Nazi nonsense. That’s next level insanity. I don’t want to hear shit about any other fanbase after that.
[removed]
I think any popular rapper is going to have a vocal and weird ass minority of stans. As long as they aren't crossing over into batshit crazy behavior,I'm indifferent to it.


I really liked Em when I was a kid but I haven't listened to his music in years. I won't deny he's a talented artist tho.
I wouldn’t call it one the greatest rap beef in history in terms of opponents, cuz one lost miserably imo lol. But it was definitely one of the BIGGEST.
Tbf, the drake abd Cole beefy is weak and corny
I'm excited to get more Em but he hasn't been the only thing I care about. I still bump JID, Kendrick, Cole, and a few underground artists. It's just nice to have Em back in the rotation.
This is the internet. Every fan base is whack af
Yeah, but there is only fan base that was legally labels a gang.... Juggalos.
The Kenny v Drake beef definitely brought hip-hop back, Em’s track is just giving it more momentum, but to me the only thing it brought back was Slim Shady, Em has always had a little bit of Shady in his music but we haven’t seen anything like this from him since Relapse, and that was definitely not the best outing we’ve had from an almost purely Shady album, I’m hopeful we’re gonna be getting more Eminem Show/MMLP/SSLP type vibes from this album.
Have you been to Kendricks subreddit? My god the lack of perspective. And I say that as a fan of his. 

That being said, most subreddits dedicated to a single person are so cringe.
Dawg I'm going to be real, this feels like every fandam. Every fanbase for rappers (and most things in general) have fans that are super embarrassing to be around. Likewise you have haters that exaggerate shit. 

  
I like Eminem, Kendrick, and a whole lot of other artist but I don't browse their subreddits since I find them embarrassing. 

  
I find this to be a online thing ngl, if you chat music with people IRL then they tend to be pretty normal.
Kendrick fans: wait a minute...
Young boy fans are the worst tbh
Literally, every big artist in every genre has corny fans.
I think the issue with stans is that the stupid ones are too loud. Most of his fans that are normal humans don’t really talk much publicly, but then you got the little 12 year olds saying that the word today is so sensitive
I mean yes he has a lot of obnoxious outspoken fans but guess what? So does everyone else lol. 


Drake fans, j Cole fans, KANYE fans, and even Kendrick fans. 


Kanye fans are the worst imo, sycophants who don’t give a fuck how horrible he is.
can you show us where Stan touched u?
Reddit is the worst thing to happen to HipHop fandom in awhile man… seeing the drake and Kendrick subs was just so cringeworthy, douche chills
[removed]
I LOVE after 20 years of being told he’s the best we are having this conversation.
[removed]
Every fanbase is crazy but for some reason everyone highlights the Stan’s.  Y’all go fuck with the swifties and find out.
Man the Kendrick fan base is mad at EM now huh lmao these fucking weirdos think a man with that small ass catalog with old ass songs nobody plays anymore.. until the Drake clout chase! Eminem is clout chased more then anyone until the Drake beef
There are a lot of corney fanbases. Even taking who you said, Drake has one of the biggest stan fanbases now a days. They still try arguing that drake planted the evidence and kendrick beats his wife. 

X fans all act like a 12 year old who hasn't heard rap outside of their generation yet. Juice falls under the same umbrella with them saying he's the GOAT freestyle rapper like Harry mack or blind fury weren't killing it. 

When fanbases get too big, there are more casual fans who will argue more for that specific artist. Tends to be magnified on reddit.
Ive been a die hard eminem fan for the last 15 years or so and yeah, the fanbase is just cringe and corny. But, hell, i challenge you to name one fanbase of a HUGE artist like eminem that isnt corny or cringe. I mean, kendricks, drakes, taylors, etc fanbases are pretty much all the same degenerates lmao.
Every fan base has weirdos and crazy people. When you have a massive following like he does you're going to see a lot more of them. And for the record Em is the GOAT and it's not even close
How many people actually said that last thing? Is this like when Fox finds 3 tweets by randos and acts like it’s a movement?
Kendrick too
No,  that beef was so shit. It's on some Eminem dissing Nick Cannon shit.  And on your other point,  Eminem is the biggest rapper in the world. His fan base reasonably then includes a little bit of everyone. Most people dumb, Thus, many dumb fans
Those are just people who don't have the concept of being open minded. Not everybody is going to like everything, people have different opinions on everything. Eminem is the GOAT! Sure maybe your goat but not everyone else's!!
You want to talk about corny fanbases? I loved the competitiveness of the Drake vs. Kendrick beef, and all the side-beefs that came alongside it, but the stans in both camps completely ruined it for me. It's like people weren't into it for how good the music was, but rather to cheer on their favorite sports team and refuse to acknowledge anything good the other side did. Wack shit.
Outside of Drake fans, I couldn’t agree more
[removed]
yeah i loved the new em track but hiphop was back before he jumped in lol
I assure you that drake fans are worse
Ngl the drake va Kendrick beef was pretty lame asf. 

The only real winner was BBL Drizzy cause that shits just funny asf
You are right. Let’s throw Kendrick Lamar fans in this category as well
I’ll take anyone over cardi B fans .
Greatest rap beefs in history? Kendrick knocked Drake out and kicked him till the police showed up
Tbh I haven’t seen anyone nearly as hype as you are angry…
Agreed except this beef mid at best
I like this… cuz I like Em.. I think he has skills and some folks hate him for dumb reasons… but yes everything you said… including the unmentionable… right there with you bruh… I know dudes that hate rap except Eminem and then say he’s the best rapper in the same breath… like how is that even possible..? lol… rap is great now.. and i grew up in the Tupac/Nas/Biggie era… I admit there was a low point around the early 2000’s… but it’s been back for a while now… love hip hop
[removed]
Yeah it’s brutal, his shit did not age well and his fanbase is so blind to it lol it’s like that’s all they’ve listened to in the past 25 years
To be fair, rap (in general) is pretty corny anymore.
I am a huge Eminem fan, but I wouldn’t consider myself a stand in the way that some people are. I love his music not because he’s controversial or because I am a closet racist but because a lot of the shit he was saying in his early career connected with me because I was going through a lot of bullshit as well. He changed the game for the better, and when he’s actively dropping, it makes other artist want to be better. That’s just my opinion though.

Now I’m a fan of hip-hop as a whole and just like any other genre there’s going to be times where it feels like it’s going in the wrong direction. A lot of it depends on who you mainly listen to as well. If all you’re hearing is crap from designer or 69, then your gonna feel like it’s failing. But those are also the same people who don’t listen to Hopsin, Joyner, Kendrick, or Cole. It’s all a give-and-take.
Lmao@ Kendrick vs Drake as the greatest rap beef of all time.

But yea, fandoms are weird.
Let people enjoy things. Fan bases are cringe but it's in absolutely everything, we're a tribal species. Never not gonna happen. Best to just leave 'em be. I have far more shit that's actu real that annoys me.
The irony of this post is not lost on me….smh
DEAR MISTER IM TOO GOOD TO CALL OR WRITE MY FANS
agreed but also i am part of the problem
I was never THAT into EM but I recgonize his skills, I grew up on Slim Shady and now that Shady's back... i find I didn't miss him, like at all. And I realize all the shit I said in the early 10s about "I liked him more as slim shady" was just edgy bullshit and "Houdini" feels like an attack on that guy for misunderstanding his arts.


Fr, EMs a wordsmith who bends words to his will, Dre was crazy to let Shady run loose on record but we got some exceptional pearlclutching social upheaval when a white guy said wack shit with a beat.


One for the hall of fame for sure.
Yeah this whole gen z is offended shit is so annoying, most of us grew up with em
It’s weird that others can affect you that much, and it’s not even about you. That’s what’s wild.
I’m on the cusp of millennial/gen z and I grew up with Eminem. It’s not like music ceases to exist a year after it comes out lol. People acting like anyone younger than 30 “can’t handle” a rapper’s (relatively tame compared to his old stuff) new song is so fucking corny. 

Also have you actually met anyone who’s trying to “cancel” people? Maybe I just don’t hang out with many chronically online people but I dead have yet to meet someone who’s on that type of shit.
 a lot of fanbses are like that .
Including you
Something this last track made me realize is that some fans are so fucking annoying. Not even in the sense of calling him the GOAT or whatever, but seeing reactions of what parts of Houdini their fucking with. 

“I can’t wait to see him make them CRY” 

Just the dudes loving the half baked homophobia and transphobia are so fucking cringe. I’ve always just loved his rhymes, bars, and just sonically I like it. But if you’re listening to a shady character track and loving the shit he’s saying.. idk man
OP is old enough to "grow up on Em" (40 something years old) and types like a 12 year old. 
Kendrick Lamar’s is worse and I’m a fan of his . Haven’t heard a full shady album in 15 years
I wouldn’t call myself an Eminem fan, love his old stuff.

But calling this drake shit one of the greatest beefs in rap history is wild
My guy out here proving his own point.  The irony.
He's the most famous rapper ever with the most fans. So just by the numbers this is bound to be the truth. Same with Yankee fans, Laker fans, Swift fans.
Every fan base is like that! It's just a case of tribalism, basically team edward vs. team Jacob nonsense.
Right behind Drake
Off all time* in case you were wondering why OP didn’t want to spend 2 seconds.
Find some friends to talk to do you're not stuck online 👍
I had the slim shady lp and hid it from my parents in 5th grade and only listened with headphones when they left that was 24 years ago.
One of the greatest beefs in rap history? Biggie and Pac? NWA vs Ice? 

This is your legendary battle? That’s cute.

Edit: Funkmaster flex vs Wu Tang - call it corny but our generation invented you. Beef was real back then, not just rap or talk. Yeah, our generation might be corny now but don’t disrespect where it started and how it went.
Rap fans respect Eminem when he sing the struggle.

Clowns like slim shady, because that's a clown ☺
I would consider myself one of Eminem’s biggest fans ever, I have nearly 200 thousand minutes listened to him just from the 6 years I’ve been on Spotify; probably at least 100k more from before then.

Eminem coming along didn’t feel like I was white and finally able to listen to “real rap” not that “garbage mumble rap crap” it felt like he came along and literally opened up a whole new door to music that I’ve come to absolutely adore. If it hadn’t of been for him I’d of never had a voice to attract me towards the art form and that’s what I think a lot of his early fans can agree with. 

However, there’s a massive portion of this Muhfuckas fan base that see him as the only rapper to ever exist because he’s the only rapper they’ve ever liked. Those are the people that absolutely ruin his fanbase. The closed minded people who think no other rapper even comes close to being as good as him musically because they refuse to give any other rapper an honest to God listen. 

Shit is embarrassing and gives a truly great artist an absolutely horrendous image.
I liked Houindi a lot but it had to grow on me. I'm fr a Kendrick Stan. As I feel he's the only musician I've ever heard in any genre of music get myself to being more introspective about my right and wrongs, but most importantly, especially, my wrongs, as I look at myself honestly. As Kendrick sings and raps his unique human experience and his best is when he's introspective with himself he looks at us the audience and through his silence and acknowledgement of his journey of contemplation and betterment his dares us to do the same on our own unique life's paths through the forest.  And change in my behavior and mental person hood toward a better self actualized human being has occured by the wavelength Kendrick helped me do better in. 

Eminem is one of my favorites, he's had songs I've teared up, he's moved me, and helped me feel less crazy as an outlet of madness. Plus I am and I'm convinced his also has ADHD/ASD like myself so the insanity feels like being seen an has voltage and amps in the current of electricity his rap convey, to me. To each their own.

However no one other than Kendrick has moved my soul toward betterment in the same way. I am a better person in life and toward my fellow humans, I have more confidence in myself through my betterment that when the music turns off, I still explore the forest.

My friends know Kendrick is my #1 and how he sublimated Drake, which makes me feel good. I've never liked Drake he like the opposite of my grandmothers Mexican cooking, he's inauthentic. Hip-Hop and Metal were always my favorite genres of music because they displayed honest human emotion so elegantly and honestly. Drake was a rotted dragon that came to devour all that is real and genuine.
The beef was just 1 month ago, hip hop being back is still pretty fresh and a new thing.
Personally I feel like a lot of the corniness comes from fake fans. Ppl that know he's GOATED and like him just because of that. I feel like this happens with any rapper that peaks and it's pretty sad.

I 100% blame the internet and social media for the downfall of hip hop and relevant culture. Hip hop doesn't exist anymore, there is pop-rap or trap in the USA. Thank god the UK hasn't lost its culture yet.

Edit: I'm a huge Eminem fan, I'm 24 and he introduced me to hip-hop. I think Houdini is a good song and a nice trip down memory lane. I don't find any bars spectacular or particularly impressive, and the fact that people share bars from this song as 'genius' or anything similar ruins the song's credibility. This causes contention, and hinders em.

All my opinion
Do you think it’s that? Or that people who are vocally fans of things in comment sections are just generally weird .
Can we just like music and not treat everyone like gods? Its money. Always has been.
Too many of his fans are racist white people who don't listen to rap in general but like Eminem because he's a respected and talented white dude in a primarily black medium. They like to prop him up as to say a white dude is the best at something primarily done by black people. I ain't even the biggest hip hop head but I know the dude isn't top 10 OAT outside of maybe sales.
Who cares. Either like the music or not. Doesn't matter what other people think or how they act.
Take this hardcore Em fan's upvote please. 

A large part of the fandom is giving me all kinds of cringe these days. Can't even enjoy the nostalgic high from Houdini comfortably.
Greatest beefs?  When did this happen? Still waiting for these newer rappers produce anything memorable.
Drake fans are the corniest fans in hip hop history
Greatest beef = one jackass calls another a pedo🤣
The sooner you pretend fandoms don't exist, the happier you'll be with life. "Fans" ruin all sorts of shit.
I ain’t been able to really rock with him openly for this reason since Relapse. The level of delusional rodeo performances were crazy. Luckily most of his output since then has been ehhh (although I did fw MMLP2)
My best friend is a huge Eminem fan, got his kids (before they were 10) listening to Em, constantly has Em on the playlist, and is always asking me if I’ve heard the new Em song.

Em was my favourite when I was a teenager.  We’re 40 now.  I respect Em’s talent, and am happy for the life he has built for himself, but his music generally does nothing for me.  The new song is catchy, but it won’t be getting many spins from me personally.

This same friend, despite claiming Em is his favourite rapper, and the GOAT, couldn’t for the life of him tell me who Em’s favourite rapper is, never mind know who “Reggie” is.  

This same friend constantly asks me about lyrics, “what do you think he meant by that.”  I explain it, because I generally understand most of what Em says when he raps.  My friend comes up with the wildest interpretations of what Em says, even completely makes up words to fit his narrative, and then tells me I’m wrong when I basically quote Genius to him.  His reply is usually “wtf is genius.”  I’m like bro, you could look up the lyrics on Google, instead of guessing, but he’d rather guess.

When I mentioned the Kendrick / Drake beef, this same friend claimed that he had never heard a Kendrick song before in his life (even called Kalendrick Omar, or whatever).  This same friend and his entire family, kids included, constantly say “ya bish” to one another….and yet he says he doesn’t know where he got that slang from (we used to listen to Money Trees all the time on a friend’s boat).

This same friend, and entire family, has sunk hundreds of hours into GTA5, and yet still claims to not know who Kendrick is lol.

And like OP said, the IYKYK part with my friend is 100% there.  His playlist is nothing but white rappers, sprinkled with some 50 Cent, G-Unit, Dre, and some Pac.  He’s never heard of J Cole, claims he never heard of Kendrick, never heard of Jadakiss and the LOX, never heard of Outkast, despite Em naming them as his favourite rappers, in songs.  Most definitely has never heard of any of the young rappers out right now.  He knows Tom McDonald, but I don’t even think he knows Jack Harlow lol.

And yes, tbc, lately I constantly question the friendship.  We’ve been close for 15 years, his kids are like my niece and nephew, but ever since Covid lockdowns, his brain has become rotted by tiktok and IG, and he wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed to begin with.

He also thinks Kill Shot was the greatest diss song of all time, despite the fact that he can’t even name Ether, Who Shot Ya, Hit Em Up, Back Down, Back to Back, No Vaseline, The Story of Adidon, and still hasn’t listened to a single track from the Kendrick & Drake beef.

He’s the living definition of an Eminem Stan, but doesn’t know the first fucking thing about hip hop and rap music.

He also completely misses the point of a lot of Eminem songs.  My friend actually thinks that Em hates gay people.  I’m like, you realize he’s explained multiple times that he says that shit just goofing around, and that he doesn’t actually have anything against them.  I told my friend that one of Em’s kids was non-binary, and he refused to believe me.  The bit in the new song about Em showing up to a cypher wearing a Bud Light t-shirt went completely over his head.  He thinks Em would support Trump, despite the fact that Em made a song saying the exact opposite.  

It would be funny, if it wasn’t so sad.
One of the greatest beefs in rap history? I'm sorry. I enjoyed it too but come on.
Chief keef ain't this, chief keef ain't that
[removed]
I've been a Stan since 2000 and you couldn't be more accurate. Over the years I've met, or talked to a lot of people like me, who really enjoyed Em, would critize him as much as praise him, and aren't generally fucking morons. The problem is the internet, you get a million hot takes, people looking for views, or likes, etc. 

The internet made people be idiots for a lot of reasons, and also some people, well, are being honest and they look like idiots. 

I've seen the same shit with Kanye, Drake, Jay, etc. Overall, I think Em continuously was liked by newer, younger generations that didn't know how to fucking act online. That's just my opinion, but I respect your take.
Every fanbase has its portion of annoying fans. Eminem is the most popular rapper which is why we here from his Stans the most
I mean the Kendrick Drake beef was entertaining.. one of the greatest of all time? Debatable I guess. Pretty one sided.
This entire thread about Stans and fandom is why I have a very “arms length” relationship with the internet.
Not as corny as kendrick fans
It's really just a small minority of Eminem fans that act this way. Idk why people project it onto the whole fan base.
👍
One of the greatest rap beefs in history? There’s not 1 legit good song outside the “beef” setting. Not like us the beat is fire, the lyrics are ok, I dislike the rushed cadence on some parts, reminded me of silk the shocker trying to fit 18 bars where 16 should go. The shelf life for any of the other songs already expired.
Drake vs Kendrick was not anywhere near the greatest rap beef in history.  While mildly entertaining, it was mid compared to some of the oldies, Ice Cube vs. Easy E or Tupac vs. Biggie.
I think it has to do with most people not liking the "new rap" that is coming out. I don't mind Kendrick but a lot of mainstream artists are not my tatste.
Name one fandom that isn’t cringe
If the greatest beef in rap history was so forgettable that randoms with chatgpt bred better bars, well, damn man.

This is a greater diss than any between the artists breeding the "greatest beef."

I've literally seen fans of each be like "lol was weak but not as bad as .."

This post literally goes harder than the artist you support with that attitude.

Maybe you are right. Maybe you aren't. If you feeling some type of way maybe wonder why that is.
Eminem, Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Taylor Swift have the worst obsessed fans. Honorable mention to Kanye and J. Cole, I love them both but their most obsessed fans are pretty terrible. Not quite on the level of the first four though.
Yawn let’s get some new takes in this sub for once
Meh, I would say that we didn't have one of the greatest rap battles in history, because I've never liked, nor taken Drake seriously as a rap artist. To me, it's like comparing Britney Spears to Aretha Franklin, or comparing Drake to Kendrick Lamar.
Houdini is funny like he's competing with Dave (the character).  Not Like Us is a legit banger.
[removed]
When you realize the fan base was always a bunch of corny losers and some of you are finally becoming self aware enough to notice. Lol
I grew up on The Slim Shady LP as a teenager in 1999. I’ve been a lifelong fan. I’m also not delusional. Encore, Relapse, Revival and MTBM suck. MMLP2 and Kamikaze are underwhelming. And now—Houdini is a bad, weak single.
People complaining about fans of rap taking an artist too serious in a reddit for rap.

Em’s haters will never stop because he’s the goat and all these bitch asses whine and whine.

Wiped Kdots numbers in the middle of a beef.

Casuals upset the real ones but don’t whine about that shit in this subreddit.
Fucking L corny take.
MGK quality take.
I mean as someone who had the Shabaam Sahdeeq 5 Star Generals single, his fan base has always been corny.
Or.... everyones just happy to have so much going on in hip hop right now that they get excited when the next quality rap comes out. Gives you a hint of what it was like in the 90s.

 Sounds like OP is the one with the closed mind...
Stans saying new listeners are soft like Em isn't literally one of the best selling artists of all time and everyone from millenials on grew up with him everywhere is funny af
People were like, "this is gonna be the most offensive he's ever been" and I'm like wait you really believe that? As a 51 year old white guy who has millions? The whole point of him dissing his own kids is to get across how goofy and unserious the whole thing was. For old times sake heade a gay joke, but he didn't make gays the joke. He mentioned gender expression but he didn't deride the whole concept.

It seems to me he feels he can write Shady lyrics in a way that doesn't offend who he is now. He's still done and taking a victory lap as he's washed up. Good for him but this isn't the comeback of the year.

I don't know who it was I saw comment that, I think it was a YouTube comment, but I'd like to tell them: If you've been paying attention, you've seen Em tell you how he feels about poverty, about guns, about Bush and Trump; and you should know by now that he floats in the gap between neoliberal and lower-case libertarians. You think he's going to reach a new level of mean in this age of political hatred then you're high as fuck.
Idk man I see more em hate in subreddits than Stan’s being annoying lol. You literally can’t even say you like Eminem to some black people without being cooked
Greatest beef in rap history? And you’re calling people corny
Any fanbase is weird, no one should worship an artist
I had to leave the eminem subreddit because it was so bad. Just constant cringe.
Lmfao so true. I love Em but I hate the fanbase
He also has one of the corniest catalogs of all time. Like begets like.
Where have u seen this? I haven't come across anyone that's been saying this.
Hey OP.... you suck.
what fan base of anyone isn’t corny?

Kanye and Drake fans are as bad as any I’ve encountered on the internet. I’m not defending Eminem fans. But fanbases in general are pretty much the same
All these mega fans of any artist are cringe, just enjoy the music you like don’t get so caught up in meaningless shit
Just people with no lives living through others
Haters gonna hate. And LOL "one of he greatest beefs in rap history".
All fandoms have corny fans. It’s just what it is. It’s almost more corny to care enough to make dumb posts like this.

EDIT: actually took a second to read the post and this is the corniest shit I’ve ever read, can someone take this man outside??
”Hip-Hop is back" as if Nas hadn't dropped 5 projects in the past 4 years lol. Em fans are something else
Corny? How is a fan base corny? Genuinely asking because I’m not understanding what it is you’re hating on
Houdini made me realise Slim Shady LP is probably deleted from Eminem's history. 
[removed]
“One of the greatest beefs in rap history” doesn’t involve Drake.
Watched Houdini with my girlfriend last night. Ya it was entertaining as like a nostalgic spectacle but I couldn't imagine driving around listening to it like it's actually good music. Yikes.
[removed]
Benzino is that you??
Every rapper's fan base is like this tbf. Kendrick and Drake subs rn are insane,and not in a good way
Agreed. I mean I'm a huge Em fan as well but extremists stans really don't wanna admit that he's fucked up in the past. Like I've seen people defending Revival with tooth and nail.

And the worst thing is that it's bad for the artist as well because it has this yes man effect that fucks up their perception
I’ll never understand why people care about other people in this way.
Have you seen Yeet’s fan base? Or NBA Youngboy’s? Or even King Von? The little kids who bump these rappers and think they are supa gangsta all the time and think it’s cool to throw random hand signs in pictures like they are really about something? Do you genuinely think that’s cornier than Eminem’s older fan base who’s just reminding yall that he’s not like your favorite rappers?
Most fan bases are corny. It isn’t exclusive to Em. 

This Kendrick and Drake beef showed me how corny both of their fanbases are. 

I was relieved to learn J Cole’s base can admit when he does some whack shit.

Ye fans are a parody of reality at this point.

Em and Jay have long been my favs, but Em fans have been insufferable in comparison.
lol smd
I think Kendrick does 
Well Eminem is and has always been corny sooooo. And I say that as a fan. He's hilarious and makes corny jokes. So what do you expect? Stans are strange people
Just some loud people. I made the same post about Kenny fans while his fan too, but I was just kinda pissed about Kendrick’s fans, so I made the post. I knew that it was only some part of his fanbase that was this corny though. I think you’ll get over it.
Which beef you talking about ? Because if you mean on drake and Kendrick Lamar you need to re evaluate what rap is supposed to be 🤷‍♂️😂
I feel like this is just one of those “you had to be there” moments. Eminem started a huge culture change for white folks. Back in the early 2000’s everyone was getting a fade and bleaching it. Hell I remember this one white boy I went to elementary school with got cornrows. Eminem was huge.
I think there is a big difference between fans and stans. I am an eminem fan, but i wasn’t “rap is back” when he dropped Houdini. Sure it is a nice song, a lot of nostalgia. But for me “rap is back” began when the beef between Kdot and Drake started.
Yo Eminem doesn’t drop albums he makes COMEBACKS this is his eighth COMEBACK and he’s coming back harder than ever before right in yo face!!!! Get ready you don’t know what hit ya rappers. Em is BACK and shady is BACK and Marshal? HES ALSO BACK
\*SLOW CLAP\*
🤣😂🤦🏻‍♂️🤙🏻

I've noticed that there's a large number of people who are super far up Eminem's ass who generally don't listen to much, if any, rap music. If you ask them their favorite musicians, it's all over the place and goes from like Linkin Park to Slipknot to Eminem, and they put him on a pedestal far above every other rapper like hes hip hop Jesus. It has always been like that, and I can't figure out if it's cus he's white or if it's the angsty raps about killing his mom or what.
Facts
You know how when you have someone feature in your track you call it a “feat,” like everyone always does in the really usual, normal way of talking about that thing
Wayne fans are a lot worse
Eminem has literally addressed this on several different occasions over the course of 20+ years dude. It’s not his fault. 

He has whole verses about this specific topic. White America addresses this topic, real slim shady, Stan, etc. “and they connected with me too because I look I like them”

Theres your answer dude. A lot of Eminem fans like Eminem because the vast majority are what I like to call “hip-hop adjacent”
i’m under the impression most of the supporters are bots on social media,

they absolutely can’t have a conversation and hype Em up wayyy too much. he’s washed now, get over it.
I never see such things tbh. Post like these are dumb. Stop being chronically online. It's not healthy. Or fix your algorithm.
Thank you! I'm not hating anyone who loves Em or whatever but if he's the only guy you listen too you're not a rap fan you're an Em fan.
Yea some people take things way too far and yes it gets annoying and odd haha 
I am a em fan but damn some people think he’s like god or something. Little bit much 


Buuttt… one of the greatest rap beefs? Come on man. 
Drake isn’t even a rapper he’s a pop star. 

Kendrick is phenomenal. 

I also don’t think really any rap beef today would be as intense or historic as the ones in the past.
Drake's Fandom is hilariously corny, the level of coping has never been seen before.
Yeah man eminem is one of my fav rapper (alongside Nas and MF DOOM )but i dont mention it bcoz the fanbase  thinks some weird shit and i dont wanna be counted like that . I love em but the fanbase has made it annoying . Thats why i just listen and dont see anything that is being said about him . If i like the song it stays if not then i am like yeah whatever
As someone who considers themselves an eminem FAN, I do see how annoying certain stans are but honestly, as of late, Eminem haters are even more corny and worse than his stans.
Hahahaha the maker of this thread is so cringy it’s hilarious 😂😂
I like em because his lyricism is untouchable and although he produces corny lyrics now that he’s older he is still indisputably the best lyricist to exist since the 90’s.
His new song / video was so fucking cringe. I used to be a big fan too, but I'm shocked by how many people are saying that his fans are the problem and not him. Dude is lame as fuck now and has been for a **long** time.
lol I just really relate to the raps about his relationship with his mother and also the raps about his kids and trying to do right for them. I also like he’s funny. I like funny 

Sometimes it ain’t that deep brother
he’s the only good rapper
People have the right to like and dislike whatever they want. Get over it.
Just let people have fun. I found the drake and Kendrick beef to be the cringiest thing to ever happen in rap. I like them both a little less.
Eminem himself is the corniest mf in the game so what do you expect. Don't get me wrong, he used to be great. His new shit you couldn't pay me to listen to. But Em fans do not know rap
What about Korn fans?
I think you’re referring to the tweeny bop Stans.  I’m 37 and been rockin with Em since 99.  Never once would I say he’s the only good rapper.
Waaaaahhhh!! People like the most famous rapper out there, waaaaahhhh! 😭
Greatest beefs in rap history where? There hasn’t been good beef since the 90s
I second that sir
I’m willing to bet most of them couldn’t tell you the lyrics to Kim, much less the Kids from the Walmart edition
Brother, are you not aware of the Kendrick Lamar fanbase right now? It's like they came out from under rocks or something. 
Nah after seeing the way people acted during the Kendrick/drake beef really showed how corny most fans are, people still be posting about it in the weirdest of ways
The older/bigger a fanbase gets, the more it collects bozos. Thems the facts 🤷🏽‍♀️

It can be embarrassing for the rest of the fans at times. But don't y'all tell me there aren't other huge stars with weird fans. Kanye? Swift? Drake? Nicki Minaj? I could keep going...

Edit - need to add here that the haters are just as weird as the weirdest stans. It's exhausting.
The greatest beef in hip hop history? Gtfo bro. One of these dudes straight up apologized after putting out a dis…. Shit was so corny.
Eminem and Kendrick Lamar both got cringe fandoms and glazers that ruin it for me.
Kendrick fans are way worse by far.
I’m an Eminem fan and I am kinda corny about it lol
I grew up on slim shady, had the lp in grade 5 and knew all the words. I cant deny he is one of the greatest for surely. But i cant listen to em anymore like that. Ill check out the new shit but im not replaying it. But if it werent for em Grizelda records may have not gotten the attention they deserved and thats my favorite shit right now.
I never said "hip hop is back". 

You kids love to generalize. I know you're all pretty stupid, and that's going to suck for your whole life while renting, but go eat a dick with your 8th grade reading level. 

Like what you like, and leave us alone.
If it makes you feel better, you never hear those brain rotting takes in real life. Only in echo chambers where they know their shit opinions will be agreed with.
I love the new Em song, but yeah it's just fun it doesn't elevate the genre or anything.  It's not supposed to..

Shit, Macklemore's recent song goes harder imo
anybody who stans anyone or says "the kids are too soft" are mentally ill
Facts
Greatest Rap Beefs?Brah?? Who??Dafuq?? Who the Corny One? I think you the “CLOSESTED “ TO CLOSETED ! The Greatest Real Rap Beefs never been a topic on the Today Show my Guy!! Bro and wasn’t one these idiots on IG like Watch this, hold my Mimosa!!  watch this shit!! Ima delete his tracks of my off my feed!! AHhhaI told you I’d dona  that way Since it’s Pride Month and I Respect that, but what I don’t respect is this Corny ass post 🤣😂 GTFOH !!!!
Agree
If you have a look at most of the subs specifically dedicated to one artist, it's full of cringey freaks - it's not limited to Em's fanbase
“Greatest beefs in rap history” — aka Drake getting completely mopped up and everyone knew it as it started. 

Eminem is known for being untouchable and hasn’t been releasing publicly that much, so having a #1 charter without it being on radio whatsoever is going to fuel that fire. So many people are mad as fuck that he has that motion still.
“ greatest rap beef “ Drake is a pop star
Why do you keep making posts about Eminem? You have three total now. Is it just cause you’re getting attention?
Content/ability to connect, he’s top 5. Flow, he’s top 5. Word play and syllable-breakdown, he’s #1. Freestyling, he’s 1. There’s a reason no veteran alive wants to battle him. It’s what he does and he does it better than anyone else thus far. With that said, I haven’t thoroughly enjoyed an entire album of his since relapse. There are 2-3 good songs per album after that, but it’s just not the same. First rap song I ever heard was real slim shady. I was 6. It’s what got me into rap. It will always hold a special place in my heart. But raps changed, as has all music. If as a fan you’re incapable of adapting and changing with it, you’re gonna get real bored real fast. There’s so many good rappers out there now, to make a statement like “hip hop is back” is asinine. It never went anywhere. When someone says that it just tells me they stayed stuck with the same taste they had as a child and never broadened their musical library beyond that.

Edit: and yeah, mgk was right, your beard is weird. As are the hats you wear. Lose that shit homie.
That goes for how wild haters are as well. It’s odd.
For real. Houdini got me feeling like I did when I first listened to Eminem Show, but I’m not losing my damn mind over how the song is charting or the shit going on over on the Eminem sub. Those people are nuts.
Problem is anyone that defends against someone else’s opinion gets labeled a Stan nowadays lmao I told someone they were crazy because they claimed Eminem has never made hip hop music and got called a delusional Stan
I also have seen way more gen Z kids making reels of them mocking Eminem fans for saying you kids aren’t ready for this. 

But yet I haven’t seen any post like that. Just reels of people saying they keep encouraging those kinds of post.
Eminem subreddit don't even have mods working... everybody can talk there
Yeah, the Drake and Kendrick subs have made me never want to be considered a fan of anyone. That shit is so cringe.
Hence the reason for the song and term “Stan”
I’ve been an Em fan for a very long time, the Houdini song was honestly alright. Hope the album has better stuff.
Dude I’ve been subbed to the Eminem subreddit for a long time but if I see one more cringe ass post about people needing to play his song nonstop so it hits number 1 I’m about to block that off of my feed.

Seriously how much of a loser do you have to be to not only do that but make a post on Reddit like it’s a rallying cry.
That track put you back on Stan mode?? I loved that he brought back **his** unique flow but I thought it was mid. Maybe I should go listen again
I mean you say you’re going stan mode but are you “AHAHAHA I BET THE SOFT ASS YOUTH ARE SELF DESTRUCTING MY KING IS BACK AM I RITE FELLOW ELDER MILLENIALS??? TRY TO CANCEL HIM AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, B-WORD!!! WAIT TIL YOU HEAR KIM 😂😂😂” stanning???
Stan is probably about as serious as a fan could take it tbh
Cole fans having a crumpet and enjoying their sub’s conversation during the breakfast scroll. 

I’m coping. I am incredibly jealous.
What's up with this being a fan of one rapper or the other?

I like ye, Cole, dot, keem, 21, drake is corny as hell but I fuck with his old shit and I love me some em and weezy too. Why we all gotta be stans of 1 person
I love this comment because, intentionally or not, the term Stan comes from Em.
Ye Stan’s are the worst by a pretty considerable amount …
At least (in my experience) ye fans acknowledge that music other than Kanye can be good. Yeah ye fans might stan albums that have no replay value (donda and vultures). But they aren’t out here saying that every artist sucks but him. That’s something I notice a lot with Eminem fans. But at the same time, if they make good music they make good music, I’m not gonna judge an artists music based on their fans.
Don’t forget the Nicki stans
Ye stans don’t even like him
they arent corny ngl 90% of them just complain about lack of music and start to get more and more insane with every antic he does
kendrick stans are worse
Ye stans are probably the worst in hip hop
with Adam 22
Nah.  The racial element makes Eminem stans even more unbearable. 


If I had a nickel for every time I've seen/heard a white person say "I don't even like rap, but eminem is great".
This is what happens when you form all of your opinions from YouTube comments
Agreed the OP is butthurt about Eminem fans, I bet this is Ja Rule secret account
Can’t fathom making a post about this lmao. I watched the video, loved the nostalgia then went on about my day. This guy is out here fuckin FURIOUS about somethin
Some sanity in reddit comments? Nice
At this point, what fan base isn't toxic?
he a stan he a stan he a stan
Wasn't it Nas making a reference to that Eminem song? Guess credit should go to both
Every once in a while I think about collecting my thoughts and typing up a post about what I personally like and don't like about Em's music, and how I interpret the direction it has gone, but I never bother because I know the comments would just end up a shitshow of hate.
There was a massive crossover between Eminem, ICP, Kid Rock, and Limp Bizkit fans in the early 2000s. That’s all that needs to be said really.
Yeah. They got me feeling like Peter denying Christ
Coming from someone who once thought Juice was the goat, it’s literal immaturity and ignorance, but I mean that in the nicest way possible. They haven’t developed a taste for hip hop just the sad, emo rap sub genre of hip hop.
every Juice song has the same lyrics

“I just took a xan now I’m sad / saw my old bitch now I’m mad / thinkin bout the times that we had / percs in my stomach make me glad”
Ngl id listen to X and juice over Eminem anyday
The only person that can freestyle like juice is lil Wayne. Who else can just freestyle for 20 mins straight ?? And at such a young age ..
That’s completely different. Juice stans are literally children you’re dissing teenagers rn. Thesw eminem “fans” are grown ass men acting like this
Real, they made good music but calling them the goats is wild
Whenever I scroll past the playboi farti subreddit I lose a few braincells.
Throw Travis on that pile, too.
Oh naw, hell naw yall..... I'm playing... I'd say kdot fans are pretty bad. 

Pointing out real things that he is hypocritical about is met with blinders and just dumb goal post moving or straight up denial.
No the worst are Drake fans. Dude is the corniest cornball of all time and doesn’t even write his own shit. Oh, and he’s a fucking CREEP.
tbh they had potential to be goats but ultimately calling them goats is overdoing it. the term legend though i think fits X he was massive. juice too but not as hard on it
Taylor Swift and Beyoncé fans would like a word.
No, pop fans are the worst by a mile. Absolute fucking nightmare people
I don’t know if Playboi Carti is a real person or just a shitposting reddit that appears when I scroll for too long to be honest. That sub makes the Arkham one look sane.
Jermaine was really talking about us
All my albums are still rap, and that's all I look into. I understand your point tho, and see why you're right to an extent.
I listen to old rap. I feel like there's a portion of us.


I bump the stuff I know and love. Not much post 2010
To add even more to ur last 2 sentences, they call ppl soft for not liking Eminem ( specifically slim shady ) but will attack anyone who says they don’t like Eminem, or criticizes his bars or says something bad abt him lmao . Even then I believe gen z, the younger ppl who they call soft is also liking this song . Its like a top 3 song on Spotify rn , and its the biggest any of his newer songs have been on Spotify (big coincidence but it’s also the most slim shady he’s been in awhile too in a track )
I feel that but churned some good discussion
that subset of his fandom are the “who is still listening to this classic in 2024” “they don’t make music this good anymore. it’s all just mumble crap” mfs that plague youtube comment sections for 20 year old music videos.
If I have to see one more tik tok about how Eminem isn’t good and a culture culture ima snap
Holy fuck, such people exist? Please provide me with links
People enjoy hating more than they do listening to music. Nobody said you couldn’t be a huge fan of both Kendrick and Drake. You can think Eminem is the goat and still appreciate everyone else. I just listen to what I like.
I think one thing you’re missing about the Em Stans that makes them particularly bad is pure ignorance of Hip-Hop itself. A lot of Em fans outright say they only listen to him and he’s the goat despite admittingly knowing nothing about the actual genre outside of him. A good amount of Em fans have never even checked out the guys he’s shouted out in his own music.
📸
How is it corny? It’s still applicable.
I think it's just because the annoying stupid shit is always the loudest.

I got Em as my #1 but I listen to a lot more than just him
Lets talk then, i am trigged because yes one way thats true ... but on the other you got real hip hop stans who follow more than Eminem and everytime they say he is the GOAT people say things like that 😅

I like a lot more than Em, i think he shows a lot creativity and thats not easy to find, got big mix bag of songs, flow, history bla bla...

I love Wu, Kendrick, Cole, Westside Boogie, 50 Cent, Denzel Curry, Biggie, Pac, Rakin, Missy, Pop Smoke, Schoolboy Q... and damn i can go on and on, i love this culture .
This is what gets me. It's the complete lack of almost any other hip hop knowledge coupled with assertions that Em is the most important rapper, best rapper, yada yada yada. Culturally, Em isn't very important to hip hop. I will and have consistently said Em is the most technically skilled rapper in the mainstream ever -- but that doesn't make his music good. In fact, it's made it bad pretty frequently in recent years. Em is dope, and Em's music is sometimes dope as well, but let's leave it at that please. 
I don’t listen to a lot of rap, but I like Eminem. 

AITAH?
Yup.  Exactly.  People get mad or down vote me when I say this.
Dude … the past month and a half has been nothing but people glazing the entirety fuck out of Kendrick Lamar, down to analyzing every lyric to somehow prove his genius superiority. Kendrick fans are twice as bad as the Drake fans, it’s not even close.
>Also they are delusional in his fall off when it comes to the quality of his music

Encore was drugged out and sloppy but had some gems

Recovery comes across too poppy and commercial

Revival sucks but the last 2 songs are goated

Those are basically universally agreed on with Em fans. Been uphill since Revival.
OP lacks the object permanence to understand that sequential events can be linked together under the same idea. Or they just bounce around being told how to feel and what to think by their TikTok diet lol.
only people that were offended by houdini were megan stans on twitter and ig. and even then, they were getting ratiod under every single post
Yeah I only saw Megan fans crying lol
Its especially funny because nothing Em said was as scandalizing as it seems like he wanted it to be. I am actually into how corny and goofy that video is, but anytime he tried to say something "controversial" it literally comes off as boomer shit. Like he's shaking his cane and these young whipper snappers having no respect.


 Em I get you're a rap legend and all, but I just want to pat your head and say "bless your heart!" at what you seem to think will get you cancelled. The young uns have had real boomers spraying poison at them for decades, this stuff will just make them roll their eyes along with me.
Get on twitter, the Megan fans are livid. Literally turning his dumb bar into a mini-race war.
Search for reviews of Houdini from young journalists etc, there were many "offended" people. The usual crowd on Twitter that you would expect too. Not that their opinions matter.

Em occupies a strange place that people that don't listen to rap think they get a say, and it's usually bad takes. I think it's probably due to him being white so it's easier for them to comment on it without them feeling like they are out of their lane tbh, but there are no way to prove that.

I'm not trying to defend previous tracks though, he has been mid for a long time. Houdini is good but nowhere near his peak.
Where did you get any of this from?
Yeah but he never says the N word, so who's REALLY racist?? Huh??????????????? Checkm8

>Content/ability to connect, he’d top 5.

Yikes.

>Flow, he’s top 5.

I’ll give you that.

>Word play and syllable-breakdown, he’s #1.

Debatable.

>Freestyling, he’s #1. 

Most of his “freestyles” are written and when was the last time he did something aware close to this?:

https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DprmQgSpV3fA&sa=U&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwiHxfG55IuJAxUUxuYEHRcsB3EQwqsBegQICRAF&usg=AOvVaw0ACN7vZVt9SOEpQQebn1zX

>There’s a reason no veteran alive will battle him.

Define *battle*, ‘cause outside the commercial market Em ain’t winning one in today’s day and age. Also, the myth of him “killing” everyone he’s been on a track with is just that…
I thrive on hate and hot pockets
People who just gather around an individual to praise or shun them and make it their whole personality are just idle cult recruits waiting to be claimed.
This. You couldn’t have any discourse Kendrick and Drake subs during the beef without being called a stan or glazer for disagreeing with someone.
I've seen so many tiktok posts from millennials and gen x thinking the entire gen z is trying to cancel eminem when like 5 people on twitter tried doing it and most of gen z either don't care about the song or enjoy it
No that shit is cringe af, I am just excited for the Album.
Not after Grippy they’re not
A lot of Eminem fans are not real hip hop fans.  What I’m saying that they’re not into other hip hop artists. They do not dig that deep to find other artists they might like.
Donda is a great album and vultures have some singles I replay here and there
Donda has strong replay value imho. 

I sometimes prefer it over TLOP and WTT.
Kendrick stans have been eating well recently ngl compared to the other big fanbases:
- ye fans, same as usual, “but he made graduation!!”
- Drake fans are in shambles
- Eminem fans have to deal with him dropping more mid
- Cole fans feel like they got the last lifeboat
- Rocky and Frank Ocean fans starved to death
I’d say it’s drake fans who are worse.
I think it's a tie between Kanons and stans 

It's over for ye fans and they (we) been known for a while
imma ye and kendrick stan and yea nah we suck. em stan’s are worse tho
Seriously. Kendrick fans have gotten to the point of being just as bad as Eminem or Ye’s are.

That Kendrick Lamar sub is crazy, the levels of idolatry are off the charts.
Nah fandoms can kill an awesome thing and it happens often. 

Think about Rick n Morty for example. It was a good show but the fandom made you think it was toxic and stupid. 

I stopped giving a damn the moment I saw kids standing on McDonald’s counters yelling for god damn sauce.
I'd honestly like to read that one day. If you ever decide to do it and don't want to post it, send it to me. Maybe we can have a discussion. I've been a Stan for a long time and have a lot of dislike in his music and ideas, topics, songs, features, etc. I still think he's a goat, but that does not come with a lot of criticism from me.
Fan bases for Reddit post about fan bases is the corniest fan base
As an Eminem fan in the early 2000s who started listening to Nas and Biggie because of him

I’m kinda bummed that I’m associated with ICP, Kid Rock, and Limp Bizkit
yea im mostly talking abt my little brother tbh his dumbass wont shut up about how X is the best to ever do it.
Now you’re an “old head” just like me!

Muahaha!
That’s how I feel about Drake. He’s a nice intro to rap for teenagers but by mid 20s it’s fewer, most have branched out and now that I’m in my 30s no one listens to Drake.
It's not about lyrics is about the VIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIBE!!!!


I'm glad I'm in my old head transition fr.
yea freestyling is impressive but he aint the goat of that either. wayne is better any day
Okay T fans yes are insane..I work with a few and it's insane. Alright change my original post. Nobody rides dick like rap fans and T Swift fans.
Agreed. I feel like it's telling that when people name the rappers who have the most insufferable fanbases, it's always the rappers who incorporate significant amounts of pop into their style.
Those hurt to read. "Rap is a mountain"
All I'm saying is this.  EM in the top 5 sounds good until you start making that list.  Cause it's not about putting him on the list.  It's about who you take off , to put him on the list.   To me, he's a gimmick rapper with great word play.  Like a Juelz Santana in his prime.
>It's the complete lack of almost any other hip hop knowledge

I always found this take funny because it's partly true.

But on the opposite side of the Eminem fanbase you'll find people deep diving every old school album he wears on a T shirt. Going through each name on his Rock n Rock Hall of Fame speech list, etc.
It's absolutely ridiculous.  I seldom take them seriously
You can like what you like, and you make valid points, but to say em wasnt culturally important for hip hop is crazy to me. Hes inspired so many different rappers right now, even Kendrick.

Hes also introduced an entire wave of people to hip hop as a genre. Sure some of them are the kinda corny fans who only listen to Em and shit on the rest of the genre, but a large majority get introduced by Em and keep searching and finding all these other incredible artists out there. Thats what I did at least.
You skipped relapse
And im all out of hot pockets
i am a fan of the name
I need these heated pockets.
They're people with no identity of their own so they follow someone who does have one and they adopt it for themselves.


It'd be sad if it wasn't so fucking funny.
The best comment ever. I've gotta follow all your post and like them, even the most wack. It's me and you against the world now Bob. You're the best. No one better ever say any of your comments aren't the best comments.
Yeah this is a big one too. I tried to take a normal stance of pointing out good of early diss tracks on both sides but in some places like twitter if you try to say Family Matters was good at all you get incinerated and labeled a Drake glazer lmao bad on Kendrick’s sub as well

Here and HHH’s seem to be more impartial though to earlier disses before THP6 which was of course, dookie
This is Reddit. Or social media in general really. Reading comprehension is 0, no one has a filter, any different opinion is immediately the worst thing ever and you're dumb for having it, hypocrisy everywhere, and any actual unpopular opinion is hated, while popular opinions are held as unpopular because a handful of people disagree.
Yeah I mentioned how I don't know much about Drake's music but I thought Family Matters was really good (the first verse the other two I didn't care for) and how I liked the flow on Heart 6 and people on Kendrick's sub freaked out and I was a Drake stan even though I couldn't name five Drake songs before this beef.
I just listened to about a minute and a half of it. I wish that I hadn’t. The execution is marvelous. The lyrics are slung so far out of pocket that they’d protect Cole better than Pocket Sand protected The Gribble.
I still haven’t listened ngl but that section of the subreddit has been really fucking funny to watch
It's because white stations and non hip hop stations would play Eminem but wouldn't play any other rapper
Ye fans are fine… he managed to get a number 1 hit off his last album and he’s still going to grab his base every time. Quality doesnt matter because they like it anyway lmao.

Drake fans…. Yeah it’s over lmao he gotta drop his magnum opus at this point.

Em agreed but same thing as Ye… his Stans are going to eat it up anyway.

Can’t argue with the Cole take 😆

Rocky just scared to drop cause his singles didn’t create enough buzz. He’s going to drop eventually I think. 

Frank…. Yeah 😔
Nicki Minaj fans take the cake
Only acceptable place to listen to Drake is at the strip club
All stans are equally as bad let’s just leave it at that. If you’re gonna go that hard for someone that wouldn’t even care if you died then you’re weird. Simple as that
em stans literally why crazy fans are called stans, so 100% true.
Yeah I like Kendrick, but he’s become overrated pretty quickly. The amount of reels I saw about “he a fan, he a fan, he a fan; freaky ass n*gga…”. Bunch of young fans going “fan…F.A.N….’Freaky Ass N*gga…ITS AN ACRONYM BROOOO!!!!” I mean like yeah lol. That’s not that great?
Did you see that in real life, or on the fuckin Internet?   

If I hated shit based on how shitty dumbasses on the internet are, I would just stop breathing
Star Wars fandom caused Lucas to sell to Disney, and then we got whatever the hell the sequels were.
Im late as hell and just started watching it (its funny as hell). Whats wrong with the R&M fanbase?
Yeah to this day I’ve still never watched it solely because of the fan base
It's still a good show. Idk why consuming fan comments somehow changes that for you lol
Excuse me, sir: we cannot have rational takes on Reddit lol
Lmao that tracks. Show that dude some Black on Both Sides and Aquemini/ATLiens. Should do the trick.
It’s the ultimate plan.
Kpop stans
I don't understand why rap is the like the only genre where people are obsessed with goat talk. Same with basketball...
There is a post of 2 days ago in his subreddit and you can clearly see we listen to a lot of artists lol
That one is mixed.

Em himself thinks it wasn’t a good album, his fans think its a classic

So from his fans perspective, he skipped relapse cuz to many of them that is the perfect album .. and so (no comments there)
relapse is actly my fav of his albums lol but i love horrorcore so
I miss the day where I praise a male artist without being called a glazer.
Dude I was rooting for Kendrick super hard, but anyone who says Drake didn’t put in serious work is lying. The beat switches and production on Family Matters is crazy and he just keeps the intensity pushing. I am far from a Drake fan but damn, good music is good music.
Everyone seems to take disagreement as a personal affront and immediately go into war mode having to "win" the disagreement with insanely long posts
Hell I said on YouTube that, “Kendrick won the beef but Push-ups and Family Matters still hard” and got called both a Kendrick AND Drake glazer in the replies
L M A O

Edit: Gave it a listen. Got into 30 seconds and tapped out after “She’s strictly dickly.” 

He needs another apology after this shit lmao. Bros pushin 40 and talkin like he’s a zoomer lmao.
“that section” you mean the whole thing? 💀 grippy jokes were funny at first but it’s top comment on every damn post
Theres certain demographics that can relate to Eminems music.  


I think it was Charlemagne who essentially said "I can respect the technical aspect and acknowledge that hes clearly gifted, but I just didn't relate to the topics he mentioned. I loved my Mum!".  


Lil Wayne is a famous example of a rapper who always did my nut in, but after learning about the way he writes his bars and his freestyles etc. I came to respect that hes a master of HIS craft. 


As a Brit, there certain American/French rappers who have a solid reputation but I simply can't relate to their music like that. 


Shits subjective and that's what's fun about rap. The only genre where guys can battle it out, jump on each others beat and really show everyone their skills. 
That’s a part of it but an even bigger part is Em has grown beyond hiphop.  He was a rapper when he started and he honed his craft for a good decade before his first album but after the Mathers LP dropped he became a bonafide pop star on uthe level with the Backstreet Boys, Britney, and even Madonna, the very same thing he claimed to hate and fueled his creative hatred for so long.  Not to mention the same Stans that are willfully ignorant to hiphop, whom he absolutely hated back in the day because he knew they would ruin his spot in hiphop history (and here we are looking back now with most of us having little positive to say about him thanks in large part to those Stans) he’s learned to embrace them.  Now he’s a pop guy who raps and attracts the listener base of “I can’t stand that rap stuff but boy, that Eminem is something else, he’s the greatest to ever do it.” And most of us would be fine with them having that opinion if they weren’t so ignorant to hiphop not to mention they’re so vocal about his goat status when again the only hiphop they listen to is  Eminem or at best Eminem adjacent artists.
Funny thing about Drake, is he can actually make a major comeback, but it won't be overnight and he and his fans will be in the mud in the meantime.

If his ego don't get in the way, he can start from square one like with the Delilah shit, and get Toronto back rocking with him. Embrace the Canadian shit. Collab with the small-time Toronto artists and content creators, use the little bit of goodwill he has left.

He'll lose fans in the meantime, and the Drake that emerges will be a little cornier yet more authentic Drake.

Then the right hit...BOOM. Drizzy 2.0.
Mos Def said Drake makes shopping music. Best description I’ve ever heard.
Or your woman's  car
It became a term after Eminem wrote Stan. If he never wrote that song no one would be calling anyone a stan regardless of which fan base you're talking about.
I wish I was more like you because the dumb ass Internet mfs really get to me sometimes I can't lie
Yea there would be nothing to enjoy lol
Or because those things seep into real life. it doesn’t really have shit to do with internet. 

The amount of insufferable R&M or Eminem fans I’ve met in real life is what turns me away, always blaming the internet is goofy lmao
Star Wars fandom is the root of all evil
From like 2016 to 2021 or so it was notorious for its awful, pretentious fanbase. It’s a good show though
It’s an okay sci-fi cartoon with comedy blended in. 

Kinda like X-files and Dr. Who had a baby for Adult Swim. 

It’s fine. It has some memorable moments. 

But yeah..the fans act like it’s the first best and only sci-fi show worth a damn that has ever existed. 
nah he called Biggie, Nas, and Mobb mid

and we r from NY 

aint no turning that
That’s a bingo.
Cause people always trying to crown this dude when the culture really doesn't care for him like that.  He koo. But that's it. He isn't getting played in any hood in America.  Not happening.
Seeks kendricks fan base is split like 33 say it was some of drakes best work just wasn't good enough (which ended up being true) 

33 saying it is awful (which I mean definitely has some had parts but as a whole its my favourite drake song, in saying that I don't listen to drake so take that with a grain of salt)

And then 33 who were more just disappointed drake focused so much on other rappers and didn't necessarily dislike the track it just wasn't for them.
I'm the same way man. I am not a drake fan at all, but push-ups and family matters were some heat in a great battle for sure.
I’m in the zoomer demo and I don’t even talk like that. The flow and beat? Sure, that’s nice, I enjoy that. Listening to the lyrics? I do think I’d be appreciative of an apology though my enjoyment of his other music is not contingent on one.
Mark my words, it’ll get funny again for a bit in like three months and then go back to annoying lol
Wayne is someone who no matter what their taste is, most people listening to him are like “damn this wordplay is impressive”
Nah my girl doesn't even play that shit
Yep, Em is why we even have the term "stans."  Kinda shows that commenter doesn't know what they're talking about.  Sure, some Em fans are crazy, but so are plenty of fans of *every* celebrity.  The fact "Stan" was a good enough and popular enough song to birth the term itself supports how good Em was/is.
That's valid. But he's talking specifically about watching people jump on a McDonald's counter, you KNOW that's pure internet.   

Either way, annoying people are annoying people. Annoying ass MFs enjoy a steak, I'll still enjoy a steak.
Yea their go to if you didn't like it was "it's too smart for you, you just don't get it". Shit put so many people off who only saw a clip with a silly fart joke.
~~Beat that kid.~~ Sometimes we have to accept others differences.
My gf was an admitted Drake stan back in the day and she’s completely fallen off.
Nas used it in its modern form vs Jay Z, it didnt just birth itself out of the song.
he is just a general terrible person too  so i can't wait to move out lol
Ya dude only got popular from Degrassi in the first place had a head start towards TEEN girls
Thank You, Swifties


The most challenging weekend of my 13 year bartending career just ended (including 7 years of Mardi Gras in the French Quarter). And even though you guys were fucking NEVER ENDING in sheer numbers you were also so kind, patient, and understanding. I got bracelets put on me every day. I got complements on my drinks. I got gratuitous “thank you”s just for doing my job. I came home covered in glitter and money after 12 hour shifts, four days in a row. I hugged more coworkers than I ever have out of sheer emotional necessity. 

You guys fucking rocked
The swifties have a bad rep on the internet - because of the loud crazy handful that behaves badly… but in real life, they are a treasure
Thank YOU and all of New Orleans for being so so welcoming. I was blown away by the reception that NOLA rolled out for us!
This warms my heart so much 💕. This was my 7th trip to the FQ and I don’t think there will ever be another like it. I’ve never seen the locals so moved by anything, the joy was infectious for everyone!
This is what Taylor would want to hear
Thank YOU for working so hard to make the experience great for so many concert goers! We appreciate you as much as you appreciated us!
this is how i feel about my girl scout summer camp I worked at- the majority of us were swifties and we wore the friendship bracelets and pink cowboy hats and talked about the new release (2023, so it was Speak Now) and sang taylor songs on hikes! It was like being at Eras because of the girl friendship and fun swiftie vibes

edit: and everyone was so sweet, I made so many friends, we all communicated really well and did our jobs and wrote each other nice notes and the campers loved it all too
Taylor wouldn’t want it any other way. 

I’m sure they were *exhausting* shifts (I’m in the service industry as well). I’m so glad you were tipped well. 🩷💜
I am so happy I chose New Orleans for this tour. There was nothing like strolling the streets of the city with Taylor blasting everywhere, the crowd singing along, trading friendship bracelets in the street, Eras cocktails everywhere we went, literally everywhere we went was on theme. My three year old daughter received more bracelets than I can count. THANK YOU NEW ORLEANS!!!!! AND THANK YOU OTHER SWIFTIES!!!!! This weekend touched my heart in a way that I’ll never forget. I had the time of my life with you all 🥹🫶💜
I went to Miami and honestly if this is the future generation man are we in for a treat. I actually overheard the security guard and police officers talking on our way in that they wish every venue at the stadium was a Taylor Swift concert. There is never any bad behaviour, overly drunk people. Peace love and happiness is all they want. This couldn't be more true. Taylor inspires everyone to be kind and brings out the best in all of us.
I love this post so much! Hope you can put your feet up now!
Oh man. This makes my heart sing. They had the time of their lives fighting dragons with you 🥰
This makes me so happy to hear! I tried to tip extra everywhere. At one point a drunk man told me he cried getting his first friendship bracelet because he’s never felt so included before. Thank you, Nola, you were the BEST. ❤️
I hope every person I met this weekend in NOLA know how much of a positive mark they left on me!! Yall were so incredibly hospitable, lovely, and best LIVELY hosts. I forgot how truly magical this city is. From my whole heart, I hope us Swifties left yall feeling as loved as we all felt. 🫶🏻
Can’t thank you and NOLA enough for the hospitality. It’s been so amazing seeing how wonderful the people and this city are! 🤍
I was in London and heard from so many service workers how AWESOME this community was. Yeah, we brought in the money. But also were so nice (apparently) while spending it. So while we were giving compliments, we were getting them back. It was so heart-warming and I'm really thankful my teenager could experience it. 🫶🏼
So glad it was a good weekend! Most of us are only psycho in the analyzing way 'cause "I am what I am cause you trained me [Taylor]"
This is my first time in Nola and it was amazing! Everyone was so nice and welcoming! 

Thank you for all the friendliness and hard work!
I was so impressed by how well the city was able to absorb the extra people and energy! It felt like a lot of bars and businesses (and even the city planners themselves) really leaned into the Swiftiness of it all, which made the whole weekend feel like a fun extension of the concert. Thank YOU for working so hard to be a part of a wonderful weekend that is now a cherished memory for hundreds of thousands of people 💕✨
Her concerts are legit the closest thing we will ever get to Barbie World. ☺️
That‘s how mother taught us.
This is what a Matriarchy would look like. The whole world would be a kinder place.
I was amazed seeing all of us give away bracelets to the staff and fbi military guys outside. (Okay they were kinda creepy but loved the bracelets). 😆 I even have some away to the casino workers - we visited afterwards!
This is a long shot but any chance you were the bartender who introduced me to “salad shots?” If so, you were the best bartender and contributed to an amazing evening we won’t forget! Either way, thanks for welcoming us to your city, it was a magical weekend
New Orleans is one of my favorite places in the entire world. I would be disappointed if us Swifties disrespected it. I’m glad you had such a positive experience! 🫶🏻
We need a swiftie Mardie’s gras festival every year!
As a Swiftie & former Nola resident who couldn’t make it this weekend, I loooove hearing how amazing this weekend was & have so much FOMO!! Sounds like Swiftie Mardi Gras without all the BS 💛
covered in glitter and money. they said THAT!!!!
This is the way! I hope the tips were flowing too. If you wouldn’t mind sharing, I’d love to know how much you made compared to an average night.
I went to astroworld the year it was insane and haven’t been to concerts with lots of people since. As I was leaving night too there was SO MANY PEOPLE trying to get out and I started to panic because I felt that same initial fear of “oh shit I’m about to get smooshed and stuck and not be able to get out” just like at astroworld. Nope! Everyone there kept in their own personal bubble, no pushing or shoving, and we all got out in an orderly way. Just seeing the stark difference seeing people know they’re crushing others, making it so they can’t breathe, pushing them to the ground to get closer/out sooner, versus the way the eras tour was.. really made me get over my fear and realize not every crowd will kill me. Thank you swifties for acting like normal people even though we all were seeing our favorite artist!!!
Man, the city completely embraced us. I talked to many service workers, and they said that NOLA has never done so much for a concert like this before. The sheer amount of special TS activities, themes, and decor was UNREAL. Thank YOU for making it so special for us 💖🫶 I was blown away from the friendliness from residents and swifties alike!!
“I came home covered in glitter and money” is how every day should end 💜
I’m not at all surprised to hear this (especially considering my own love-filled experiences at the eras tour), but it makes me so proud to be apart of this community. I’m so happy you had a great experience and were given the same level of love we have for each other and for Taylor 🫶 hope you have time for some well-deserved relaxation!
I have never been to a Taylor Swift concert because I am getting too old for concerts.  I now want to go to a Taylor Swift concert just to see people being nice to one another.  It is so rare anymore.  Plus, you get the bonus of wonderful music!
This made me cry! I LOVE SWIFTIES!!
I’m tearing up reading this.  This weekend was incredible.  All the bartenders and waitstaff everywhere we went were so friendly and on point. Thank you for your service.
Thank YOU, New Orleans! We came down from NY Wednesday for the N2 show, and your city made the entire experience absolutely incredible!! Our hotel and every bar/restaurant/business we went to was not only SO on theme, but more importantly had the most amazing, friendly, pleasant, and welcoming staff despite all the craziness!! I’d love for SWIFTIE GRAS to be an annual party to show so much more love to this amazing city!!💛💚💜
Thank you so much for your service, seriously! The swiftie descent is real 💰🫶🫡 we were in Nashville (night 1) and stupidly called a restaurant that had been advertising “swiftie brunch” to see if we had to make a reservation. The host was out of breath and panicky and said “it’s so busy. The line is out the door. I don’t even know where the list went. I’m sorry!!” And I said “I’m sorry!!!!!” And then we both laughed and hung up.
As a fellow bartender 35 minutes away in BSL- I must know- how much money did yall make? 👻 glad you had a good weekend!!
The world needs more kindness…and Swifties ;)
Thank YOU for everything!! This was my third trip to New Orleans and it was unlike anything I ever could have imagined. Y’all’s hospitality and kindness was unmatched all weekend and I’m thrilled to hear that the experience was reciprocated. You’re one of us now!! 🥹🫶🏻
Thank you so much to you and the entire community! New Orleans was so welcoming and embraced the invasion of the Swifties! We only had 24 hours in the City, but it was absolutely magical. The streets were sparkling with glitter and sequins and everyone was so happy to see us. We loved every minute. Thank you all for the hard work to accommodate the extraordinary crowds of visitors. We all truly appreciated the extra effort.
There was a concert here in Sacramento this weekend where the artist made everyone wait 3 hours and then cancelled.  Hundreds of people then stampeded through the security and the arena got looted and trashed. Then people were running and scrambling out the building because they thought a shooting occurred. Point being: there are a lot of Taylor Swift fans who have no idea how lucky they are to be Taylor Swift fans
Love hearing this! Swifties are the best kind of people🫶🏻💜
I worked at amc during the eras tour and even though I am not a manager I would call out to the crowds for orderly and if we didn’t have products. 

Only 1 person gave any attitude (and nothing like marvel fan attitude- just disappointed attitude) everyone else was a delight and understanding.  1 out of over 1500 in a span of 3 hours.  (We don’t normally do that much business-Oppenheimer and Barbie level business) 

The lines were long and everyone was patient.  Some knew it was a party cinema while others liked the quiet ones. The amount of bracelets, as a fellow swifitie it was the best experience because everyone just wanted to party and have a good time.
I was there, it was rare. I can’t count how many times I teared up over the weekend seeing the mass amounts of love & inspiration in the air. Couldn’t have happened in a better city with the most genuine of people. New Orleans forever deserves a win & the Swifties delivered. Sending you all so much positive light 💛
I know it must have been a marathon of a weekend, but NOLA + Taylor must have been magical.

I was there in 2012 for the Lutheran youth gathering. I know not many cities would have been thrilled to have thousands of teens descend on downtown for a week, but all the locals we met that week were so wonderful and happy to have us. 

If I had a chance to see an Eras show anywhere, it would have been NOLA. 

Love to y’all.
make me cry in one reddit post!!!!!! <3
Now why did this make me cry 🖤
This makes me so happy to see! My husband went to his first Taylor Swift concert with me a couple of weeks ago, and he isn’t a fan of big crowds - but he was commenting on how everyone was so kind and happy and how different the vibes were from a typical concert. I know swifties get a bad rep, but I’d like to think we’re mostly good!
Swifties are among the best fanbases ever not as toxic or hateful as other ones tend to be, im new in this fandom but seen nothing but good postive vibes
Thank you for welcoming us all with such love and hospitality! I was blown away with the ability to transform the city into a switfie oasis where we all felt safe and connected!! It truly was a magical weekend experience✨
I love to hear this. I just got home from driving from PA to NOLA for N2 and has the time of my life there. My friend and I talked to a waitress yesterday morning who said this was one of the busiest weekends she’d seen in the quarter but the safest she’s felt with that big a crowd 🥰🥰🥰
You guys made the weekend amazing for us. When we tell people we saw the eras tour in nola they know
it was a different experience than other cities. Because of you guys!! Thank you for sharing your city with us!!!
Aww I love this! Glad to hear it was a good weekend.
13 is a mighty magical number around here! This post was so wholesome, warms my heart ♥️
I love this
This makes me sooooooo happy!!!!! ❤️
So happy to hear this! Love that all of us Swifties are being good ambassadors in the cities we visit
I drove my granddaughter to the concert.  Walking around town we got the same reception.  People were just so complimentary and sweet to her.
This was my first time in NOLA and every single person in every single establishment made me feel so welcome. Y’all really are the most hospitable place on earth.
I went to a Taylor sheesh concert on the weekend and the amount of swifties there was amazing. I took my best friend who was not a swifty in the slightest. Thought she was overrated and her fans were insane. From that one concert, she walked away a convert and wanted me to play Taylor all the way home. She asked me if all of her concerts were such a good vibe and everyone is so nice. I was like yes queen this is girlhood
This makes me so happy!
🩵🫶🏼🩵🫶🏼🩵🫶🏼🩵
This is so so so great to hear! I’ve been a fan of Taylor’s music since the first time I heard Tim McGraw, but seeing the camaraderie and positivity and joy that has come out of Eras is what made me a Swiftie.
Friends…we love us and everyone else too.  🫶🫶🫶
flying out of the city rn and YES 🥹 what amazing energy throughout. it felt so special.
We also had an amazing experience in NOLA and I can't wait to go back. I love the playful sense of humor the locals had. And those gorgeous accents! Everyone was just so nice and fun and I know they were probably exhausted so I was impressed!
Thank you for having us NOLA! I hope I represented well last weekend 🫶🏽
Waw your the same age as my daughter Brigitte born 1989. Air sign a force to be reckoned with. She might not like you. She is being an Aquarius. She picks her people. Human level thing.
This is my fomo issue! The music and the show would be great but I can’t even imagine the vibe and the positive energy. Feeling it through posts like this!
thank you guys! this was my first time in New Orleans and despite the sheer amount of people being overwhelming for me, the energy there was infectious. everywhere we went there were taylor songs blasting, taylor art, taylor signs (the swiftie beignets at cafe du monde was so cute!!), and so much more! I traded friendship bracelets with my tour guides, bartenders, cashiers, even a security guard on the street! it was so so much fun and I was astounded by how the city welcomed us! I expected people would hate us being there (people tend to think badly of swifties and I'm not really sure why) but most of y'all were really nice! it made the trip such a great experience and I'd love to come again.
The thing that always amazes me is the incredibly good vibes coming off of the crowds on their way out of the stadium. It just seems to be positivity and good vibes. I bet the cops have a relatively easy time of it.
It REALLY helps that Taylor Swift is the personification of love, and that she encourages us to continue spreading love & kindness to each other 💙

I went to the Friday show in Miami a couple of weeks ago, and I was REALLY fortunate to be around my fellow lovely & friendly Swifties.

I got my 1st ever Swiftie friendship bracelet thanks to the younger girl that was sitting on my left 🥲
Posts like this 🥰 all the warm feelings. Thank you for your service OP
The Swifties are such amazing fans 💖 I worked at the Edinburgh shows as front of stage security and they cared so much about us, while we were there to care about them
Thank you for hosting us!! NOLA has been so wonderful and welcoming. Taylor herself was blown away by the giant friendship bracelet on the stadium. I was touched by how celebrated the Swifties are and how kind the city has been all week. I'm still here as I've always wanted to see New Orleans and to celebrate Halloween here. I just had THE BEST Halloween ever. I haven't even left yet and I'm already planning on all the things I want to do on my return. Thank you New Orleans!! 
Every Taylor concert I’ve been to, it’s women and girls complimenting each other and being so kind and fun. I’ve been talking my daughter since she was 9. She gets to see how lovely women are w each other. Leaves her feeling on a happy high for a week after
I truly believe the Eras tour is a close to Barbieland as exists irl, and it’s so beautiful
They revitalize every city with glitter and hope. The future for our women is bright.
I was in Melbourne for all her shows there and the energy was incredible. I spoke to Uber drivers, transit workers, security, waiters, police and it was a respectful, friendly, camaraderie I’ve personally never experienced.
Do they actually get a bad rep?  I was in NOLA this weekend (still here, actually, fly out in a couple hours) for my first Taylor concert, and I thought the swifties were an incredible group, just so much fun.  Loved the outfits, loved the dads with daughters, loved the inclusiveness, just overall loved how happy everyone was. Amazing experience, and I have no clue what comes next, but I’ll be at the (hopefully there is a) next tour!
Every time I meet a fellow swiftie irl it's such a pleasant and warm experience. It's like we're one giant family<3
And they have treasure. That shit ain't cheap.
The ones who give us a bad rep are the ones who are constantly spamming and sending death threats to anyone who they perceive to have a negative interaction with Taylor.
Truly incredible!
The FQ singalong was a one of a kind moment.
I finished Girl Scouts in 2016 (did k-12! It was a big piece of my life!) and the inner Girl Scout in me is so glad to hear this lmao
This Miami Swiftie is so jealous of New Orleans swifties! The city really stepped up, it  looked like a blast!! (but let's face it I wish I could travel to every city and go to every show because I'm insane)
Long live all the magic we made in New Orleans!
I hope we can continue this through her next tours, it’s been such a magical and special ride that we’ve created.
My friend works door security at one of the Bourbon st clubs. He showed up at the bar after his shift with a stack of bracelets and that old punk was *ecstatic*. Him: ‘look! They MAKE these themselves!!! They’re called friendship bracelets😃😃I’m a swiftie now!’ 

Also: yes, as a long time French Quarter resident, y’all were top tier tourists. Thanks for coming and being awesome!
This is honestly how Vienna was too, even though it ended up being such a bummer. All of the locals I interacted with truly felt SO bad for everyone who was in Vienna to see Taylor. It was special in its own way and I was grateful that they made an effort to be kind to a lot of sad Swifties.
Stockholm was the same.  I was talking to a local resident outside the stadium where there were thousands walking around exchanging bracelets and compliments like 4 hours before the show.  Her comment was that normally for a football match the plaza would be crawling with police. We only saw a literal handful of uniformed police in a crowd of thousands. She couldn’t believe it
TIL it's trained not chained! Omg
It was my first time in NOLA as well and my first time seeing Taylor and everyone around me made the whole weekend feel so incredible!
Nola handles tons of famous events, including the next Super Bowl as well as international Mardi Gras each year, Jazz Fest.. The dome itself has legacy history ( not just Katrina ).
there’s so much truth in what you said.


“and you were tossing me the car keys…”
And in the in between, we do have Kamala. 💙
SAY IT LOUDER 👏🫶🏼✨💚✨
I need to know what a salad shot is...
As a Swiftie who LOVE New Orleans I was confident that the Swifties would treat my favorite city right. So glad they are meeting my expectations!
I mean if her team can get a Krewe together, its possible to get a permit and make it happen
SAME. This has given me the ultimate fomo. New Orleans will always be home and seeing all the swifties singing together in the French quarter made me so emotional 🥹
me too. i bet it was crazy. but so hard. but worth it
I’m an oldie and have been to many concerts in my youth but I’ve never had a spiritual experience like I did at Eras. Do it anyway!
You’re never too old for concerts 🫶🫶
I would also like to add that I heard from a lot of people that Miami did not have a welcoming environment for the Swifties last week. The Superdome staff did a wonderful job and everything seemed to go off perfectly. New Orleans now has a special place in the hearts of my family and thousands of others after this weekend.
I'm a guy and I haven't had more compliments from girls in my life since I went to the Eras Tour in Argentina (my country) wearing a home-made "I'm not going to talk about that in my monologue" shirt. It was crazy and didn't know how to feel hahaha so much good-natured people
This was what drew me in, actually. Decided to walk around outside the stadium when she was in my city, just to witness the spectacle, but the atmosphere was so uplifting!! Stayed for half of the show and have been sucked in ever since.
Swiftie dudes are awesome also. I was next to a probably late-50s man at my Eras concert in Munich. He stood the whole time (more than I did, tbh) and knew every word to every song. I wanted to talk to him but I don’t speak German so we just kinda smiled at each other and sang together 😭 it was wholesome

(ETA: please don’t be mad at me for “taking” a German ticket, my bff lives in Munich and we wanted to go together ♥️)
That's what I see. A few times there is one outlier that is horrible at a concert like one. Those are the ones get boats blasted all over social media,  but most times they weren't even real fans anyway.  They were ones who were influencers or rich kids going for the cred. 
“Hi Swiftie!” *waves*
oh THIS is a take!!!! i love it cos it's so true😭😭
In da clerb, we all fam 😜
I didn’t expect it, really. When I got to the airport there was a ‘welcome, Swifties’ display, and it didn’t stop after that! Friendship bracelets, drink specials, Taylor art, Taylor music everywhere. Seriously, how wonderful. I’m still buzzing from the high, and I’m back in the northeast now!
I can’t stop talking about that. I have been on bourbon street many times and seen the debauchery of it all. I’m 41 now and planned to mostly avoid it. And while it was still really loud and overwhelming it was the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen 😂. I had promised my friend some topless ladies and we didn’t see a single one but we did have an unexpectedly amazing time dancing all night!
I live in the FQ, and it was so MAGICAL. Walking in the FQ never gets old for me, but this just renewed for me WHY New Orleans has my heart and soul.
💚💚💚💚🌈🩷🫶
I'm a Girl Scout Leader!  My niece starts Daisy Sprouts next year and I am dying to take her through K-12.
Thank you for being the BEST host city ever. It was so so special. 🫶
I understand completely, when waiting for the lyrics to be up on release night I thought Guilty as Sin said "bedsheets are aGlaze" and that was TMI even for me.
Me too omg?
I’m glad you had a good time too! 😊
Their experience showed beautifully 😍✨✨ I was talking to my friend about this in line at the grocery store and the guy behind us in line puffed up his chest and said “that’s what we do.” He then told us that he works at a hotel in the French quarter, did 12 hour shifts all weekend, and was blown away by how nice the Swifties were :-)
Cucumber vodka, sour, and a sprinkle of Cajun seasoning on top. AMAZING! Definitely had more than my fair share on bourbon st
My mom and I came here all the time before Covid.  We agreed this would be the best trip because of all the swifties; and boy has it been even though it’s only been two days for us.
Sign me up!
same same same! … lived near there for 20y up until last year. i was so sad that i couldn’t get tickets to one of the nola nights. i’m just so happy reading all these replies. i’ve been happy crying while reading this thread and i happy cry when i watch all the tiktoks of bourbon and the FQ and how happy everyone was while there. it just blows me away how this musical movement has brought so much joy and kindness to all these places and all these people. <3
I like it!
That’s awesome. I love the dads that take their kids. They have the best time too.
Omg amazing shirt choice
Same, I went alone in Dallas and got so many compliments on my “No it’s Becky” shirt and it made me feel so warm and fuzzy inside, everyone I saw was so nice!
I just sang that in my head! Now it's gonna be stuck for days! 
They are! I love to see the dads w their daughters dancing and singing w them too
This story is magical aw 🥹
Yes! Just to smile & wave at the other Swifties in the NOLA airport this weekend was so sweet 🫶🏽
I have friends who live in New Orleans and they were shocked. The city really cleaned up before the swifties invaded. The hostess who was starting sing alongs on bourbon was posting on so many videos of it talking about how it was the best time of her life on TikTok. Everyone down to the residents felt more safe in public and it was infectious from what I hear.
It’s the only time in my life I’ve ever wanted to be on Bourbon Street.
Aweeee!! Have fun with it!
Oh noooo, that's a disturbing image!! Glad you got that clarified sooner than later lol
THANK YOU! Can't wait to try that...
Okay that sounds refreshing as hell and now I wanna try it.
I have so much FOMO!! If I had been able to choose which city that I would get tickets to, it would have 100% been NO, unfortunately we all know that in the Great War of getting Eras Tour tickets, you get what you get and you don't get upset !
Yes! I only went with one of my female friends and we had a blast. First time coming to the country (I has already lost hope, I've been a fan since Speak Now) and it was wonderful :)

I reckon it's been a great experience for your daughter
I WANT THIS ALL. THE. TIME. THE JOY. THE COMMUNITY. THE SAFETY.
Yes!! We had a really disappointing view (it looked perfect online) but still had a blast!
That makes me happy to hear! 

And yes she has the best time. We’ve been to 6 of her concerts so far. Last one was eras in the US, Philadelphia. We take her two best friends every time too.
Guess who's back? Back again. Eminem Houdini
https://youtu.be/22tVWwmTie8?si=SUZ7ye6uf6-b8ILU
Drake vs Kendrick is out, Old Eminem vs Young Eminem is in
This is the nostalgia I needed today
Black Guy Pees lmao
Aight it’s been 10 years but I might be ready to be a Stan again
![gif](giphy|Wv9kcISbTN0B2)
“Black guy pees” is rightly getting a lot of attention but “fuck my own kids they’re brats” is just unexpectedly fucking hilarious
It’s amazing, I will always be happy for new Em music
ya, em's so back with this one
We're so back! This is everything I wanted and more. Made for the fans
The main dawg made it in so I approve
bumping r kelly's favorite group black guy pees. 

I haven't laughed like this since Kendrick said what it is the braids
The GOAT is back, back again
I haven’t been a fan of Eminem for a long time now. I really enjoy this one. I’m just glad to see him finally having fun again.
Thank the Lord someone won’t be talking all that culture vulture Shit with Eminem this is the old Em we missed.
It just FEELS like 2002. Like, this is the Em we grew up with. He had some super dope little pockets too. Fuuuuck I'm so glad it was good.
“would I have a shot at her feet” letsss gooooooo
Hitting an 8 year old in the face with a participation trophy

I mean he used to be leaving twin babies in a car with the windows up. So while he’s less cruel I guess he’s still the most lyrically violent towards children of any major rap artist. 
Haven’t truly enjoyed anything Em’s released since recovery. This is awesome :)
Sometimes he’s tried to bring back the Slim Shady persona and it’s felt really forced. It feels natural here and sounds just like something from 20 years ago.

Here’s an idea for a song: Guilty Conscience Part 2. Old Eminem vs Current Eminem.
Just woke up for work, saw that it dropped, and have played it 3 times. WOW! I'm in love with it. I needed this.
If someone better than me could put together a full list of cameos in this video I’d hugely appreciate it
this was better than I was expecting.  that's a catchy ass hook. who's the hitmaker now? (kidding)
such a fun track, like i genuinely enjoyed listening to the entire song. never been a huge fan of eminem but he just convinced me to give his album a fair chance with this one.
This is so fucking sick
Shit slaps!! Fuck yeah!!
More genius and the album will be even better.
Shady tryna get his ass canceled, damn we're so back to the 2000s 🤣
I like it. Takes me back.

It seems like the majority only fuck with slim shady rather than em or Marshall.
Eminem tried to dissociate himself from his alter ego many times throughout his career with no success and loads of criticism. 
How many times does he have to bring slim shady back? 

Em clearly understood that the vast majority of his audience are still attached to the old reckless slim shady, that’s why we had albums like MMLP 2 after RECOVERY or KAMIKAZE after REVIVAL.
As a modern em hater and old em glazer I gotta say this is really what I have always wanted to hear from modern em. He doesn't need to be more than he is, he just needed to slightly modernize in terms of production and references, but keep everything else just like old slim shady. I feel he did exactly that on this song. The production sounds sorta modern, but keeps a nostalgic core, and the references are simple, modern, yet very effective. He isn't trying too hard to rap faster than everybody, or have more technical yet still comedic lyrics or anything like that. He is no longer trying to be the best and that's exactly where I want him to be. Just be a chill funny old man that comments on the modern day squabbles of the youth. Like kings disease energy, but slim shadyified. Before I glaze too much all I gotta say is I hope this is a very tight and well made album from him, and I hope we get more like this in the future.
 We might be back
Well I'm glad he's having fun again
I feel like his past ten years of work have been him trying to prove that he could keep outdoing himself, but only for himself. But the thing is he never needed to. 

This might be fan service and all but I fucking love it and I feel like this must have been almost cathartic to Em. Like he’s saying fuck it I’m having fun again.
Can't wait to listen when I can have the speakers on
🔥🔥🔥
I remember seeing a clip of the Without Me video on TV back in school and wanted to get TES so bad. I thought it was the best music video I've ever seen and the best album I've ever heard. Still think so today. But I was told Eminem will never be a big artist and he doesn't make real music. 20+ years later we're all grown up and still bumping to this.

Kudos to Em for paying homage to this era. I felt MMLP2 was too forced but this should work better.
Great song. And the video is fucking amazing. Kinda wish I haven't played SMB - Abracadabra so much over the last year. I'm gonna get sick of this track faster than I should.
This year is a good year
The beat, the flow, the lyrical comedy, all of it is reminiscent of 2002.
The Megan triple was crazyyy. Had me baffled when it hit me.
ok he wins
The Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini line is wicked.
What a good year for rap/hip hop👏
Not the meghann feat line oh lawd the funny thing is she really can't say shit it's eminem
How many artists in their 50’s have ever put out rap music this good? Just being listenable at that age is an achievement.
This song was everything I hoped and more. And the music video was freaking brilliant aswell
Got me excited for the album
Yessss
I wonder if the cameos are going to be featured on the album. I’d love another Em/Westside Boogie project.
How in the world did they do the de-aging tech on blonde Em? Movies that cost $300M couldn't pull that off
He’s going back to basics this shit is just like the old fun tracks he made
After listening like 15 times now I can safely say this is just awesome. It's just such a high energy enjoyable track and the music video is such a fun ass nostalgia bomb. I hope the rest of the album maintains this momentum. But even if it doesn't, it still would have been worth it for this track.
There’s something about this that just works so well. 

The nostalgia helps but I also think it feels really authentic, I think the self awareness and making fun of himself really sells this song. The video is incredible.

He’s done a few of the silly singles since he came back in 09. This is by far the best one. 

Also helps the song is catchy and he sounds like he’s having fun. It’s still lyrical but he’s not doing too much. It’s that sweet spot
I heard rumors of a new Shady album a while back but felt really skeptical about it.

This is fucking awesome on another level. 

Cant wait for the album.
No matter what dude releases he always has people that talk shit. 

I don't understand why miserable people feel the need to spread their negativity and hate on every single post. It's disgusting and sad
*Like happy!*

Fucking brilliant.
ABSOLUTE BANGER!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥THE GOAT IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok. That was a fun video! Dope!
GOAT never left
Member slim shady! 

Yeah I memeber….
Unreal
ABRA ABRA CADABRA
Fire
This is fucking awesome. 

Holy shit I can’t wait for the album.
50 years old still doing shock value rap and high school humor? Lol y’all got it
Can anyone tell me what the "black guy pees" line is about?
What a comically good song. Lol
I’m shocked all the white ppl on Reddit love it
You guys really like it?
Shadys fkin back. This gives goosebumps 😮‍💨🔥
I get that it has a lot of callbacks to old Em so I’m happy for the fans but independently of any of the nostalgia grabs I really think this song sucks.
![gif](giphy|3oriO6ysZ5yj9neQY8)

Super Cringy
Video was good but overall song was 🗑
Sounds mediocre at best ngl.
You guys can’t be serious
That song was not good. I came to the comments expecting to see people pointing out how corny and trash it was to be shocked by universal praise.
🤠🤠🤠

I like the song.  I feel like I’m alone in this but I don’t LOVE it but I’m still excited for the new album nonetheless
This video is great
It feels like he was never gone! 🥰
Rap is having a renaissance, led off by Kendrick Drake
so glad it’s getting love in this sub cus i’m even seeing hate for it in r/eminem

well, some people are just in that sub to hate
In 2024, why aren't music videos recording in 4K
I can’t wait to hear all of the things Slim has got to say about the current state of the world
We're so back
Meh I'll look forward to lupes samurai yall can have your dad bars wordplay death of slim shady
If he brings a track out called The Joker and uses that hook. I would be totally down for that. 
Especially the adlib after the "Maurrriiice" line
Feat Snoop, who is The Joker, The Smoker and the Midnight Toker 😁
I gotta be honest. I stopped listening to Eminem after Encore after being a huge Stan. But I’m back in with this track. What are some of the best tracks in the past 20 years lol
I think I liked the way Eminem evolved over time and how his writing and complicated multis and topics progressed to what it has been lately. I think this track is cool and a call back to his roots but I also realize that I too have grown over time and this track didn't really land for me. Funny, nostalgic yes...replay worthy no.
I’m tripping because I think this sounds a lil corny to me and some (only some) of his newer stuff that I thought was cool got panned. Guess getting old is weird
Ngl the sample is the best part
Em is on another level compare to literally everyone else in the game. It's crazy
I hate when my transgender cat says he’s black but goes around and acts Chinese
Cringe
Trash
That was garbage.
listen i’ll be so honest, i’m a huge eminem fan and i really thought the music video was fun to watch and enjoyable but the song itself was kinda mid.
Still whack lol
Man this song fucking sucks.
This is legitimately the worst song I’ve heard in years man. Are yall joking?
I didn’t listen but I kno he must’ve given Brittney Spears a proper tounge lashing
This is decent
A throwback to the Eminem show era of 2001 to 2002, if the death of Slim Shady album is a concept album and Eminem goes all out creatively (instead of just being lyrical miracle over underwhelming beats), this could be Eminem best album in many, many years. 2024 in rap/hip hop is real fascinating,  I feel inspired again as a hip hop/rap head.
… so yall really liked it? Dope video where where it stopped with me
I was hoping this wasn't a campy goofy beat and that's what I got. This MFer is corny and has been for a min.
I wish I could really understand what he's saying sometimes on the first listen. He hates mumble rappers but the irony is i got no clue what he's spitting either lol
So mid.
Holy shit that was so bad
Im not an Eminem fan but I think this is great and I’m very excited for this album after watching this. However, I wish he would bring his old flow back instead of using this choppy one
Thanks, Eminem, for blocking the ability to view your video from my country, you are truly making the world a better place 👍
Don’t get me wrong I like it but this just feels like baiting nostalgia to me
Super mid ngl
How did this guy become so so lame its so sad he’s still top 10 of all time just because of those first 3 albums, but christ this guy sucks now
Hope the album doesn't sound like this, imo all his slim shady type songs have not aged well at ALL
[deleted]
Not really feeling the hook.  Can’t really judge the beat from listening through my phone speakers.  But the flow is on point and the lyrics full of self-deprecating humor had me LOL more than once.  I’m very curious to hear what the rest of the album sounds like.
liked everything but the instrumental
If he maintains this flow/cadence/lack of accent this shit might legit be fire circa 2003
Definitely one of Em's best songs in a long while but still not super crazy about it.
Someone needs to take Em out back at this point lol
![gif](giphy|G4ZNYMQVMH6us)

I missed this shit.  Feels like I’m in high school all over again!
Biggest age related beef since Me Vs. Me by MattyBRaps
Who’d win in a serious battle
So.. guys.  .can someone please explain me Kendrick/Drake beef ? What main songs do i have to listen to ? . I did research on things upto 6 months ago... Now where do I begin.. I heard there's like a Euphoria, not like us and some songs like that.... So , pls lemme know all that in detail
why do ppl love kendrick so much, i listened to his songs - theres nothing interesting there, at least Drake has bangers like Friends with Money
EXACTLY
Out of every bar that’s the one you quote 🤣
Goddammit I'm in. I was happier as an em Stan
on a related note just how good can you be to create a new word in the english vocabulary, just crazy
So you agree this takes you back? Some people are shitting on him saying “ohhh, he still sucks he’s just trying to rap like it before” 

Weirdos imo like most of them listen to someone like lil baby, and there’s nothing wrong with that but anything that doesn’t blend in with their playlists is trash for some reason 😭
I love the sampling from Abracadabra. It fits so perfectly with the song.
Me listening to this shit

This is terrible WTH are you guys can’t be serious?
This is exactly the kinda shocking/hilarious/unexpected shit Eminem used to say. When he was 20 it was fuck mom.. now it’s fuck my own kids. lol
Honestly sometimes I think every parent feels like this it’s just funny to hear it out loud lol
While drake and Kendrick are calling each other bad dads in comes Eminem with the my kids are annoying as fuck bars 😂😂
"Go ahead Paul, quit, snake ass prick. You male cross dresser, fake ass bitch" made me laugh and then he said fuck my kids straight after lol
Hailie: Why’d he say fuck me for?
I love their expressions in the video too
OH OH THATS WHAT HE MEANT OH GOD I THOUGHT THE BLACK EYED PEAS HAD SOME HISTORY I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT
Their faces in the facetime cracks me up. It's so cool to see how they're all on board, sticking right behind their Dad all the way ! It also makes me laugh because if anyone ever called Hailie out on a song he would wipe the floor with the artist (Ja Rule being my favourite diss) 
"Now he's dissin his own daughter's and we gave him the Rolling Stones cover?"
Can't wait for this album
This is more than what I wanted. BROOOOO WASS COOOKING
The dawgs are eating well the last few weeks.
Proud of our big kahuna
They be everywhere, and they deserve it!
I had to rewind to re-register that he did just say that😭
[removed]
Yeah, this track was really bumpin'! Nice to see Em back again!
He is one in this song was

![gif](giphy|2w6I6nCyf5rmy5SHBy|downsized)
Tory Lanez? 
The double entendre 🤯
Let’s not even dig into what he got up to on Relapse…
I mean we still have Jasiah’s Art of War to contend with, but Eminem’s is far more frequent.

Either way “yo this the type of shit to make you curbstomp a new born baby” is still the most jarring and disarming opening line I’ve heard in my life
“Half the shit I just make it up to make you mad.”

Looks like he did the job getting you all butthurt accusing the man of being cruel.
Also feel like he should be throwing the trophy at the parents. the kids don't ask for the dumb trophies
Not even stuff like Lucky You? Lock It Up? I Will?
I thoroughly enjoyed MMLP2, but fully understand why others wouldn't. Anything after that has not been for me, but if this is what the rest of this album is going to be like, I'm sold
I’ve been the same, however there have been a few decent “old school” tracks. Framed, discombobulated, stepping stone, Alfred’s Theme. Those have been my favourites from his more recent releases. But Houdini just overtook them all!
MMLP2 was dope.
anything after Relapse was pure puke, i have hopes for this new album
Or old em vs Dre. Old em trying to get new em to go back to his old shit and Dre trying to keep the new em. And in the end Dre either completely folds or makes sure he doesn’t change completely
well clearly he used unreleased and scrapped lyrics of Without Me era, this is so good, i need more unreleased lyrics on the next songs
those are rookie numbers 😅
Idk his name, but the guy that’s sings that one chika chika slim shady song is in it.
incase you're unaware its an interpolation of 
Steve Millers - Abrakadabra
If you’re not familiar with this style, I recommend perusing some of the more “fun” tracks he’s done over the years. Without Me is an unadulterated bop that really precedes Houdini, but it’s not the only one. 

If you want some recommendations, I’m happy to share.
I mean recovery did very well and not afraid and monster are two of his most popular songs in his whole discography. Also songs like lose yourself and Stan are songs that even if you never listened to him are songs you know. Wouldn’t really be fair to say he had no success not being slim as some of his biggest songs are him not being shady
[deleted]
Damn that got long.... I need a hobby. 

I (naively) think that this might be his way of offering a 'respectful' reminder about how little he cares about anyone's opinion... strategically directed, though. 

I think it's a full circle moment kind of release meant to call up his original fan base and fan's turned critics to tell us directly to sit down and shut up, too. He just said it in our native tongue which felt all nostalgic and got our attention.
I think most would agree that his actions and words, whether we like them or not, always seem to align with his reality, his current values, and passions. He said Slim was dead. As a real life person, he evolved like people do, along with his sense of purpose and his creative process. And many fans thought our disappointment held value when we didn't like all of the evolution happening. 

He's told the world since the beginning that he literally doesn't give a fuck about what we think, that rap is his therapy, essentially...   So what's he actually saying? Maybe that we're not special either. 

It starts with Paul: you're on your own
?consistently a theme mentioned throughout his entire career; he's fine on his own, always has been, always will be. Cool with that. 

Back in the days of old me/dope fiend/became smiley face emoji: 
? we can't shut up about how we miss the old version of him; the one that was behind the scenes starting and living with an addiction that changed and almost took his life. Cause, he's a real live man with kids and a life separate from us listeners, ya know..?

Verse 2 I think speaks the same, like I'm going to say what I want so don't listen if you don't like it. But his reference to running full speed and others jogging could also suggest that he never slowed down, we just allowed down thinking he needed to catch up when it was us who got lapped. 

The only cancel culture these days is really his old base... the media isn't the same. 

There's some mic drop, 8 mile rap battle vibes near the end when he essentially knocks off himself, his fam, and everyone in his corner. 
That's easy to decipher 

Sherri Papini reference, she was the woman who staged her own abduction because she didn't know how to leave the life she no longer wanted with a husband and their young children. 
Houdini... I mean, isn't the key to magic distracting the audience so we're focused somewhere else while you make the real moves happen elsewhere?
He gave us what we wanted. I don't think it's cause he's spent a lot of time pondering how to get us back. 


Should that have been a private diary entry?! Lordy. I'm clearly avoiding the work I should be doing lol
all of these albums mentined sck big time, bc Eminem only brings something different when its crazy stuff, 1-2 serious songs and crazyness - nobody can reach him
But that is what makes this track, and why he waited so long so good.

The whole song is "yeah, I could whip this out anytime I want, and I get why people are nostalgic. But at the end of the day it belongs in the past. I'm too old for this shit."

Besides, em is in a much better place now. He has nothing left to prove in the rap game, wealthy, off drugs and healthy, and a happy parent. Why would he through that all away to say fuck the world, other than as an unserious joke? That's Pete's job now.
Eh - sales don’t agree. The MMLP and Eminem Show are his top selling albums, not the SSLP.

That said, I didn’t really see fans asking for “slim” back specifically - they asked for “old em”

This is old em/slim
So what you’re just saying Eminem doesn’t like to make fun music but he has to? L
And to think that Ben Shapiro was featured on that song with  Tom McDonald this year...I think 2024 has been redeemed.
I think she’s gonna have a feature on the album.
r/megantheestallion completely freaked out and says that she needs to clap back 😂

Like...I love Megan but dude, come on...
Black Thought
Nas, Redman, Method man, Ghostface Killa
Nas
I think blonde Eminem was just another guy and it’s a deep fake, but du rag Eminem was just him shaved with a lil of that de-aging technology mixed in.
It's a deepfake on top of the real Em. A company called metaphysic did it.
Well, Em says:

"I don't give a fuck, god sent me to piss the world off."
God damn y’all are fucking soft as fuck, this is rap. People are allowed to talk shit on music they don’t like, people do the same shit for Drake, etc.
Ik it’s a lil late but it’s making fun of MGK’s group which is called the black-eyed peas
You talking about the Kdot Reddit?
Lmao, I’m wondering the same.
I had to have heard a different song lol
dont be too shocked..its the same group as usual
And by He I mean the chickachicka Slim Shady!
That’s actually why I enjoy it. I hate when he tries too hard. This one is fun.
It's just the old eminem formula. Catchy first single for the masses. It's not going to represent the whole album
I liked the video but the song is not going to be in rotation for me. Goofy ass beat
Brother hasn’t heard Grippy lol, stay up
for me the worst was the whole last kendrick album
“Lyrical miracle over underwhelming beats” 

That’s all you got out of his last few releases?? What
[deleted]
Once you get to a certain level nostalgia becomes the core selling point.  Happens with all artists regardless of genre.  Only a handful of fans go to shows for artists that have been around a while and want to hear new stuff, they want the hits. Most folks in an Eminem crowd want to hear Real Slim Shady and his streaming numbers back that up so it was a smart move to cater to that group.
You make it sound like it's easy. He "remade" a classic son from over 20 years ago and made it sound good.
omg the nostalgia I needed silm shady is so back!!!<1k upvotes>




I feel like he's baiting for nostalgia<-1k downvotes>


Duality of reddit in a nutshell . 
Cry
Both The Real Slim Shady and Without Me sounded nothing like the rest of the album
I agree with you. I hate these type of Eminem songs. It doesn’t sound good nor is humorous.
Steve miller
Nobody is mentioning it because it’s not a sugar ray collab lol they covered a Steve Miller song which Eminem used.
I care about everything but your opinion
[deleted]
Why spread hate and negativity? Is your life that bad? I feel sorry for you
Why do I see you on all these posts about this song saying negative stuff.  You don’t have anything better to do with your life?
Damn -43?  Let’s see if we can go even lower
Nah the last verse is straight from 2004, its fun as hell
Call it what you want. It's fun.

[removed]
it’s exactly what we need right now
And Gunther is putting out a new song today! It really is 2006 all over again!

Edit: I'm joking for those who can't tell
Young em. He gave zero fucks and was here for the violence.
I say old/current Eminem with a bullet.   
  
Younger Em had some pretty serious shit going on internally and as he got older he got clean and way more emotionally intelligent, which means he had to look inward deeply and address the darkest parts of him, probably with the help of therapy. I think current Em would be able to hit young Em with a psychological beatdown so devastating that it would make "Meet The Grahams" look like a playground insult.
If you don’t wanna go WAY back and just wanna catch up on the spark that lit the powder keg and you don’t wanna catch all the other shit that Drake addresses with other artists:

First Person Shooter - Drake and J. Cole

Like That - Future, Metro Boomin, and Kendrick Lamar

Push Ups - Drake

Taylor Made Freestyle - Drake (only on IG or YouTube)

Euphoria - Kendrick Lamar

6:16 in LA - Kendrick Lamar (only on IG or YouTube)

Family Matters - Drake

Meet The Grahams - Kendrick Lamar

Not Like Us - Kendrick Lamar

BBL Drizzy - Metro Boomin

There are other tracks that had bearing on this beef with Future/Weeknd/Kanye/A$AP/YG/Rick Ross/etc. but they don’t bear a ton of value on the actual battle with Drake and Kendrick. J. Cole also dropped a song but apologized and recanted it and took it down 2 days after it dropped.
Here's a funny explanation from one of my favorite comedians. He's also an anchor on The Daily Show.

https://youtu.be/K3uWj2MpydI?si=PxPT8_ueSfqtlfiQ
Exactly the foolish mind that Drake music attract
this is satire right
Well which ones did you listen to? If you want bangers try Money Trees, Maad City, or DNA
Because we have ears and discernment.
One is a top 5 rapper ever, the other ones is a meh pop star.
Well see Kendrick writes music for people with an IQ over 70 , whereas Drake writes songs for the same population that loves Taylor Swift.
Same, life somehow just went downhill after MMLP2
Kai cenat created the word rizz. The masses decide a word not the creator
How is it terrible? elaborate.

instrumental sounded like something that’d play in the background of madagascar.
Loved it. Not sure what you’re going on about but to each their own
Now that’s growth.
Refreshing even lmao. Especially after the morning I had with mine.
Yeah they were great. I know Hailie’s quite public these days and she seems great in general, but I haven’t seen much from Stevie or Alaina so it’s nice to see.
R Kelly had to also rewind & register
black eye peas being black guy pees is the funniest shit
Am I hearing things, but is he saying black guy guy pees.

Why is he saying guy two times?

This sounds weird to me.

I liked lucky you, but this is so much better
I think they meant they haven’t thoroughly enjoyed a whole album since recovery. He’s had some bangers sprinkled throughout otherwise not so great albums over the last decade. My hopes are high for the new one though!
Yah yah erasure
I always find this weird and I'm not hating but I found MMLP2 to be awful but really enjoyed kamikaze and music to be murdered by.

How come you didn't like his other stuff after MMLP2?

I promise I'm just asking lol I'm not about to tell you why you should like it or anything haha
I loved MMLP2 but I do think it hasn’t aged too well. I still like it though.
Stepping stone, like Houdini really did feel like a blast from the past but stepping stone was just so bittersweet. This tune being just a fun fuckin bop is such a welcome surprise
#I CAN MAKE ORANGE RHYME WITH BANANA

He’s hilarious to listen to and his shock rap with weird little jokes and things thrown in are hilarious. I know it’s not culturally appropriate in today’s day and age to make fun of a lot of various things, but honestly, a simple gay/happy bar from Eminem is the kind of thing that is refreshing and entertaining in a very simple way. 

We know he has the co-sign of debatably the most famous gay man of all time, one of his kids is openly LGBTQIA+, we know he isn’t homophobic, and it’s just harmless jokes. It’s nice to see people enjoying it.
And kamikaze
Oh that’s even better.
Yeah I’m sure that Meg line came from ‘02 💀
Lmao clearly not.
The one that looks high all the time?
chika chika Slim Shady? I’m sick of him, look at him 🙄 walking around grabbing his you know what
I definitely am.  I have heard some steve miller but not that one. Thanks for letting me know, now I can check it out.
yes recommendations please
I definitely agree with you, but I still think that if he doesn’t marketise his content with the slim shady brand he will not do as good as expected.

Maybe I am biased but I enjoyed recovery when it first came out. I think it is a pretty solid album with a bit of humour , serious content and incredible lyrical displays. 

But in somehow got heavily criticised. then he drops MMLP2 (of course another great project)couple years later and  the reactions were  the complete opposite. 
Maybe because he dyed his hair again, giving that slim shady vibe ? I don’t know but I can really see a pattern.
Monster is MMLP2, not Recovery
I really hope he’s going to giving us an album with a different type of flow. After the rap god he has never been the same 😞😞
Great way to describe it. It felt like he was trying to hard. He could do it, it’s just not what most people wanted to hear.
This AND after 10 years of “I’m the best, I’m skilled, I used to be everywhere, why do people hate me, I’m saving rap!” It got very tired and one note

This is *fun*, that’s why it’s a breath of fresh air
I think I could agree with some of that. 

My thinking is that Em wants to put the Slim Shady stuff to bed because he finds it cringey. Since MMLP2, we’ve had plenty of music that has been Slim Shady-esque but not off the wall in the same way. 

Like Houdini after being punched repeatedly (death blows if you will, or coup de grace) but still performing acts despite being asked to seek medical help, Slim Shady coming back is equally ill-advised. The world has moved on, we might like the attitude but the actual Slim Shady character is dated. 

I love Slim as a character. I think he’s fantastic. I think him calling everything gay is genuinely endearing, because I am old enough to remember the specific sentiment that evoked (which wasn’t homophobic, contrary to modern interpretations). And yet, it’s nothing more than irrational nostalgia to want those times to come back again. 

I’m looking forward to how he can tastefully push the character forward in an album while also saying goodbye to it definitively. Slim Shady is iconic and deserves a proper send off.
He likes to make fun music of course but I feel like he also wants to be appreciated as he makes something more serious.

The i created a monster verse on without me is really a thing.
That was my thought too for some reason. I could be totally wrong but I’ll be curious to hear what the rest of the album will sound like
Right... but the deep fake looks real. Most shows/movies look terrible - see Fallout or The Mandalorian
Almost, it's a deepfake on top of the real Em. A company called metaphysic did it.
I'm soft because I don't spread hate and negativity. Ok
Or people are actually vibing to it?
It’s about music not entertainment, I hate this shit “The character doesnt fit into trying too hard” (I heard it about Carti, Future and others). In music you gotta try hard if you want to make a good song. Great video, but I prefer when the video completes a great song, not the opposite
Thank you. People are acting like this is the greatest song ever purely off of nostalgia. I can’t stand it. He literally uses the word abracadabra in the song and we’re supposed to just look past that because it’s Em/Slim Shady? Any real fan of hip hop or fan of Em knows this is just a desperate grab at relevancy. It’s sad he’s literally 51 years old. I can’t lie the music video production is great 9/10 but the song itself is a solid 2/10. Him releasing a song like this gives me no hope that his next album will be good. I’ve asked multiple people if they have heard this song and what they think about it. The response is all the same it’s trash. The only people that like this song are white 40+ year olds or kids that have parents that monitor what music they listen 2. I promise you NO ONE WITH A AUX CORD IS GONNA PLAY THIS.
Yea nah this is worse than that
Huh?
Average Eminem fan ^
Tells me a lot about you frankly hahaha
They got you too lmaoooooooooo
That's not duality. It'd be duality if both had up votes at the top of the thread.
Did you even understand your own comment before you wrote it? lmao
[removed]
Any criticism is crying.
My point is his slim shady type songs like Kill you, who knew, drug ballad, under the influence, criminal did not age well... even most of sslp did not age well.. and I'm a fan of him but that's just my opinion I like his mature songs way better
The lyrics are not bad but idk I've never been a fan of his slim shady singles lol, I like his mature and motivating songs better, also I think I like violent and dark shady instead of the goofy and silly shady but I'd rather have 8 mile and rabbit run type rapping 🤷‍♂️
This ain't good, stop the cap stan
Take Eminem's penis out your ass—he does not know you, son.
but i love u…
Funny that people think 45 reddit accounts mean anything. 1000 reddit accounts agreeing on the same thing means nothing too

Yall fien too hard over a little online validation

It’s a generational talent who’s hungry and energetic vs a generational talent who’s no longer hungry but has thoroughly refined himself.

Each version has something the other one doesn’t.
BROOOOOOO I'VE LISTENED UPTO MEET THE GRAHAMS... AND LEMME TELL YA, IMO BEEF ALREADY ENDED LMAO ... DRAKE IS DEAD .. KENDRICK COOKED SO HARD , IMMA HAVE TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE KITCHEN FOR A WHILE
Yep , tonn of thanks man ... This is just what i needed
Lmao ... He took it down ?? So it's not over yet ???
I don’t know if you leaving out The Heart Part 6 was intentional or not, either way it was funny.
I knew exactly which video was gonna come up when I clicked this 😂😂😂 This dude is fantastic
It's not that, Kendricks flow is off a lot his voice is grating and he doesn't make what he's saying very interesting.
ok show me the truth, what are the best songs of kendrick and i will put them against my fav drake songs
no,im being honest
King Kunta and Humble as well. Absolutely amazing songs.
Backstreet Freestyle fosho
idk ppl told me he is Eminem level, songs that makes you think and stuff, but i dont see it
im curious how a person with 60 IQ can write music for people with IQ above 70, but if thats your thing, im ok
charisma was already a word
[deleted]
Music’s subjective. I did like the line where he talks about Siamese cats and participation trophies. But be direct man, say something to get “canceled”. Be real and stop being so political about it all. And stop trying to prove you can rap we know this already, we don’t need the filler bars, stick on message. 

He’s using the whole slim shady thing to hide his “controversial” views.

He’s adding comedy to his raps like he isn’t 51 years old and not smarter and can be more poetic, intricate, or direct.

Maybe the message needs to be dumbed down.

Maybe this is the only way for the message to be said or understood, but even then there’s no change that comes out of this music, to anyone’s life.

So it’s not for me, I’d rather him have tracks like the way I am. Because THATS where the world’s tone is. Not this comedy stuff. Not using the same old gimmick.

Maybe I expect too much out of him, but because of mmlp and sslp I’ll always listen to his albums once.

You have the biggest audience, make some shit happen man.

Do i expect artists to be more engaging, yes, you have the biggest audience ever and choose to do shit with it. Mosh was cool, had that spark. Now, eh. 

Your not that mad at the world if your making tracks like this, so I don’t give it attention because you have all the money you could ever need but these songs make it seem like that’s all you want more of. Winking at controversial topics instead of really digging into them to make change.

If I was in the studio with him I would have told him to delete this shit. It’s not crossing no cultural barriers, and if he doesn’t wanna speak to the world, then all he wants is his audience, so money. Put the pen down there’s more important stuff for people to focus on. 

Abra abracadabra Foh. 

Just my two cents, not right, not wrong, but this song isn’t for me. Yall enjoy.
Idk for OP, but for me the whole "fuk every1 cancel me" slim character is just cringe af. Its saying stuff just to provoke reaction. And thats fine, but I just dont find it interesting. 

It got me thinking if I was an adult back in the day Id have rocked with The eminem show like I did.

It also attracts the wrong kind of people. Closeted transphobes already filling r/Eminem

Edit: I was 13 when TES dropped. I know Slim Shady, grew up on it. My point is exactly that NOWADAYS I dont find it interesting at all, I probably enjoyed back then because I was a teenager, and Im hoping Em is going to Kill Slim on this album, critizing it, not doubling down on it.
Circle of life.
I literally laughed out loud when I heard it and sent it to my wife. So good.
What’d they do
But I bet he started bumping and grinding right after.
Nah man fuck you man. You made me spit my tea all over my screen. Come on man do this comedy on weekends
I’m saying he may not get the chance to register is all I’m saying…

Can't wait to listen when I can have the speakers on lol. Apparently he calls Black Eyed peas Kell's favorite group but calls them Black Guy Pees too 😄
Knowing Em, probably all 3 lol
I think you’re right lol didn’t even think of the foot fetish angle
Triple
No shit what’s wrong with these dude lol
Not Alike goes sooo hard and the ringer just being a fuck you to media journalists is amazing.
I think they are a girl scout.
Alright… Stepping stones is an absolute banger and gave me goosebumps. Can’t believe I missed this! Any other recs for modern Em?

Edit: ah I see a couple more similar recs above, will check those out!
read what i said again and come back when you understand it
No he sings that song that goes "sippin on gin and juice"
Tell me you are really young without telling me you're REALLY young 
Either that or completely uneducated musically.
Abracadabra was a number 1 in 10 countries and remained there for a few weeks. In practically every other country besides the Netherlands for some reason it was in the top 10. It's The Steve Miller Band who were also famous for The Joker? Made even more popular by the Levis 501s ad, with the guy coming into the packed office on the motorcycle? No? YouTube it 😁

Ah come on you've never heard of TSMB in your life, just tell the truth 😂 no judgement here 😉
SSLP: My Name Is, Bad Meets Evil

MMLP: Criminal, The Real Slim Shady

Eminem Show: Without Me, Business, Square Dance, My Dad’s Gone Crazy (are all pretty fun in their own way)

Encore: Rain Man, Big Weenie, Ass Like That, Just Lose It, One Shot Two Shot (TW: Mass shooting on this one… buyer beware)

Relapse/Refill: Bagpipes from Baghdad, Old Time’s Sake, Elevator

MTBMB: Tone Deaf, Discombobulated.

Curtain Call: FACK

Not all of these are as fun as others and I may have missed some along the way, but these are some fun songs in the various styles of Eminem over the years. He got a lot less fun around Recovery/MMLP2/Revival/Kamikaze, but his work on MTBMB is REALLY good, a lot of different approaches to rap with a few fun songs mixed throughout but a much more lighthearted approach overall on MTBMB compared to anything after Relapse: Refill.
Yea I see your point maybe because they hate when he does slim shady now but love when he does it with nostalgia added where MMLP 2 had extreme references to the MMLP and Houdini had the without me music video going on. Idk how big Houdini will end up being I doubt heavy radio play or anything but if he releases it without the music video then people would’ve hated on the song way more
I think the reason people weren’t a huge fan of MMLP 2 is they were expecting something very similar to MMLP. And it wasn’t. It was a lot of him apologizing for some of what he said on MMLP. 

Don’t get me wrong, bad guy and headlights are great songs, and it was extremely cool to see an artist be able to look back and say “hmmm, maybe I shouldn’t have said some of those things”. But it still just didn’t have the “I don’t give a fuck what anybody thinks” that MMLP had. And that attitude is largely what made him so huge back in the early 2000s.
Sorry was thinking of love the way you lie

No, you're soft because you care about the opinions of others, if you genuinely enjoy the song yourself why do you care about the negative opinions?

I know man it doesn’t help him, I honestly dont like blame him for it either, if he was 50 years old rapping about all the crazy shit he was rapping about in his 20s it’d just be strange. Those first 2 albums are some my fav OAT. However in that recovery period he did become extremely whack unfortunately
i would roast you back but you'll prolly go shoot up a school

i think old has the advantage of knowing exactly what to say to destroy young the most
This was my genuine reaction that night

Not Like Us is a lot of fun 🤫
Add in Drake’s The Heart Part 6. That’s the final song out from the beef.
No problem
Cole apologized and said he didn’t feel right dissing Kendrick
LMFAO I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

Honestly, that song was so bad I forgot Drake dropped it 😂
I don’t need you to do that, I heard enough Kendrick and Drake songs to say Kendrick is objectively better lol.
bangers or thought provoking songs?
Kendricks album are concept albums you listen to them front to back, tpab, gkmc are two of the greatest hiphop/rap albums ever. No questions asked

Drake doesnt have a rap album that scratches the top 500
Kendrick in one album alone has better music than drake has ever made.
Rich Spirit, Blow My High, Rigamortis, Backseat Freestyle, all of GKMC and TPAB. 

Also, Drake is a Nickelodeon rapper.
then idk what songs you listened to, but damn

try n95 (from mr morale), for free? interlude (tpab), the blacker the berry (tpab), good kid (gkmc) and xxx (damn). These are all very good tracks in my opinion
"Sing about me I'm dying of thirst".. more than that isn't needed to say .
Then you are lost.
If you want stuff that makes you think try "Sing About Me I'm Dying of Thirst," "How Much a Dollar Cost," "Mother I Sober," or "XXX"
It's because you lack critical thinking.
Ok so you are trolling lol
What?
You responded to the wrong person I believe
Horrible take imo. This is def what we need.
I mean the man does many different songs, this isn't the only tone of song he does or plans for this album? Look at every album he's done, even from revival onwards, and he's talked about serious issues. Not every song has to be serious, shit gets old quick. This is meant to be a Slim Shady type song, not a serious one. If you want that, why not check out some recent songs like Darkness where he raps about the las vegas shooter, or others where he talks about police brutality, racism, etc. 

This song is meant to generate hype for the new album, it's basically a trailer. Its a fun song meant as a throwback to all his old stuff and is meant to be more lighthearted while making jokes about the current state of things, not actually digging into the issues of it all. People would just be disappointed and annoyed about another song that digs into that shit when its meant to promote a new album. Nobody wants to only listen  to serious rapping about social issues, its just depressing and everyone gets enough of that shit in their every day lives. He's a rapper, not a politician, but you sound as if you expect him to solve world problems because of his success in music?
Naw definitely wrong. Sorry he’s not alt right enough for you
You mean his first 3 albums? Lol
It's just a song bro, enjoy the music.
The word "Cringe" is the worst of the century.

Everytime I hear somebody type that, gives me an image of a white fat boy using his computer navigating through 4chan and eating Doritos.

🤦🏽‍♂️
> Fuck everyone cancel me slim character is cringe

You mean, Eminem’s whole character? His I don’t give a fuck attitude has literally been a huge part of his personality for his entire career lmao
Did you watch the video? When I first listened, I thought it was ok and didn’t quite understand what he was getting at. The video pulled it all together and made it 100x better. I think it’s supposed to be fun.
Thats Slim Shady haha. You must be young.
H
Just listen to his albums man, I don't get the hate for the last 3, while they aren't like all bangers he has at least 6 songs on each that are lyrically and technically great with some story telling songs in-between.
What lyrics are clearly from 02
I hope that felt good for you.  maybe you can go find someone else's post to contribute to now! you're doing a great job.
The music released over 40 years ago, I wouldn't call a 40yo "really young" lol
I can’t name a “doodie” off MMLP or TES
I don't care about your opinion, sir. It would be a sad life if everyone enjoyed all the same shit.

It's just pathetic that the only way people say they don't like something is by being an asshole and talking shit. You can say you don't like something without being a negative, miserable asshole

Real. I think most everyone forgot about it lmfao.
Damn , should I give it a listen or naah?
Because he likes kids or it’s for kids, or both?
I can't ever see him as more than Jimmy. Every time I see him, I just wonder how Spinner is doing.
thats sounds like a trash song, dont me the author
Bro does NOT have the attention span for sing about me
what is critical thinking? if i dont like a rapper i must have been lacking something then?
took you long enough, im creating an experiment of how many downvotes will i get and mean comments, like an animal behaviour you know?
My bad man I haven’t had my coffee yet. thought you were the hater
Why? Please elaborate
What does alt right even mean?
Im explaining exactly why I didnt enjoy the music. The lyrics is part of the music. Hes not humming a wordless melody
I find y'all reaction to a contrary opinion ... cringe. Embarassing maybe a better word?

English is my 3rd language. Not everyone is from the US. We use this word because you use this word. Id express myself better in my language, but americans rarely know other languages, so it aint gon work.
Exactly. Probably why I rarely go back to his stuff. His albums are literally what I grew up to, this 97~2007 hiphop were my teen years. But Im realizing amongst DMX, Hov, Kast, 50, Kanye etc, his stuff is by far what I go back to the least. I probab enjoyed because it felt cool being such a rebel saying f everyone, cuz I was a teenager. But right now its not interesting to me. I get its a critique but I think its a weak one.

But if you fw it, more power to you. Im just saying, I really wished he had dropped something Id like, Im not hating
I did and it makes it a lot better and funnier. At face value its fun, but besides bringing me back to my teen years, it got the opposite effect on me, Slim shady isnt what Im interested right now and maybe it wasnt that interesting to begin with.

I'll wait for the album, I still have hope he may agree with me and is doind theatrical stuf but is eventually going to do a "kill slim shady" like Hov did "Kill JayZ" - I hope hes going to criticize slim, not double down on it.
I made an edit just for you sir / ma'am.
ITS ALL ABOUT THE GAME
The random adlibs where he sounds way younger might be
Wow calm tf down! You don't like being told you're young? That sux. You gotta be if you don't know that this and "The Joker" were two of the biggest hits that the OG band who produced that track was where he took the hook from?  You are so easily offended! Better not listen to the new album so 🤷🏾‍♂️
Most OG Eminem fans are in there 40s now. That song sampled was released in 1982. Eminem would have grown up hearing that song played incessantly on the radio. It was "big" at the time it was out in 1982. As was The Joker. Are you old enough to remember that Levi's ad where the guy drives our if the elevator and into the office to pick up his girlfriend?

I wouldn't call 40 really old ( 🎶 *"you're a monster!"*)
If you think 40 is old well 🎶 *"I'd rather be 80yr old me that 20yr old you"*

I'm 44. Houdini made a hell of a lot of us feel half our ages again 😂 I must have watched it at least 20 times the day it came out. The nostalgia has me grinning ear to ear remembering the Without Me video and seeing all the parallels and Easter eggs. It was dopamine hit after dopamine hit 😁 

In conclusion, he's **definitely** a magician 🤣🪄✨🐰
Drips is absolute cheeks and ruins the “no skips” nature of TES after the first listen imo. 

Otherwise TES may be the most perfect album he has.
Except his golden trio (TES has Drips which is bad, and MMLP has Amityville which is ruined by Bizzare), and let's add Relapse to the mix, the only really bad thing of that project was the accents.

Except his golden trio, the rest of his discography oscillate between high highs and low lows (or in the case of Revival, entirely low low) and Relapse is underrated
The story of two star-crossed brain cells forbidden to ever make a connection.
That's pretty dumb but good luck dude, I hope you find someone to pay attention to you in real life someday! I doubt it, but the world is full of miracles!
We need funny stuff? And its not just funny, amazing bars too.
Pretending not to know what it is is pretty cringe
Cringe
Maybe but they can easily use tools to change his voice too even then it’s not lyrics from 02 being used lol
I'm not American, even if I was old enough, I wouldn't even know what's a Levi lol
Damn, take it easy. Don't have to kill him
yeah but look at how it started with my genuine post as a question and they immediately start attacking you, like i really dont care about kendrick, im listening to Eminem, but yeah you are right, who cares anyway?
Funny stuff? You want funny man go watch a comedy special. I’d rather hear some crazy concepts from him, like real music that talks about real stuff. The bars aren’t amazing because they talking about nothing.
No I’m serious?
Ok that explains a lot. 
We used to have ads for Levi's jeans and Diet Pepsi in the 90s that many were all about the women being thirsty (apt for Diet Coke lol) but Levi's had the same approach, pop a James Dean lookalike in the ad, make him so something super "sexy" with a killer back track in this case the Steve Miller Band song "The Joker" and that's how you remembered the product before the days of the internet.
The addition of Abracadabra in Houdini is an unforgettable hook just as it was when it was first released by the SMB.
Kill him? He didn't even bleed him yet.
I mean it's the Internet and on top of that it's reddit lol
If it’s not for you, cool. Not sure why you’re so surprised people love it when this was classic Em and music like this is what got him famous to begin with.
This is just one song. We dont need doom and gloom all the time. Dont listen to it, rest of us fucking love it. Should every movie be about some real stuff? No funny comedies? No awesome balls to the wall action movies? The fuck u on about brother.

Steaua and Red Star were the last great upsetters
The “state project” moniker people are throwing at Red Star is a bit ridicoulous. They don’t understand and haven’t been around to watch Yugoslavia football. No, the best Yugoslav talents didn’t all automatically go to Red Star. No they weren’t that financially dominant in comparison to the other big 4. For example Dinamo beat them to the signing of Haris Škoro, the hottest player in the leauge a couple of years before the CL. The other clubs (Hajduk and Partizan, Velež mainly) also had major connections in the state.

It is wrong to see the corruption in the Yugoslav league as a state thing. It was mostly a battle between corrupt football officials trying to make their clubs better, they were absolutely free to compete against each other. The only true Yugoslav state football projects were Hajduk in the 40s, maybe Partizan in the 50s and the Yugoslav national team in the 50s. 

The other great teams and generations (Partizan in the 60s, Dinamo in the late 60s, Hajduk in the 70s, Zvezda in the late 80s and early 90s) were a product of excellent academies, good recruitment from smaller Yugoslav clubs and some innovative coaching. Any of those generations probably should have achieved the results Zvezda have.

Yes, there were definite corrupt incidents (Dinamo was on the end of most of it, how things change). But it wasn’t all Red Star, not even close to it. For example, we lost the title because of administrative reasons to fucking Hajduk.

Very different situation than it is now in Serbia.

I can’t believe I wrote three paragraphs in the defense of Red Star but what can you do.
It's not all in the money. Here we have Manchester United as an example, a rich club that has no idea how to play football.
I swear the next year the European Cup was won by a team that had a title stripped off them for paying their opponents to lose in that same year?
Ahhh, the 90s,  when match fixing was rife.   Two years later, Marseille were involved in a match fixing scandal.  [They even tried to fix the 1991 final](https://www.google.com/search?q=red+star+belgrade+1991+corruption&client=ms-android-samsung-ga-rev1&sca_esv=590380016&ei=GAB6ZczzEqTGhbIPqd6iqAc&oq=red+star+belgrade+1991+corruption&gs_lp=EhNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwIiFyZWQgc3RhciBiZWxncmFkZSAxOTkxIGNvcnJ1cHRpb24yBRAhGKABSK0eUNwKWKkccAF4AJABAJgBvgKgAZYPqgEIMC4xMS4wLjG4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgoQABhHGNYEGLADwgITEC4YgAQYigUYQxjIAxiwA9gBAcICCxAAGIAEGIoFGJECwgIFEAAYgATCAgUQLhiABMICBhAAGBYYHsICCxAAGIAEGIoFGIYDwgIIECEYFhgeGB3CAgQQIRgVwgIHECEYoAEYCuIDBBgAIEGIBgGQBgq6BgQIARgI&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp)
The 80s/90s had their own ManCity with Milan and Berlusconi.
That Red Star team was some team. 

As an outsider the comments from those in Serbia/former Yugoslavia here are really interesting - I’m learning quite a lot about this era from the various fans viewpoints.
The last European Champion coming from a smaller league bar Mourinho's Porto. I don't see a team outside the Top 5 leagues winning the CL ever again, with the excepction of an insane run by a Portuguese or Dutch team.
It was always about money
Rich coming from a club that's state sponsored for its entire history.

Red Star Belgrade and Partizan Belgrade are called 'Tito's Twins' for a reason.
While they are government backed and have been pulled out by shit. Mafia club, should not say anything.
Yes, Red Star did have substantial financial backing back in the day. However, it simply pales in comparison to current day City, PSG, Chelsea, etc. It simply is not in the same league really.

Also, as other people have stated, Red Star had only Yugoslav players, with the notable asterisk being Belodedici, who had defected from his native country of Romania because of the Ceauşescu regime.
Comment section full of envious croats thats a yikes from me bro.
Outrageous comment section. We are seeing the most recent bought club by out-of-continent owners and the club with the most financial backing even with PSG in existence. They bought 2 100 million players in back to back years and have bought players for over 200 million euros in back to back seasons.

If city hadn’t won last year CL? 100% they would buy another 100 mill player until they did.

City is effectively using money glitch in football.
Football has always been about money.
It's always been about money. It will always be about money.

The good old days
So many people here talking out of their ass without knowing anything. Oh Red Star is state owned so it must be sportwashing or comparing that to City hahahaha gtfo, you don’t understand anything
 It was always about money, you just had it back then
Red Star is one of Europe’s great clubs
sorry but red star are the last club to be talking about this. they get favoured in the Serbian League and they're the government's favorite pet
RESPECT
People on this sub really like to be negative and complain about everything. The value of this club is less than what City and other teams have spent on single players and yet they won a European trophy potentially before a lot of these teams will ever win one. Is that not something to be proud of?
Read: We play shit football now, so we'll talk about past.
I wish we could go to 3 to 5 foreigners in a team again, see what happens than
Plastic dickriders trying extra hard on the mental gymnastics in this thread
Full Respect to Red Star
I'm just here to read the English excuses, lectures and finger pointing at XYZ 🦜
now, if you're a belgrade fan, football is about losing to youth academy prospects.
This is truly beautiful in more ways than one. Fuck Manchester City and their bullshit "money rules everything" approach. That's why they have no true die-hard fans. It's a plastic club. Fuck you.
Chelsea and manu disprove this point.
Conceding 2 goals to our academy players LOL
Btw,top boys leading that curve are all just about employed  by team and drawing salary.
Brought to you by - one of the largest crime organizations in Europe.
This is beautiful, cannot wait to Cheat FC sent oblivion when they get done for those 115 charges and finally sending justice from their systematic cheating.
Just the other day some guy here told me that City wasn't a big club just because of the money. Couple of comments after he tells me I am wrong and that he knows better because he is a fan of City for the last 10 years...

I found it suspicious, but he didn't understood why.
apparenty Red Star's fanbase has the average world view of a teenager
It's worth mentioning that Red Star's main sponsor now is Gazprom ..
when it was about blood and broken bones?
Cope
That Red Stat side absolutely slapped us in Japan

"When football wasnt about money and instead was about corrupt authoritarians forcing the best players in the country to play in the same team and workers had little to zero rights to move to other team"

Lol. Lmao, even.
Ah, our dear Red Star. They were basically what Bayern Munich are today in Bundesliga and took pretty much all the best players in the league. On top of that, they were the state project. Please, on behalf of everyone in Balkans, shut the fuck up.
Didn’t they play Marseille in the final which was owned by the extremely corrupt Adidas owner at the time Bernard Tapie
.... long as we don't talk about what they were up to in 1998 /
Comrades we stand with you
Wiser words were never spoken
Lmao no one gives a fuck about these banners.
How bold and original of them. I almost forgot money was invented in 2008.
All this banner shows is how susceptible these tifoz are to propaganda. 

Not just about what everyone else is saying about money corruption existing even back in 1991, but even the multiple flags and banners in the stands that are still perpetuating the colonialistic genocidal mentality.
World champion of what, the United States
They say you can’t hear a picture but I can definitely hear this one and what I’m hearing is “Ubij Šiptara”.
world champion of what?
if you broke, sleep.
Thier coach 
 Barck bacher broke 2 world recored
Great banner.  I look fondly on those days, but I live in the now and that is how shit goes.
The Barcelona of Serbia lol.

Fair play they, great team to watch
Ah, the 1990s! The time when european teams would fight for their lives to win the UCL, only to have to do it all over again vs a South-American team for the Intercontinental.

That was a magical time.
well, back then it was yugoslavia, got a plethora of players from all over the balkans.. i mean.. yeah
Well said
Why is r/soccer so defensive of man city?
And Red Star was one of the worst at that
Didn't marseille get caught by taking steroids when they won the champions league
Ironic, considering your flair.
Yeah, I loved that in the 90's football wasn't about money at all, except for that time a belgian club refused to let their former player to play for a french 2nd division club without getting any money and subsequently ended up creating what we call modern football
I'll trust you, you're an expert.

Well yeah the competition for those bribes was fierce, nowadays only nation states can afford to buy referees
This is coming from a Marseille fan too. They were the masters of this for a while
BoJack FootballMan
It's like these guys have no idea wiki exists and everyone can easily google the fact the government developed a plan and gave significant financial backing to the club to achieve european success in the period before their title. Oh on top of the fact they have a state build 100k stadium in the 60's, one of the biggest in europe, that was holding 60-65k at the time after regulations and seating was added to terracing.

But yeah not ''only'' money helped them, they also brought all the best talents in Yugoslavia, apart from those that would not leave their biggest rivals for an absurd amount of money to join them.
Of course, you need money to buy a football.
Sure, but it's disingenuous to compare what is happening in the game nowadays just because money is involved. Of course clubs need to earn money to succeed and grow, nobody with two brain cells can argue otherwise, but having billionaires buy teams and leagues to sportswash and play irl FM hasn't always been a part of football- it is something we should actively fight against.
No, only since its professionalisation.
Not always, but once the salary cap was removed and the rules around distribution of money were changed it very quickly became about money.
You'd be surprised by the number of OM fans who think we didn't need to throw money like PSG does today. We taught them this trick because Tapie knew money was the only way to reach UCL glory and bring the best players. Then, Aulas bought OL and Canal+ bought PSG.

Before QSI, Canal+ was the owner of PSG and used a lot of money to attract great players. They even tried R9 at some point.

You forgot football was always about money... but also politics. The latter allowed Real Madrid to have its first big dynasty.
Money and politics have ruled sports since before Mussolini's Italy
Exactly.
Strongest financial backing in Yugoslavia ≠ richest team in the Europe.
It's still a great story. Everything was falling apart around the club at that time.
What a load of fucking bullshit
1991, when football was pure and not championships were not decided by who had the most money, but instead by who had the deepest politburo connections
What are talking about?
Jajajajaja.


Meanwhile City has 133 strikes and Qatari owners. But yeah make it about Yugoslav influence in their own then-nation.
back when football wasn't about money... it was about political propaganda 😌
At least it wasn’t another country backing your team like in city’s case
And wasn't the fan base virulently fascist by this point too? With future war criminal Arkan leading their ultras.
They also kidnapped players, and didn’t let them go before they signed for red star haha. My PE teacher played for them, he told us that. He also played against Maradona which was cool
What about Porto in 2004 ? Real Madrid had the galaticos and United had a massive team but Porto still won
Red Star were World champions while Steaua were only European champions. Back then Intercontinental Cup meant something because European clubs didn't buy all South American talent yet.
>I can’t believe I wrote three paragraphs in the defense of Red Star but what can you do.

You're uncharacteristically objective football fan.
> No, the best Yugoslav talents didn’t all automatically go to Red Star.

I don't know about automatically, but that year Red Star had Jugovic, Pancev, Prosinecki, Mihajlovic and Savicevic, aka some of the finest football players I have ever seen. I consider them all world class (Savicevic more than the others), but I think they qualify at least as "best Yugoslav talents".

The rest of your points stand.

And the saddest thing is that teams like these won't be possible anymore because Bosman killed all the fun.
How the hell did Velež have state connections, they were a classic overachiever club liked by the masses, they got way less support than the Sarajevo duo, despite them being really good in the 80s.
Thanks for stating the obvious. ❤️
>For example, we lost the title because of administrative reasons to fucking Hajduk.

To je ono neki kurac s Rijekom bil jelda? Zvoni mi al nemrem se sjetit kaj se točno dešavalo
>I can’t believe I wrote three paragraphs in defense of Red Star but what can you do

“It was okay when my club did it, but it is wrong when other clubs do it.”
I did watch and I did go to Maksimir and I do remember the officiating at away games in Sarajevo, Tuzla, Novi Sad, Skopje. That’s where the state machine took its toll. On not given penalties. On shady offsides. On letting Dinamo players get smashed off the ball. That’s where the points are shaved and stolen. Belgrade dominated Yugoslavia and their teams received the royal treatment wherever possible.
Any other team with that level of mismangement would be relegated and risking bankruptcy. Their richness is exactly was denying them that risk. They simply can afford to always stay afloat
But at least United aren't breaking any rules.
Came here to enjoy some city bashing but instead catching strays just for being shite. We know we are shite thank you.
Are they really that rich? Thought they had huge levels of debt?  
  
in before some one says yeah but Sevco etc
That was 2 years later. And that title wasn't stripped.

The next final was actually Sampdoria-Barca.
How did their 1993 champions league title not get removed? (Same as Juve for doping)
Yeah, we matched-fixed all the way to the final victory. 🏆 
I guess you didn't fixed it in 2006...
I feel Ajax or PSV could do it under a great academy generation, like in 88 or 95.
Ah yes the mighty state of Yugoslavia in 1991. So rich and stable.
Everything was state owned back in the communism. Private ownership or independent from state control institutions were not allowed.

So the clubs had patronages like a lokal factory or army in this case. Players usually were employed by the patron but didn’t actually have to go to work.
Sure, but their budgets are still some of the smallest in every european competition they qualify for. Yugoslavia was a communist country, all the teams were state owned, Partizan and Zvezda were never privatized, which is actually a crutch because Serbia cannot afford to give them astronomical budget while some other states or billionaire owners could.
Ok Man United
At least we are sponsored by our own state.
Don't know which club you are talking about. Red star or Dinamo?
Ironic af coming from a Dinamo fan whose club was treated by the Croatian government the same way Zvezda was by the Yugoslav ( Serbian ) government
After 1991 Obilic FK assumed that role, was led by war criminal Arkan and they became the one who were backed by govt and threatened refs, bribed etc. They were mafia club as well. Red Stars and Partizan reassumed it later again.
At least we won it.
[deleted]
Steaua București also won it in 86' only fielding Romanian players. Same as Red Star, Steaua was also heavily favored by the regime and always got the best players.
>Red Star had only Yugoslav players

As if that's a bad thing? Yugoslavia would be incredible today.
haha only one dared to share the actual truth, but the rest - as expected.
The numbers change but it aways been about money in some way. I would prefer it wasn't like that but every big club now had some monetary advantage to get ahead in the first place.

It's just old money complaining about new money.
We aren’t even the most recent. Also we won the CL and still bought a 100m player, stay mad
I love the smell of jealousy in the evening. Thank you!
The point is it's gotten SOO much worse.
…and now it’s putin’s money
No Balkan country would ever like to go back to the 90s
Live multiple wars so some twat on reddit can say shit like this
Because they were the only country to benefit from the Yugo era.
…fuck putin fuck Gasprom
0 foreign players tho. OM on the other hand.
The Champion of Greece pays 20-40m for players each year (both buying and maintaining). A relegation candidate in England can easily spend over 100m!

Money play football now more than ever, that's why the past 10 years CL and to some extent the lower ones are won by the rich guys.
Funny how every club outside the top 4 + PSG leagues plays like shit nowadays. Maybe it's not a skill issue?
That’s a Reddit ass take
Tbf that final was god awful. One of my first live games as a kid, and it was so shit I stopped watching football for a while.
Who probably still earn more than most of their players
Everyone is conceding goals to your academy players lmao. You're a vacuum cleaner sucking up all the best talent. Hard to find next gen players that haven't been at City at some point
*employed by the club and the government (Vucic)
Where would a 1150 point reduction land them ?
man the entirety of europe still gets gas from russia and like azerbaijan which is a straight up a genocidal regime that committed ethnic cleansing mere months ago, what is the point of this endless moral grandstanding
Sponsorship worth 5M euros a year. A sum that is in today's football as relevant as your point.
BAHAHAAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAZ
In Yugoslav case, that was really not true. You can say a lot of shit about Yugoslav communist, but they did not force players to play for clubs they did not want or prevented them to move to other club (in or outside Yugoslavia).
I think they just had to wait until a certain age before they can go play for foreign clubs. When you look at the amount of talent they had and limited amounts of funds compared to Western Europe- it was a good rule to have. If you wanted to win.
Please inform the class which clubs were privately owned in that league as well just so they have a good understanding.
What was that? Genuine question
Not really since they were backed financially lol
Just like your players and coach don't give about your team
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Intercontinental_Cup
And its amazing, but I can hear a load of shite after reading your comment.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Intercontinental_Cup
Don't you mean one of the best? Unless sthey didn't buy any wins.
What the fuck are you on about, they had a Academy that got players from all over the former Yugoslavia. The Red Star team of 1991 was full of Yugoslavian players.
"Our roided up guy beat your roided up guy."
What are you about?
I think that was Juve, Marseille bribed opposing players
Such amateurs, nowadays everybody takes them and nobody gets caught
Pretty sure it's ironic. To imply its funny about them to complain. 

Otherwise my man has just completed the biggest *whoosh* that even he could not foresee.
Mate
That's the joke mate
Didn't Arsenal literally pay money to remain/stay/go into League one years ago in something like the early 1900s? lol
[And on the field](https://youtu.be/HkQoBL6-9oE?si=EaNJx167k7wQbCxt)
Out of curiosity, how was Poljud built?  And Maksimir?
Honestly the shit they've been pulling under Vučić is worse than anything that happened back then. Not that we're saints but it's clear to all who the dictator supports.
Sure but they only had yugoslovenian players. Their best player left a year prior.

 Ironic that you are a Hajduk fan as well.
Funny Red Stars never had Albanian players. All others had. Even Partizan. Fadil Vokrri most notable one. Btw todays Balkan football is horrific tbh.
Why didn't you win it then?
Rich ppl owning clubs and goverments giving them preferential treatment has allways been part of any sport.


There were tons of scandals everywhere, even germany had the bundesliga scandal, where like 2 dozen players and officials were banned and 2 clubs demoted. The state of bavaria helped Bayern to avoid taxes and salaried some of their players, when it became public, they swept it under the rug and fined them peanuts. Kurt Beck and the Fritz-Walter Stadion desasterclass happend less then 20 years ago.


And this is just the tame shit, we literally had dictators favoring and financing teams for decades in europe, with Ceausescu bankrolling Steua as the most famous example...


I agree, that sportwashing is a major concern and that it is becoming increasingly harder for clubs to break into the elite clubs in europe without major financial backing, but money allways dominated football, if you are not sure about that, just take a look where the biggest clubs of each country comes from and then compare that to the industrial centers of the past century, you might see an overlap...
>Exactly

Since you seem to know about this, how comparable was Red Star's financial backings compared to the elite European teams of the time?

Edit: Getting crickets....🦗
Daje
No, not exactly at all.
Who is the richest team, Emir of Abu Dhabi FC, Sheikh of Qatar FC or Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia FC?

I guess with Messi and Neymar wages off the books Qatar FC is probably no longer the one spending the most.
So it‘s ok to buy domestic championships, just not international cups?!
They didn't have to be the richest team in Europe because Yugoslavian talent cost peanuts due to the prohibition of transfers to foreign clubs until age 28. Some players could leave at 25-26 y/o with a special permission, but by that point they were already at one of the big 4 for a couple of seasons.
Well City was utter shite at times as well, doesn’t make it better
Next they’ll say Dinamo was Croatia’s president’s pet project in the 90s smh
Yeah it's utter bullshit. It's the old case of someone coming into a thread early and speaking as if they know what they are talking about, then a bunch of clueless people will upvote it. Then it's at the top and the first thing you see in the thread so it must be true right? Upvote!

Some classic reddit in action.
*UAE owners
> But yeah make it about Yugoslav influence in their own then-nation.

from the perspective of competition, that would be far more inequitable for their domestic league
So if the UK government was backing City that would be better?
“My sportswashing is better than your sportswashing”
No
But you look back and realise that the special one just cooked too good in the signings and had foud very good (maybe even world class) talent for very cheap, it was genuinely an upset but I think less so than the others (still massive)
Man, we were 2 minutes away from beating Pep's Barca. That would have been a legendary title.
I mean steaua got robbed big time in the world championship final in Tokyo :/ they had a perfectly valid goal by Belodedici that wasn't given by the refs.
honestly I never took it seriously because it was just one game and the timing was usually off.
The world champion of 2 continents, similar to American world champions of USA
Im still in shock.

I saw the Dinamo flair and thought "here we go again..."
Trust me, there were at least 20 players/talents in the league who could have at least fought for the place in the Red Star first eleven and some were just better than the Red Star players in their positions. Boban, Šuker, Panadić and Ladić for Dinamo; Mijatović, Jokanović, Omerović, Stanojković, Vujačić for Partizan; Bokšić, Jarni, Štimac, Bilić for Hajduk, Barbarez and Kodro from Velež; Vlaović from Osijek; Pantić from Olimpija; Brnović and Drobnjak from Budućnost; Stanić from Željo; Zahović, Ivić and Govedarica from Proleter; Drulović, Mirković and Đorović from Rad and a ton of players I can’t remember right now.

And the only reason Prosinečki and Mihajlović were in Red Star in the first place is because Dinamo (Miroslav Blažević) didn’t think they were good enough, they were both at the club on trial ready to sign their contracts. What could have been…

Anyway only Prosinečki and Savićević were that much better than their peers at the time. I think Boban had the best career of any midfielder on the list, while Šuker, Mijatović and Bokšić were all better players than Pančev and I stand by that. Jarni, Bilić and Štimac were better defenders than anybody bar Belodedici on the Red Star team. Ladić and Omerović were better keepers than Stojanović.

Red Star had the best team but the other teams also had serious quality. Also, Red Star assembled the team not by some state intervention but by Dinamo’s incompetence, good scouting and a bit of luck.
Red star stacked the team for decades.
They were the only club alongside Hajduk that was allowed to keep their prewar name and organization while the other Mostar clubs were banned. That’s what I was going for, definitely not on the level of the others but they still profited from that.
Je, izgubili od Rijeke, ali su oni imali igrača koji navodno nije smio igrat jer nije odslužio suspenziju. Dinamo se žalio i Komisija je prvo dala bodove Dinamu, da bi ih usred sezone Savez maknuo. Mi smo se žalili, cijela trakavica bila ali na kraju je titula ostala u Splitu.

https://gnkdinamo.hr/hr/vijesti/clanak/proslo-je-40-godina-od-dinamovog-nepriznatog-naslova-prvaka-za-1979
Can’t argue with the terrible standard of officiating in Yugoslavia but I wouldn’t call it only a Belgrade problem. Everyone knew every team had their referees and the away records of even the best teams were always below expected. It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary for a midtable team to have 10 or 11 wins at home and none away.

I mean, one of the biggest scandals in Yugoslav football was when inspectors found paper evidence that Maribor had a secret fund to bribe referees with trips to Austria and Italy, skiing trips, dinners and so on. And that was the stereotipically “civilized” Slovenes.

Of course Dinamo often got the short stick and a lot of decisions didn’t go our way both on and off the field (how our late 60s team doesn’t have a title is a first class mystery) but that’s how everything went back in those days. We were definitely in the worst position of the big 4 and I am also frustrated by that.
This is it, they're basically insulated from any failure (for a short time at least). They're too big to fail.
so much for the „fairness“ that is threatened by evil Man City

Nah they to busy boxing women
Sorry, I meant league title! The point very much still stands, thanks for the clarification though.
I thought Marseille lost their CL title. They were prevented from playing the Intercontinental Cup and AC Milan took their place.
Honestly, I don't know. But compared to other teams (Manchester City), we got punished well enough to have fallen from grace. We were stripped from the Ligue1 title, not allowed to play the SuperCup and Interncontinental Cup, not allowed to play the next season UCL (Monaco went to the semis). We even got relegated at the end of 1993-94.

The following season, we won the second division title but weren't allowed to be promoted. The season after that, we finished second and this time, the promotion was valid. In 1996, the punishment was unofficially over and we could return to business. So, I guess our debt to society has been paid and I have no shame related to that. 

Unlike some other teams who cheated in many league games in a season and were initially disqualified from UCL. For some reason, they were allowed back... and became champions. I'm referring to the 2006-07 AC Milan who, the previous season, was involved in the Calciopoli. Had Milan not cheated, they wouldn't have gotten a UCL spot legally and to this day, no punishment. I guess Berlusconi knew the right dicks to suck to avoid Milan AC to be disqualified. 

To be honest, Tapie was hated by higher ups in France and were waiting for the first mistake to kill his career. I think it helped a lot for what happened. But I'm glad it happened because at least, we paid our debt and there's no doubt. I can proudly say "yeah but we got punished and now, we're clean".
Definitely Ajax and PSV. And Steaua.
Monaco with Mbappe and Bernardo seemed plausible. Ajax looked great beating Real Madrid only to lose to Tottenham and Lucas in crushing fashion. Those are quite recent. It’s unlikely in any given year, but I think we could see a team like those win still. The cup format lends itself to that.
So you’re saying there’s a chance for Luuk black magic
1991 Yugoslavia vs. 21st century Qatar and Saudi Arabia? What's even the difference? Me smart redditor and very nuanced.
That's so wrong lol. Yugoslavia wasn't a straight up communist country like USSR was. It was socialist and they had a dictator (after he died, the country was in so much debt and others were fighting for the top, which was the reason the country broke up in the end), but they were playing both sides (US and USSR) and those footballers in the 90s still made a lot more money than the rest (they weren't like factory workers or common working people lol). There was only a rule they couldn't leave a Yugoslavia club until they were 28 or older I believe, but pretty much everything else was normal.
Both haha
I was in Split last summer and loved the connection the city has with the team. What is exactly the deal with the hate towards Dinamo? (not just the rivalry but if I’m not mistaken it also involves politics/government)

I remember a taxi driver who was crazy about football but not caring about Croatian NT/Luka Modric as well.
Kmečavci
It’s not ironic considering Dinamo fans and BBB were/are the strongest opponents of both Tuđman and Mamić. Our club was hijacked twice, first as a megalomaniac nationalist state project and when we finally got rid of those guys we were turned into a criminal’s piggy bank who irreversibly changed the club for the worse in a million ways.

Dinamo fans wanted none of that shit and we also were the victims here.
Changed our name yes
Fun fact Arkan originally wanted to buy Zvezda
You seem to be correct. However, that brings us the the original point of my post: football today is dominated by big money, much more than before. The rift between rich clubs and everybody else is just gaping.

Off topic here, but I would be up for this rule to be reinstated. It levels the playing field a bit, I think.
Yes, the best players *from Romania*. Big clubs today hoard the best players from the entire world. When a football club is only a fun side gig for it's extremely wealthy owners, some of the magic is inevitably lost.
Yeah, imagine if some team today could field all the best Romanian players, they would blow Man City and Real Madeid away
For me, it's the part of the charm actually.

If anyone watched Kusturica's documentary about Maradona, at one point, Maradona compared scoring his (in)famous "The hand of God" goal against England to "pickpocketing an Englishman's wallet". There is quite a bit of shared sentiment here as well.

A lot of people in Yugoslavia saw the winning of the Champions League as a victory of an entire nation, which was classified as an outsider in just about everything. Especially considering everything else was going sideways in the 90's. The cultural impact of Red Star's victory cannot be overstated.
Literally noone cares or gives you any credit outside of bandwagoners

You are just a small club-turned-plastic toy for some slave owners
Sure brate
Your entire history is a decade!

Unrelated, but what's your club flair? I can't recognise the badge
Are you actually saying Serbia benefited from Yugoslavia???
Yugoslavia hurt us the most of all involved.
I agree with you, fuck Putin, fuck Gasprom. Fuck Red Star and fuck Vucic. But most conversation in here are absolute nonsense, that’s why I’m trying to add some context. 

It’s not like Gasprom, or Serbia is giving them budget of $100s of millions, their budget is less than Haaland’s salary. Even in 1991, I’m 100% sure their budget was less than Marseille, Milan, Bayern, Barca and any other western European team.
…once again: FUCK putin FUCK gasprom, fuck your all putin’s bootlickers, vote me down you fucking commies
…only on stupid Reddit two comments with saying the same thing one can be downvoted and the other one upvoted 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[deleted]
Yeah because shit players never earn more than good players?
Who said anything about that, I'd just like them out of the PL and EFL. PL tiles voided, no winners those years to highlight the years they cheated to win titles, hopefully UEFA strip them of that tainted CL win as well.
Europe good
Wasn’t “just” about money
Of course I was just referring to that much memed statement from Noah Lyles re the term world champions in basketball. It applies a bit much more for Soccer/football
> The Red Star team of 1991 was full of Yugoslavian players.

A Romanian too
Don't act like Red Star did not have preferential treatment by the regime at the time. Just look at Maksimir riots
Marseille bribing their way to winning the Champions League. Paying CSKA Moscow players in the group stage.
Yeah don’t be disrespect Juve like this, they never got caught!
I thought they didn't bribe their opponents in the European Cup, instead they bribed their opponents in Ligue 1 so they could win easily and rest players for the knockout games ... Or at least that is what they claimed and hence why I believe they were stripped on their Ligue 1 title but not their European one.
Wenger was Monaco coach when Marseille won those titles and Monaco were their big rivals. I'm not sure if he's ever spoken about it but that episode definitely cost him a couple of titles
Marseille doping scandal rocks Milan  
Milan are ready to demand the 1993 Champions League trophy after a Marseille star claimed the team was on drugs for the Final.  
The Rossoneri lost the match in Munich 1-0 to a goal from Basil Boli, as their opponents became the first French team ever to lift the trophy. It was a shock, as Fabio Capello’s side had a 100 per cent record until that point with 10 consecutive victories.  
Now former Marseille midfielder Jean-Jacques Edelie has revealed in his autobiography that the game was not all it seemed to be.  
“The only time I agreed to take a doping product was the 1993 Champions League Final,” he confessed in the book that will come out on March 1.  
“In all the clubs I played in, I saw some doping going on, except for Bastia, but this was the only time I accepted. We all took a series of injections and I felt different during the game, as my physique responded differently under strain. The only player who refused to take part was Rudi Voller.”  
The news is a particular shock to Milan, as among the Marseille stars were future Serie A heroes Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly.  
It’s not the first time that the French club has been embroiled in controversy, as it emerged they had fixed their title-clinching League game against ASOA Valence-Clime so that they could concentrate on the European Final. The side was stripped of Le Championnat, relegated and barred from defending this trophy.  
Milan have asked their lawyers to look into the situation and many of the players who lost that day are hoping to be awarded the title with a 13-year delay.  
“I am shocked and find this news disturbing,” Daniele Massaro told the Corriere dello Sport. “If these allegations are proved, then it would be right to take the trophy away from Marseille and return it to Milan. The whole thing is simply incredible.”  
Roberto Donadoni, who is now Coach of Serie A side Livorno, aimed his scorn at the club hierarchy.  
“I don’t know what the future of that cup holds, but one thing is certain: if it's proved that all the players were on something, then the directors must’ve had a hand in it. I remain stunned by the fact that professionals in this sport can go to any lengths in order to win.”  
Vice-President Adriano Galliani called for UEFA to take action over these allegations.  
“Our lawyer is looking into the situation and we believe that UEFA cannot help but begin an inquest when confronted with these statements. Of course, if Marseille really were on drugs against us that night, then I think it’s right for the trophy to be assigned to Milan. We’ll wait and see what happens.”
Oh OK am probably mixing them up after watching all of them football icebergs by vizeh
Hey those accusations are unfounded buddy!
Partially yes, partially because everyone hates Tottenham. We got voted into Division 1 after WW1. Spurs were ahead of us in the league, but didn't get voted in. There are rumours of bribery, but equally everyone hates Spurs.
Poljud was built for Mediterranean games in 1979, and Maksimir is there since HAŠK days IIRC with upgrades ofcorse.
it's the classic daily average person from the balkans hypocrisy at show
It's not about support anymore, he turned it into his own private mafia business front
Yugoslavia would easily be one of the best teams in the world if it still existed today.
Yugoslavia was huge though. I dont know the answer to this, but how many current countries would have been represented in their starting XI? Of the players I know of from their future careers, I can think of Croatia, Serbia, and Macedonia
Obviously it's not the same as Abu Dhabi/Qatar/Saudi Arabia but the financial support they had was tenfold than any other club in the region could remotely benefit from.

Serbs bad!!! kme kme
I'm not saying any of that isn't true, but the scale of investment that is currently changing the football landscape across Europe is a new development that is actively ruining much of the sport's culture and competition that has been developed over centuries. Man City, Chelsea, and PSG have dropped over 1.5 *billion* since being bought, there is no way that Ceaușescu spent anywhere close to that propping up his favorite team. I'm not trying to make light of how these corruption cases are, but the fact remains that literal fortunes are being pumped into football, companies are making teams, and holding companies like the City Football Group are buying up teams and ruining leagues. 

I'm not sure what your last point is? Wealthy population centers with the resources to do things that attract people to go there is just the driving force behind urbanization? Teams from London, Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, Munich, Hamburg, and the Ruhr did well because they had a huge pool of players to pick from before football became much more globalized, allowing them to establish themselves over decades, that's just a fact. Nowadays, however, with enough money from the Gulf you can turn any small club into a powerhouse in a few years.
Exactly.
are we talking about strictly above board payments, or those passed under the table too?
Hahahaha man come on, do you apply that logic to every league? Majority of leagues are dominated by 2-4 teams who are more rich than everybody and win all the time. No football league is about parity unfortunately. I’m not saying that’s okay, it’s just how it is. 

What I am trying to say with my previous comment was, Red Star being state-owned didn’t give them advantage to win CL because they weren’t remotely richest team, but they still won, because they built internally with domestic talent.
The club was falling apart at the time they won it. They are still cunts don't get me wrong but their story that year was great
did Scotland declare independence last year starting a multifaction war in the uk ?
Stevan Stojanović - Home grown

Vladimir Jugović - Home grown

Slobodan Marović - Home grown

Refik Šabanadžović - brought in from Željo

Miodrag Belodedić - fled to Yugoslavia from Romania

Ilija Najdoski - brought in from Vardar

Robert Prosinečki - Signed after a trial

Siniša Mihajlović - Record signing DM1 million

Darko Pančev - Brought from Vardar

Dejan Savićević - Brought in from Budućnost

Dragiša Binić - Signed after a failed stint abroad

Compare this 1991 team to City's team that won CL last year. Also Partizan had by far the strongest government backing in Yugoslavia.
Same but different
Yeah
Definitely
Yugoslavia teams were owned by state, it has nothing to do with sportswashing ahahah all the teams were funded by the state, Red Star did get the strongest backing. You can say the same though about La Liga giving the most money to Barca and Madrid.
What does Red Star have to do with sportswashing?
Where Crvena Zvezda seen as a vehicle to further Yugoslavia’s image in the world are you just throwing around terms here?
Great pithy quote, sadly it doesn’t make any sense when you think about it for more than two seconds.
The top comment is shit, but to pretend like Arkan wasn't an ultra leader when they won is just lying.
[no, they were pretty fucking awful by then under Arkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinamo%E2%80%93Red_Star_riot)
That would still have made it 1-1, not a sure win as overtime still had to be played.
Life goes on! Right now we are struggling in the second division of Romanian football and try to get the right to promote (sport laws here are very weird and corrupt). We finished second last season but because the law is so vague and only used against us we cannot do anything about it. We hope we can get the right to promote next season and comeback in the first league!
>Boban, Šuker, Panadić and Ladić for Dinamo; Mijatović, Jokanović, Omerović, Stanojković, Vujačić for Partizan; Bokšić, Jarni, Štimac, Bilić for Hajduk, Barbarez and Kodro from Velež; Vlaović from Osijek; Pantić from Olimpija; Brnović and Drobnjak from Budućnost; Stanić from Željo; Zahović, Ivić and Govedarica from Proleter; Drulović, Mirković and Đorović from Rad and a ton of players I can’t remember right now.

I'm surprised I recall most of those names. 

There was definitely immense talent there.
It's too bad life got in the way, because these players could have won at least one WC and one Euro during that decade. The Euro 92 was theirs to lose. Add Stojkovic to all the names you listed and you would have one of the most terrifying team in the history of football.
Are there English language books about Yugoslav football around this time that you’d recommend?
Željo also kept our prewar name, although we weren't party's favourite for sure.
 Sloboda, Borac and other smaller clubs kept their names.
But Velež and Sarajevo (which was formed by the communist party) did have some political support at least in earlier stages, not to undermine their great periods with cups for Velež and league title for Sarajevo.
ta 78/79 je bila zajebana, ja naravno nisam još ni u planu bil al stari dan danas ima traume od tog kad je Varteks ispal iz druge lige
 Nah man. I saw how teams were out to kill Dynamo and played reserves against cz. It was their role and they played it. You can sing hej slaveni to yourself on new years.
U think Steaua has a shot? They barely even qualify for Europe to begin with, last year they even lost 5-0 twice to Silkeborg IF.
Monaco is not really that small of a team though haha
So exactly like in Poland. No private ownership, players employed by state. 

Thanks for the history lesson but I already knew all this.
It's the well known tale of the state owned club from the capitol city financed massively in this case by state companies to achieve results domestically and abroad, backed by our first president Franjo Tuđman and the government at the time. They dominated the late 90's or when they struggled they simply stole the championship by his direct decision like they did in 1999 from Rijeka. 

After his death they struggled in the early 2000's before Zdravko Mamić took over somewhere at like 2003/04 and well that's another whole wall of text of corruption, scandals, preferential treatment like their feeder/second team allowed in first league and borderline match fixing that resulted in them winning about 15 out of 16 titles in a row with massive financial backing from the local government, mainly the Zagreb mayor at the time and ending with Mamić and his brother being tried and sentenced to prison for all sorts of corruption charges for their financial gain along with many ex-players like Luka Modrić more or less openly lying in court to protect them.
Zvezda fans can say the same thing
I know. And fan groups are named after his thugs
What stopped him? Couldn’t raise the funds? Or was he politely told to fuck off?
Ngl it is a bit weird to see a top English team with extremely little English influence (players, coach, play style, whatever it may be). May be too late to change it back though
Yeah, I thought it was obvious I meant the best players in Romania. Yeah, unfortunately football has lost a lot of magic in the past couple of decades as wealthy foreigners who have no clue about football takeover clubs and invest loads of money. And then there's those people who are proud of a team from their country winning a trophy, domestic or continental. Like how much pride can you be when your team barely fields any players from your country let alone locals. 

I feel the same about international football who looks more like club football nowadays. You look at teams like France, UK, Germany, hell, even smaller teams like Switzerland who are good mostly because they are rich enough as countries to attract foreigners who are born there. They're like sponges for international talent. 

Honestly if my NT looked like France for example I wouldn't even support them. Even international football would look so much more different and competitive if they could only use players that are ethnically from the country they represent. Or at least half. Imagine how some teams would change. France, UK, and Belgium wouldn't be near as good. Switzerland would be a mediocre team. Albania would be good. I think the only team that would still be world class would be Spain. 

Imagine how much more competitive and nice to watch international football would be. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten to the point where federations throw a bunch of money at good players to be naturalized and play for another NT like other sports do.
Yugoslavia had won the Youth World Cup only a few years before, led by Prosinecki and Savicevic.
Please tell me in more detail how no one cares, I’m dying to know
Funny how you criticize City's spending yet your club generously enjoys business with rich owners and states. Dias with City, Enzo with Chelsea, Ramos with PSG, Nunez with Liverpool, Felix with Atletico. Absolute outrageous pricing and your club retains responsibility for the perpetual inflation increases in player prices, which led to clubs seeking richer owners to afford to play in the big leagues.

Your club owners are a bunch of capitalist pigs who are in bed with these "slave owners.* Don't virtue signal about slavery when you don't even advocate for all the children in China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh who make the brand name clothing you wear.
Oh dear. My guess is you’re very young. This is a tiresome trope with no basis in the truth. For one, we were founded in 1880, Red Star in 1945. By 1945, City had won the First Division, FA Cup twice, Charity Shield. Red Star didn’t win anything until 1953. Now, tell me about history. Facts are awfully hard to debate. I’m sorry
So you weren't even born? The hell am I getting myself into here
Morava Velika Plana, 90ish km south of Belgrade by freeway, Podunavsko-Sumadijska liga. Think we're third on the table currently if Markovac won their game.
also conveniently forgotten that no one brought up the Young Boys tifo back in September that criticized all 3 opponents in their group stage (Gasprom/Putin re Cervena, and Red Bull violating regulations re Leipzig. I don't even need to make further comment about the other opponent)
All the best players in Yugoslavia you say? Literally the best players from Yugoslavia played for OM hahahaha, plus yugoslavia had like 25 million people back then.
France? 56. 


Give me proof they rigged the run and all is forgiven for your ignorance
Yeah nah make this guy only be able to watch third tier Venezuelan football
Underdog team gets odd amounts of money

Wins CL

Hardly non-important is it?
Romania was a country that was established after the breakup of Yugoslavia
Absolutely did. There was a story from a former player about Partizan and Red Star trying to sign him in the 70s or 80s, Partizan sent generals and military trucks to pick him up because they were the army's club. Red Star sent luxury cars, took them to a nice hotel, sent his family on a nice vacation, then offered him 4x more money than Partizan lol

Red Star has always been way more corrupt of the two, and I sadly grew up their fan.
Not sure how that is related to winninng the Champions League?
The guy above specifically called out Red Star, and the person you replied to asked for examples. You've now mentioned Marseille, which is irrelevant to the question.
[*redacted*] using illegal tax dodges to buy players they couldn't afford
And the pot calls the kettle black
This shit actually happened?
Indeed, we weren’t. Crazy Zeman making conspiracies yet again.
That's what happened. But you can't blame opposing fans to hold a grudge, it's human nature.
Fun fact, Deschamps played on both teams.
And the mediternaske igre were banrolled by whom?  The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  https://hrcak.srce.hr/247445  


Maksmir had major renovation work done post WW2, with concrete stands, the clubs offices + sanitary pipelines and modernised athletes track.  In '61, lighting was installed which was modernsied only 13 years later.   A final phase of renovations was done in preperation for the Univerzijada in 1987.  Please tell me, who bankrolled all these renovations?
Well just Croatia which was just a part of Yugoslavia has easily been one of the best teams in the world in recent years themselves.

I would say they've been a top 3 team by achievements in last 5 years: 2nd place at WC 2018, knockout stages EURO 2020, 3rd place WC 2022, finalists of Europa Nations League 2022 (lost on pens).
Oblak in goal
Keep Croatia’s core and address the striker shortage by starting Mitrovic or Vlahovic. Add Oblak in goal. Huge upgrade without disrupting the chemistry much.

More importantly, the depth would be huge with Milinkovic-Savic, Tadic, Savic, Kolasinac, Sesko, Dzeko, Marusic. Croatia ran out of steam in both world cups but with this kind of bench, you could rotate and trust that levels won’t drop from Real Madrid to the HNL.
Possibly everyone without losing too much quality
Sure, but if we compare them to the ~~UCL~~ e cup runner ups  the difference was disgustingly huge.
He wrote a normal comment, you're the one getting offended and whiny. Classic serb victim complex
> Man City, Chelsea, and PSG have dropped over 1.5 billion since being bought, there is no way that Ceaușescu spent anywhere close to that propping up his favorite team.

Sure, he only spent a fraction of that money, the reason is pretty obvious. Bayern had a revenue of 10 millions in 1980, in 2008 when City was bought their revenue was 300something millions, Ceausescu never had to spend billions.

> Teams from London, Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, Munich, Hamburg, and the Ruhr did well because they had a huge pool of players to pick from before football became much more globalized, allowing them to establish themselves over decades, that's just a fact.

First and foremost it was way easier for them to amass fans and find local sponsors.
I mean both, i struggle to see someone beat the fact Neymar was paid 300 million directly by Qatar to be their Ambassador for PSG to comply with FFP and him to pay his own Barcelona release clause.
I mean historically (ignoring cases of political interference) by being the best team you'll become the richest. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, and the natural order. 

I'm a Derby County fan and of course we don't have the resources or fanbase of clubs from bigger cities. There's nothing wrong with that. If you think there is, would you also expect a club from fucking Great Yarmouth to have the same resources as Manchester United?

The reason it's all bullshit now is the link between success and popularity, and having money, has been broken by these oil states who just pump money into some random club and make it the richest. Clubs no longer have to earn it, which the likes of United, Arsenal, Liverpool did.
It‘s the same thing though, just on different scales.  Corruption is still corruption, isn’t it?
Nah they were backed by a communist state blah blah. The same state that was in a civil war, the club also had ##zero foreign players. Hence they must of rigged their ucl. Reddit in a nutshell.
Ah I understand why they won it now.. they had the greatest player to have ever graced this world.. Robert Prosinecki
The final was one of the most boring matches you will ever see, but their run to get to the final was really impressive. They played some great football, thanks to those incredibly technical midfielders.
Sure mate, you can peddle that crap to some foreigners here who are less informed
No they’re not the fuckign “same”. And the implication that they are all the same because they are arab is fucking racist.

But who gives a shir about arabic racism in this forum anymore
ok i'm sure that makes a lot of sense in your head
please explain how that makes any sense at all. would that not be a massive conflict of interest?
People cannot seem to comprehend there wasn't a private sector in eastern europe
-source am eastern european
The fact that sportswashing comment has more upvotes than any reply puts into perspective how much people know on here. Need a reminder sometimes
>Yugoslavia teams were owned by state, it has nothing to do with sportswashing

Being owned by a state is the definition of sportwashing, regardless if it's domestic or foreing lol 

The biggest reason why a state would fund a team is so that the supports of said team see that state in a possitive light

>You can say the same though about La Liga giving the most money to Barça Madrid.


Literally yes, most rivals do. It's just get lost in the white noise created by foreign fans of those teams
That wikipedia article is pretty spot on - except for the Arkan part.  Don't really care if you believe me or not, but he was not the Delije "leader".
Richard Mills’ “The politics of football in Yugoslavia” is pretty decent but it’s more of a general overview rather than a specific timeframe.
I honestly forgot about Željo and I guess Vojvodina. Yes, I was  focusing on the 10 or so major teams, I know a ton of smaller clubs were allowed to keep their names if they had a history of being ‘worker’ clubs in the first Yugoslavia or if their members fought on the right side in the war.
I meant 1980's Steaua in terms of academy players. I misread the part where he talks about the future run. Definitely not these days. It's impossible.
Not exactly like in Poland. It was a "Non-Aligned Movement" led by Yugoslavia, India, Egypt, Brazil and RSA. Poland was part of an Eastern block as a USSR aligned country. Yugoslavia was a very unique country for it's time, but it was still a socialist country, just more independent.
Thank you so much.

Hoping you get the championship this year, I’ve never seen a city so in love with its local team. A friend and I have been following the results each week this season.
Zvezda is a state club, it couldn't be bought. Here is one his quotes when he had ownership of Obilić. "I will not buy Crvena Zvezda if it is privatized. I have my club Obilić. After all, Zvezda is not for sale, although I think it would benefit from privatization. One man could achieve much more than the current three political currents running through the club. "
I take it you mean most UEFA national teams. Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Ecuador, Morocco, Senegal, South Korea, Japan would still be class.
> Honestly if my NT looked like France for example I wouldn't even support them. Even international football would look so much more different and competitive if they could only use players that are ethnically from the country they represent. 

just some casual ethnostate ideology in r/soccer from the totes-not racist-country that is romania. Ai de pula mea cat de inapoiati suntem.
You won the league and had 3 people celebrating outside your stadium...
so you honestly believe a club like Benfica who is forced to sell their best players in order to stay financially stable is to blame for accepting galactic fees from state backed clubs? Jesus Christ…. 

I would rather not sell a single player to them yes. They’re enjoying more our academy players than we did - Cancelo, Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ederson are all City players. I would rather see them with us than playing for a plastic club, no question about it. 

if the Premier League, UEFA and FIFA allow disgusting projects like City, Chelsea, Newcastle or PSG than you honestly believe it’s rational to ask clubs like Benfica, Dortmund, Porto or Ajax to not sell to them and risk financial ruin?! sometimes I’m baffled by the ignorant takes I see on this sub.
We are literally fan owned you muppet and how are we to blame? Should we just sell our players for cheap? Fuck me prem fans are dumb as rocks
Man Americans really do live in another world. So the reason City are owned by slave owners who break all the rules others have to follow is the prices we sell players for...unbelievable logic right there. As if someone pointed a gun to the rich clubs' heads so they HAVE to buy our players, and Benfica should just hand them over because they play in "better leagues" (aka leagues pumped full of oil money). Nice circular argument you fucking genius. Btw my club doesn't have owners, yank. Go learn something about football and its history before coming here to shill for late stage football capitalism.
Wrong team!

You're a Manchester team not a Serbian one!

Before fact checking me read the comment right!
Typical gloryhunter.
…absolutely agreed
You need to brush up on your history bud
you cant be serious mate...
Marseille was a runner-up so presumably Marseille paid Red Star, but Red Star still won, so they were the worst in terms of fulfilling honest deals.
> Shit sorry, I'm thinking of season 92/93

not exactly irrelevant to the question. Adds some context that other teams at it also. But appreciate your comment.
Nothing confirmed, but allegations.

Fair to point that UEFA back then was utterly mad towards OM in 93 when our Ligue 1 bribery case happened, and made their own investigation about our European games. They found nothing, hence why the 93 UCL title stands.
My guy pulled out the hrcak
So you are comparing Belgrade Marakana, the stadium which was used as model in developing Olimpic stadium in Munich, to Maksimir, which used to look like a stadium, it seems before they put flood lights.... you're funny lad
>I would say they've been a top 3 team by achievements in last 5 years: 

But clearly not by pure player quality
From Slovenia Benjamin Šeško would make it to the team for sure too.
Yeah, yeah. Just a normal "Serbs bad" comment... Nothing to see here, keep on moving...
Source?
Well, not in every case are those 2-4 teams being corrupt to be the richest. Sometimes it is because league is set up in a way to reward best teams with most amount of funds, those teams have most lucrative sponsorships, always qualify for European competitions, and hence gather most funds that enable them to constantly overcome their competition. Sometimes those teams are bought by private investors who inject club with funds that enables them to beat their competition. Sometime state enables certain teams to have better budgets by signing them bigger sponsorships deals with other state affiliated or state owned entities. Some of this is corrupt, some of it is capitalism, some of it is structure of competitions, sometimes it’s mix of all. But again, it is reality of football.
so there is no actual proof of them rigging it? just people against country backed teams?
Tbh, in 1991 he was probably a top 5 player in the world. I know Pompey fans love him but you got a run down budget version of a truly amazing footballer.
Please inform us with the facts and sources that counters his claims ?
It's not racism, it's about the fact that they are backed by a foreign State
It’s you who is racist tho?

Explain me the difference between rich AEU and rich Qatari? Is their oil somehow different then the other oil?
populist gonna populist.
Yes it would be better if clubs were not used as sports-washing tools of foreign governments, it would be better if governments sports-washing at least invested the money into their own communities, as opposed to stealing the culture of another. Its not complicated. Doesnt mean sports washing is good either. Just slightly less bad
Yes it would be. But I prefer that to Saudi's who murder their own citizens because they are gay and don't give women any rights
Hahaha yep, it’s such a funny thread because all these people are trying to apply 2023 capitalism terms to 20th century communist/socialist nations. 

The point of the whole post is, what Steaua and Red Star did in 1986 and 1991 are some of the biggest achievements ever in this sport, where we saw teams naturally build internally with domestic players and developed best teams in the world those years, with small portion of budgets that teams in western europe had. Red Star and Steaua wins are bigger achievements than Madrid winning 6 in a row in 60s when they had by far biggest budget and formed all star team pretty much. 

Cheers.
So every team in the entire nation is sportswashing because they are all state owned? Maybe you just don’t understand how communism works ahahah

You could say then “oh all these sports are here just to turn away our attention from real problems” and then suddenly every sporting event is sportswashing. But I don’t think that’s the point of term sportwashing.
Yeah, that's why a lot of Radničkis kept their pre-war names.
Oh like that yeah, you're right that generation would be something else.
Thanks but I’m not here to discuss political systems lol. Just how clubs were financed and that was pretty much the same in all eastern bloc
Just to add little bit more context about national team part, but this issue is very deep and complex.

In those mentioned years, especially during Mamić's peak in power, national team was privatized for Dinamo and Zagreb. 

Just from top of my head, few examples - they used national team as showcase for players in need of sale in Dinamo, and national team only played in Zagreb. Like my first, and last game of Croatian national team was in 2005 vs Brazil in Split. In next 10 years, national team came to Split just 3 times. 

And when you add all mentioned facts about national federation, you simply turn people away from national team. 

After WC-2018 some progress was made, national team started playing in Split again (even tho, it's not local people attending games, but from diaspora or bosnia). Then Livaja started playing for national team, and we were on a good track to have atleast neutral feelings towards it (heck 3rd place at WC22 made me smile a bit), but everything went back to shit in June, right before national league finals - when Dalic didn't back Livaja in incident vs. fans. With current people leading federation, and especially with Daliban as coach I don't see anything changing in short to mid term future.

For us, Hajduk is simply first, and above everything. National team runs on #obitelj (family) motto, but they are far from it.
They blame us (Dinamo) and then lose to Maltese and Kazakhstani(?)  clubs which are way below our league standard.

While I like Hajduk and love to throw some banter slack in fun, they are big whiners. They had few chances in last few seasons to seal the title but somehow fucked it up. Also club is ran by the street, not in a mafia way but incopetent way.

Dinamo also has it issues but we did not win because of the backing. Just look at players Dinamo produced and look at ones Hajduk produced. We had Eduardo da Silva, Modrić, Gvardiol, Livaković, Baturina, Olmo... All world class players or ones destined to play in proper clubs.
Risk financial ruin? You lot will never have the chance to win the UCL when you have massive clubs like Madrid, Barcelona, and United retain a bunch of glory hunter fans to keep their funding. You believe you have a better chance in the UCL by selling your best talents to the big teams you cry about? How delusional can you be?!? No matter how much inflated money you receive from these sales, you're never going to be competing against City, Chelsea, Madrid, or United.

The moment you sold Dias and Ederson, you already signed their fate to the UCL. Dias is the best CB itw, and Ederson plays perfectly for Pep's style. His crucial saves against Lukaku in the UCL final shows it. City wouldn't have won without these two players, and you gave your BEST players to them. And here's the problem. Once City gardeners all these best talents, they will have money to fund their own network of academy players. And we just saw that in their latest UCL group stage win. They will not have a need to buy players from you lot anymore. 

You shot yourselves in the foot. You fed an oil tycoon for the benefit of your own pockets instead of football, don't even smokescreen the smiles you get when you see those oil money dripping into your pockets. If you're going to complain about "blood money" entering the UEFA and PL, then you're also the ones who accepted the "blood money" when you sold Dias and Ederson. Once again, virtue signalling at its finest. Dealing business with them was rational from a business perspective. It was NEVER rational to deal with them from a football perspective. Don't mix the two together, but of course, Benefica fans are the same as Dortmund and can't distinguish the two anymore.
Don't sell players to the clubs who ruin the league. How hard is it to say no? You keep the best talents to your club, other clubs follow suit and your league becomes better. Instead you prioritize money for god knows why and wail about disappointing UCL results despite giving these teams your best talents. 

Your club are the ones who set the prices. Acting as if your hands are tied behind your backs, classic Benefica fans will do anything but retain responsibility for their capitalism.
No one asked to sell those players to those clubs either. You're delusional as hell if you think you had a share of the opportunity of winning anything in the UCL by accepting those outrageous selling prices. You would've done more for football if the lot of y'all started a movement by denying business with the "slave owners." In the real world, we would call that an embargo. If City can't buy the best players in the world, then that would cripple their power to win anything. But no, let's go ahead and give the best CB and one of the best goalkeepers to City, and then whine when they win the UCL or they knock us out of the competitions. Where the hell is the logic? Y'all enjoy oil money coming into your pockets yet simultaneously complain that it's even in football? Ironic much? 

Go start a frecken movement and deny rich owners players, and other clubs will follow suit. But at this point it's too late considering City, Chelsea, and PSG have a great academy. Y'all gave them the best players, which attracted fans internationally and won them trophies, and now they got legitimate ticket and jersey revenues to keep it up. Great fucking job. Cries about oil money while being in the system that helped it win. Shot yourselves in the foot without even recognizing it.

Our rivals? We were playing Red Star Belgrade. Or do you mean Liverpool who push us pretty hard most years. Or are you saying that United fans are holding up signs in Belgrade about Man City? That’s a level of obsession that is hard to comprehend. To humour you… [City history](https://images.app.goo.gl/jcb1KR4WT6uFipkP7)
If I'm wrong, I probably do... I seriously thought it was part of Yugoslavia
A bit of a reach since the commenter specifically mentioned Moscow and nothing about Red Star. I think they just got confused.
The fuck you on about mate
And you're purposely ignoring the fact that Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia.  Belgrade, which was devastated by WW2 and vast areas of the city had to be rebuilt.  

And I was comparing Marakana more with Poljud, but you also chose to ignrore that.
Do you rank the best teams by player quality or results?
Not sure, not yet at least. Serbian forwards are still better than him.
Yeah these racists attacking Qatar for no reason.

It was extremely widely reported at the time that this is how the Neymar deal went down. It's a basic fact that Neymar funded by Qatar and not PSG funded by Qatar paid the clause. That's obviously completly different and clearly PSG did nothing wrong and Qatar are totally in the clear. Nothing shady at all.
Surely you can use google mate it was widely reported he signed to be ambassador for Qatar World Cup to bypass FFP and him paying his own release clause to join PSG.

there wasn't, there were rumours about OM trying to rigg it but that's just speculation. 

They also assume Yugoslavia was some whale lmao
Which is scary really because he is still the greatest player ive ever seen play, that includes Cristiano Ronaldo, which i know sounds stupid because hes definitely a goat, but there was something so magical about Prosinecki and theres a reason hes loved so much here.

Guy just did amazing stuff for me to witness as a young lad to think that was a version of him who struggled with injuries and was chain smoking at half time. He wasnt even training properly he just did what he wanted.

Shame there wasnt the access to football growing up there is for people now, because my opinion of him prior to him playing for us is just from things ive watched and others opinions.
First of all obviously you cannot compare their levels of spending with today’s City. There was so much less money in football, and their levels of funding also obviously weren’t that high comparatively. That doesn’t make his claim any less disingenuous, because they were very much favoured and pro-regime club which could bankroll the players paychecks even if transfer fees seem comical from today’s standpoint. League, referees and state organizations like police favoured them heavily. So they were able to pull youngsters and attract players easier than Bayern grabs them in Germany. They were A LOT more shady club in context of 80s / early 90s Ey-Yu league than Man City and their 115 FFP breaches are today. 

In greater Europe? Still an underdog and amazing achievment, yes, but not as much the fans present themselves in that post photo. And he’s got balls to say that Zvezda having preferential treatment is a load of fucking bullshit. I mean, knowing the history just a little bit, that just comes off as asinine. Bit like Pep’s whining. 

I’m obviously biased which you can see by my flair, since Dinamo and Zvezda match from 1990 is considered an unofficial start of the war. So take it with a pinch of salt, but I am trying to provide messured context.
Yes it is, the Arab peninsula is home to some of the best quality light oil in the world
The mental gymnastics on display here.

So the money has actually never been a problem? It's the people spending the money. Got it.
City group has heavily invested in the manchester area though
I can't believe a perfidious albion said this unironically
who's talking about Saudis? don't even know the correct country, which is the one your stadium is named after.
So if the Saudis gave lots of freedoms to their own citizens but took part in illegal wars, sold arms to dictators, and was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocents like the UK government you would not mind if they owned city?
Repeat after me. All brown people in the Middle East are not the same. Saudi is not UAE.
You forgot that they also stone people to death in 2023, for being gay. 
Also, executions where public until 2019.
Agreed
>So every team in the entire nation is sportswashing because they are all state owned? Maybe you just don’t understand how communism works

I don't think you understand how communism works lol 

"bread and circus", soviet states used sports (not just football clubs) as the circus. That's why they were so focussed on winning the olympics and shit too.

*The autocratic regimes had to do it to keep their people on their side* ^(isn't that the definition of "sportwashing" lol), if you knew a bit of history you'd know that....



>But I don’t think that’s the point of term sportwashing

You use the definition that only suits you, but whatever....
>then suddenly every sporting event 

Not every sporting event, just those held by autocratic regimes: 1936 Olympics along with all those held in the USSR and China, 1934/1978/2022  World Cup and even more. Are you telling me those weren't sportwashing?
Trying to build your club by having good academy, competent scouts and long-term strategy is gone. Pep spend 1.5 billions in City alone. Game's gone in that sense and we all know it. How can you beat unlimited money? The best part is we were kicked out 6-7 years ago from CL qualifications for breaking FFP rules for less than 500K euros. That seems fair.
Yeah I started talking more about a country in general, but like I said, those players were not just random shop workers, they had privileges and led a much richer life, and then left to earn even more, outside of country in other European leagues. Clubs here are very specific in ownership terms. Even Dinamo Zagreb is set up as a citizen non profit organization, that is owned my it's members officially
Let’s not brush aside the fact you said we have capitalist owners lmao

Stick to talking about what you know about
> You believe you have a better chance in the UCL by selling your best talents to the big teams you cry about? 

no ??? but between putting the club at risk of going bankrupt and not even compete for domestic trophies is worse. that’s the reason we sell, we don’t sell because we want, we sell because we need to do so. we don’t have sponsorships or TV deals like others have to finance their operational costs, therefore, we need to compensate by selling our best talents.

> They will not have a need to buy players from you lot anymore. 

great! I honestly hope so, the longer we keep our talents the better, even better if we don’t provide them to City. but that will be impossible, the portuguese talent pool is very good, there’s no way City will be self sustainable when there are countries like Argentina, Brazil, France, Croatia and so on having lots of amazing players recently. they will not want to miss out. 

I repeat once more, since you clearly didn’t understand. we have to accept oil money, sadly competent deciders in the sport allowed monstrosities like these to happen in the sport. if I could decide I wouldn’t accept but, since UEFA allows this shit to happen our board is in no position to deny the money. how are you going to tell a club that needs to survive by selling players to not accept money from City or PSG? Rich clubs are almost all state backed, there’s no running from them sadly. I’m never happy when we sell to them I despise them but I understand it’s a necessary evil for our board to accept it. 

glad I could help with your ignorance, you clearly don’t know jackshit about Benfica and Portuguese clubs situation.
Just don’t sell your best players bro 🤓🤓
He was talking about RS while I was talking about City's Rivals, Manchester United.

Compared to them City is a dwarf that hasn't seen anything past this decade at least for a few decades.
Shit sorry, I'm thinking of season 92/93
Joj isste jebo, o tom i pričam u Beograd se puno više ulagalo nego u ostatak Jugoslavije, pogledaj rezultate, pogledaj dvorane, pa bokte jebo i metro imate.....a sad tu kao '91. bez para postali prvaci
from the sounds of it, it was an amazing feat
That guy was a GENERATIONAL TALENT by all means. 

Heck he even himself said if there wasn't "gemišt" (white wine + sparkling water combo) that he would be the best in the world...
I didn't know the match was the unofficial war start event
So why take Chelsea away from Abramovich if you are so cool with foreign nationals giving the money?
Read the last two lines again. Slowly, over and over until you comprehend the point
… thats the point?

Its better for a government to invest in THEIR community (you know the people they represent) than a foreign one.

Jesus all of the replies to this really showing the level of reading comprehension here fucking hell
When I was a kid, I definitely thought about how the Saudi government was letting people stone gay people and have public executions till 2019 when i was watching man city. I definitely didn't just fall in love with man city because of the players playing on the pitch and playing beautiful football. I didn't watch city because of aguero, yaya toure, kompany, david silva and co. I watch them because of the human rights violations that saudi have commited. /s
But isn’t then every sporting activity, regardless of who owns the club, sportswashing. Sport is a fun activity that turns away our attention from real issues and pushes us to focus on “circus”. People are poor in capitalist states and the private business owners want to work us as much as possible while giving us least amount of pay, and least amount of time to rebel. Oh and here is sports, music, movies and TV to spend what little time you have.

Also, US always wants to win Olympics, so are they also doing it just to give people “bread and circus”? 

I understand your point, I don’t disagree with it, but owner of the team doesn’t matter at all in this scenario, capitalism/communism, state owned/privately owned doesn’t matter, all sports is “bread and circus”.
Yeah, same system was in Poland. Like when the players played for the club under military patronage they were given high military ranks so they could be paid more. 
Those who played for a coal mining state enterprise had high positions in those enterprises also to be paid very good money. Everything on paper of course, they didn’t work a single day there.
Right. Well I'm speaking to one, aren't I? Continue receiving that blood money while you virtue signal about it with absolute hypocrisy. Shameless activities are going about here, but I don't expect less than the Beneficas. 

I wonder if you're this dedicated to disconnecting anything to do with borderline slavery when you wear the clothes that are Made in Asia? Perhaps the electronics that are Made in China? Laughable stuff. Funny how people start to hate borderline slavery when it's against their own interests.
It's a "necessary evil" lmao. The delusion continues behind a veil of greed. So many of South America's leagues don't even bother selling all their top talents to these clubs and continue to enjoy football. The fact that you associate football into winning trophies is already proving the common denominator that I've been saying all this time: Benefica fanboys can't distinguish between business and football. You can always run from them and you blatantly choose not to, on the defence that you want to win trophies and have the European stage glory. What a joke. Football is football, you play it for the sake of the sport, not because you want your club to have glory on the European stage. Football winning isn't about glory. I thought we established this years ago but some brainwashing stays behind it seems. 

"If I could decide, I wouldn't accept" is the laziest argument I could hear from an advocating standpoint. Go to the stands, put your banners up, and let the club know you don't want to sell to these clubs. Go to other fans and ask them to join the movement. Talking about monstrosities when your club is one less than them, accepting their blood money and keeping quiet about it. I don't see y'all having banners saying "we don't want blood money, we don't want Qatari money" do I?
I love receiving Qatari money but I don't want clubs owned by Qatari money 😁😁😁
Beograd je bio razoreniji od bilo kojeg drugog Jugoslovenskog grada.  Jebiga, neki nisu sa cvecem Nemce docekivali.  


O kojim dvoranama pricas covece?  Istim dvoranama sto su se gradile po ostatku Jugoslavije?  


I kojem crnom metrou pricas, leba ti?  Ne znam ko te tu zajebo, ali Beograd metro nema.


Da razjasnim, mrzim zvezdu.  Bukvalno prezirem sve u vezi tog kluba.  Ali da su oni bili u rangu danasnjeg Man City-a je onaj najgori revizionizam.
Interesting that a version of the German word ‘gemischt’ is used to name the drink.
Things were heating up and it’s one of several escalations, came after first multi-party elections in decades, where pro-nationalist party won. Thigs were going towards dissolution of Yugoslavia. Definitively not recognized as starting point of the war in history books, but a notable conflict and riot broke out. Dinamo player Boban, later Croatia WC98 captain, famously kicked a yugoslav militia officer, which were beating the home crowd.

Weird takeaway. I was pointing out the hypocrisy of the original comment. If it was up to me, I would put a spending and wage cap on every single club.
Yes, only geniuses can comprehend absurd mental gymnastics like this. This is too sophisticated for us plebs.
>Its better for a government to invest in THEIR community (you know the people they represent) than a foreign one.


They weren't investing though, youre just mad a foreigner did what the natives should have.
>But isn’t then every sporting activity, regardless of who owns the club, sportswashing.

Is the team owned and funded by the state? If yes then yes. 

>Also, US always wants to win Olympics, so are they also doing it just to give people “bread and circus”? 

No, they are funding millions of dollars into their olympic programs out of the goodness of thier hearts
We can't refuse when they pay the release clause
Šta cmizdriš, nitko ne kaže da Beograd nije bio razoren, ali da se ulagalo u beogradske pizdarije više nego druge, to je činjenica, ja sam 100% siguran da bi i bez razrušenog Beograda tak bilo, jer eto tak je bilo i prije drugog svjetskog isto su pare išle vama....mislim zato i jesmo švabe dočekali sa cvečem
What do the last two lines of that comment say?

And then what did you ask?


Do you see how your comment was stupid?
… are you this slow on purpose?

I am saying that the UAE government should have invested in their own country instead of England. As you literally just said “what the natives should have.” Thats literally my entire point. That a sports washing government should give THEIR OWN community this investment, not some random community in a foreign country?

How are you not following this very straightforward logic? Did your parents drop you a lot as a baby?
White hip hop fans (from a black man)
White hip hop fans go to concerts, buy merch, buy vynils, create fan pages/subreddits to show support, become content creators out of pure love of the art, studies hip hop history, etc etc etc.

I've been to more than 15 rap shows in the past 10 years, and even the most street artists will have the whitest crowd. And it's even way more for the "pro-black" type of artists.

Considering all that, why are white hip hop fans treated as "guests" when they're the ones who actually INVEST in hip hop?🤷🏾
I’m white but grew up in an all black neighborhood. It’s the first type of music I knew that had culture behind it. My parents forced me to learn piano and play classical and study classical but the era was so far removed from my time that I couldn’t connect with it at all. Then I’d go outside and my friends were listening to snoop dogg and nwa, and I’d join them. I’d beat box and they’d rap. I’d hit sticks and pencils to make beats on the steps of our shitty ghetto houses. It’s as much my culture growing up in the inner city as it is any of us kids that did. If someone is treating me like a guest, I just assume they’re ignorant and move on. I have nothing but utmost respect for my friends of all shapes, sizes, and colors. Most of my friends aren’t white but none of them have given me crap about it.
I'm white and not from the US, for me it's like any kind of art, you get given the opportunity view things from someone else's point of view when you listen to it. I feel like far too many people especially in this Kendrick drake beef are assuming that it's just stateside people interested in it.
Something in this post doesn’t feel right lol. But I’ll continue and answer your question from my viewpoint. 

To say that black people don’t invest in hip hop is a distorted argument to make. It’s ignoring history. Especially given that rap is much more mainstream and accessible now than it was before. Are white people buying the things you listed? Sure. Black people are too, but support and investment goes beyond what you listed.

When an artist is trying to get put on, they come to black communities. In that same community you’ll find the people who might’ve paid $5 for that random mixtape they made. But if it’s hot, it’s our community who continues to pump that music and support the artist in various ways. We help raise the profiles of said artist and the art itself. Word of mouth. Small club shows. Mixtape purchases from the bootleg man or record store. That’s not happening in predominantly white communities. 

Before OutKast became big, I remember receiving their demo on cassette at a summer concert festival. No one knew who they were. But within 2 months time, I would hear songs from that tape around my city before they even hit radio. Thats support and investment. I was a purchaser of a Jeezy’s early work at ATL strip clubs before he got put on. It was the strip club and the black community that supported and invested in his music and early shows. That’s support. Not a white soul in sight at those shows. LaFace, and other labels, were created to support and invest in black music. You can go back in time and insert most hip hop artist into the above Kast and Jeezy scenario and they’ll have a similar story.

It’s undeniable that hip hop music is inherently black and a major part of our culture. It speaks to a black experience in America at the core. If we, black people, didn’t invest back then, you wouldn’t be able to make your argument today.There’s a reason rap is more mainstream and global now. It’s more accessible, and in a lot of ways, acceptable now. At one point tho, it was looked at with disgust. And we didn’t care, because it was ours. But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t to be shared. Anyone is and was welcome to join in, but respect the culture from where it came and the art form that was created.

I never expressed the “treated as guests” sentiment, but I can understand where one would make that argument. If you wanna join in, come on in. Make connections. Remain authentic in your love for all of the music and the context of the culture it represents. Don’t co-opt it because it’s the cool thing at the moment and you wanna be fashionable and current. You can’t go crazy for “Hot In Here” and then side eye “Fight the Power,” “U.N.I.T.Y,” or even “Fuck the Police.” Don’t become tone deaf and run back to your “native culture” (idk if those are the right words there) when issues involving the community are discussed through the music. Like any party or function, there are respectable guests, and then there are those you know for sure that you’ll never invite again.

Disclaimer: This will probably read like a jumbled mess as I’m typing it while multitasking lol. But my views are from someone who grew up in hip hop as an 80’s baby in the biggest, blackest city in the south and later on became a DJ because of my love for the music and our culture. I’ve seen the various phases, changes, and progressions that hip hop has gone through.
Cause we’re dorks
Black people do the same thing lol. From a different perspective (In the U.S.) white fans do outnumber us and have more spending money to invest. I think the overall socioeconomic status of Black Americans is improving as more enter (and stay in) the middle class but the progress is very slow. Too many black people are still too poor to really do anything in your first paragraph consistently when other priorities come first.
I guess it would be because the roots of Hip-Hop is in the streets, in the community, so the money aspect isn't always what people value the most in Hip-Hop. As far as I know, there weren't people that looked like me partying at Sedgwick Avenue in 1973
‘Ones who actually invest in hip hop’ is a wild statement to make. Your point is not articulated well…
Lmao, this thread has invited a bunch of people trying to sever the connection between American Black culture and Hiphop. Jeez
Okay this whole comment section is reeking with anti blackness and way too many tone deaf comments. They are guest because it’s one of the last remaining art forms the black people have and when we just allow anyone in our cultural spaces, it allows for higher degrees of appropriation and erasure of black identity in a black born genre of music. Throughout history white people have inserted themselves in our cultural spaces and have even took over complete genres to the point it’s not even associated with its black creators. This is what happened to rock music when chuck berry and little Richard were coming out they were demonized in the media however when Elvis Presley stole his whole act from a black artist, rock became more acceptable for white America. 

This is why it’s important that Rap keeps its black identity. Nobody owns music or genres of music however, it’s very important never to erase the cultural and historical roots of genres of musics as art is part of cultural identity and heritage. There nothing wrong with being treated like a guest in our community but you can’t claim the culture as your own. If anybody doesn’t see the importance of this than they need to do self reflection on to why they feel like black spaces/art forms shouldn’t remain associated with black people and not just an “American” art form
Well first of all, the majority of people in the U.S. are white. I believe that the reason most fans are white is because we live in a country that is majority white.

Secondly, hip hop is black music, with its origins in African American culture. Does that mean suburban white people can't like hip hop or even participate as artists? No. Are they guests? I don't think guest is the right word, but I always understand what people really mean when they say white people are guests in hip hop. The music wasn't made for them. It's not *not* made for them (the two "not's" are there on purpose, double negative), but it's just important for a white person to know where they stand in the community, and to not turn it into cultural appropriation or exploitation of black culture. I think Mac Miller is a perfect example of how to be a white hip hop artist and do it right. Action Bronson is another example. But then you also have artists like G-Eazy and Jack Harlow who come off as very disingenuous when it comes to their appreciation for hip hop as an art form. Then you have artists like Lil Xan, Post Malone, and Lil Peep who feel like they're in it for the clout. 

I think what bugs me is that a lot of white people didn't really get into hip hop, or accept hip hop as a legitimate art form until white people were doing it. Even though we had The Beastie Boys and House of Pain, it took for Eminem to get on the scene for white people to really get on board on a much larger scale. The more white rappers there are, the more white fans there are. There are some people that I know that seem to only like rappers that are white (I don't call them out on this, but I seem to be seeing a pattern, and I'm sure he's not alone). 

Instead of enjoying hip hop as a whole, they tend to only like rap because it is socially acceptable to do so. This isn't about all white people btw. Like I said before, there were The Beastie Boys and House of Pain, as well as a larger portion of white hip hop fans that support the music and the culture as a whole, and not just the white artists. If you're white, and you're on a sub reddit where you talk about hip hop, chances are, you're not one of the white people I'm talking about. You're probably a genuine fan. 

But knowing how white people (as a whole) throughout history have made their music off of appropriating others' cultures (even rock was stolen from black people), I see a pattern, and it makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes. It makes me feel like they're going to do the same thing with hip hop (not the artists' fault, BTW, but the fault record labels, execs, and corporate offices) and then try to rewrite the history like they've done, not only with music, but with everything that doesn't have white people as the most prominent voice. I think telling them that they're guests in hip hop isn't saying that they aren't allowed to enjoy the music or participate in the artistry. It is just reminding them where the roots of this music belongs, not to forget it, and make sure you are respecting it and not exploiting it.
In 2022 its reports that 14.4% of American is Black/Aftican American. The populace that listens to music in general is going to heavy favor white kids(myself included). I happened to go to a predominately African American and Hispanic school so for me I grew up around the culture and had an older brother who fell in love with Nas/Outkast/Tribe and a few others.

Either way the reason we are viewed as guests is because we are. We did not get sought after by the government and the CIA or our communities segregated and exposed the same way African American communities have/had/are. We are guests because while we can comprehend and understand it is not the same as living day in and day out in that culture. My best friend never saw his mom except once a week when she dropped groceries off, he was 7 and that lasted until I took him to college at 17.
For ten years him and his little brother survived sure with a roof and food but no parenting. They relied on the community and their neighborhood to help them with school work and health and safety concerns. I had the ability to witness but not understand until I was a teenager at which point I did as much as I could for them. Once I was able to drive I offered to never let them walk again if they did not want to. 

It’s just incredibly unfortunate and fucked up how this world has treated the black community and for a white person(unless actually grew up on those streets) we just can not grasp the day to day that those years made or make for these communities.

All I can do is help where I can and respect it to the best of my ability. I am incredibly thankful to Outkast/J Cole/Hov and Childish Gambino for making music that I relate to and have brought me life changing moments. But I understand that it was not meant for my perspective. Much love to anyone and everyone it’s what makes a difference.
First things first, what you’re saying in your first paragraph is in no way exclusive to white people. Plenty of black fans do the same things, it’s just that white people can more often *afford* such luxuries. Even then, black people *do* invest in hip hop, just in different ways. 

On the white crowds thing, that’s also not too surprising considering most of America is white. 

>why are white hip hop fans treated as “guests”

I don’t think that they are. If you believe they are, it stems from rap being predominantly black, same with basketball.

>they’re the ones who actually INVEST in hip hop 

Imo you’re discrediting the role that black people play in these artists’ success. Artists aren’t only successful because of vinyl purchases and what not, they’re also successful because of *exposure*, which is how most of their black audience listens (in their car, via apps, at parties, etc).
Because its origins are in the black community. I don't really think it's any deeper than that.
They are treated as guest because they literally are guest💀if black people start buying mariachi albums and going to mariachi concerts that doesn’t make us part of mariachi culture lol we would just be guest and huge fans of the genre. Same goes for whites people supporting rap
they gon love you bro lmao, captain save-the-white-man
White hiphop fans are treated like guests because hiphop is inherently black culture. The four pillars of hiphop were started by underprivileged black and brown people in New York and the culture stems from those people.


So when whites come into hiphop, some of us take caution because we know their history of appropriating things, especially when it comes to black American music. Doesn't mean they're not welcome, we're just aware of how this has gone with literally every other type of music we created.


They can create their version of it, as can any group, but I'd like to keep black hiphop music created for, by and mostly towards black people. But that's just my perspective and I don't expect others to have it, not even other black folk.
Umm because they are guest?? If black people started becoming the biggest supporters of mariachi music, we’d still be guest because that’s Mexican culture and we’re just consuming/supporting it. Black American culture is the same way. Nothing wrong with being a guest
This is the most Yes Master shit I've ever read. And considering Reddit's demographic, I'd sooner believe 2 Pac is living on an island before I believe any of you who claim to be black *are* actually black. Don't know a black man alive that would cape this hard for people who don't give a fuck about them. 
I am white. Hip hop is my culture. It's the only place I've ever felt accepted and comfortable. Fuck yall trying to kick me out of my home I ain't going nowhere.
White Hip Hop fans are the number one demographic. And it’s been that way since forever. Hell Ice Cube was literally calling white women “cave bitch” to a crowd full of young suburban white kids. 

This was the case with the Blues, Jazz, and any other form of music dominated by black and brown artists.
Just an observation.. there are (usually) just a lot more white people than black people in the population in general.
Invest 🤦🏽‍♂️ that’s what you call that?
Rap drew me in from metal when i was a teen and ive been hooked ever since. Id hope to not be treated differently but honestly i couldnt care less.

How people think about me liking rap doesnt stop the lyrics from connecting witg me. 

People will judge over anything these days.
U making it seem like black people dont do the same exact thing wym?
They make up 60% of the population as opposed to black people making up around 12%. 

To be mainstream in America, you have to be marketable to a white audience.

Moreover, mainstream rap is hardly representative of the culture that is rap. I don't think we should pat white people on the back for supporting an overwhelming amount of artists that do nothing but reinforce negative stereotypes about black America not only to white Americans but the world at large.

We could have this conversation if white people supported more Kendrick Lamars and fewer NBA Youngboy types, but that isn't the case, and when it comes to our representation in the media, all publicity isn't good publicity
Personally white people are guests because the conditions that created hip hop, were created by white people.
If the white govt never took a generation of black men from their children. Because of racism. Then we wouldn't have so many lost boys today. White people created, then introduced crack and drugs into minority neighborhoods. After the govt had already segregated colored folk and made them second class citizens.
All because they feared the unison of so many colored people.
 White people don't understand that if they weren't so shitty to black people, then the art that stems from their pain and oppression would not exist.

I'm full native American and white govt did the same to us. With that being said.
I don't consider myself black. But I definitely lived around the drugs and gangs. Some of the people I grew up with are still in the game.

 I invest by buying music and showing support to artists by giving props. Like Riley Freeman says I'm not on anyone's nuts tho. 😂
 I have a family and a job. Sometimes the concerts are on work days. I wanted to see ice cube and bone thugs last 420.but I had to work. 

I also have friends of every ethnicity and the common thread amongst minorities is that white ppl do white people shit. Sometimes it's innocuous as having no rhythm but sometimes it's major like invading Poland.
Because whites try to dictate it
Less than 15% of the country is African American. So shows being over half white people isn't exactly the shocker one might initially think it is.
I just know this is about Drake.
I’m white and went to school on the streets Griselda names songs after. I’ve been around black culture my whole life. I would never think my opinion matters on it though. It’s one of those things where I can support what I like and have an opinion on the music, but as far as “the culture” goes, it isn’t mine. Being adjacent to it doesn’t make me part of it. I still have a wildly different life experience than people from it and that skews my feelings in ways that I don’t even recognize when I’m listening. Stuff like TPAB, or Micheal by Killer Mike, are SO deep rooted in the black experience that I just don’t connect with them as much. I still like them, and can tell they’re great, but also aren’t for me.
The whole culture stealing thing is probably a little correct but also wrong. 

Culture is supposed to be shared. That’s how we can become a major melting pot world and have more balance and more unity. 

Basketball was invented by a white guy but the nba only has like 2% white guys. That’s just how it is. 

I get the whole stolen culture thing tho after the massive success by white bands who stole blues riffs etc. and of course white artists in hip hop selling more records because they were white but for the most part rap just turned into popular music in the late 90s so it’s hard to stop it after that.
I dont disagree but ending your point with saying white people "invest" in black people/culture comes off a bit wrong lol
if i bought Punjab art, poetry, clothes and cuisine it would still make me guest to that culture because i didn’t come from it i’m just consuming it from the outsiders perspective it’s not an “investment” it would still be there whether or not I supported it financially

The same applies to hiphop
Because they are guests lol you can’t buy your way into a community. They’re always welcomed to enjoy of course! We do support our own through their music. Yes, some don’t buy merch or valuables but a lot of people don’t buy merch. It can be just plain ugly, it’s a lot of other things. Music is for everyone yes but the music doesn’t make you black. A lot of the white fans I’ve personally encountered assume the music makes them adjacent to blackness when it doesn’t.(not saying rap is the thesis of being black) 😂
I think the last part of your post is the most interesting. I'm a white rap fan. My first CDs were the nutty professor soundtrack and the space jam soundtrack. My first concert was Redman and Method Man's Blackout tour.

I'm only just getting back into hip hop now after going through long stretches where I was more into alt rock, indie, and EDM, but I've never totally been out of the culture and I've always considered myself a genuine fan of the genre. 

So are we white folks really viewed with skepticism when it's clear we are into the music and the artists and the scene? I mean, white people acting black in a broader, cultural or personal way is usually cringe, and I can understand skepticism and shade for that, but do most black folks really see us as guests or tourists if we show up at a rap show and just act like normal fans?
Not sure if you are actually a Black man asking this question lol. It should be obvious to you. Not Hip-Pop or The Black Eye Peas HipHop. The real essence of Hiphop is created by Black people and mostly those who come from nothing. It is cultivated from the Black lifestyle and experience. Don't get me wrong here. I fuck with the Whites and alot of them are cool asf and we definitely vibe. 

The history of our country has Whites typically in an adversarial role in our lives and music. In a music sense The authoritative, dictatorial, and menacing roles are usually played by Whites.  The police that want to lock us up etc. And us too of course. In addition to our own decisions/bad decisions, Black creativity is the fuel to Hiphop in a system that hates, pits us against eachother, and seeks to ultimately destroy us and our identity. The system created by the hateful Whites. The pain and creativity channeled by our life experiences does not include White identity, although Hiphop is expansive enough that they understand and vibe just like us. I think it runs parallel and intersect but largely the basis is our identity. They certainly get it. And they understand they are not of it and don't claim to always be a part of it. 

They enjoy it and relate to it. But at the end of the day, they are able to dibble and dabble in it lol. While we LIVE IT. We can't buy a ticket to our experience and leave it alone when the concert ends. They are consumers of our product (us too), while we are it...

Tbh us Blacks are fans to MANY things but are considered guests lol. We can start with politics. We can talk about commerce. There are so many things Blacks pour money and ideas and time into but aren't considered apart of that culture...Hip hop is the one of the few things that is marketable from Blacks and that's why it is starting to be gatekept in a way...
It’s because those white fans could have their heart in the right place and learn everything there is to know about hip hop by listening to black men talk, really get what they’re saying… but will never truly be able to experience it. This is a cliche trite example but a racist cop isn’t going to attack a white hip hop fan.
The ideology of whites being guests in hip hop stem from the very foundation of the genre. It was a form of expression for African Americans to talk about their struggles and the things they had to live through. It became an art form so people of other races and cultures started doing it too. Whites are considered guests because they’re not the originators of the music (by this logic they’re guests in a majority of music) but rather fans participating in something they enjoy. Cant say I’ve heard anyone calling white rap fans guests in hip hop though, just those actually doing rap such as Eminem
They invest in the corporatized mainstream hip hop. Maybe even some "underground" or "independent" types but only after they have a buzz and a fanbase. They don't really be at local shows on the grassroots level like that unless it's a more preppy upscale type market. I know because I've been to those kind of shows for years. I've worked with those artists, I see black people at those shows.


There's def a fair share of white dudes that do production, engineering, instrumentation, etc behind the scenes stuff. And a lot of them are more open to unsigned hype but at the base level they aren't there they usually get put onto music that's why they're seen as guests.
I think this is a interesting post a couple of reasons:

1. Your perspective is reality. The area your concerts are in, the creators you watch, and the artists you listen to will define your experience as to what you’re exposed to. I can easily tell you that being from Atlanta, that a Young Nudy, Thug, or even Childish Gambino concert will have a majority of black audiences. 

*Appreciation is measured by more than just showing up to a concert.*

2. This dives deeper into economics and sociology, but those with the disposable income and ease of mind to purchase that VIP or front row seat will, those can not, probably will support by watching the YouTube recording. I for one, am not nor know anyone that is willing to buy $300-$1000  ticket if it doesn’t sit comfortable with them or if it isn’t a once in a lifetime experience.

*The person who’s working 2 jobs to live might not be able to attend Coachella, but probably listens to Frank Ocean’s Coachella mix daily.*

3. There are roughly 340 million people in the US. 75% of them are white. 14% of them are African. 

You should come to the Jazz Festival in Atlanta and see how much support is given because it’s affordable and accessible.

I think it’s great whenever someone appreciates our culture, but why do you think we should put one race of people on a pedestal for buying our tickets? How do you think they should be appreciated since the current way doesn’t work for you?
The reason rap/hip-hop exploded in the 90s which, ended up creating billionaire rappers wasnt because black kids just all of a sudden started listing to the music.

Nope, it was because white kids started buying records, etc.  literally 100x the market overnight once white kids started listening to the music.
I’m a white woman who grew up with parents who just characterized all rap as gang banging music. Their opinion has softened over the decades (I’m 35) but it’s still not cool. I really discovered rap and hip hop in middle and high school and I tend to appreciate it for the narratives. I can NEVER experience what it’s like to be black, but I CAN listen to the people who live it rap it and try to understand. 

I’m into pretty much all music (but country… although there are exceptions) and music tells the stories of the people who make it. Music is meant to connect people. And if your music makes me feel something, I’m gonna support it, big or small, regardless of genre.
You being a drake and boosie fan explains why this post is so fucking dumb lol
It's all a matter of perspective. There are a lot of people who don't like white people or put an asterisk next to the ones they do like. Sometimes white people are viewed as colonizers when it comes to black art, like any appreciation has ulterior motives.

It is what it is man. I've been on both sides of the argument and it all comes out in the wash at the end of the day.
I’m a white fan. All in all, we are treated as guests because the subject matter is not relatable to the white experience more often than not. And that’s fine. Music in itself is a community and I’ve never felt unwelcome at a rap show (except for Noname one time lol). I’ve gone to meet and greets with Ab-Soul, JID, 6lack and I never felt out of place. They showed love to their fans and I could tell these artist genuinely did not give a fuck what their fans looked like.
If only people would just let others enjoy things no matter what they look like, but that’s so hard apparently.
I'm white, from Eastern Europe. My whole culture and mental processing is a lot based on hip-hop. Hip-hop is not black... it's diversity. It's a medium with which anyone regardless of background, skin color, gender, net worth, can express themselves. 

I didn't have to be a black kid selling crack to relate to it. I could be a white kid living in post-communist Romania, sorounded by poverty and people expressing their disappointment in the way things turned out at the time and the need to bring actual change. A whole generation grew up on that music and actually brought change to our country.
Rap has been catering to suburban white people for over a decade bruh…
I'm black too, from an all black family and an all black neighborhood and city.

Just because we as a people are and have been oppressed and mistreated in America and around the world, I don't feel that gives us any right or reason to do something similar with hip hop.

I find it very annoying, disappointing and distasteful the disrespect and reverse racism I see in hip hop related subreddits.

Some of my all-time favorite hip hop artists, emcees, DJ's and producers are mixed or non black.


I mean, imo hip hop is the evolution of blues, jazz, rock & roll, soul, and r&b; which all owe it's roots to former enslaved African Americans, but have branched off into genres of music that are global and made and enjoyed by everyone.


My issue is the popularity and success of negative, violent, unethical and destructive music in mainstream American media which helps to ruin society as a whole, but especially for the communities and people that look like me.
Do white fans really feel they're treated as guests? Like somehow their fandom is illegitimized because of their race?

I've heard people say things like "white artists are guests in the house of hip hop", which I think makes sense given hip hops roots. But tbh I've never felt that this guest narrative extend to fans.

Forgive me questioning the question, but this is the first time I've heard someone make this complaint, and it's not even coming from a white person 😂

I am neither black nor white (shocker, I know) so this is an interesting topic to me
Its just enjoying music lmao im a massive jazz fan skin colour doesn't come into liking music
We still see conversations about the biggest white rapper of all time being a "guest in house of hip hop". Granted hip hop/rap has been created by black people, that will never change. But looking at these conversations is quite disappointing.
I come from a white, upper middle class background. I developed a love for hip hop and all music at a very early age. My dad was instrumental in my knowledge of things that were happening with certain rap artists. Most parents would ban their kids from listening to N.W.A. or 2 Live Crew, but my dad said it was bullshit what the government was doing and encouraged me to listen. I also think the influence hip hop culture has had on society is important in bringing all people together. Just my 2 cents.
I don’t consider white people as guests in hiphop for that very reason. Yes hiphop belongs to black people and was created and molded by people of color as a whole but it was made for everyone, white people included along with what they contributed to the game. To exclude white people and write them off as guests goes against everything hiphop stands for if you ask me. Of course there are those individuals that exploited the game and appropriated it, those we deem fugazi, but that’s not just white people, that could be anybody who disrespects hiphop.
Yo. Thanks for this. I’m a late 30s white dad and I’ve been listening to rap/hip hop for about 20 years now. It’s my genre of choice any day. Sometimes I get jealous that I won’t ever be able to relate to these things or be a part of the culture but god damn do I appreciate it
Thanks for sharing your thoughts! Im as white as it gets and I grew up kinda wealthy too and that sometimes makes me feel like I don‘t really belong into Hip Hop (especially recently with the beef and all) and like I‘m low key culture vulturing.
But Hip Hop is the only genre I ever actually vibed with and I love it and I always will. People can treat me as a guest if they want, I just wanna chill and enjoy some bangers :)
Imagine being a hiphop “fan” and not understanding how black people are disproportionately affected by poverty. If you think that spending money is the only way to be apart of a subculture then you have no understanding of the true roots of hiphop. Black people “invest” in hiphop by being trend setters, innovators, survivors, and continuing to find ways to create art, including hip hop, despite struggling to make ends meet, survive police brutality and racism, and be discredited by “fans” like you.
Because hiphop was created out of the ashes of Disco, funk, rock, and blues; music genres that were all eventually white washed and gentrified.

Other races are treated as guests because hiphop is and will always be a black artform. Think about it, the only successful white rapper is Em. Like every now and then there will be an Iggy, Jack Harlow, Macklemoore, etc but they never have lasting success and that's because we dictate the culture, which kinda proves the whole "only white people listened to Eminem" narrative is bullshit but that's another topic for another day. 

But yeah we still have a firm grasp over the artform so everyone else is considered outsiders. Btw this isn't a black or white thing either as hiphop started off as an inner-city thing so suburban kids as well are looked at as outsiders too. Hell growing up most of the suburban black kids (I'm black btw) at my schools listened to rock and pop more than rap. They probably still do.
the answer is racism.
Great question, bruv.  For a lot of black people, rap seems to "mirror", a uniquely black experience. For them, you can't separate the experiential knowledge from the art. Authenticity and being genuine is a key component to what makes the art form as interesting as it is.   White people, on large, do not share this same experience. Funnily enough, neither do most black people. 


Most of us in these threads and listeners of hip hop, regardless of race, don't share this unique experience. As much as Drake seemingly co-opts black "hood or ghetto culture", you find black people in America do the very same thing.   


 Interestingly, this sort of thing is mirrored in other aspects of life. We rightfully understand that the wealthy have an easier time in every aspect in life. We've now inverted that perception to correct that imbalance, and we now commodify being disadvantaged. This holds a unique and important social cache these days.  


To some people, that disadvantage could never and will never be understood from someone who is white. Connecting to that social disadvantage, ironically, has a lot of advantages in itself. You don't need to actually be from the hood to carry that social cache. You only need the color. For those people, there is power in exclusionary places where whites shouldn't or can't fully go.  


 There's a historical precedent, so it's hard to tell that kind of person that other ethnicities can also belong here.  I say If you can rap, then just rap. If you like it, you like it and that's aight. Bump whoever says you can't be here. If we're going by their standards, they usually don't either. 
>Considering all that, why are white hip hop fans treated as "guests" when they're the ones who actually INVEST in hip hop?🤷🏾

Maybe in the world of fandom. In the *actual* Hip Hop world that *materializes* albums, it’s mostly White folks behind the bag.
Probably for the same reason those foreign language experts post crowd reactions on YT to natives seeing a non-native speak their language. It just isn’t considered normal. 

**Race:** White as it gets

**Childhood:** Suburban as it gets

**Favorite music:** Hip-hop

**Car CD Playlist:**
- E. 1999 Eternal
- All Eyez on Me, Book 2
- 36 Chambers
- Chronic
- GKMC
- DAMN
- AUX Pandora to find new similar stuff. As a result I have a great knowledge of hip hop discography and catalogue but absolutely zero about the culture. 

This beef made me realize that because I wasn’t even aware there was beef but was there when euphoria dropped because I fuck with Kendrick. I can see why black hip hop fans might look down on that. I just stay in my lane and say playa instead of the nWord in songs cuz you know there’s some hip hop that makes you sing it out loud it’s so great. 

I’ve subscribed to quite a few streamers AND LEARNED ALOT because of this beef and am looking for a great resource on understanding hip hop history, not just reading Wikipedia - drop a link if you got a YT to somebody detailing the Tupac/Biggie era, I’d appreciate it.
There many ways to invest than just going to the concerts and buying tees. The people who invested in those small black artists were inner city black people who gave those artists their platform to even be recognized. Those same inner city black people also have much more to focus on than going to see their favorite musicians at concerts where the tickets prices are insane. I’ve been to one concert my entire life, it doesn’t mean I live the artist any less than the person who buys all their merch and concerts cuz at the end of the day, their product is music, everything else is accessory. Most black artists will recognize this too and will still make music that the inner city will recognize and relate to cuz they know we are the ones who put them on and got them there in the first place.
Grew up Hispanic/white mix in the Chicagoland area. Hip hop, jazz and blues is what I grew up on
It’s a fiscal limitation.
[removed]
Idk I as a white dude who’s a massive hip hop head I just love the history of it. It’s not like I’m listening to mobb deep and relating to it on a deep level but I still like to hear the stories they have to tell. Then there are artists like lucki where I can legitimately relate to their lyrics. Either way I think the whole outsider thing is mostly on the internet. I’ve been to lots of shows with people of all different skin colors and we all get along and rage out together.
Depends in the person. I'm 100% a spectator cause I live in Sydney, aus and although Sydney is a hugely multicultural place, there's not a large African community. there's barely any African Americans.

I literally have to import music from other cultures or listen to Indie pop rock, and even most of those bands are from adelaide. 

I guess i could always stick in my lane and do the nutbush.
I think it has a lot to do with where you’re at, I mean right? 

And not not trying to sound snooty or anything, but 15 shows in 10 years isn’t exactly a staggering amount for a sample size.

I live in a very white city, but we get good music. Whenever there is a big hip hop act, lots and lots of people come from bigger neighboring cities and those crowds I’d say are predominately black. 

But again, that’s just my experience, and only you have your experience. It’s really hard to make extreme sweeping generalizations like this and maintain an objective perspective
I agree. You wouldn't have Tom Macdonald without the support of my white half. You're welcome. 

Neh. But yeah, as a Hispanic/White guy that fell in love with rap as soon as I became conscious of music, I don't really pay it no mind. I know the rappers themselves enjoy the love they get from all races and if they favor their black fans I feel like that's a good thing too. If you think my opinion matters less cause I'm not black, that's fine. I'm not trying to be in no parasocial relationships anyway. You can ruin your own time caring about that stuff, but you don't have my permission to ruin mine. It's all love over here.
Sometimes good music is good music and can be appreciated by all
We had one black kid in my high school growing up. Out of a few hundred. I grew up listening to “modern” rock. Nothing old school. As soon as I heard hip hop, I was hooked. The beat. The lyrics. Fucking reel me in. 🤷‍♂️ I don’t listen to pop shit, I love real artists. Just can’t help it. Music is just one of the most basic of human artistic expressions. To me it doesn’t matter what demographic the music originates from. I just support folks making good shit, music, art and otherwise.
Artists love white fans. Is it a humble brag you have money to spend on hip hop products more than other races?
Racism
It's like immortal technique said " who the fuck you think made snoop and jay platinum? Call up any record label and ask em"
From what I can tell. The word guest I usually only used when a white ARTIST has worn out their welcome. I am white and no one has used the word guest for me (to my face anyways). But their are an insane amount of interviews explaining why specific white rappers are guest.
Idk bro you gotta ask your black contemporaries. A lot of the community doesnt seem to realise most artists couldnt make a living off this if it wasnt for the whities
Same reason Africa is ran by white people ,it's about control no matter what we say on wax they know that they have control over a lot of artists in the game
I'm white but grew up in South Florida where I was the minority for the majority of schooling from K - 12th grade, and overall I just believe in equality. Idk, it's a long pointless story but I am who I am and love the music. Rap is my favorite genre and I'm just glad to be here with other fans.
I'm a huge nerd man.. white AF, love hip-hop and snoop dre NWA Tribe wu tang em and Kendrick are always in my rotation..  I love all music and hip hop and rap hold just as special a place in my heart.
Music is for everyone, people forget this. Thank you government for splitting us into smaller and smaller groups.
I am hip hop.
I’m a poc but white people are the only fans I’ve ever heard say “real instruments” when referring to rap with guitars or drums 

White people like to praise rap groups that use”real” instruments as opposed to samples.
I’m a 30 year old white guy who has been listening to rap since I was 10. I grew up poor, and I always identified with a lot of the themes presented in rap music. It always connected with me more than any other genre. I am more hip-hop than most people, regardless of color. I respect the culture and it respects me. I have never felt disrespected as a white person and I have never been treated like my opinion means less in regards to it anywhere except on social media the past couple of years, but that doesn’t really bother me.
I dont have an answer to that but as a white man who loves people of all races as well as hip hop, it can be easy to sometimes feel ostracized. The fact that a word is used so frequently in songs we love that we obviously cannot say kind of further shows that we can observe but are not truly welcome. 

Theres also a lot of reverse racism. Not black people hating white people but moreso the assumption that youre racist if you’re white. It sucks when you truly have nothing but good intentions, but i get it
Rap as far as I know is more based on reality, now we do have the bling bling part, but most of the time it’s hardcore, real, I learned most of the stuff from the Legend 2pac…
One word: Racism 
There’s several historical factors as to why they outnumber black people in this country. 
Why do you think Hip Hop was created???
For me personally, as a white with British ancestry I can only trace my lineage back so far, and I feel like there is much of my families history that has been lost or forgotten on both parent's sides.

With black music (not just Hip-hop) I can feel the passion and the history, the soul and the roots, plus the rhythm and the connectedness it shares. I find these traits in most continents indigenous music also and there is something grounding and rich.

Perhaps I gravitate toward Hip-hop because it fills a void I have in my own life and culture.
Gatekeeping?
Well about 60% of the USA (I’m assuming you’re American?) is ‘white’ and 12% ‘black’ according to the census data, so even just statistically speaking *any* concerts are going to have a white majority.
As a mostly white dude(part Mexican), i grew up in the 80s listening to Run DMC, Dana Dane, Big Daddy Kane, etc. I was always drawn to the beats and samples, the word play. Just made sense to me. I listen to so many genres, but hip-hop has always been there. And if anyone calls me a guest, I'm good with that and I get it.
I’m not white nor black and living outside of the USA. Let me tell you, we knew about Rap/Hip hop music because of a white artist - Eminem. Even today if you ask to name a rapper, most of my countrymen/neighboring countries would say Eminem. After i got interested in Hip Hop, i discovered that there’s too much black vs white. White shouldn’t be guests and should be treated equally as blacks when it comes to Hip Hop.
They shouldn’t be guests if they invest. They are apart of hip hop
[removed]
I'm white, I don't care if people say I'm a guest. I listen to music I like and that's that.
I’m a hip hop fan, but my first love is reggae. I’m a white American dude, and I make my own flavor of reggae while trying to always be conscious about not biting and being respectful of the form and the people who gave it to us. If I hear and artist I like, I buy their music, go to shows, and generally support the fuck out of them. In my estimate, it’s the best thing I can do to honor them.

Reggae music is first and foremost a revolutionary music. Like hip hop, it’s a commentary on the environment from which it comes. It can teach us about experiences we might never otherwise understand. And most importantly, for the listener and fan, it can bring empathy and an appreciation for our shared humanity.

All that said, I find it important to be sensitive to certain boundaries that exist in the music and culture. Calls for unity might be first intended for the African diaspora, then colonized peoples generally, then Jamaicans at large, and finally all peoples. A lot of reggae music has deep bonds with religion and culture that shouldn’t be dismissed nor co-opted to the point of removing its original context and meaning. We see a lot of this in hip hop music and culture as well.

In the end, and in agreement with your original post, I don’t feel like a guest because of the relationship I have grown with reggae music and culture as a fan, and because of the niche I’ve crafted (and filled with love and respect) as an artist.
dawg just because you contribute doesn’t mean you’re not a guest still like what 😭 if i went to dinner at friends place but brought food id still be a guest no matter what i contribute.
I don’t have a lot of black friends myself but one thing you should always remember is that you don’t need to grow up in a certain area/culture to be a part of it 

Besides, even if you’re not, music is music
Not sure but I don't care. I just like it. I started with metal and punk. Moved to naughty by nature, beastie boys, house of pain, rage against the machine then followed it from there. Did the artist say we are guests or does the media say this? Anyone can enjoy any type of music they want.
it's a meme bruv calm down
White dude who grew up next to one of the few black dudes in town (who put me on to WuTang - which we all know is for the children). I've always considered myself as a guest to the culture. I love all sorts of music, but hip-hop will always be my favorite music. I don't have a problem with being considered a guest, but I do think the lines are blurring much more nowadays compared to when I started listening in the early 90s.
 Its not even the investment part i would say the part that the music and the lyrics connect the people that listen to it its just beyond color its culture its a social connection of understanding a story.
I think art its colorful but also colorblind.
The music of the struggle has always attracted white people. Unless you're from that struggle can you really understand? White hip hop fans may like the music, and that's OK. Rap was invented by the children of Black freedom fighters. White people can only understand our lives at a surface level. White people loving and buying hip hop doesn't mean that they understand the struggle. Some of them just want to have their worst fears of Black people confirmed.

Rap isn't the same, it's not the way that. It's never been segregated or even against white rappers. Like other forms of music of the struggle, it's ok to partake, but you can't colonize. That's what's happening now. It's not about the struggle. Rappers are bought and paid to promote the most ignorant aspect of society. Paul Wall has never had a problem being accepted. Mc Search hasn't either and when they gave him problems, he gave them the gas face.
White Aussie here, not far from 50. My mum was always playing music, watching the Grammies, etc etc. One awards show Run DMC performed my Adidas and holy crap I was maybe 8 or close and I never heard anything like it before. During my time approaching that pivotal moment, my mum always watched shit like grease, the village ppl movie, the Blues Brothers, even flicks like smokey and the bear had heaps of country music in it. My step dad played pink Floyd n heaps of other stuff like it. I love all music, but hip hop changed my life. Copping dubbed tapes of takes a nation of millions to hold us back, and 2 lives move something around 10 years old and I couldn't get enuf. Of course it was the "oh you want to be a black person don't you?" crap all the time until it became cool to be white and wear ice t and nwa and cube shirts without getting bashed by the local surfer twats. How times have changed, those surfer cocknuggets these days pump Aussie hip hop more than anything now lol anyway cheers blokey 
PS when ice cube or whoever comes to Australia it's almost all white cunts and it ain't no thang, just love.
I’m a white Englishman with no personal connection to the genre or its roots. I love hip hop and the different styles of music it has created. I’m happy to be a guest. I love Wu and Kendrick for examples, but can I relate to the lyrics and themes? No not really. Much of the time I have no idea what they’re even rapping about, but do I love the music? Yep. That’s what it boils down to for me. It’s simply the music. I can empathise with the roots of the genre, but it’s not my life.

So yeah, happy to be a guest.
Dude thank you!!

I’ve been to countless hip hop concerts, listened to rap, hip hop and rnb since 97.  I’m a white man and I can say the racism from fellow hip hop fans is an actual pretty new thing I’d say over the last few years.  But man this recent beef has really brought out some really disgusting behavior all in the name of “The Culture”.  

I will always love hip hop but the current cycle isn’t my favorite.
RACISM
Humans are PLAGUED with an “Us vs Them” mentality. It’s the root cause of nearly all the problems we have. Therefore, culture is seen as something which divides people, rather than it all simply being the human culture it is.

It’s as simple as that. Humanity is simple. Humans use negativity to mask their simplicity to create the illusion of complexity. The worst part is people, as individuals, are too simple to even realize what they’re doing, as they were all indoctrinated into the society in which they were born in.
simple racism mostly
This entire post is cringe. From I see from black or from white it's already suspect to me. Just my opinion. I didn't even bother read replies just the title got me. Sorry
MCA had run dmc signed to def jam in the early 80s. If it weren't for white people, there wouldn't be hip-hop! I ain't even read your stupid fckn question this race shit has been tired... you real sheltered huh
It’s just apart of life that people are gonna view you differently whether intentionally or not when you do things that are outside of what’s typically expected and apart of your race or culture. People in here are trying to give history lessons about hip hop without realizing that genres change and evolve with hip hop being no exception. Being white doesn’t make you any less credible when it comes to your enjoyment of hip hop music, yes you won’t be able to relate to a lot of the lyrical themes in a lot of hip hop music but as I said, rap is way different from what it used to be and is more than just its lyrical content. If we kept the same alienating mentality then black people would be seen as guests in genres like rock and metal for example.
Realistically the only people that have ever made fun of me or gave me a hard time about it would be white people. They’d find out what I was listening to and I guess I listen to goofys so they’d joke on me. I don’t really care, I’m a loyal listener as long as an artist doesn’t do some terrible shit like this past years been full of.
No matter how many tacos a white person buys in California the taco will remain a latino food.  


Investing money doesn’t change anything you will always be a guest in something born from someone’s culture 
Culture is meant to be spread and shared. No one is a guest if they're a real fan of something.
Im almost in my mid 30s and white. Been listening to hip hop since the late 90s. Been a fan ever since I first heard to it. I remember back in my middle school days, maybe even early high school, if you were white and listening to hip hop, you were frowned upon by other white people. But I didnt care because I loved the music. Black kids never gave me a hard time for liking hip hop. So I personally have never felt like a guest. I have studied the genre and have listened to so many historic albums.
You are 100% correct and it’s so many teens that come with their parents too and it’ll be some super expletive music lol
As an older white dude that's always been a fan, I don't really get that, I get initial surprise but once you actually prove you have some knowledge and sound opinion to justify your position on a topic all that guest BS goes away. Maybe I'm naive, but I don't feel the guest treatment.
I listened to nothing but rap in the 90’s and early 20’s,but slowly the music just wasn’t good anymore to me and then when rappers started calling white people guests  I checked out you can have it,I started listening to everything in the past that I missed out on because I was obsessed with rap and it was nice finding new music to listen to.
I’m an old white guy. Grew up in DC long time ago and knew rap/hip hop/go-go music from an early age. It WAS part of my culture. Like I’m in 3rd grade hearing Chuck Brown “We Need Some Money”. 

Now, the only people that are giving me any grief for enjoying the music are either IRL white people or online black people. 

Not one black person has ever said shit. If anything they’ll be like “oooo shit, what you know about Chuck Brown?” And then I drop the nugget that I used to work on his car way back in my 20s. Then it’s just one big happy conversation. 

One time a buddy of mine wanted to go to a rock concert with me. He’s black and to him this concert was like the epitome of white people activities. After the show we’re walkin back to the train station and he just blurts out “man, yall crackas know how to party man! Nobody got in a fight, everybody was cool with me being there”. I was like “cool with you?” And he goes “yeah man, I’m black bruh, worry about that shit all the time” and man that sucked to hear him say that with such finality. 

Anyway, just let people enjoy what they wanna enjoy. Within reason of course lol

These are definitely not the words of a legit Black American, who created, lived, died for and breathed the culture. Definitely the words of a black immigrant or a white man who looks like Asher Roth. Need someone to cue the John Williams Superman theme, cuz the cape is flappin’ my guy.

I digress - white hip hop FANS are not called guests. White or Non black hip hop artists who cosplay black men and make a gazillion dollars are called guests because of two reasons : 

1) They are. They didn’t go through the struggles to create and make the genre mainstream and they don’t intimately know the culture because they and their predecessors didn’t live it and 

2) if we don’t gate keep, you’ll have articles 100 years from now stating that Eminem was the #1 reason why hip hop is successful and how the origin of Rap was a collaborative effort between the races, which is false.

Black Americans made the mistake of not gate keeping and labeling guests with Country and Rock and look at who’s the face of it now. We’re guests in genres that WE created.
I think it's more to do with the genre's origin.

I'm from Scotland, so most shows I go to are predominantly white.

I've never really felt like a guest. Hip hop speaks to me.

However, I'm well aware I have no experience of what the African American struggles are.

Although hip hop allows me to understand and empathise, it'll never be a substitute for the real experience. Is this what you meant by being a guest?
Cause they love to consume the art but when actual issues arise a lot stay home and quiet. But we’re all guilty of this to some degree
I’ve been commenting on the beef a lot (on IG where I have my white face as my profile pic) and fully expected to be told to “move on honky” or something like that but everyone’s just been going back and forth with me like normal. I don’t personally thinks it’s as big a deal as it used to be.
🌽🌽🌽
One aspect of white privilege is being able to feel like you have the right to be wherever you are. So, I don't think most of us are paying any attention to whether we're treated as guests, ever, anywhere. I think it would be better if more white folks recognized that, but it is what it is.
Because it’s an outsider loooking in type of deal, if you do to Europe  and invest there you aren’t European you are a ally just be that. Why try to add more steps this is why we lose so much because we cause have no boundaries.
I like what I like. You can too. It doesn't matter what I look like, or what you look like, or where we came from, or how much money either of us have. 

It's music. Everyone agrees on the importance and benefit of music, regardless of what type. All this protection and shielding of a genre over some aged racist 'white boy bad' attitude is ridiculous.
Because white people naturally tend to colonize even in music. Look what happened to rock and roll and House music. /s
Because they can't sing along because the "lyrics" are racist AF full of n-bombs?
Who cares if they are treated as guests? Does that mean white people can’t enjoy rap anymore? If anything with them generally making up most of the population and having more wealth (as a whole), they’re able to access and “appreciate” it by what you said which is going to concerts, buying merch, and even having the time/education to dissect hip hop. By the way, it’s easier for people to study it when you’re observing it as an outsider as opposed to someone living through what rappers are rapping about. There’s privilege in that and if someone doesn’t see that, I don’t know what to say. 

Of course white fans can genuinely appreciate the music but they will remain guests because hip hop is derived from black culture and still today mostly within black culture. Being a guest isn’t even bad, it’s an honor to have access and appreciation for it. Would you get upset if you can’t call someone Japanese if they love Japanese culture and travel to Japan multiple times a year? They can still be a guest of the country and appreciate all Japan has to offer but still at the end of the day will never be Japanese.
I’m a white elder millennial woman and the first time I heard Tupac was California love in the last seat of my sixth grade bus. It changed my life. It shifted the focus of my entire life and the way I see the world. It was my first foray into the world of injustice and what it’s like to be black in America. Due to that one song, my bookshelf is now filled with books about black history, MLK, Malcolm X, Compton, and the 1960s. I, personally, feel it is our duty as a white person in rap/hip/hop to do the research and educate ourselves to the stories behind the songs, the history of the lives of these men and women. We cannot enjoy their art without understanding and appreciating their plight.
Snoop Dogg played at a little one day fest here in Omaha ,NE years ago. It was all Ska and reggae bands and then snoop as the co-headliner. All day, the crowd was overwhelmingly white people. As soon as Snoop came on, there was a dramatic shift in the crowd, and as soon as he was done, it went right back.
It’s the last thing black people have and they don’t wanna see Macklemore be number 1
I think this issue is just complicated but has ignorance on both sides. I don’t think white people or any race called “guests” in hip hop music. The whole point of music is shared experience. I would like to share my experience with someone else. That’s at least my opinion. In a perfect world would African Americans be the primary demographic that consumes and supports hip hop monetarily? I mean yea considering that the music is often made by African Americans about their experience. However poorer people can’t go to concerts and buy merch as much. There are poor people of all colors however they are disproportionately POC. So then it’s just whoever likes the music who has the money to support. I think it’s a little naive to think that hip hop as a whole isn’t special for POC/people who grew up in the culture. Even for the guys who are white but grew up in mostly black areas they have a lot of overlap but it’s still not quite the same. Regardless I do think it’s stupid to gatekeep people from listening or learning about hip hop just because they’re skin color that’s dumb. Idk if I made a point here just some thoughts
I'm a 41 year old white guy, and I've been a hip hop fan since I was 11. When I rap, I only speak about things that I've actually experienced instead of mimicking what I listen to. Have sometimes been seen as a novelty, but I've never been treated as if I don't belong. Out in the real world, where it's not just words on a screen, you can pick up on somebody's vibe. Melanin content doesn't matter as much.
My family is South Philly Italian, my dad ran with the mob before I was born, my brother was in gangs my whole life (still in and out of prison 30 years later) so I was always around some kind of hard life. I remember when I was like four years old my brother brought me into his room and was like "this is the sound, you need to listen and learn" and he played NWA for me. Ever since that day, I was obsessed with hip-hop, and this was the time when MTV was really starting to peak, so I had access to a lot of mainstream gangster rap.

The first job I told my mom I wanted when I was a kid was to be a Breakdancer, I used to practice in the living room. When I was old enough, I started signing up for those free music CD mailers, I had over 300 CDs. The funny part was my mom paid for every single one of them and never said anything about it. I was listening to Tribe, Gangstar, Scarface, Wu, E40, Too Short, rap was my life from eight years old until today. I may not be able to identify directly with the culture because I'm not black, but I identify with the music because I understand what it represents.

I remember when I was 10, Wu-Tang forever had just came out, I went onto some fan website I found through AOL and printed up all of the lyrics to every single song and learned them front to back. It inspired me to write, and I still write lyrics to this day. When I hear new shit like future and all that, I can't get really excited about it, but when I hear artists like Kendrick, I can't help but be taken back to when I was a kid. 

Rap may not be a part of my heritage, but it's embedded in my heart. Fuck the police, wu tang forever. ✌️
Because white people historically notoriously stole culture from black people while simultaneously demonizing black culture AND minimizing the black experience. Then hip-hop came around in a more “woke” era for the time and the people creating it have worked hard to make sure that it’s well known as black culture. 
I love white people ✊
I'm a black person that's a fan of music (rap to rock) and what I've noticed about the difference between the show/concert experience is, as a black person, my funds are limited. I don't have the disposable income of some of my white counterparts.
As a white hip-hop fan I’ve never felt like I’m a “guest” it seems to me when you respect the art and artists you get the same in return. Are there a a small minority of people who may act like white people shouldn’t enjoy hip-hop? Sure. But any group/fanbase is gonna have people with an inability to be accepting.
I'm a white hip hop fan and was always confused why some people race-gatekeep it so hard. What do you think happens when something goes mainstream in the USA? That's just simple cut and dry demographics. Even though the number has been falling, the United States is still a mostly white country- last census says 57%, with second place being Hispanic/Latino at 18%. That means its literally impossible for something to "go mainstream" and not have white fans.
Most hip hop fans in America and Canada are white, just due to demographic reasons. Once you hit mainstream success, most of your fans are white. I’m white for the record, but I think as long as you go into an environment and show proper respect, people will recognize that.
But I am a guest.
[removed]
I feel like it’s because a lot of white fans are newer to the genre, and haven’t really looked into the historical significance.   We might be called guests, but white hip hop heads who grew up in the culture don’t really feel like typical “guests”, if that makes sense.  

More like the homie that your wife is friendly with and your kids call uncle…… that can walk in, check your pantry, and turn on your Xbox and the whole family is just like “alright cool”.  Like he’d let you do at his crib.  I feel more like that kind of guest.

I brought a cassette single of “gangstas paradise” to show and tell in kindergarten/1st grade.   I haven’t listened to many other genres since.   I’m not going anywhere and never felt unwelcome (I’m from Chicago)
The young whites also have more blogs and internet information about rap artist the culture was brought and colonized by whites with that also came a change in the way the music was put out thats why you have rap & real hip hop . Yall can keep the trap / rap / government weaponized rap . Oh yea I saw small village in china where the old elderly women wake up every morning and rap as a crew  . insane how the culture has traveled I remember when you didn’t even hear hip hop on tv or radio whites hated it. Respect to the whites who make real hip hip iLL bill , el-p, aseop rock , alchemist, and a bunch of others !
I grew up in a mostly black area, and went to a mostly black school. I was introduced to hip hop when I was young, most of my friends listened to it, and a lot of my family did too. I never felt like I was treated as a “guest” by my friends, classmates and neighbors. I was treated like I was part of the community, even if being white meant that there were parts of the culture I didn’t have to struggle with. I think the difference between being treated like a guest vs being treated like part of the community is your respect and understanding of the subject manner. 

I had plenty of other white friends, friends who didn’t live in these communities, who loved listening to the music, many of them casually using the nword despite being pale as snow, and who started doing percs and xans solely because it was “cool.” Tons of white artists have been accepted into the culture, hell, Eminem is the best selling hip hop artist in the world, and has made songs with most of the biggest names in rap and R&B, because he clearly understands the culture, and his place in it.
Cause that shit ain’t hip
Because it was created by black people created it and that should never be washed over
As a white guy I think that most, if not all rap songs, are so culture derived that when listening/feeling/embracing the music, I am still a guest to the ultimate meaning.  I can relate to financial struggles.  I can relate to losing a girl, a friend, family member.  I know what its like to get the shit kicked out of you or jumped.  I know what its like going to jail.   
  
What I can't relate is having the color of your skin effect a persons DAILY life, regardless of position or power.  I do not know what its like to be black and how the world, at least in the us, treats black people.  I have eyes, and I can see how black people are treated, but I can't begin to fathom how that actually feels.  I have experienced discrimination but maybe only once in my entire life which is incomparable to the life long discrimination many black people experience.  Thats why I think some whites are guests.  We can embrace the culture, but until the entirety of my race in this country is subjugated to another race, I will never understand the decades/centuries long impact it has on black people.  Rap is one of the biggest way I see the black community talk about, discuss, demonize and celebrate the end of slavery/Jim Crow/discrimination as well as trying to further equality and promoting black success and my white opinion isn't needed.  What is needed is my support for the black community and me going into MY community and be an advocate and voice for the black community.
Because we didn't invent it and it's a culture we're adjacent to.
I never quite understood the whole "guest" thing.  My father grew up with Vietnam Protest music and knew the importance of not censoring anything.  When I asked for my first rap album (Cypress Hill Black Sunday) as he was reading off the song titles and you could hear the disagreeing in his voice, he literally said "My parents took away my music and I will not take away yours. Just don't repeat the words to anyone".  I owe my WHITE dad for my love of hip-hop.  He didn't have to agree with the genre, he agreed with the fact that it shouldn't be censored.
Only ignorant people call them guests. They’ve supported and have been the largest consumer of Hip Hop for decades and it’s not even close.
In the uk hip hop still gets a predominantly black audience at shows but I have found rap and hip hop crowds far more accepting of me than metal crowds who are usually full of egos
At the end of the day, it's all just race baiting. 

People can't enjoy shit anymore. It's all about divide and conquer, and your average American is dumb enough to fall for their race baiting tactics.

Ever notice that when the citizens unite on things (occupy Wallstreet, etc), the next day, headlines are all about racism, sexism, bigotry, appropriation, separation, and fear mongering?

They paint everything with the sins of our ancestors so that they can keep the culture divided and fighting over stupid shit like who's a guest in a music genre, instead of arguing over actual shit like taxes, human rights, law reform, etc.

Divide-Conquer. Hip-hop is just one of the things they use to push that same agenda.

My advice would be: Don't listen to the bullshit and  enjoy the music for what it is, and include anyone you think is showing love and respect to the genre, no matter their skin color or background.
Because the whole fucking country is obsessed with race (and more accurately, skin color)?
As a brown person, it's always been interesting watching black and white people fight and constantly being told to pick a side.

Humanity is a dysfunctional family.
I'm a white person, and I love hip hop. Been listening to it since I first heard Eminem on the radio and since Linkin Park introduced me to Jay Z. But I don't blame people for considering me a guest. My parents didn't listen to hip hop, with the most they've listened to being MC Hammer and Will Smith. I was also born in Ohio to a military family, so it's not like I grew up in the culture either. Probably doesn't help that I'm not big on the newer stuff and spend most of my time listening to Pac, Biggie, Method Man, Ghostface Killah, OutKast, etc.

Despite that I do love the genre, considering it second only to rock in my preference.
My personal opinion, I think it’s like that because hip-hop is one of the few things that we as a culture are credited for and can call our own. It’s no secret that a lot of our history, cultural, and ancestral connections have been lost because of the actions of other groups of people’s actions.  

My personal issue with people who aren’t black but support the culture is that they pick and choose when they want to be apart of the team. At the end of the day, they don’t have the same struggles we have, just like we don’t have the same struggles they do. I’m a black man everyday, they’re a part time black person. I see no difference if you were a white guy born in the suburbs who adopted hip-hop and the culture from a hispanic person born in the black neighborhood who only knows black culture. 

To wrap this up, there are some people who aren’t black who knows more about hiphop and the culture than me, or some other black guys. But at the end of the day, you’re a “guest” or and “outsider” no matter how much you preach about black love, or equality, or improve this, or how much money you invest to the culture. I love anime, I’ve lived in Japan for a little bit, I love their food, I think their traditions are interesting and my girl is Japanese but at the end of the day I’m just a “guest” or an “outsider” to her culture. Even if I moved there permanently, or learned Japanese or even became a citizen of Japan. I’m missing the fundamental piece I’m not Japanese 

Or in the case of your question “They’re not black”
It’s a culture gatekeeping sort of thing. I honestly don’t think it’s as prevalent as it may seem, but as with almost any topic, the most extreme 5% is the most vocal, and going to account for 90% of anything you hear or see about it. 

I think most people are happy to have elements of their culture experienced and celebrated by people from different backgrounds, and you seldom hear from them. The ones that want to keep it for themselves are usually also the ones who claim they’re misunderstood, they’re being marginalized, etc.. not realizing it’s their own prejudices putting them in that box and alienating them from new experiences/different people. That goes for white people, black people, Asian people, Hispanics, and everyone else I didn’t mention. 

I think most of the country (USA) is cool with experiencing and taking part in elements of different cultures, and it is again the loudest 5% on each side making it seem like there’s animosity and gatekeeping, furthering the cycle for the next generation to continue hating based on skin color or country of origin.
Stop thinking about things from a racial point of view
Because it’s like gentrification.

Eventually it gets to a point where white people are telling you what it means to be black.
because they are guests
Sorry, that’s an ignorant statement made by ignorant people, hip hop is worldwide. The claim to say my people created it or founded it is has not been disputed, but to say someone is a guest is just ridiculous.
I’d imagine white people’s history of stealing black culture has a lot to do with it
Maybe hip hop is a cia control tactic and the white money just pushes it forward
r/asablackman
Just in general, we should exploit the fact that we all speak the same language to come up with more words for the different processes happening around cultural production, promotion, consumption, and protection. 

Re: protection
I see gatekeeping being used in this thread as a negative and then some people here flipping it as a positive. I’m not the boss of english, but it seems like the pro-gatekeeping folks are saying 2 different things:
1) Some are saying “hell nah, keep ‘em out”
2) And others are saying “we need to be mindful of who comes in and how”

I wish there were more words here then, cause though both are what a gatekeeper does, one is more like a strict bouncer (who is/not on the list) and the other is more like a garden tender (“can this thing work with whats already going on here?”)

Production/consumption:
Theres a false binary going on about who is “investing.”
It is unfortunate that the white OP is framing this in a way that leaves out the INDISPENSABLE reality that (as said better by other commentators here) if you knew the history or many/most/all of the big names in hip hop being invested in by white fans with lots of cash to spend (ahem…)—then you’d know it was black communities and black fans who were the first initial backers and investors, so to speak. The GOATs didnt just show up at some sorority in Durham and play a show for 10k and then two years later its sold out stadiums. They started with mix tapes, battles, by being part of the culture -that culture being black culture. Cool, white people are the major concert goers now that a hip hop act has broken big. But be real, if those artists werent hearing their mixtapes getting love in the clubs or on local radio (by black folks) they prolly wouldnt be where they are now period. 

I’m white and i can say with high confidence as an insider: most white people cannot hold in their minds how they feel about a thing while also understanding where things actually come from and how they got to where they are today. Its like a cognitive bias curse of living in disney fantasies about our shared histories.
He used a black emoji.


Seems legit.
Wow what a decent and respectful perspective first and foremost. I grew up in Leeds England in the 80s I went to school with everyone from Chinese and Indian kids and 2 of my best friends are black Jamaicans my dad introduced me to gangstas paradise when I was about 10 it was the big hit in the UK at the time then I started listening to snoop dogg and fell in love with hip hop now me and my best friend listen to everything from Anderson paak to run the jewels we've got a massive collection between us a favourite of mine we've just been listening to is iron-man by ghostface raekwon and cappadonna I'd like to think we've all come along way from gatekeeping dope shit behind racism there's good people in every walk of life there's also complete shit stains on society just be a good person and share the arts.
Not sure what you mean. I’m black and have heard many stories of the white crowds showing up and going crazy at shows, and it is well received and appreciated. Not sure what you want more than that lol
As a white British bloke I don’t know that I’ve never felt like a guest as such but I’m conscious enough to know that I can’t necessarily experience the world in the way that black artists talk about so I guess there is always a level of separation there regardless of my love of the genre and culture.

I think it speaks to how Eminem became so huge though because I can absolutely relate to what he speaks about AND it’s in the genre of music I love 

That all might be bollox though I don’t know. I would guess we all have a lot more in common than we don’t but division is the norm now so we concentrate on the differences in race/culture rather than the commonalities of being a human being in a crappy world.
Probably because of the history behind this art. I got a massive amount of love for this craft, even to the point of writing raps for myself. But that doesn't make the history any less true when we've had people that claim to love the culture, but have no respect for it who would do nothing but come in and try to make a profit. Unfortunately, a great deal of those people have been white (Ex. Tom McDonald, Vanilla Ice ect. Ect.) So the culture is extremely protective over who it lets in, simply because at face value, many don't know what certain white folks intentions are. And as a byproduct, I'm not sure if we'll be looked at in a favorable way in this sphere because of how our peers have acted. But, we do what we do and we love what we love. Personally, at this point I've just accepted that it comes with the territory, weather I like it or not.
Thank you for posting this if only just to spark some conversation. 

I am one of the stereotypical suburban white teens from the late 80’s and early 90’s that listened to NWA Dre and Snoop etc. I won’t get too far into why I preferred that genre over rock (although Pearl Jam and the grunge era got me too) but my interest has picked back up since having teenagers that listen to Drake, Kendrick, Key Glock, Moneybagg etc. 

I love the music as a middle aged white haired man. That said, I’m ok being seen as a visitor. As much as I love it, with what I generally listen to, I can only listen/hear the perspective of the artists it comes from and I accept that I cannot fully understand it. 

Finally—as for the flip side of what I described, I had an Uber driver last week in Memphis who didn’t fit the stereotypical listener of country music. It was awesome. He was singing along to Aldean when I admitted to him that he was challenging my personal biases. We laughed and he explained why he listens to it and we laughed that I have picked up listening to the Memphis scene over the last few years. We agreed it’s all just “telling stories” and “painting pictures”

Man that was a good conversation.

Same thing with reggae and jazz and any other form of black art it’s not meant for them but they are the main consumers. And they are that consumers they are not a part of the culture. If you can’t say N*gga you are a guest 🤷🏾‍♂️
I would say that it's because the black people in question are petty racists. They've grown up hearing about racism towards them from whites and, rather than strive for a world where nobody's racist at all (which would require them to act like grown-ups), they prioritize getting revenge by looking for opportunities to turn the tables on white people, not understanding (or caring) that the white people in question were never racist towards them to begin with and that the vast majority of this racism was way before their time.

The ideal outcome is that we all enjoy hip-hop together. It shouldn't matter what somebody's race is.
I find it really interesting that the only people who have ever told me that I couldn’t rap because I’m white were other white people
Great topic bro , this is so true coming from a black guy. I would agree that it’s not really about color imo but more so characteristics *allah mac miller*jim Carey.. basically anybody who accepts and respects the culture is a part of the culture. I’d love to hear ya feedback on this
I only feel like a guest in certain moments. For instance, the moment Kendrick told Drake he couldn’t use a specific word anymore, I knew that was a discussion where I don’t really belong. In those moments, I’m very aware of being a white person in a black space. The rest of the time, I don’t feel like a guest at all.
All I know is I fell in love with rap. I don't claim it as my culture, tho I'm versed in a lot more of the history and such than the cliche white boy imo lol. (Ik how white I sound saying that)

Idk that I feel like a guest, me and the boys turning each other on to new music all the time, so in my circle it's just as much a shared passion regardless of race.

 Tho, I understand the guest concept for two main reasons.

 One being that historically how its been created/developed/used is obviously originating from black culture. White people and many other races have had influence enough to all own their own style of music at this point, for many generes. Fact remains.

Secondly, there ARE some real fuckin goddamn posers that try way too hard and throw the nword around casual af and don't know shit about hiphop nor respect it more than enjoying its sound. A few bad apples really does have a stigma whether it's true for one race or another. Be a fan of whatever you like, just watch what youre stepping on i guess. 

So I accept the guest ideology in ways, I also just don't feel labeled by it because I like what I fuckin like no apologies. People get upset over nothing so if we gotta pick our battles then Guest terminology ain't worth it fr.

What I love most about rap are the stories. Jesus christ, things are written so eloquently sometimes. I feel like the most impactful stories to me were those that showed their life in such a way that I gained new perspectives growing up. 

Not to trivialize other skinned artists and their impact of course, but what I was taught by hiphop was majority thru black hip-hop.
[deleted]
So i am white. Love hip hop. White people can perfectly support the music (bar singing along the N word) but i hate the stigma against white people partaking or even being artists in the scene, bar mac miller, we are all seen as corny. Hip hop is black mainly, but its not defined by skin colour, its also class system, its against the (typically white ) 1 percent. Hip hop should be for all, and again, no offence, skin colour should be irrelevant
I’m a white as snow cowboy ass MF that grew up in the sticks. I heard NAS’s illmatic when i was a kid and I’ve been into rap ever since. I ain’t no guest, I’ve been here lol. I listen to rap, edm, red dirt country music and everything in between. Good music is good music. The color of the artists skin and the color of my skin doesn’t make a damn bit of difference.
Idk man, it's music at the end of the day. I'm not a midwestern white dude, but I love Bob Dylan and can feel what he's singing about. I'm not from Harlem, but I feel what Qtip's rapping about on Electric Relaxation. Good music speaks to the human condition and taps into an intangible part of our collective soul. I try not to pay attention to people with narrow perspectives on what music's actually about and who it's "for".
This question feels strange from a "black" man, but what you're saying is true; especially about the shows. they definitely come out and support. They can participate, they just cant openly dictate things within it because they dont have the full foundation of cultural understanding (its just facts). They dont have to live it. They just visit it and love it. Therefore they are "guests" 

you might be a guest too lol
I'm white.  IDC whether I'm treated like a guest.  I think I probably am.  I fuck with the sound and if people hate on me for loving on it, then I'm fine with that.
I grew up on classic rock and R&B from my father. In middle school we moved to an area that was predominantly black. I started hearing the samples from late 80s rap and was hooked. I started bringing my vinyl to my new friends' house parties and learned to cut and scratch. Eventually became a decent DJ. Saw a lot of great hip hop on the come up like Outkast. Often times I looked like that little white dot when you turned off an old TV. I definitely ran into gatekeepers along the way but less than than people seem to encounter now. I'm not saying I never code switched or co-opted some culture but it was always out of love.
I’m a white guy and have been a fan of hip hop my entire life. That said I have no problem with being treated as a guest…because I am a guest. Hip hop is mainly an art made by black people for black people commenting on the lives and experiences of black people.

I also love and appreciate that art but am fully aware it is not specifically for me and never will be.
I’ve never felt treated as a guest. It’s silly. The notion that it’s an exclusively black culture is entirely false. Look at any old footage. It was black/hispanic/white kids. The neighborhoods it started in were more exclusively poor than exclusively black. Not to mention when hip hop went from the streets to the clubs, it was the punk clubs that gave them a chance, nobody else wanted them around. And don’t forget, before Rick Rubin commercial hip hop was more like a sub-genre of disco. Kurtis Blow/ Sugar Hill soft shit. I grew up in the 90s hip hop scene and it was white people outside the culture that saw it as a black thing. Nobody involved in it ever noticed or cared at all. It was always about the art
Racism
You can’t buy your way into the cookout. 20 years ago they couldn’t relate to 95% of the content of the music and trying to do so was colonial at best. These new artist tho? They can have them.
I think people often misconstrue hip-hop with blackness.

I like to look at examples of authentic hip-hop artists. For instance, the only time I've ever wanted to be white was in 8 mile white. Eminem was like, "I'm a piece of white trash. I say it proudly!"

He didn't try to portray blackness. He displayed authenticity in his American experience.  

Another great example was Childish Gambino's CAMP album. Nothing made him seem gangster by any means.
It’s because they and anybody else are guest if all they are is a consumers because hip hop is more then music
I’m sure this comment section will be chill.
I never understood this whole guest thing. By this logic,  POCs are guests in everything white men have invented. That includes all other American music,  Hollywood,  western clothes, computers, internet,  television, and most of western civilization. Hilarious.
Idk the answer beyond the simple population and socioeconomic status differences but I feel King Los summed it up perfectly at the end of his LALeekers freestyle #95.
I’m white and grew up in South Africa for the first 14 years of my life,we were lower middle class but lower middle class in South Africa is close to lower class in most countries than it is to upper class(we could afford to eat,have a computer,have a TV and 2 cars(one of them was a company car that was free and had free gas),all my friends were either black or west asian(I had 2 white friends up until I moved) and my neighbourhood was generally poor and next to a very poor neighbourhood,I have seen gang activity first hand, I have seen people get shot,stabbed and publicly shamed (a man was stripped down and getting whipped by multiple other men), I have had people close to me get killed because of street crime, I have seen genuine racism first hand (police brutality for example) and with most of my friends being black I have heard about their struggles first hand. Seeing as this was my environment growing up I obviously got exposed to lots of hip hop from a very early age,people often think that I’m trying to act black by listening to hip hop and not listening to most “white music” I’m not trying to act black I’m just relating to what I grew up around, I have street smarts and my neighbourhood was bad enough that I couldn’t walk around alone. My school was across the road from a street that was notorious for having trap houses and they would constantly get raided by police,the only music I really heard was rap I never heard anything else unless it was from the radio in my parents car, I still remember when tpab released and it was massive in the country, I was only 9 but remember hearing alright all the time. I love hip hop and black culture because it’s what surrounded me as a child.I know the struggles that black people face without facing them myself and I know the pain that racism has caused seeing as atleast where I grew up the hard R was still used all the time as a slur to cause hate and an Afrikaans word with similar meaning. 

TLDR:I’m white but grew up in a kinda crappy neighbourhood with only black friends in Africa and got exposed to only black media,the only white influence in my life has been from direct family members.

I’m 18 btw
White guy weighing in. 

I don't think the "investment" matters. 

The fact that  hip hop music and culture can't be bought out, diluted, or dominated by white investment is a defining characteristic.  Both are unapologetically and inherently black. 

"Blackness" isn't a thing I can "invest" my way into. I'm a guest. It is what it is.
Because there's way more white people in the US and they have a fuck ton more money. So the all white crowds you see are more a result of gentrification not being better fans.
When I went to rap shows in 2007-15 the vibe was very welcoming for all people, colors and sizes. We wanted everyone to share the same experience together and be safe. Some shows were a little violent and unwelcoming because we’d have kids from the NYC come up and a few gang fights would break out. But no one fucked with you unless you gave someone a reason to. 

My favorite show was Hopsin. He brought up people on stage to battle rap. Bro freestyled 90% of his set and let others hop on the mic to hit a their own verse or two. It was the most intimate I’ve seen a group of people together. Truly amazing looking back. That was what rap was for me.
Imagine a guest coming for a visit and then deciding to unpack and call it their own. That's not how that works. What has that person done to build this house? Visiting it after its already been built makes you a guest, not a founder. Nothing wrong with being a guest, but respect my home if you wanna be welcomed back. 
They're guests because they're visiting a home someone else already built 
How ignorant. Music has no color or gender identity
Honestly, I would expect someone who grew up on rock (as you stated in the comments) to make such a tone deaf and naive comment about hiphop. 

Do you have the slightest clue how white investments have historically led to theft, pillage and the dismemberment of entire cultures, heritages and communities? So to suggest that we let OUR art form that WE created that is deeply rooted in OUR African American experience and culture go unprotected simply because white people “invest” is so incredibly ignorant and foolish. 

Do better black man, do better! smh.
truth is we have several defective and destructive mindsets that have become our "culture". look at everyone crying about caitlin clark getting attention but the same losers don't support any black female players or the wnba period. but wake up day after day crying racism as if racism made her set all those college records and racism makes her "own" actually show up.
Just let us say the word so we don't fuck up the flow.
So, I don't say this to discredit you at all, but maybe just to provide some perspective.  I have a background of at one point studying economics and a statistic that always stuck with me was that (at the time of this study) the average white family in America had something like $160,000 in 'familial wealth' compared to black families at around $16,000.  I don't recall the study well enough to cite it, but the numbers stuck with me.  So if you are making the argument on a basis of who invests more just be aware that just for it to be equal on a per dollar basis we would expect white people to invest a minimum of 10x more just because they have 10x more to invest.  


Beyond that I think there are just cultural reasons.  I am a white boy, and growing up for me hip hop was a way to are a step out of my 'whiteness'.  That is going to have a powerful allure.  I am a huge hip hop head, have a set of turntables and do some music production, all that.  The fact is I am still a guest in the sense that if I wanted to code switch tomorrow I could pretend to have none of those interests, talk as 'white' as possible, and go apply to some job where i only get hired because I'm "one of the good ole' boys" (wink-wink).  I am a guest in the sense that I have always felt welcomed, but the fact is I can pack up and leave anytime I want to with none of the baggage.


Also as an aside I think some of yall have maybe gotten used to interacting with the type of white folks who are really into hip hop, and if that is what comes to mind for you for an average white person it will give you a skewed view.  Most of my friends are black, and one thing I will always tell them when it comes up is that they would be shocked to hear what white folks would say to me in private, I guess just assuming that because I am white I would agree or be ok with it.  I am white and I mostly don't fuck with white people, so I am biased in my own way, but it's mostly because of stuff like I just mentioned.
R/AsABlackMan
Racism
nah that last sentence is weird as fuck
As a white dude, I've never really run into the "you're a guest" type of black dudes. I just consider them an internet myth like so many other types of people you will never actually meet in the real world.
People are kind of on this “cultural vulture” thing where if you’re not directly descended from that culture, any sort of reference or use of a culture is appropriation. 

Which is bullshit. There is actual cultural appropriation - taking something with no respect or care given to the original culture and/or acting like it is originally yours - and then there’s everything else. 

It’s especially annoying to me when we are talking about music - because learning from other’s people’s music and applying it to your own and playing what you want to play is what music is all about. 

Drake was called a vulture because he’s intentionally taking aspects of black culture to make himself more appealing to people in that culture - not just because he’s half white and rapping. But even some of the anti-Drake folk have this wrong and are calling him a vulture for the wrong reasons. 
Because we (black folks) have been disenfranchised in such a ways (slavery, red lining, burning down of black Wall Street) that we have less than half the net worth of the white crowd. Hard to buy for concert tickets when we are broke.
Blacks, Hispanics, and indigenous peoples are the only significant groups in the US that live mostly below the poverty line. That means that a minority of a minority is even able to financially support artists, when contrasted with the majority of the majority group. It is fucking stupid to look at the numbers and then wonder why there are so many white people in the crowd. There are more of them, and they are better positioned to pay for the experience. 

Plus they get to like hip hop. This shit started in the park, but that was a long time ago.
To answer your question- why are white hip hop fans considered ‘guests’?

One’s culture is specific to them. I’m not refuting the fact that many white Americans, especially in black areas have a cultural background filled hip hop appreciation. Still, there are many aspects/motifs in hiphop that non black Americans cannot relate to on the SAME level as black Americans. E.g. Police Brutality, systemic racism, being racially stereotyped. This isn’t to say that all hiphop artists reference these topics but rather that these topics are engrained into the DNA of the genre. So much of the genre is art that is expressing the black American experience. Just as a trust fund baby cannot truly relate to a rags to riches story, a typical white man will cannot truly relate to most hiphop (at least on the level of the typical African American). This isn’t to say they cannot appreciate, support, and empathize with hiphop wholeheartedly; but that their cultural background makes them a cultural guest. And their critiques (if they have any) are made from the outside looking in.
I’ll never forget being 1 of 10 black dudes at a sold out Kendrick show in Florida. I thought I was at the wrong show till dude walked on stage.
Because we invest less as a percentage but jave a higher population to crowd out shows with. I think we've reached a point where the culture of hip hop has a lot of sub cultures within it. Some, where it makes sense for white people to still see themselves as guests and most, where it doesn't really apply that well anymore. But the investment of money and headcount shouldn't be overvalued. It's not like the black population of the u.s. can just decide to multiply in size and spending power. But I'd pretty confidently bet that a larger portion of the population is significantly more invested in hip hop even outside the creation and growth of it that modern fans still obviously benefit from.      
       
I also think that being a guest is a less than ideal term and a lot of us probably interpret it differently. Most of the time is should be as simple as 'you can't be a white racist hip hop fan without being a walking contradiction'
Hip hop is tied to the black struggle, identity, and experience more than most other American music. As a white guy, those are experiences I can't access in the same ways. I can connect on the poverty angles or some of the political or radical elements. Also, while there are many many white fans who respect the genre and it's roots, there are way more casuals who only respect the superficial or commercial asthetics without really understanding the culture. Especially if you grew up in an area with very few if any black folk to get authentic perspectives of those experiences.
If anyone wants me to listen to country instead of rap then it would be by means of punishment only
If you want a real answer it’s probably (and I’m speaking generally here) because a lot of black people I’ve met do not enjoy the thought of white people sharing in anything they’ve deemed as “their culture” regardless of if it actually is or not. 

Rap is a big thing in their community so I get that stance but they’re definitely not quiet about the fact they don’t want us there because we’re trying to take over it or something.
I’m 48 so I grew up when the music started to explode and eventually took over as the most popular form of music 30 years ago. Most white people, especially under 40 now rap is all they know. They don’t remember rock being king and grew up with the hybrid rock/rap music like limp biscuit
I think white people generally look at it as music/entertainment. People are genuinely fans of the music and artwork and don’t go based on the race of the performers. Nobody is a guest. You either like the music or you don’t.
Nobody with any sense treats people differently because of their skin color, period. That’s all there is to be said about it.
As a white man, I appreciate this post.
I'm the whitest rap girl fan by far!! I don't talk ghetto I come from the good side of town and I've loved rap since middle school!! I do date black guys and everyone assumes I like rap because of my ex. I don't get offended I love to impress others with my rap knowledge.  I like the hardest shit too tupac, nas, dmx are my top 3. I know all the words and love to rap along!! It surprises people cause I act really white honestly I hate the ghetto white girls...it's mostly fake!! I find I get respect after I prove.im a real fan not a fake one trying to impress people. My question for black people is this do u get offended if a white person raps along and says the nword? I try to just skip it so I don't offend anyone...and honestly I love the music so much even if every other rap fan disrespected me and called me fake I wouldn't give a fuck
Black people are also racists.
You’re implying that black people don’t support or INVEST in hip-hop. Idk if you realize that, but that’s absurd
Go look at most studio footage from the 90s.. a bunch white boys around the keys 🎹
[removed]
Because it's a genre intrinsically linked to a community and relating to collective problems based in systemic issues, it's not meant for white people to fetishise over what it would be like to be persecuted.
Tf is this? White people want us to thank them for listening to rap now? Y'all are so fucking insecure
Treat others the way you want to be treated
Grew up in a mixed family in NY and several formative teenage years in Fort Lauderdale. The crowds at rap shows were always mixed at most if not mostly Black and Latin American-- BUT, that makes me wonder if the crowd turnouts largely just reflects the geographic demographic of the show town? This post makes me wonder though. Sidenote I know id be a totally different person probably for the worse if I hadn't met these underground rappers in my neighborhood when I was five and thought it was the coolest best thing in all of creation to be a part of. You grow up and understand there are more important things in a way obviously like family and rest and emotional health but music is a big part of that anyway, so in reality there's no dichotomy. This music and what it means can be as important as anything
Black people are treated as guests everywhere in America, even though we have been here 400 years. White people cannot handle when they are not the center of attention
Youre whole perspective sounds like a bash. White people arent the only ones who invest. Who do you think gives these artists the cosign before they really blow up???
Because despite our progress so many people still see race as a big deal and are deciding to be gatekeepers to a gate they don’t own

White people are the biggest hip hop fans
Oh my god would you stfu with all that pandering. Everything you said was valid but still let the white fans post on their own behalf.

![gif](giphy|9nREuIINenE5y)
I'm Scottish and didn't take to hip hop at first (save for a few songs in the charts when I was a kid). That all changed when I discovered Kendrick Lamar around the time good kid m.a.a.d city came out. I can't relate on the level of facing racism, but listening to artists rebel against it made me feel something. Being working class, I felt Kendrick's music (and then many more rappers in general) connected with that poor kid in me who didn't have a whole lot growing up in a shithole. 

Moved to Atlanta for college and was completely immersed in the culture, welcomed in by my friends and got to experience a side of the world that I never thought I would. Now it's one of my favourite genres. 

I'll never lay claim to rap the way I do the Arctic Monkeys or EDM artists that were MINE and part of my culture growing up, but I'm happy I developed a taste for rap and hip hop. It's beautiful.
What a guy. Appreciate that point of view.
Music belongs to EVERYBODY. Period
I’m white. When my brother had his 16th birthday party all I heard was west side connection, (backyard boogie). My mom listen to Mike and Janet from Ohio players to the temptations. My sisters listened to Janet and all the popular bands of the time. I still to this day look like a fool going apeshit to ice cube, wu tang, or Mac Dre.
The white crowds are the ones consuming the culture, which is created by the black artists they're going to see, if that makes sense. It doesn't become your culture just because you bought into it. That would be like buying a Native American reservation and calling yourself a native.

Dont matter how much money u spend with a black artist that dont make u black my guy simple as that

Youre considered guests because hip hop is a part of black culture.
Amen to that. I'm a black kid who grew up on rock, and all I got from my white friends were songs and album recommendations. I had friends in bands too and saw them perform drunk. This shit was awesome. I'm a die-hard hip hop fan, but I'd be damn if I thought rock wasn't my culture as well. Not because it was originated by black folks, but because I created some timeless memories around the genre
This is how I feel. I’ve never been treated as a guest or a vulture by anyone who knew me and how I grew up because it’s just how I live.
shit i grew up in the burbs of north jersey 20 minutes out of NYC and it wasn't all that ghetto aside from a bunch of people being on crack because it was the 1980s, but neighborhoods are definitely redlined and i lived on a block that was the cusp between a white neighborhood and a black neighborhood...being a mixed raced kid who didn't fit in anywhere, at least in 1985 the black kids were more fun and cooler to me than the white kids but i never really fit in strictly on race in any category, and ended up being friends with the freaks and geeks 

i found skateboarding in the late 80s, and through that older kids exposed us to all the music...NYC Hardcore / Metal / Hip Hop and tons of local bands because they were all going to shows and early on it was common for white kids to be into Public Enemy as well as Metallica, at least in my school

thru skateboarding in NYC in the early 90s, I got immersed in graffiti and DJing and that shit basically shaped the path my life has been on since..i dunno, i kinda gravitated more to the underground scene when i was still young and going out where race was less of an issue, especially in the DJ battle / turntablist culture where it's a bunch of fillipinos who use the n-word and black kids who like anime who get really good with turntables anyway

i dunno..i'm probably still a guest to most people on surface level, but my kids have played basketball with Young Zee and gotten a bunch of sick ass hand-me-downs from the graffiti pioneer Zephyr who was a white dude painting subways in 1977 and was in a bunch of early hip hop shit like Style Wars / Wild Style, and hip hop has brought me around the world to paint my name and play beats for people

one thing i'll say though, it's hard to get your friends to support you in underground hip hop...when i was DJ'ing, the parties that were the shadiest with money was the hip hop parties / promoters...the Drum N Bass / Raver parties were always straight with money but hip hop dudes were always mad shiesty..

with shit like underground hip hop and graffiti, sometimes it's more fun to be a hater than a supporter lol
Same here.
Same
I agree with Cyber-Cafe. I have the same type of situation and haven't ever felt like I'm a guest from friends or people around me since that's what I grew up around and liking
I'm white and my experience growing up was very close to yours. I've also gotten the occasional weird look or shitty attitude wearing an Outkast shirt but most people don't care. I don't either.

As far as being guests, yeah I disagree with that. I'm as much a part of it as anyone else is in my humble opinion. But when it comes to the level of an artist who's creating and selling their work to an audience in a capitslist society things do become a little... nuanced. I recommend  F.D. signifiers youtube video on white rappers (which wasn't explicitly pro or against just... nuanced). It was a really good meditation on the topic and I agree with most of what he said
My fatass loves you bro. Stay blessed

Classical music is fkn awesome. Plus learning classical translates well to any genre. Was so easy for me to use my classical training and bring in into my death metal band, just like its easy for me to bring it into hip hop.
(black commenter) Bro, I don't think anyone that's in the industry or has spent a lengthy amount of time outside the US would think that. Some of our absolute classic artists in hip hop wouldn't have made careers or great money if not for the international audiences. I remember catching a De La Soul concert in Germany like 15 years ago and they gave so much love. It warmed my heart because De La was formative for me as a kid.
Wonderful write up.  You covered points I wanted to talk about, but couldn't find the words. Thank you!
I’m glad you took the time out to write this because this is spot on. And for the post, you’re right, it feels extremely naive and just off.
Well said. Everyone ITT should read this post. Thank you.
These are great points, thank you for sharing this perspective.
Love this response! A lot of us white people want kudos for being fans of rappers but we only started liking them once they hit it big.
I love this response. Except they are 100% guest. Like you said this is a black American art form. The same way Mexico has mariachi or Jamaica has reggae. “A guest” is basically saying your welcome to enjoy the music and support the art, but your not welcome to tell us who the best artist is or dictate how we run our culture. Basically enjoy the music but stay in your lane. The same way we wouldn’t have the audacity to tell Mexicans who the best mariachi singer is or how they should make their music.
You absolutely can pick and choose which hip hop songs you enjoy. Political hip hop songs might not appeal to you because theyre heavy handed, poorly written, or you just disagree with the message. That doesn’t mean you’re hypocritical or wrong for enjoying the thousands of apolitical songs that exist in the genre. It’s getting in here is probably an enjoyable song for a lot of people, but something like fuck the police has a specific message which only certain persons will gravitate towards.
And watch what dorks have made throughout history
Couldn’t have said it better myself. I’m a white dude who literally grew up in the suburbs but hip hop drew me in so much that I literally consumed so much content on it and read deep into it and learned the culture because well I’m a dork
Speak for yourself
It's probably worth mentioning for perspective that the US is two-thirds White by population. In terms of consumer demographics White consumers will always outnumber other consumers, all else being equal. 

Black people account for around 13%, while I and my fellow Asians account for around 7%, based on the census numbers. 

I think your point about the socioeconomic status of Black Americans is valid but I think it's simpler than that, for this particular situation at least. 

If there are 40 million black people, 20 million Asian people, and 250 million white people in the US, only 24% of the White population buying an album is the same as 100% of Black and Asian people buying that same album. There are only so many people in the country actively consuming content and most of them are white. 

I think the socioeconomic status influences which demographic is maybe buying the most expensive concert seats but broadly speaking I think it's mainly just a population thing. I see a similar thing going on with K-Pop. I know far more non Koreans who are obsessed with it now because living in the US, I know and encounter more people who aren't Korean than are.
“Black people don’t go to concerts, cause they don’t have money to spend” is a weird take that I see often. If u ever go to a Rod wave concert or someone in that vein, it’s mostly a sea of black people
>Too many black people are still too poor to really do anything in your first paragraph consistently when other priorities come first.

Then why do I see black people at the clubs spending money there all the time?
change "know" to "can see" and you just wrote a decent rap verse lmao
[deleted]
I'm reading through like it's insane people are rolling with this lol. Since when did being a consumer get you a seat on the board? If that's the case I'm telling Nike you owe me. 


OP shops at Target or whatever but never gets the impression he gets to make decisions in that muthafucka, but it should be different for black art?
![gif](giphy|oOTTyHRHj0HYY)
Thank you. I didn’t want to say it because that’s what it is- antiblackness. First of all there are way more white people than black people in the us. Like does OP know how math works? When something goes mainstream it hits a wider audience! That just so happens to be white!! 
And yes white people can enjoy and relate to rap music but they will always be guests in this genre because the music is rooted in the African American experience. That’s an extremely particular and specific lens and it cannot be erased. I mean, I would consider myself to be a little bit of a guest because I’m not African American. I’m Nigerian American. The history of the transatlantic slave trade to the new world and everything that entailed after- is not my story. It could never be. (It’s British colonization and civil wars lol but that’s another story for another day). 
Secondly, I actually support a little bit of gate keeping to a certain extent. Maybe if that were to happen what happened to rock, folk, country and jazz wouldn’t have happened. 
In my opinion white people and especially white people in this thread have absolutely no right to tell black people fuck yall this is my house about a genre of music and way of life that African Americans created through strife, community and ingenuity. African Americans built this shit brick by brick. 
So yeah- you ARE a guest. A welcome guest, I’m sure. A valued and loved guest..
But a guest nonetheless. And it would be best if that’s never forgotten and due respect is always paid. 
I'm a 41 year old white dude, and you're right.  When I was younger, I listened exclusively to rock and metal.  All my friends listened exclusively to rock and metal.  However, one night in like 1999 I think, I was up late at a buddies house watching MTV (back when the M still somewhat stood for MUSIC), and this goofy looking white dude pops up on the screen and says "HI....my name is", and it wasn't just because he was white that I paid attention.  It was different than any rap I'd ever heard.  It was witty, and funny, and didn't take itself too seriously.  I spent the next few minutes staring at the TV, laughing my ass off at this dude just being a goofball in the video, and the lyrics just made me laugh.

From that day forward, I became a serious hip hop fan.  I went back and listened to Pac, and biggie, and wu tang, NWA, etc etc.  I was hooked.  I grew up in a small city near Detroit that we refer to as "Junior Detroit" around here.  I was poor, had to walk everywhere, had a fairly crazy family life, watched friends start slangin to feed themselves while still in high school because their parents were either pieces of shit, or simply couldn't afford it.  Friends and acquaintances died to violence, and drugs, and if you were a teenager and a cop saw you out and about, you were getting fucked with (regardless of skin color).  Basically, I grew up kinda rough, but I know MANY had it worse.

After becoming a rap fan, I began to understand the world around me, and my environment more.  The best thing it did for me was influence.  Ive been playing guitar since I was 6 and had metal bands growing up, but I always kind of felt like we were bland.  Rap gave me sooooo many more types of influence to draw from, and my writing became so much more versatile.  Rap has influenced so many things in my life since then, and helped me through the absolute worst times of my life.  I may have grew up within the culture but I never considered myself part of it until discovered rap and realized much of what they talk about is stuff I went through and saw others go through daily.  It changed my whole life and my outlook on life, and I'll never forget that.
This is the perfect comment. You understand
This is a very solid comment. We live in a country with about 5.5 white people for every black person. And the average white person inheriting about 6 times as much family wealth. This is even a massive improvement given the the median wealth of an African American family almost doubled from 2019 to 2023. 

Even if we ignored direct attempts to overthrow or any malic, without intentionality white people will simply take over any black media once it hits mainstream appeal due to simple population size and spending power. 

Eminem is amazing, especially in his prime, but there a reason the one amazing rapper who is white has almost 2 times the sales of the other goats. There's a reason logic, g-easy, maclemore, and action Bronsin had comment sections full of people saying some vairent of "finally someone making good rap"

I'm white. I fucking love rap music. It's what I grew up on and loved my whole life. Ts the music me and my friends made growing up. Im not a guest. But there's an understanding that you have to carry in the scene that this music fundamentally rose out of the black experience. That it's not just some sterilized art form but something with a history. And a history that involves a lot of pain born out of a legacy of racism and economic discrimination.
Missed me when you mentioned Lil Peep is a clout artist. Ignorant af.
Saying Post Malone and Lil Peep are (were) in it for the clout is a very uneducated statement. Same with your statement on Mac Miller.


Early on, the dude was a white rapper and it is very evident that there was little respect for the culture. Later on when he had matured, he was a rapper who just happened to be white.
Bravooo this guy has the answer!!!

![gif](giphy|AwttwIryJLZodu6UyS)
I felt everything you said but post Malone is actually very talented and he is a very genuine artist.
>Instead of enjoying hip hop as a whole, they tend to only like rap because it is socially acceptable to do so.

Although I’d say there was definitely just a generational  aspect at play here also, since older black people weren’t embracing hip-hop during its genesis either.
Mac Miller and his whole family including his dusty ass mother ripped me and a gallery space off in Pittsburgh. 

They absolutely used and abused the black community in Pittsburgh and have done absolutely dog shit to give back. 

The whole family are nothing but money grubbing vultures.
Honestly this. I love gaining new perspectives and coming from a poor white rural area i didnt really know the other side of the fence. 

A lot has changed since then and i can thank the many rappers who have spoken out about what they went through for that.
Even as an Asian-American growing up in suburban Southern California, I respected the culture & music simply as a platform where artists could be transparent in telling their own stories of their experiences, even if I didn't live my life exactly like them.
[removed]
Yes it would that's literally the definition of fan🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣you should worry way less about skin and enjoy life
Im adding "captain save-the-white-man" to my vocab lmao
I agree with you brother. Honestly I feel more hip hop than black lmao. Any hip hop fan feels like a distant cousin
>Fuck yall trying to kick me out of my home I ain't going nowhere.

Give examples of folks making you feel actually unwelcome. And don't give me some silly shit like they won't give me the n-word pass
Nah, this thread is wild. People came ready with their Cerberus Gatekeeper Shotguns. Imagine some Norwegian dude telling you that you have no valid opinion on black metal because you’re not a Norwegian from the 90s.

If you weren’t at the house party Kool Herc threw on Sedgwick in ‘73, I don’t wanna hear it.
Black people's ownership of hip hop was never questioned
Probably because you spend your life trying not to sound racist instead of just telling the truth. I dont blame you
Punjabi by definition is a specific ethnolinguistic identiy.  Hip hop is not.
My guy, punjab culture started in 3000 BCE. Hip hip is a 50 y.o genre where you can trace back the contribution of more than 1 ethnicity since the beggining. Huge difference
It’s also the type of person too! It’s a lot of respectful white people that are into hip-hop and rap. It’s just boiling rap and hip-hop down to bare bones it’s about being black, It’s about a black experience, it’s by and for black people. It can be consumed by all YESS they will be welcomed YES. They can be in close proximity but, they aren’t black. That’s literally all it is that’s why their treated as guests.🤷🏾‍♂️ 

Edit: Not to mention the income portion of it. A decent amount of rappers come from low-income backgrounds. They loved watching other artists but didn’t HAVE the money to support. Their fans are in the same predicament. There’s specific locations & times some people can’t afford to take off for that. Some people can’t even afford to be present some people also aren’t OLD ENOUGH to be present. That’s why they’re shown love in the hood and praised on the internet. Yet the crowd may not be as full of those that actually support them.
What's the point of trying to gatekeep?  What does being a "guest" practically mean?  White people, latin people, Asian people, etc will continue to make music.  They will continue to consume music.  Call them guests all you want, it doesn't really matter.  Absolutely pay homage, and know and respect the roots of hip hop, but also understand that music can evole a lot iover 50 years.
No, you're seen as fans of the artists you paid money to see. Dunno why the OP is confusing shit. He's either doing it on purpose in bad faith or by mistake in which case he should delete this
Facts. This is NOT a black man.
PREACH
Fellow ATLien. We make some of the same points. ATL is certainly built different than wherever OP is from lol. The jazz festival is the perfect example to prove your point. It’s one of the biggest events we have in the summer. Old heads and youngins all show up.
But no put pinapple in my pizza.
yall balkan boys cool with me yall relate to struggling more than mostx
Hip Hop is black. There is no doubt about it. 

The fact that anyone can make tacos doesn't change the fact that it's Mexcican food.
That don't matter at all. I love Chinese Food, wouldn't claim it as belonging to me.

The music you love comes from a very specific experience lived by a specific group, black Americans. 

Black people aren't the only people who went through hard times, but Post-Communist Romania didn't give us hip-hop. Post Jim Crow Black America Did. Apartheid didn't even give us rap and hip-hop. The struggles of the Black American neighborhoods did.

The fact that you love hip-hop but are trying to claim some type of ownership feels like you are trying to deebo it from us. This makes people feel some type of way. 

Listen to it. Enjoy it. If you have the skill, add to it.

But acknowledge where it came from and who moves the culture. Because nobody blows up in rap without the hood's sayso.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Love that shit man. I grew up knowing Big Pun, Fat Joe, Eminem, Busta Rhymes (Jamaican), Paul Wall, Bizzy Bone (half white half black). If they are not hip hop than who the fuck is? 😂
Reverse racism doesn’t exist. 
>Sometimes I get jealous that I won’t ever be able to relate to these things or be a part of the culture

Dude you do NOT want to be a part of the culture. you do not want to grow up in poverty. you do not want extra attention from police. you do not want to be an easy target for prejudice and harmful stereotypes. You do not want to be in a situation where society isn't giving you much of a choice other than crime. Let's all enjoy the music tho together. Its GOOD music.
>the only successful white rapper is Em

Mac Miller... I think he's more liked among black ppl even
Macklemore may be corny, but he has genuine love and respect for the culture. Replace that name with Tom Macdonald. Now theres a dude that's fucking corny and does nothing for the culture other than scream "I'm white, respect me for being here."
Em really saved white rappers. Before him the most popular white rapper was Vanilla ice. Em was tied for number 1 singles with Vanilla ice until 2009. That’s wild to me. 

He’s really like “Rocky Marciano”

I grew up in the 90s and all the hip hop shows were 99% black and we were definitely not welcome.  I think Em changed a lot of that I got into metal by the 2000s but shit was definitely different when I was deep into hip hop

I think at some point, people like Alex Turner and Kendrick Lamar are living similar lives. Rich guys in the same city, often isolated. Traveling the world, experiencing lots of different cultures. Then putting it all into their work in different ways

I think just going to school in Atlanta can put you well ahead of a lot of the rural white fans in terms of understanding. Unless you spent all your time in Buckhead and Midtown or something

I grew up in both white and black neighborhoods. Poor and middle class. We have FAR more in common than we like to admit, for whatever reason
Like the second cd I ever got was west side connection and I still will never understand why my stepdad got me that)I was a 12 year old white girl living in the sticks lol, but it opened up a love for hip hop for me.

White culture is also part of hip hop 🤷🏾 same as mexican culture, puerto rican culture, jamaican culture, and more. Hip hop has always been a mix of a bunch of backgrounds and influences
There are so many artists…imo mainstream belongs to everyone, but someone like Mr. 3-2 rapped for 25 years…3.7k monthly listeners on Spotify. Those 3.7k can’t be guests compared to someone that has never shown an interest in that specific artist.
🤝 
I fucking love to hear this. I did a lot to introduce my friends to rock and metal (uncle played bass in death metal bands in the 90s) and these days one of my black friends plays metal and I couldn’t think he’s cooler if I tried. I love music, I don’t care what anybody looks like as long as they like the same music I do. That whole gatekeeping thing is dorky.
I love that last part, just because it's not viewed as part of "your" culture doesn't mean it can't be or isn't part of your individual culture.
From Chuck Berry to Bad Brains my friend.
Trading music with the different racial/ethnic groups when I played ball was one of the coolest parts of my life. So many laughs and downright heavy moments.
it's all music
I am old school thig guy! Grew up in the 70's-80's and everything changed in '79 when I first heard Black Sabbath.  Opened up my friend base and experienced an entire new to me culture at the time. Went on to play in metal bands up till I turned 50, and in that time never had an issue I had to address. Sure, a couple of buttholes show up occasionally but there were always far more friends than not. Came back around to hip-hop and rap in my adult years and still love it all. Kind of rambling, but your post resonated with me and I just wanted to engage. Rock and rap on friend!,,!
I haven't met very many legit men who don't like rock
You have this thread marked as a discussion however looking through the comments, every time someone posts a well thought out rebuttal to the narrative you're trying to paint that invokes actual history you're nowhere to be found. The energy I'm getting seems more like you're tokenizing yourself saying "I'm black and giving white people permission to act like they own rap" or "let's start another thread complaining about how raceist black people are." Either way it doesn't seem like a post made to have actual discussion.
but Rock is your culture as an American Black Man tho. Chuck Berry, Rosetta Thorpe, Little Richard etc.
I grew up in the same kinda scene, but not America. All of us into skateboarding, snowboarding, punk, metal, rap, any other cool shit we could find. As a teen I legit thought that racism was mostly gone in my country as it was never an issue with anyone I knew. Then moving into the workforce I came to realize how shitty most people still are. Blehhh. 
My super skinny ass loves you too. Blessing back at you my friend.

Germany has some of the best hip hop fans on the planet, bar none
Nah I'm not saying the industry, I mean a load of the fans
The Pharcyde played in New Zealand this summer and the crowd was SO into them, despite it being 30-odd years since their prime. I LOVED watching them perform, and watching the most random-ass crowd vibe with them too
you definitely “can” do that. but that doesn’t mean you won’t be judged for doing so. you most definitely will be judged. if you can’t gravitate towards a message like “fuck the police” then it’s telling of how ignorant you are to hip hop being so intertwined with race and class struggle. rap music is bigger than how it sounds when you’re just listening for pleasure & enjoyability. it’s a lot deeper than just that. hip hop music shares the experiences of real life people; this is real shit that people have to go thru and to be ignorant of that is very insulting to the core values of hip hop, which whitewashes a culture that’s dealt with a lot of oppression.
You can absolutely have a preference, I’m not saying you can’t. We all do. Sometimes, I just like ignant shit and sometimes I want lyricism and substance. That’s fine.

What I mean by that last paragraph overall is, don’t just come for the “shake ya ass” club stuff and claim that you’re part of the culture. In my opinion, it’s more than that.

I believe that, to be a part of something larger than yourself, there’s a certain level of awareness and understanding one must have. There should be some level of empathy and sympathy. So yea, you may disagree with the message or messengers for “Fuck the Police” (or any song with messaging for that matter) but if you’re truly a part of the culture, you’d be able to understand why that messaging even exists in the music. These people are speaking from experience. A shared experience in most cases. The words, or the meaning behind them, carry weight. That expression is hip hop at its core.

That song is also only one example. There are countless hip hop songs that express the same sentiments (and others) differently, with more context and detail. Choose your message and your messenger there.

So, if you’re here for the bop…cool. Enjoy the bop. We all enjoy the bop. That alone doesn’t make you part of the culture imo. Thats only a small part of what hip hop is about. If you choose to ignore the parts that’s real and raw, you’ll never step foot inside the “culture club” door. And I ain’t the one that necessarily wants to hold you up.

I know two people can have the same thought but I like to think my long ass rant yesterday inspired this. I hope so because I agree and it’s nice to have a black man expand further by going into more elaborate examples.
Dorky response
You're right, very good point. I always liked looking at the perspectives that might get overlooked lol.

I recently had to take a Race Relations class as a part of my curriculum which is why I bought up the socioeconomic status. It was a eye opener seeing how in the last couple of decades the average black/hispanic household is making around $40,000 while the average white/asian households are making above $80,000. I started thinking about how ticket scalpers have become such a huge problem and another reason why you might see even less black people at the concerts of different popular artists. A ticket's original price being $400 is one thing but the minute the concert sell out and that resale price go up to $800.... you start seeing the people around you change their minds. Seen that too many times when it comes to co workers, friends, family, classmates, social media, etc.
There is a difference between Suburban Black Folks and Inner City/Hood Black folks though
That is why I didn't say *all* black people.
I didn't say we not outside lol.

No no no, you don’t get it. Everything should belong to and be, first and foremost, for white people. They have money and are white, why does everything not automatically belong to them?? Stop being racist to white people!1! 

Big ole /s if it’s not obvious enough
Top comment is a white guy saying it's just as much his culture as it is black folks.
I don't think people were in the comment sections saying Logic was making good rap music. Dude constantly gets clowned on.
Post Malone too. Dude never even pretended to be a rapper lmao

No it doesn't😅being a spectator is not the same as being part of the culture. As a black man I don't get to dictate the direction of mariachi music or tell Mexicans who they should like just because I also like the music. It's not my place
“I feel more hip hop than black” that explains this entire post man
Never go full uncle ruckus folks!

Being a consumer doesn't give you a vote. 
You just be doing tricks on it huh 🤸‍♂️🍆
Hip hop is the current iteration of blues.  Blues was built on the expression of black American slaves/working men.  Rap, in its core, is black American poetic expression.  It was created as a cultural response to oppression and racism, especially growing up as a young black man in America.  Even Eminem, one of the best rappers ever, considers himself a guest of hip hop.
Not trying to throw shade, but the current music today is probably not what they were listening to your Google search of 3000BCE. Today’s Punjabi music probably doesn’t date back to that long ago.
Where did I gatekeep? And if it doesn’t matter why comment? I never said you can’t and shouldn’t. I said they are guests! Why? bc you’re not black. It can continue to evolve and you can continue to consume it BUT majority of black rappers speak on the black experience in one way or another. You can have a similar one but, it’s not the black one. It has evolved duh! Thats how life works. A decent amount of white rap fans i run across literally think that consuming rap will make them black or understand enough of the black experience to make extra commentary. The community has also evolved. He brought up money though. Money cannot buy your way into a group or culture.
I had this same feeling too when I started my reply lol. Like, why do black people need to go into hip hop studies? I would bet a large number of us LIVED hip hop and for others it was passed down to them. Wild post lol.
He’s definitely not and all the people in this thread affirming this borderline offensive take is getting on my last nerve. Literally looking at all historical context and just spitting in its face and attempting to divorce one of the few black cultural collectives that’s still extremely black from its black roots. I know some bullshit when I see it.
Frl. It's black culture. Not white or asian or african of carribean culture . It's black american culture period.
>trying to claim some type of ownership feels like you are trying to deebo it from us

Where the fuck this you just read that? :)))))))))

Look, everyone acknowledges were it started. But that doesn't mean it belongs where it started. HipHop is not just about Black America, it's about all of us, regardless of where you come from. Post-communist Romania gave me hip-hop before I got into Eminem, Dre, Rakim, etc...

No one is taking it away from you, you have exported it to us and you have shaped the way I think, act and dress. You should be proud of that.
Ehhh. I fuck with Mac heavy but in terms of success he was nowhere near Em. Hell he wasn't even on Macklemoore's level. He was more of a niche market similar to Tyler. Like yeah black people knew of him and some listened to him but most wasn't playing his music.
I wasn't talking about who had genuine love for the game. I was talking about who was being pushed heavy and had success ie Macklemoore and Iggy who wasn't championed by the culture so their careers went nowhere. Those artists were pushed heavy by mainstream media but once the black community stopped fucking with them it was over. They might have had some success afterwards but compared to what they were achieving before we stopped fucking with them that success looks minuscule.

We dictate the culture because it is our culture, is the point I'm trying to make.
The fact that you said “and Hispanic people” shows my point
Grew up in the '90s too but in New York so I wonder if it was just more mixed up in my neighborhood
Your question was if white people INVEST so much in hip hop, why are they considered guests? What did u expect me to take from that other than this guy is trying to buy his way into a culture?

It hasn’t really been a mix of cultures. Others cultures have participated but hip hop is unquestionably Black American culture
Emulation is the highest form of flattery.  Everyone is welcome but don't get it twisted. Hip hop is deeper than clothes and music. Its creation is just as significant on the black timeline as slavery is. It has been a major source of empowerment and also used to spread hate and prejudice against us in the form of censorship and disinformation.  It was largely a joke to most of the world until the suburbs got a hold of it and now it's a global phenomenon.  Hip hop is open to everyone but it's for black people imo and that should be recognized and respected.
What do you mean by white culture? Centred around what?
For sure! And it's also hypocritical considering that there are Korean, German, or even Swedish rappers in their own country who dont give 2 fucks about our opinion 😂 and these guys are actually creative and talented. The world is bigger than NY in 1994
💯🤝
I Against I was ground-breakingly stellar when it came out! Yes, I’m old. But, not old enough for Chuck Berry drops hahaha
That's a pretty big leap, man. White people permission to act like they own rap? No one comes close to any of that. What I see in the discussions going on is multiple people from far reaching backgrounds saying how much they love not just rap, but all kinds of music, across multiple genres. You, however,  seem to feel as if you are offended that white people do feel as if they're part of rap. I hope not...
Also one of the biggest Hip-Hop cultures outside of the states, up there with the UK and France
True. A lot of nerds are becoming Nazis
i think the main factor is the venue’s rod wave performs in vs the venues and A-lister performs in.
not just price of admission but also location
Yes but we (Afro Latino) spend a lot of money at clubs. Can easily get a concert ticket for the price of 2 nights at a club. Money is not an issue.
You didnt. My bad, I read what you said wrong. You're actually absolutely right 😂
Not now, but you should have seen it during his rise like 6? years ago. The reason he gets clowned on so much now is because of backlash from so many people saying "finally someone who can save the game and rapping about more then drugs and women."
Yup, exactly. He has a point with Lil Xan but the dude isn’t even white - he’s Mexican lol
Dude even said as much he hates being called a rapper. He wants to be an artist.
His first single was called White Iverson. He picked his name from a rap name generator. Has completely adopted black dress, hairstyles, body modifications and even grills and came up as a trap artist. 

And he wants to distance himself from the stigma of being a rapper. 

That's exactly what we mean, white people will co-opt everything black except for the struggle. 

Thanks for highlighting exactly what the issue, you don't get thanks for being too obtuse to see the point your own actions make.
It's fucking music my guy, yes, you can do all that. Check out a band called ociano and ask yourself if this guy is a visitor or a pioneer of the genre taking it to new places.  You also don't know said hypothetical fans  yet judge their exsperiance based off skin color. The poor white trash have far more in common with the idea of hip hop then the rich black kid living in the burbs yet ones a visitor knowing the life yet the other knows nothing about and is welcomed? Sounds a little suspect my dude.
Yes it does. It's actually my point. You're not exposing anything here buddy 😂
It was low key anti black right? Or am I just trippin?
The nerve of some of these people. 

Infiltrate a culture, then try to say who it belongs to. 

Amazing
I may have made a slight misunderstanding. Apologies.
True, true. White people in rap are in a weird place. The best analogy or explanation I've seen about them is that while it is much harder for white people to break into the game, but when they do, the mainstream appeal and heights they can reach are much higher than black folk, for whom the inverse is true. There are exceptions to that, but then it opens up a can of worms.


I guess all this is to say that mainstream appeal is a bitch. Rap has overtaken rock as the most popular music genre for a while now.
[deleted]
He trying to to appease them with the post but he can’t see what’s going on.
DJ Kool Herc, recognized as the pioneer of hip hop, was a Jamaican immigrant. Like DJ Akademiks 😂
This right here. I realized hip-hop was truly global when I seen a track of some Japanese cats jumping on the BBL Drizzy beat. And not just the beat, mind you, but actively cooking Drake, in Japanese. People are c-walking to Key Glock in Mumbai. Shit’s different now. Kind of feels the same as how comic books used to be just a niche thing that got blown up and went mainstream as hell.
I sometimes think of Iggy Azalea growing up watching non stop US Hip Hop on MTV Australia and then being trashed for putting out music inspired by it.
Nas reference lol you RIGHT!
Facts, look up Tokyo drift freestyle by rich brian. He’s a Korean dude that learned English through rap and YouTube. It’s totally different than what we have here but the freestyle is really good. Worth listening to

Edit: Rich Brian is Indonesian mb.
Ukrainski rap is/was popping off, they have some great party tunes from about 2020 - 2022 and now even their pop songs are hard as fuck.

Who do you like in the Deutschrap scene?
I never even implied that. If you're asking I agree with the sentiment that white people are guests to rap. I'm simply pointing out that based on OPs behaviour this doesn't seem like an honest attempt to have a conversation on white people's place in rap culture.
You’re right, they don’t get enough credit either. France hasn’t really broke through to the US yet, but the UK has been on a roll recently
yeah i def get that. 

I'm saying *some of us* have to "save up" for that concert that cost a month's rent or buying the equipment necessary to start creating content. We often have to live *within our means* a little more than other groups which might cause us to miss different expensive events. In regard to OP, this can create the illusion that we don't show support as much as other groups which isn't entirely true. We just have to be a little more selective. 

Some of us be outside spending money when they know they living pay check to pay check and have other financial obligations. Financial discipline is a different conversation tho.
one sounds like a much better bargain bruh lol, also location is a huge factor.
Then why not just say that, versus painting this picture that whites are just exiled from the hip hop community or something, if they supporting then they’re welcome.
I’m not trying to expose you at all man you’re not a celebrity. I’m just saying I think you may have some underlying identity issues to address if you think a music genre is more relevant to your identity than your race.
Oh you definitely exposed more than you understand with that. You definitely have identity issues if you identify more with music than you do your own people.
Oh definitely that’s a wild thing to say. But that’s beyond me 🤷🏾‍♂️
You’re saying that as if I don’t know what I’m talking about of course I was going to see you try to slip that in. Everyone can add to something after the fact but we shouldn’t rewrite history. The good or the bad
And he would tell you he was taking part in African American culture. He didn’t do what he did in Jamaica.
Nothing but pure tether babble!
I would say superheroes blew up, but comics are still pretty niche - maybe more niche. I read a lot of comics, and no one I know does. I only bring this up because comics - especially physical books - are actually kinda dying, and it depresses me - these days, for a comic shop to survive, they need to sell other things to cover costs. They never really recovered post-covid, and a lot of them are going out of business. Go buy some comics, people!

Also, as an ironic side note, comics *used to be* extremely popular.
Man Japanese hip hop is great, it's been going strong since like the mid 2000s as well, there's some great hip hop from Europe as well, from France where it's usually pretty experimental softer beats to Russia where it goes hard af
I think it was the voice that really did her in...
Rich Brian isn’t Korean
Rich Brian is about the most LAsian dude ever nowadays, he really assimilated well.

Shoutout to my man Verbal from M-Flo on the original Tokyo Drift track.
Oh. I'm sorry. I apologize. I was wrong, I did think that's what you were saying, but I wasn't totally sure. I just get really tired of the hate bait...the race bait, the rage bait, the outrage bait, the politics bait.  So I was too quick.to come to a conclusion and became a person who fell for just that.
You think every white person is rich? I swear we don't need anyone to look down on us when we do it ourselves.

Unfortunately for me, the constant word play is my favorite part of hip hop and only being able to speak English I totally miss out on my favorite part of hip hop if it’s not in English, which hugely derails my enjoyment 😢
Yea she could’ve just rapped but she chose to do so in a blaccent
Thought he was for some reason, he’s definitely not though, he’s Indonesian.
What does that mean? First time I’ve seen “LAsian”, but yeah that’s why I felt he deserved the shout out. I’m no longer interested in the kind of music he makes but his lyricism is impressive considering it’s not native to him AT ALL. I’ll be really excited for him when he reaches deeper levels and starts playing with more word play. 

The Tokyo Drift Freestyle is probably the best representation of his ability besides maybe something new I haven’t heard.
Well it’s not a fact but if you’re told something it’s not your fault for believing it which is the whole point of what I’m saying, I love rappers of all races but I know the best always credit the origins out of respect so if I hear someone question the roots I know they are just using it for it’s welcoming environment and will transition to either rock or country music essentially using hip hop like a 2 dollar hoe
Southern California Asians, or LA (Los Angeles) Asians, have a very particular subculture, and there's been a culture war brewing between them and the rest of Asians in America who feel that they're being ostentatious and holding their subculture higher than all other Asian subcultures, despite being the least traditionally Asian of the set of subcultures which is made up of up Asian Americans.

Rich Brian is about as LAsian as you can get. It's also where the Kevin Nguyen driving a Civic stereotypes come from.

Also personally I fucking love Rich Brian, been listening to him from his debut on Dat $tick. My favorite verse of his is off of Love in my Pocket, even though it's pretty short it really emphasizes how far he's come in terms of delivery, flow, and wordplay.
Highly suggest reading the prologue before listening!
This totally changed my view of the album, I wish I read this before starting to listen. 
I really wish this could be a spoken verse inserted before the first track.
I hate to ask this because this post is already a public service but is there a clearer pic 🥹
"It was self harm" is such a tragic perspective of that relationship. Ouch
"And in one conversation I tore down the whole sky" so sad
Not me seeing this immediately after finishing the album
Because it’s the worst men that I write best…. We salute you, Taylor.
Ending a six year relationship in which she hoped to get married was undeniably heart wrenching. Joe was and is a good guy, but he didn’t want what Taylor wanted and ultimately they weren’t right for each other and the relationship probably became lonely and strained. But ending a relationship like that makes a person go insane (I speak from experience haha!). Matty was an old flame and so to rekindle this love and a crush she’s harbored as a young 20 something was exciting and magical! I’m sure he love bombed her and told her all sorts of things that she’d been dying to hear from Joe. Rings, cradles. But Matty is not the best guy. And hence the tortured poetry. Taylor is prolific and I’m sure she wrote a lot to get through this time in her life. I’m sure she also wanted to address this time period of her life to the public and her fans, and that’s what this album is. Now she’s declared it done and dusted and can move on.

out of the slammer and into a tidal wave"
Ok, this definitely puts things into a very different perspective. So in a roundabout sort of way, even the songs obviously about Matty are also somewhat about her breakup with Joe, because they’re telling us just how far off the deep end she went and how badly it destroyed her
BUT ITS THE WORST OF MEN, I WRITE THE BEST. 

Damn Taylor
For those having a hard time reading it:    
In Summation    

At this hearing    
I stand before my fellow    
members    
of The Tortured Poets    
Department    
With a summary of my findings    
A debrief, a detailed rewinding    
For the purpose of warning    
For the sake of reminding  

As you might all    
unfortunately recall    
I had been struck with a case    
of a restricted humanity    
Which explains my plea    
Here today    
Of temporary I n s a n I t y 

You see, the pendulum swings    
Oh, the chaos it brings    
Leads the caged beast to do    
the most curious things 

*Lovers* spend years denying    
what’s ill fated    
Resentment rotting away    
galaxies we created

Stars placed and glued    
meticulously by hand    
next to the ceiling fan 

Tried wishing on comets.    
Tried dimming the shine.    
Tried to orbit his planet.    
Some stars never align.    

And in one conversation    
I tore down the whole sky.    

Spring spring forth with    
dazzling freedom hues    
Then a crash from the skylight    
bursting through    
Something old,    
someone hallowed    
who told me he could    
be brand new

And so I was out of the oven    
and into the microwave    
Out of the slammer and into    
a tidal wave    
How gallant to save the    
empress from her gilded tower    
Swinging a sword he could    
barely lift    
But loneliness struck at that    
fateful hour    
Low hanging fruit on    
his wine stained lips

He never even scratched    
the surface of me.   

None of them did. 

“In summation, it was not a    
love affair!”    
I screamed while bringing    
my fists    
to my coffee ringed desk    
It was a mutual manic phase.    
It was self harm.    
It was house and then    
cardiac arrest. 

A smirk creeps on to this    
poet’s face    
Because it’s the worst     
men that I write best

And so I enter into evidence    
My tarnished coat of arms    
My muses, acquired    
like bruises    
My talismans and charms    
The tick, tick, tick, of    
love bombs    
My veins of pitch black ink

*All’s fair in love and poetry*
Some stars never align -- Seems to be an allusion to "Stars all aligned" in "All of the Girls You Loved Before?" 

This whole poem is awesome.
I LOVE that she wrote this—I get that ppl are annoyed she wrote about matty lol but imo once you start denying pieces of your past bc you’re ashamed of them, it’s such such a slippery slope. She couldn’t just pretend he wasn’t a thing or she didn’t feel in love—all she can do is (1) learn from it and (2) accept what happened; I love love writing poetry and I frequently confront the feeling of wanting to censor or edit things bc I feel bad, even though whatever I wrote was 100% how I felt at the time—for Taylor to be an authentic singer and writer, she needs to be able to write how she truly felt in a moment without editing it to accommodate!

Like ppl forget she wrote ours about how much she loved John Mayer and ignored everyone else in the same album she destroyed him w dear John—each song is just a moment in time, not how she feels at the present moment
I feel like I have processed so much and nothing at the same time within the past hour and a half
"Temporary insanity"

Edit: this is not my image.
Thank you for sharing!! This confirms or emphasizes or supports some of the thoughts and feelings I had on my first listen.
that was...insanely good. a whole experience in itself. i'm dying inside at the parallels to mastermind in the 5-6th stanzas, oof.
He never even scratched the surface of me

None of them did.
“lovers spend years denying whats ill fated” oh man their relationship was doomed from the start. dont get me wrong they were there for each other, especially joe was there for taylor in the worst phase of her life and he was a rock she genuinely genuinely needed at that time, and it breaks my heart to say this but they weren’t made for each other. they invested 6 years in each other but tbh i think they were long overdue for a fallout
“It’s the worst men that I write best” this album is peak unhinged Taylor and I love it
wow, this has everything in it.   
Close reading this and connecting it to all the things that came before it is going to be someone's PhD.

  
I'm starting right now.
it’s an epilogue!!! 😭 “in summation” is literally how you end papers and speeches
 the prologue also depicts the 5 stages of grief alongside her playlists!!! she’s a genius
“It was house then cardiac arrest” pack a punch Taylor

as you might all unfortunately recall, i had been struck with a case of a restricted humanity which explains my plea here today of temporary insanity.

you see, the pendulum swings. oh, the chaos it brings, leads the caged beast to do the most curious things.

lovers spend years denying what's ill fated, resentment rotting away, galaxies we created

stars placed and glued, meticulously by hand, next to the ceiling fan

tried wishing on comets tried dimming the shine. tried to orbit his planet. some stars never align. and in one conversation. i tore down the whole sky

spring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues then a crash from the skylight bursting through. something old, someone hallowed, who told me he could be brand new.

low hanging fruit on his wine stained lips

'in summation, it was not a love affair!' i screamed while bringing my fists to my coffee ringed desk. it was a mutual manic phase. it was self harm. it was house and then cardiac arrest

a smirk creeps onto this poet's face because it's the worst men that i write best

"Because it's the worst men that I write best"
She wrote an album about Matty cause he sucks, she couldn't write a good album about Joe because he was a good guy lol slay Taylor
This NEEDS to be more recognized!! It gives sm perspective on the album (especially how as you go through it, it’s going from being love bombed to basically saying he should go to jail). Genuinely listening to it as a somewhat manic episode makes so much sense. And also, I don’t think she was defending Matty at all. She was just writing about her feelings, which were clearly intense and also probably intensified by the absolutely insane response from the fans. Anyways, I feel like this definitely should have been featured on the album so I don’t have to go defend it to everyone now (which I probably will anyways)
“Some stars never align” 🥺
“Lovers spend years denying Resentment rotting away galaxies we created Stars placed and glued meticulously by hand next to the ceiling fan. Tried wishing on comets. Tried dimming the shine Tried to orbit his planet. Some stars never align. And in one conversation, I tore down the whole sky.”

Wow! She’s brilliant. Just such a visual for the relationship. It makes me sad thinking about it but there’s that feeling of holding on and doing everything to make it work and in the end it just wasn’t meant to be and really that’s ok. 

Thanks for posting this…gives a new perspective while  listening to the album.
Chilling words. A true poet.
oh god damn this *is* the tortured poets department.
I took the miracle move on drug the effects were temporary. I loved you it’s ruining my life
thank you for sharing, this is extremely insightful upon the second listen
Can I claim this poem as my favorite part of the album?
Love this, thank you for sharing.
The most beautiful art comes from the most horrific pain, I'm sorry that you suffer for us Taylor
This completely realigns the album for me and honestly makes it even better. I wish she would post it so everyone could read it.
While I think both albums are Joe/ Matty I don’t think as many of the songs are explicitly Joe or Matty but a cumulation of the grief and trying anything to feel alive again after a world crashing break up….that leads to a wild and catastrophic choice of rebound like it’s all tied together. She ended up w Matty bc of Joe. The album is processing the emotions of a break up and all the ex’s and self fulfilling prophecies we tell ourselves when we are going through it - aka down bad- 
I feel like this album is her screaming at the world that she’s human and needs grace and space to be human without the level of dissection that everyone craves to be closer to her/ and being stuck under the microscope with so much speculation and loss of privacy during extremely private situations and experiences.
She dropped the anthology version.😭
I think she's mocking the people that thought they had so much of a say in her life they were writing and signing petitions for her to put in a conservatorship. Which she then carries on in theme in the Fortnight video where it looks like she's in an asylum receiving electric shock therapy. It also appears to be an epilogue, not a prologue.
This completely realigns the album for me and honestly makes it even better. I wish she would post it so everyone could read it.
"I tore down the WHOLE SKY". Say what you will about timelines, but M'AM, that pendulum swung me deep into theorizing that BTTWS is in fact about their collapsed relationship, even if it wasn't actualized at that point. I will die on this hill.
It was self harm.

It was house and then cardiac arrest.

A smirk creeps onto this poet's face

Because it's the worst men that I write the best.



I need 175 days to process this album thank you.
Okay but thanK you aIMee guys
omg thank you for posting this! i just couldnt help but cringe with some of the songs. this helps so much!
I found the album really cohesive. It sounds like the end of a big relationship make her look back and reassess everything that was connected with it in one way or another - the Kanye/Kim stuff, the reasons the relationship failed, the lies she told herself that kept it going after it should have died already, why the rebound was so compelling and also wrong at the same time, where it led her, making her confront her attitude to her fame and fans and her expectations for how partners should deal with it. It really tells a whole story. I love it.
She said…my bad yall 😅
I’m telling you, this is the album I connect with most, and I thought it was folklore. 

I’m 10 years older than Taylor and I feel like she captures  the absolute crux of midlife in this album. It’s dark, it’s light, it’s funny, it’s heavy. We are long suffering and then we break. We are professionals, holding worlds together on our shoulders, but inside there is still a 16-year-old version of us screaming to feel alive. 

Thank you, Taylor. I’ve never felt so seen.
Clearly it's primarily about Matty. There's confirmation in the songs that he's been swirled into her poems for years, Peter suggests that she was always holding out for him in some sense, Guilty as Sin? shows a lot of pining for him in the long suffering propriety of the 'Slammer' of Joe. He was The 1(975), the meteor strike, maroon, her twin... The Peter losing Wendy.

Then it wound being a 2 week affair they'd both built up in their heads, and he couldn't handle the media storm around her... And yeah... As a terminally online millennial, that makes sense. He wasn't the man she had imagined he was, that he promised he'd be.

It's heartbreaking, and there's a lot of rage in there directed at him and herself, but pointedly at the extreme scrutiny they were immediately under. There are lines on the record that are pretty much directed exactly at this sub.

It's an uncomfortable listen sometimes.
It’s amazing
Thanks for sharing! It feels like a journal and a play.
I have been in a group on FB (yes I know, no one uses Facebook anymore) and literally everyone there hates Joe, and have been very excited for this album to bash him to pieces, and it's so frustrating because I always felt like his album was Midnights, and that they probably broke up wayyyy before the public found out. I was so hopeful that this album wouldn't be all about "how horrible Joe was" as a lot of people expected, and now I feel vindicated😂
This is so true and very relatable. I got out of a long term relationship in 2022 and I got into a short relationship very shortly after which made me lose my fucking mind, I hadn’t healed from my previous relationship and after the new one ended it made it so much worse. I was in a state of absolute insanity for months after until I started to feel like myself again
Also highly suggest everyone re-read the Reputation prologue before applying your paternity tests.
I wish all the people that are calling her terrible names for writing songs about matty would read this and *comprehend* it. I guess we’ll just have to chalk this one up to the whole “college students with the highest GPAS listen to Taylor Swift” statistic.
“Out of the oven” is a clear reference to Sylvia Plath. I won’t elaborate here lest I trigger anyone. But it shows how terribly low her lows were.
aka. The most explicit "break up" album she's ever done?
[deleted]
Oh thank God I can listen now and be okay lol. Even though picturing Matty on her inner thigh is still ohh
Thanks so much for posting this! So glad I got to read this :) (though I struggled a bit with blurriness but comments section came to the rescue lol)
I finally got to watch her concert film on Disney+. And, I’d really have to applaud her for navigating the world of heartbreaks and regrets with such vivid imagery through her lyrics. Her poetry is not necessarily a semblance of torture but more of an orchestrated chaos. An insanity all of us who’ve loved and got hurt deeply before had experienced one way or another.
The ceiling reminds me of Lavender Haze and this poetry talks about Joe as much as Healy.
God, as someone who’s rebound very briefly with an old friend after a long term relationship ended this album is killing me. 

I get how she can have such intense sprawling feelings about something so short. Nothing fucks you up more then getting that ‘what if person.’  The guy that  has scratched at the back of your mind forever. Especially as you are watching what you chose and desperately want die a slow death. They can never live up to your unrealistic expectations of what your over active imagination thought being with them would could be like. I had such whiplash and more intense feelings and insecurity come up after that shorter relationship ended. AND That when the dude is just a normal dumb boy, not an absolute menace like Matty.
Thank you for sharing! So good!!!
I've seen online there is a poem by Stevie Nicks?? Anyone have a pic?
In some parts it’s like saying out loud the thoughts and backgrounds of your actions that you would normally not dare to say out loud
Well, that nearly made me cry, thank you for posting it!!
This is fantastic.
I wish I could hear her read this!
What in the Matty Healy heck is happening here? (Rhetorical question! She came for him. grinch_smiling.gif)
Can you please post a clearer image? I can read the left side fine but the right is a bit blurry. 🙏🏽
SCREAMING
Is there a text version of this available somewhere? I’m legally blind and it’s really hard for me to read texts in images like this.
This could be a song. SOMEONE MAKE THIS A SONG
This has changed my mind on what the entire album is about. 

My theory is it’s a post mortem of her entire pre-Travis era. She had her youth stolen from her by the music industry and a string of shitty boyfriends. Had her reputation trashed as a woman who dated a lot, so she settled down with someone who was fundamentally wrong for her and she fell so deeply in love she was ruined by the break up. 

But she’s free of it now, had her crazy fling, and she’s found someone who appreciates her for her as opposed to for her name. She’s free and she’s able to be herself, and about to reclaim her reputation and name (rep tv and debut tv) before entering her new era
Tried wishing on comets. Tried dimming the shine. Tried to orbit his planet. SOME STARS NEVER ALIGN 😭omg yessss, so powerful

Isn't there a countdown to 2am?  Can this be my clowning?  I hope it's leading to this somehow translating into audio, because I love so many pieces of this.
THANK U, ugh it was so hard to listen to love songs about ratty but this puts things into a MUCH NEEDED perspective


In Summation: 

At this hearing

I stand before my fellow members

of the Tortured Poets Department

With a summary of my findings

A debrief, a detailed rewinding

For the purpose of warning

For the sake of reminding

As you might all unfortunately recall

I had been struck with a case

of a restricted humanity

Which explains my plea here today

of temporary insanity

You see, the pendulum swings

Oh, the chaos it brings

Leads the caged beast to do

the most curious things

Lovers spend years denying what’s ill fated

Resentment rotting away

galaxies we created

Stars placed and glued

meticulously by hand

next to the ceiling fan

Tried wishing on comets.

Tried dimming the shine.

Tried to orbit his planet.

Some stars never align.

And in one conversation, I tore down the whole sky

Spring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues

Then a crash from the skylight

Bursting through

Something old, someone hallowed,

who told me he could be brand new

And so I was out of the oven

And into the microwave

Out of the slammer and into a tidal wave

How gallant to save the empress

from her gilded tower

Swinging a sword he could barely lift

But loneliness struck at that fateful hour

Low hanging fruit on his wine stained lips

He never even scratched the surface

of me.

None of them did.

“In summation, it was not a love affair!”

I screamed while bringing my fists

to my coffee ringed desk

It was a mutual manic phase.

It was self harm.

It was house and then cardiac arrest.

A smirk creeps onto this poet’s face

Because it’s the worst men that I write best.

And so I enter into evidence

My tarnished coat of arms

My muses, acquired like bruises

My talismans and charms

The tick, tick, tick of love bombs

My veins of pitch black ink

All’s fair in love and poetry

Sincerely,

The Chairman

of The Tortured Poets Department
This is a huge relief! That was my interpretation but people saying it’s all about Matty was making me feel weird. 

Also does that say “it was house and then cardiac arrest”? Thats incredible.
“I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary…” 🤯🤯🤯

JESUS
listening to 'but daddy i love him'... yeah taylor that's definitely a bout of insanity
Midnights was the Joe break up album. I'm not surprised she doesn't have much more to say about him.
Thank you for posting this cause this definitely adds some much needed context!
Wow I wish I saw this first!!!! Holy shit. The clarity in this prologue!
Also, what does the Page of „But Daddy I love him“ look like on the black dog and the albatross? I got manuscript and Bolter and it looks different. This is the manuscript. The bolter is a circle. So.. 10? IO? Will it be a date? 😅maybe I’m just Easter egg insane by now

The starts never align detaillll
Do we think she’ll eventually release this as a FTV track?
WOW! Okay yes I’ll listen to the album again in this frame of view…

AND I NEED A TAYLOR BOOK OF POETRY ASAP
It's not album exclusive to Matt or Joe It's about both and even herself there's even a song about Travis in the second album.
This makes so much sense after listening to the album it felt like a fever dream or something , now I understand it better .. everyone should read this.
Okay, so random thought but what if the Matty publicity leading up to the album about warning him and the album being about him was a red herring to take the heat off Joe? 
Matty hardly cares what people think, being shitty is on brand. Joe was/is private. I’m sure she still cares for him deeply and adjusted the microscope to protect him.
ok I see you italicized "Lovers"
this doesn’t change the way i view the album. i feel like the themes are pretty obvious
Is there a transcribed or accessible version? I can’t read the image.

Idk if they’re about Joe or Matty with a sprinkle of a future with Travis. What I do know is it’s 100% about Taylor Swift.
Ok honest question, why do some people care so much about who the song is about? Like who cares? Do you enjoy the song or don't you enjoy the song?
NGL, "my veins of pitch black ink" sounds like it came from my high school poems. And I don't know if that is a good feeling for me.
After a meticulous listen to the additional songs I’m almost positive Maroon is about Matty. She uses the rust metaphor in both Maroon and The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived, and in Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus she uses the lyric “Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon?” 
Maroon always felt as though it was about a toxic twenty something romance and Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus feels like the other side of it.
Can people please leave Joe alone now? Poor guy was just depressed and didn’t want the same things as her let him live. Now, Matty on the other hand… (/s)
So I started listening to the first few songs of the album and I felt so underwhelmed y’all. I haven’t finished the whole thing yet, but idk I wasn’t as GAGGED as when I first listened to Midnights. Anyone feeling the same?
YES! This album is one that desperately needs the context the prologue provides. 
If there were a TTPD tour, lights would fade and her voice would be reading this to start the show.
Fuck me. Does this mean Bigger than the whole sky is about Joe? Who had on their bingo that this would be mostly a Matty album?
WHEW. That hurts to read 😓
Alright swifties, I am a rather new Taylor Swift fan. I have always found her to be a wonderful human but the music just didn’t fit my style till recently. I am wondering why and how this changes the perspective of the album? I have listened to it a couple times through and would like to listen again with a broader view. Thanks!
Loves
You don’t have to ask me twice. I’m reading all the lyrics and am looking up everything I can about every single song. I’m obsessed 😍
Damn Taylor.
Oh wow. Thanks for sharing. Can someone post a less blurry version of this?
Wow this changes so much for me. Thanks for posting!!

I read this out loud to my husband while he was making breakfast and I had to pause a few times to collect myself cause daaaaaaamn!!! If she ever stops creating music she can still sell books of poetry ❤️❤️❤️
matty healy has got to be on some kind of crazy ass level in relationships with the amount of songs he has about him
*WHY AN I GETTING NOTIFICATIONS AND I HAVENT JOINED THIS SUB WTF*
This is what I am taking from it please correct me if I’m wrong:

She truly loved Joe but no matter their attempts they just couldn’t align so she ended it and was lost and lonely so this low hanging fruit came in to the picture and she knows it was self harm and that she wasn’t really in love and because HE was awful she was able to write more about him than Joe because while she and Joe didn’t work out it wasn’t as toxic worthless as Matt?

So did she end the relationship ship with Matt because she realize show awful he was or are these songs only because he broke up with her…OR because he broke up with her she realized how awful he was?
Can I just say I think it is so weird how people are trying to decipher the lyrics to figure out who she is writing about. It's as though her life is some kind of weird fucking reality show people follow.
I don't care who she is writing about or how it affected her. I connect with the lyrics on a personal level and relate to them as it applies to my own lived experience.
Who cares if it's about this person or that we don't know any of these fucking people.
Ugh, it’s growing on me. But still, hunny, Matty… no
This should be obligatory reading before listening to the album! It explains so much and definitely helped me understand what this album is truly about.
Regardless this album is still flat as hell
Love this  idea! Maybe on the 2am ✌️✨
Great idea
100%. I did get it after 3 listens before I saw the prologue, but the first 2 listens made me ANGRY, especially with "But Daddy I Love Him."
Just like in the Red album!! That would be good
Lets get AI on it! /s

You see, the pendulum swings 
Oh, the chaos it brings 
Leads the caged beast to do the most curious things 

Lovers spend years denying
Resentment rotting away galaxies we created
Stars placed and glued meticulously by hand next to the ceiling fan

Tried wishing on comets

Tried to orbit his planet.
Some stars never align.

Spring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues

Out of the slammer and into a tidal wave.

Swinging a sword he could barely lift
But loneliness struck at the fateful hour

Low hanging fruit on his wine stained lips
He never even scratched the surface of me.

None of them did.

*In summation, it was not a love affair!
I screamed while bringing my fists
to my coffee ringed desk
It was a mutual manic phase

It was self harm.

It was house and then cardiac arrest.

A smirk creeps onto this
Poets face. Because it is the worst
men that I write best.

And so I enter into evidence
My tarnished coat of arms
My muses, acquired
like bruises
My talismans and charms
The tick, tick, tick of love bombs
My veins of pitch black ink
AIls fair in love and poetry 

Sincerely. 

The
Chairman of
The Tortured Poets Department
At this hearing
I stand before my fellow members
of the Tortured Poets Department
With a summary of my findings
A debrief, a detailed rewinding
For the purpose of warning
For the sake of reminding
As you might all unfortunately recall
I had been struck with a case
of a restricted humanity
Which explains my plea here today
of temporary insanity
You see, the pendulum swings
Oh, the chaos it brings
Leads the caged beast to do
the most curious things
Lovers spend years denying what’s ill fated
Resentment rotting away
galaxies we created
Stars placed and glued
meticulously by hand
next to the ceiling fan
Tried wishing on comets.
Tried dimming the shine.
Tried to orbit his planet.
Some stars never align.
And in one conversation, I tore down the whole sky
Spring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues
Then a crash from the skylight
Bursting through
Something old, someone hallowed,
who told me he could be brand new
And so I was out of the oven
And into the microwave
Out of the slammer and into a tidal wave
How gallant to save the empress
from her gilded tower
Swinging a sword he could barely lift
But loneliness struck at that fateful hour
Low hanging fruit on his wine stained lips
He never even scratched the surface
of me.
None of them did.
“In summation, it was not a love affair!”
I screamed while bringing my fists
to my coffee ringed desk
It was a mutual manic phase.
It was self harm.
It was house and then cardiac arrest.
A smirk creeps onto this poet’s face
Because it’s the worst men that I write best.
And so I enter into evidence
My tarnished coat of arms
My muses, acquired like bruises
My talismans and charms
The tick, tick, tick of love bombs
My veins of pitch black ink
All’s fair in love and poetry
Sincerely,
The Chairman
of The Tortured Poets Department
Apologies, if I had a clear image I would share. This came from another thread.
Agreed, but it also makes the relationship make more sense to me too lol
Tortured Rebound’s Department
ngl I can really relate to this sentiment (and album as a whole) bc I have shit tase in men lmao

I’m also pleading insanity after my last relationship hahaha
I literally said her dating matty is self harm as it was happening where is my cookie
I take this more to relate to the aftermath (like Matty).
What relationship was it? I don‘t really keep up with her private life

Edit: Thanks swifties!!
jan levinson gets it
“It was a mutual manic phase” damn
Goodbye goodbye goodbye 😢
Between that line and the revelation the Lover might be more of a denial album... Brings up some questions in regards to BTTWS.
Reminds me of “Sadness became my whole sky” in Bejeweled
If Joe = whole sky, a baby with Joe would’ve been bigger than the whole sky??
Interesting to me that she used 'the whole sky' here to represent relationship with Joe- calls back Bigger than the whole sky. In that *something* was bigger than the relationship


I definitely think they had a gigantic loss together which fractured an already fraught relationship. 
Same, but now I’m gonna do a second listen with it in mind! Lol
Honestly this line.
she knows what she did!
A straight bar
🫡
She knows how to handle herself a dangerous man!
This comment is SO important in explaining what this album is. It's the breakup but also the rebound, of which we were not expecting in length to be included here. She basically spiraled. That time that we would like to forget about is so important to understanding why she was so infatuated with Matty. He was different, exciting, and something she probably hadn't experienced in years (from Taylor's perspective; certainly not mine lol). Coming out of a 6 year relationship that was probably (at one point) a forever concept was difficult, and we can clearly see how insane her thoughts and fantasies were. I think that is where a lot of initial confusion came from surrounding the leaks. I even thought to myself, \*it can't be about Matty.\* But at the same time, I get it now. A breakup doesn't always end when the two people part; sometimes it's the aftermath that is even worse, and with Taylor, clearly the relationship had run its course, and the post-mortem was much crazier than we were lead to believe. I'm glad she has declared that chapter of her live dead. I seriously hope she is actually healed though. All of this happened so fast, and some of these lyrics are quite insane.
Yes I love this! Joe didn’t do anything bad necessarily. He met her when she was in hiding basically and their relationship was so much different in the first years.
💯this. Also, this prologue should put things into perspective for the people criticizing that she just threw a ton of words on the page nonsensically. This prologue is telling us that she won’t hold back, that she spiraled, was in a manic state, and ultimately writing her thoughts, feelings, and emotions down in this way helped her process and heal. 
I LOVE that the album’s lyrics seem to be more raw and come off almost straight from her stream of conscious to reflect her mental state. 

It seems Taylor didn’t hold back or filter as much as she normally would with her previous work. The album reflects a maturity and growth and good for being able to be brave enough to release and share this with this from what seems to have been a volatile vulnerable time in her life.
Put this on tweeter!! Or X or whatever it's called and trend it. People are still going out of their way to call Joe cheater and it's just outrageous! God I feel sad for both of them. 
I wish awards were still a thing here, but you said it perfectly!!
Okay like I get seeing Matty as the tortured poet BUT what about when the album was announced and everyone was freaking bc of Joes group chat?? I definitely still see TTPD as mostly heartbreak, loss and the grieving of what you wished for so badly. Maybe a few songs towards Matty but almost all of the promos alluded to her and Joes relationship. The Spotify library with 72 drawers, 6 pulled out, wedding invitations, lace, dead flowes, etc. The songs she chose for hidden words I think also still says a lot too.
It wouldn’t be Taylor if she wasn’t intentionally silly in the midst of an un-silly moment lolol
I think "out of the oven" is a reference to poet Sylvia Plath, who famously committed suicide by sticking her head into an oven.
This line is so funny to me, the imagery of Taylor spinning in a microwave is sending me 💀
The Bachelor fan over here. There was a line from the show when one of the contestants brought the Bachelor home to meet her dad and his famous line, “you can’t microwave a relationship” is what I think about when I hear this line! Essentially, how are you ready for marriage after dating the guy for six weeks??
Reminds me of the saying “out of the frying pan into the fire”
Is the microwave thing a metaphor to Sylvia Plath?
100%. Dude after my 8 year relationship ended I dove right into a three year fever dream with an alcoholic. And not the fun kind. Looking back, I was absolutely out of my mind. Heartbreak makes us do nutty things.  I relate to this album on so many levels lol
As someone old (and wise???) The songs about matty are definitely also about Joe. It’s way easier to process the short, chaotic thing that glows and burns out than the long thing that slowly boils you to death.
Exactly
“Look what you made me do”
Love your username
I kinda got this as a girly who has been through this but good for her to spell it out
I'm kinda getting the vibe that she was messing with Matty before her and Joe were all the way done 👀👀👀
Which ones did we determine are about Matty?
This is exactly what I thought when she publicized her fling with Matty.  I was like, there is NO way she is sane ATM.  Not one bit.  

So it absolutely confirms her grief was so deep she wasn't thinking at all.  Just feeling.  Anything to not feel the grief.
Absolutely!
I think it’s all about matty
Can we get this comment pinned lol
Thank you! I was going crazy trying to read the image.
Thank you!!
thank you so much, i was squinting like crazy!
This needs to be higher!!
And Mastermind!
Also the reference of the comet… to Long Story Short
And snow on the beach
LOUDER!!!! this is exactly it!!
YES!!! I hate how I keep seeing people use 'But Daddy I Love Him' to say she's shading her fans and whatnot (mostly antis ofc..) when that's not the point? Like you said she wrote 'Ours' for John and then also wrote a bunch of other songs calling him out, she writes songs for each and every one of her feelings and not just the "afterwards". In the beginning she was feeling very much in love and like everyone else calling her out was wrong but then in other songs she comes to realize everyone was right all along. That's the beauty of her storytelling.
I personally cannot believe that people thought an album this deep would be about anything other than her very deep past relationship.
This is a great way to describe the feeling.
Where’s this image from? Just curious
Sameee!
Same same!!!!
And BTTWS!
"trying to find a part of me you didn't take up. Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough." it's giving coping mechanismmmmmmmm to meeeeeee (in the least judgmental way bc like same)
I agree. We don't know all of the facts about their relationship, but from the little clues and tidbits we do know, I feel like they weren't suited for each other. It seems they were at different places in life. A fallout was inevitable.
 Nothing good starts in a getaway car 😔
Something interesting is how the _Lovers_ is italicized in that verse.
Epilogue!** Thank you
Hey! Can you please tell me where you got this in a physical copy? Is it the Vinyl?? I NEED this
I mean Lover & Reputation were pretty good
Yeah that line is hilarious
I feel like she’d already said most of what she needed to say about Joe on Midnights.
You don’t think any of these songs are about Joe??
I thought almost all the songs are about Joe except for fresh out the slammer, guilty as sin, but daddy I love him, I can fix him and the alchemy
Yeah clearly Joe was giving her Sweet Nothing on the inspiration front
[deleted]
After listening, I feel like I can confidently say Joe may not have been as much of a “good guy” as some previously thought. Some absolutely devastating lines throughout the songs that don’t make sense for an alleged rebound that lasted a few weeks 🤷🏼‍♀️
[deleted]
Also I don’t believe the whole 6 years of the relationship was bad! I think looking back when you’re angry / sad you think it was all wrong. But really if anything Joe helped her write some of her best music. Whether it be with her or about him.  I honestly think he will have had a heads up on this album as he know the score with her song writing!
Totally agree. I've been sending to my friends before they listen
The department approves!
Yes! I feel like even Alchemy is partially a follow up to Long Live, a message to the fans. I think it’s Joe, Matty, Travis, even her parents and her brother, even the fans. 

This is what I see as being her relationship with her fans. 

Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?

I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong
We can finally listen to the other tracks! Loved The Black Dog and The Manuscript so far
Same! I wouldn’t have been so turned off by certain tracks had I gone into them with this mindset.
I can understand the people who think differently but I’ve always thought BTTWS was about a failed (or failing) relationship. At the time I remember it hitting me really hard because I was grieving the loss of a long relationship that I thought would bring marriage and children.
Hearing that her mum was wishing kim dead lmao. So messy but so real.
Of course!
I am obsessed with how cohesive everything is. The visuals, the promo, the sound, the lyrics. Everything is phenomenal
Edit to say- as I was listening last night, having not read this, this was the vibe I was getting. Like, was so shut up for so long she went off the deep end.
Interesting, I took “out of the oven and into the microwave” more as like a modern parallel to the saying “out of the fire and into the frying pan”. Where one situation is just as bad as the next.
I think it’s just a reference to leaving a long relationship for a short and tumultuous one. The oven cooks things slowly, the microwave quickly, it’s another way of alluding to the “get love quick” schemes.
Yes!!! I caught that too!
I read it prior and still don’t know that I believe that the whole thing is Matty. I think that we have 5 Joe, 6 Matty, 1 Travis, and 4 not really about one relationship in particular. I think that most of our Joe breakup content was in midnights and honestly probably evermore.
lol same! I was too icked out to enjoy a lot of songs, but this has me settled down now
Yess someone made a fantastic suggestion that this should be available to listen to before the album plays on steaming platforms. Like the voice memos she used to do

Context makes things so much more enjoyable for some people. Like walking through an art gallery. A painting can come alive if you know the story behind it. Same thing.
Come join the stoned Swifty sub. There’s no relationship/lyrical interpretation allowed there, just people who enjoy music.
same but i also hated midnights at the beginning and now i love it
It’s all but explicitly confirming that she is/was heartbroken about the Joe breakup, but that she then went through a harmful manic phase (aka dating Matty Healy) right after and that she writes the worst men the best ie so many of the songs on TTPD seem Matty coded. Likely what she’s saying is many of them are indeed about Joe and then more so Matty because she writes the worst men the best.

So Joe isn’t/wasn’t the worst, it just didn’t work out. But then she acknowledges the harmful nature of the situation with Matty and enters into “evidence” for fans/the reader/herself that many of these songs were written with how she felt at the time, which looking back she now realizes wasn’t love at all but mania. 

“There will be no explanation, just Reputation” - TTPD is her attempt at an explanation for a “crime” of self destruction. It’s up to us/fans/even past partners to decide if we accept this evidence as explanation of her actions. Aka the story is told and now it’s “ours” - she wrote it all out and it’s for us to decide how we feel/how we may choose to judge or not judge her.

Not guilty on the basis of temporary insanity.

Without this explanation the album can come off as putting Matty on this love pedestal and this explains that she doesn’t feel that way anymore/none of it was real.
2/2 I hope that makes sense - I think there’s more to it than just that but didn’t want to write a novel. We’re seeing her poetry from this time in her life and her “side of the story”. 

It could also (maybe) extend that she’s presenting evidence and almost an apology or at least explanation to The Tortured Poets Department which could mean to *Joe* himself - he was quoted as saying something to the effect of him and his friends call themselves that. 

So there it is and the chapters closed. Take it or leave it but she put it all out on “paper” now

Edit: typo
This is the only image that exists so far, unfortunately. It is not mine.

That is weird.
This I would pay for! Instated of a CD with 1 song
>Lovers spend years denying Resentment rotting away galaxies we created Stars placed and glued meticulously by hand next to the ceiling fan

boo this is too real. ![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1064)

I think this album will take a while for me to fully digest. How can someone who'se life is so insanely different than mine keep calling me out like this?
reading this on my second listen adds so much context! I am in such awe of the lyricism
ugh THANK YOU. this should be the top comment. That picture is so blurry.
Thank you!!!!!
The public held her in a trial for dating Matty. This is her defense, and she’s pleading insanity
Thank you!
No no, thanks for sharing!!! From it came the text version!
The Toxic Rebound Department
She’s so real for this and it’s such an important thing to shine light on. We’re all out here pretending our relationships are all so healthy now because we have higher standards when the truth is we often fall for the worst people at the worst time. Human nature.
🍪
The two weeks she was dating Matt Healy
Matty Healy
matty healy
As soon as I read this line, I thought of BTTWS. Girlie has been telling us that this relationship was over almost TWO YEARS ago
Forgive me. What song are you referring to?
Exactly what I was thinking. Putting bttws into a breakup perspective where you feel like you would have done anything different if it meant you could have kept them is.... Something.
“I’m never going to meet what should’ve been you”? Doesn’t fit with it being about Joe. Same with “did some force take you ‘cause I didn’t pray?”.

I think she just uses the same phrases occasionally so you it makes you think of BTTWS when she talks about the sky.
Bttws?
YOUR FLAIR😭
> we can clearly see how insane her thoughts and fantasies were.

This is really important context, esp with the written album note. Taylor is an unreliable, biased narrator. We can't always take her (song) words at face value.

Reminds me of how suprised some of us were at the denial playlist. Like, there's more going on under the surface of the song.
Yes and it helps to feel better about the songs that are about MH. The only thing I still struggle with is did she realize this and end it, or did he end it and that’s the only reason she feels this way.
While I don’t hope for anyone to go through pain, I can definitely understand going in to self destruct mode after what you thought was your future is over…and that doesn’t change immediately. I was stunned she was able to keep performing and sing the songs so wrote about him.
I feel like this is a really common experience with the pandemic. Like, I know so many people who got into (what my friends and I are calling) “pandemic relationships” that haven’t lasted through getting back to regular life.
I think the break up and reasons would be all sung about if it was cheating as she told us about herself cheating and all about Harry so why would she hold back on Joe. People on Twitter are nuts!
why is she so obsessed with the word microwave 

why is she microwaving things so much
Sylvia Plath also had a collection of poetry (Ariel) and a poem titled "Daddy". Which I think also played into her writing for this album - in the poem by Plath, there is a line that says: "If I've killed one man, I've killed two" and in So Long, London, Taylor writes "Two graves, one gun."
exactly what I was thinking too
I think it is also a fun modernization of out of the frying pan and into the fire.
And a microwave would spin you in circles and kill you way faster.
Yes! This is what I said about The Matty situation.  A lot of people did, but I really do think it's something only experienced by some people who get out of long term relationships.  And like, you go after the extreme opposite of what you spent almost a whole decade with. You think going to tbe polar opposite is what you need. 

I speak from experience: its not.
Same! After 4 year relationship ended (we also had a child together) I dove into a 3 month long relationship with an alcoholic who love bombed me then disappeared. It almost felt like that heart break was worse than the longer relationship because there was no time in between and my heart was so confused
Checking in to the "completely bonkers post-long-term relationship rebound relationship" club.
Same.  Had a baby with my terrible manic rebound because my heart was in absolute shambles.  He was the farthest thing I could find from the sweet relationship I lost 😭
This happened to me but a drug addict was in recovery that ended badly. Luckily I left but it was very destructive for me. I totally get it
Yes. I can relate. Trauma bonding is real too.
Hey DoorInTheAir I like your reddit handle :)
1000% yes. I think it’s glaringly obvious to those of us who have lived it
omg yes 💔 do you write? because if not you should!
Exactly... same thing happened to me. After 6 year marriage and divorce. Got with who I thought was "the one" for three months. And all the other losers I dated. Like why? But after the three month thing that I was really love bombed and thought he was perfect, stood on my ex husband's porch and cried for him to come back. It was never about the three month thing, but my marriage and this blip got mixed together until I am crying on a doorstep like an idiot.
this is so beautifully written 😭
I saw this after I listened - thanks for posting! It certainly adds perspective. I love this album ♥️
I saw this after I listened - thanks for posting! It certainly adds perspective. I love this album ♥️
Guilty as Sin? kind of indicates that she didn’t but she sure wanted to.
The World's Smallest Man is Healy, I got a real sense of her feeling even more betrayed by him than Joe. Matty is incorrigible but he convinced her briefly he could and would change.
After two listens London seems to be the only one from the regular edition that's explicitly about Joe? For how briefly she dated Matt he really seems to have done a number on her.
All of them, unfortunately
My interpretation, which obviously take with a grain of salt, is that most of the songs (that deal with romantic relationships) prior to loml are about Matty, with the except of So Long, London. I think some of the lyrics throughout allude to her having an emotional affair with Matty as her relationship is ending. Then post-breakup, diving in DEEP, getting caught up in something so different than what she had experienced for more than half a decade. I Can Fix Him is the height of this mania until the final line when she realizes that she really, really can't. 

Then loml hits and I think this is her after the breakup with Matty realizing that she's lost both this big, long love she had with Joe and the sort of dazzling, rebellious excitement with Matty. This bleeds into I Can Do it With a Broken Heart. Then she gets angry at Matty with The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived before moving on to her current happiness with Travis. 

Not sure about the bonus album, as they seem more like Vault tracks. But the OG album seems to tell a fairly linear story, at least to me.
And question “meteor strike”
she wrote one of the sweetest love songs about JM and then also gave us Dear John. Relationships contain many stages

  
also Superman & Story of Us are also JM songs
I found it on another reddit thread and haven't been able to find anything similar since. Someone else had posted it and for some reason when I downloaded it, there was no attribution
What’s BTTWS? It’s late, I’m so tired lol
What’s BTTWS? It’s late, I’m so tired lol
She's directly referencing _Lover_
That’s for sure deliberate. She’s telling us Lover was all bullshit.
haha sorry it wasn’t a dig against you, i’ve just been seeing this called a prologue everywhere and it’s driving me mildly insane
Hi! Unfortunately this isn't my image. I'm assuming this is part of the CD or Vinyl order. I found this deep within a separate Taylor Swift thread last night and have yet to find a source or better quality image.
Yeah sorry should've said "good breakup album about Joe"
She says a LOT about Joe on this album. It’s just that she’s not taking down his character so much as expressing her heartbreak about the relationship.
I also think she said a lot of how she feels on *Folklore* and *Evermore*, to be honest...Exile, Hoax, Champagne Problems, Tolerate It, Happiness, and Coney Island are some of the ones that come to mind. Thematically, they're all generally about losing a person you're still in a relationship with. It's old news and kinda obvious at this point, so I'm sure I'm just a broken record, but I think those songs are way more autobiographical than they were made out to be at the time of releasing them.
And probably a little on lover, folklore and evermore too 😅
I’m still not convinced midnights was about Joe. It’s just so weird to me to release and album about your current boyfriend who helped you on the album about breaking up?
Haha no I definitely think there are songs about Joe I was just referring to that specific sentence and the amount of people complaining/remarking that she wrote SO much about Matty. 
My actual thoughts are that she didn't allow herself to properly grieve the loss of her relationship with Joe before jumping into something with Matty, therefore when that relationship didn't work she fell apart twofold. So while she may have been writing about Matty she was also feeling the loss of Joe at the same time.
I am BAFFLED that people aren’t seeing (especially after reading this post) that it’s another Era. The album is about the death of a relationship. If you date someone for six years, that phase in your life when you conduct a post mortem would include your rebound and end at how you overcame the heartbreak… ie the Travis song.
I think I've found my people in this comment.  I keep seeing that whole Matty hype but to me this is more about getting to that place at the end of a relationship where you have no self-esteem and you're just doing something to feel something.  To get a rush of life that's been missing.  

I think the loss of Joe is stamped on these and what it drove her to.
I have to ride on the train that I do NOT believe this entire album is about Joe.
huh? smallest man doesnt sound joe - more matty
I think the smallest man who ever lived is Matty- You rusted my sparkly summer- just one summer and she was on tour.
Agreed! I’m surprised how many songs people think are about Matty
No, it’s mostly Matty! Only 4ish seem to be about Joe.
Makes me think of my ex husband. Like by the time we divorced,  we hadn't really been "together"  for a long time and I had already mostly mourned the loss already. Obviously not fully, but enough. Maybe these are mostly about Matty because she had already mourned that loss through the last few albums. The heartbreak was Obviously there in those albums.
I feel like that song is clearly about Matty? Jehovah's Witness suit, pills, showed her off in public?
That song is definitely about matty not Joe
Oh I'm not denying that. I was mostly being silly and pointing out how she gave a reason why she wrote so much about Matty when everyone was expecting all Joe.
i think you need to somewhat re-listen again because it is obviously about Matty lol. like i mean... showed her off in public? joe never did that... pills and the jehovah witness suit? yeah that's clearly aint him hahah
I don’t think anything indicates that Joe was a bad guy, compared to many other actual problematic men she’s written about. A bad, lackluster partner perhaps, not the right person for Taylor for sure. Boring maybe? But otherwise a decent person. From my personal experience it’s having to end it with someone good that hurts the most, more than ending it with someone that’s bad news though. Also, I think some devastation that appears to be about the Marty relationship harbors the pain from Joe. It’s what happens when you rebound quick and it doesn’t work out.
Not sure where to put this but I feel that you can completely understand the trajectory of this...

London Boy - hanging out with new mates watching rugby in london - all cute and wonderful.

It's "Notting Hill" - the regular guy gets the megastar.

However when the reality sinks in - your megastar girlfriend is always somewhere else with other people, doing promos and gigs and being adored...  it would take a very tough guy to be cool with that. 

I can imagine feeling like she's getting away from you and that you have to hold on tighter to keep her...  but by doing that you just drive the final nails in (Bejewlled etc)

Dating Tay is like having a pet tiger.  Wonderful when it's newly born - a wild and fantastic creature that loves you.  But eventually you need to let it roam free and trust it to come back, or it will eat your face.
Yep!!! I’m convinced she’s trying to tell us Joe was not the relationship we saw
Yes yes definitely Travis/ family/fans - the I heart radio blurbs were game changers too
Yeah, it changes her perspective on matty because a lot of the songs really praise him (until the smallest man who ever lived, that’s a really rough one) but this poem makes it really clear what she thinks in the long run
It reminded me of "my mama don't like you and she likes everyone" from Love Yourself.
Why not both
Can you break down which songs are about whom?
What song do people think is about Travis?
Thank you so much for this!
Thanks! I did some digging and found it. :)
Yes it’s the booklet with all the lyrics and the last page has the epilogue. No, I got the CDs.
Thank you!
I understand this perspective but also there are so so many layers to songwriting and truth be told, these songs could be about multiple people. I’ve seen theories that some are about Matty, others about Joe, some about both. Literally no way of knowing. Imo as long as the music itself is good that’s the most important aspect
while I agree with your statement it does not feel like the people that care so much about that care about it because of that. Its feels super parasocial-ly.
Thank you, OP! Much appreciated! ❤️
No disrespect to you guys but idk this is just weird lol
It’s unreal.
YES THIS RIGHT HERE
Her writing is magical. Genius. I just can’t get over how amazing she is!
And combine that with the theories that the fortnight video will have some story about her being in a psychiatric facility…
Holy shit this is so good. I might steal it
I love that you said this.
I love this.
Ooooo!
I feel like when the standards get higher deceit catches fire and the pillars of the town become the best liars.
God it felt so much longer than two weeks
Wow I knew she dated him briefly but I didn’t realize it was two *weeks*. There were so many songs I thought it had to be at least a couple months or something.
Ok here is my beef with us Swifties. No one knows her personal life like we think we do. 2 weeks on camera is nothing like her real life. Obviously it was much more and longer that. She doesn’t tell the public everything and everyone is gonna have to accept that. We don’t know her.
I don’t believe it was actually only two weeks but either way, really long two weeks.
“I’m never going to meet what should’ve been you”? Doesn’t fit with it being about Joe. Same with “did some force take you ‘cause I didn’t pray?” “Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia?” (Aka the universe randomly causing a sad event to happen, like a senseless death)
Bigger than the whole sky
If we are talking about it being about a breakup, i would interpret that line as she will never meet the version of him that she so desperately wanted?
It’s not that she didn’t meet the person literally. She is saying she didn’t get to meet the Joe as a father, a husband, etc. I definitely think it’s about grieving Joe.
Bigger Than The Whole Sky
She's American? As a European it seems microwaves are a staple cooking appliance in the states, from boiling water to entire recipes cooked in there 🤷🏻‍♀️
Oh interesting connection to the Plath poem! My first thought with the "two graves, one gun" line was more in line with “He who seeks revenge digs two graves."
I really hope to see Taylor swift being analysed in high school English classes in the same way Sylvia is in the future. Great catch!
This was my interpretation too. Going from being slowly roasted to a quick nuke.
Yep. Rebounded from a 10 year relationship/marriage into an 8 month fling with a wholly unsuitable suitor. It was like all of my emotions from the big breakup were suspended, and when the 8 month relationship ended, I was in so much more pain. The first relationship had been collecting interest.
Omg this!
Just to add: I think short term relationships can seem to hurt more when they end because they tend to end very quickly, rather than a drawn out, falling out of love situation. Midnights made it clear she was falling out of love with Joe for a while
Yeah, it makes no sense. NONE of those guys would’ve had a chance in hell with us if we weren’t so broken hearted and grasping at any sense of safety.

A.K.A. - Tortured Poets Department Alum.
You said it!
This is so sweet, I used to! I’ve let myself become that cliche mom with no time for herself. This album is really awakening that creative spark for me again ♥️
YES! It happens to so many!! I’ve had years and therapy to process mine, but damn it’s so much more common than you realize. Being an adult is so fucked up, confusing and hard at times 😩
The songs about Joe are much more devastating and just about the experience of heartbreak, rather than personal attacks. Matty gets most of the directed heat. But I think the overall album is just about the aftermath of a breakup and Matty had much more of a role in the aftermath. Midnights already told us a lot about the lead up to the split.
It’s not that Matty did a number on her so much as that the ending of the relationship with Joe did such a number on her that she wasn’t thinking clearly.
I believel loml as well
Really, loml, My Boy, Down Bad seemed to be about Joe to me with Fresh out the Slammer being both of them
It also sounds like she ended things with Joe, so it’s a different type of pain when you leave vs being left
There’s rumors they dated briefly about a decade ago. There was history there and by the lyrics and this poem it was intense before and that’s where it took off from. Sort of like when someone with an addiction goes back to it. They don’t start slow, casually…they take off from where they left off
Interesting
Double album !!!!!! I was like why the hell are most these about matty
I think So Long London is about the ending with Joe - but yeah, most are Matty sounding!
Nah not all of them.  1-5 are Joe, 6-9 are Matty, 10 Joe, 11 Matty, 12/13 Joe.  14 could be Travis.  I am currently listening to the Anthology so IDK about those yet.  

But half the album is def about Matty for sure.
Bigger than the whole sky
oh, i interpreted the italicisation in a completely different way. the lovers is a tarot card, and from there on, a lot of different things. 

i don't believe that Lover was all bullshit. she was in denial, yeah, but doesn't make it all not-real.
I saw it as just clearly signaling that she’s talking about Joe here
Lmao no. It's italicized because she's directly referencing the song title.
No need to be sorry :) I appreciate you
Yes Joe is all over this??!!!
I’m glad it’s that way and she’s not blaming him for everything. It was just a relationship which fizzled out and that’s the worse when you love someone. Knowing there is nothing you can both do.. I feel the worse thing Joe did to get was not marry her and want a quite life… and after the abuse he’s had over the last 12 months along with his co-stars I’m not that surprised! 
You have to be strong to deal with all her circus and he wasn’t. It’s so sad that some times she’s not strong enough too but it’s her life and I don’t think she would really change it that much!
Truuu She has nothing bad to say about himm 🥺 she's just sad that it's over
I think there’s a slight through line of her wondering whether the issues she was feeling in that relationship were normal in a long term relationship or a sign of actual problems. Lots of self-reflection as someone else mentioned, and fearing that she will tear the relationship apart (peace, anti-hero)
I've always read it as subconsciously about the issues in their relationship at the time (COVID was a down time for everyone so reflecting on the bad could be normal). Joe and Taylor could work on it thinking it's fiction inspired by real life (like folklore and evermore), but it's kind of more real than they think.

At least that's my thought on it. I don't think Taylor set out to write "a Joe album" and then like lied to everyone about it. I think it just happened incidentally cuz music making is an emotional process. (it also explains the lack of cohesion on Midnights and how much it jumps around).
It seems likely they were fairly on-and-off, at least near the end. My theory is that she left You're Losing Me off the original album because at that point she was still hoping to make it work. But I think The Great War seems to be pretty undeniably about them almost ending things but then getting back together, so with that in mind a lot of other songs seem likely to be written during one or more breaks in their relationship.
I think she was telling the truth that Midnights was a concept album of songs from sleepless nights scattered across her life, but I also think:


* the reason that theme came to her was the sleepless nights she was having in the present day re: her relationship with Joe breaking down and being very on and off


* even the songs that aren't specifically about Joe are looking back at a past situation through the lens of the present day, and so the breakdown of her relationship bleeds into her memories and how she's conceptualising things


I think at the time the album was released (although not necessarily all the time that she was working on the album) they were back together and giving things another go (*"We survived the Great War"*, *"Thought the plane was going down, How'd you turn it right around"*), but some main tracklist songs might have been replaced by vault tracks if they'd stayed broken up.


In a way, I suppose Midnights unintentionally ended up as the pre-breakup breakup album, exploring her feelings as the relationship was ending.


I think this album is also best described as an album about her breakup with Joe, but this one focuses more on the very end and the aftermath than what led to it — her grief, her self-reflection, and navigating a controversial rebound relationship in the public eye during a summer where so much focus was on her.
Midnights is like her come to jesus moment to joe!!!! Like finally waking up and realizing this aint working and this one is her final mourning stage. I always like her songs about joe because it mostly self reflection on her and their relationship
I think it was about him in retrospect
HELLO!
This really helps me make sense of the album. Because the songs are so clearly about Matty but I really don’t understand how a greasy guy like him could inspire this much depth of feeling, but if there’s feelings about Joe mixed in then the despair totally makes sense.
*slaps desk* THANK YOU. So glad someone else analyzed the album like this. Shaking your hand in spirit.
YES right there with you. She wrote this album to close The Breakup and Rebound chapter.
I just wrote a long ass comment on the main mega thread literally saying all of this was my take on this album and then BAM I see this post and this comment thread and I’m singing THANK YOU! Y’all get it!
What’s the Travis song?
Same! I shocked that people see it as a Matty record? Did we listen to the same album? To me, it's clearly about a lonnng on and off relationship. Not a 2 months situationship. It's obvious Joe was an avoidant and insecure partner who slowly built resentment over time, but wouldn't express it directly. That is the main theme to me.
I think we’re at 5 Joe/6 Matty. But ultimately all Joe because I think the relationship with Matty was  form of self-harm after the Joe breakup, like she said
1000% The “Jehovah Witnesses Suit” line is a dead give away it’s Matty. 

It’s as pointed and scathing as ohoebe bridger calling out Ryan Adams in Motion Sickness, “ why do you sing with an English accent” 

She put that in there to leave no question about  who she’s going to obliterate.
I don’t understand why everyone thinks it’s about Matty!! There are a few but this is mainly a post mortem on 6 years with Joe
THIS. By the time my ex and I separated, I was sad about the end of a relationship I'd put so much time and energy into, but I wasn't sad to lose *him*, just the marriage I'd sunk so much energy and time into. And not even the marriage so much as *a* marriage.
Exactly this. She’s never shied away from airing her thoughts about men who treated her badly. If Joe was really that problematic the entire album would’ve put him on blast rather than matty. I think some people were so excited for a breakup album dissing Joe that they’re trying to turn him into something he’s not.
I really think "Happiness" fits their relationship the best, even though it's an Evermore song.
My most difficult breakup was with a man who didn’t do anything wrong, but we grew to want different things. I remember feeling so upset and just wishing he’d text me something hurtful so I could stand on a solid reason to get over him. But he was so kind during the breakup that I was just climbing the walls in anxiety because I couldn’t figure out a way to get passed it.
Some of the lines are so subtle and yet SCATHING
I’ve been saying this since they broke up. Or since she told us they broke up. What if all the glorious, beautiful Joe she wrote of him in Lover and the rest were really just her trying to make him feel special and put him on a pedestal so he didn’t feel less than in every way because of how successful she is. But it was all a crock of shit she made up to paint a lovely picture so he didn’t leave her???? Sounds like the smallest man that ever lived to me.
I think 3,4,5,7,12 are Joe and 1,2,6,9,11,14 are Matty. 15 is Travis. Now that we have the new songs I think MOST of those are Joe
Alchemy and So High School
Thank you so much!!
Maybe make this a sticky on the post so other people can find it too?
Of course. Apologies as this is the only picture that exists of it and it's not my photo.. lol
No disrespect at all. I think Reddit is trying all they can to increase engagement to make more money. 🤷
It was longer than two weeks. They were publicly together for a month but there’s a lot pointing to it starting sooner than that since Matty was across the world on tour when they started dating and she was with him in London that January..
I made a post of their relationship timeline- it began in 2014 actually on and off since then
I think she's only counting the time that they were in a physical relationship, she's also saying there was an emotional affair for a while (and that they were involved before).
I heard it was a month but not sure.
I think she’s purposefully minimizing their relationship.
Maybe more like spent a whole two weeks physically together? 🤷‍♀️
I think she makes it clear in TTPD that she was hoping for marriage and kids with Joe, so maybe those lines are a metaphor for that, the future that somehow was taken away from her?
I'm probably way over interpreting this but I know a lot of people think that song is about miscarriage, if that's true then the conversation about tearing down the whole sky line is absolutely heartbreaking.
Why wouldn’t it? “Taken” doesn’t have to mean mean that he died? He also didn’t have to be taken, their relationship or the good parts of their relationship could have been taken.
lol what. They just heat food. People do not regularly cook meals in microwaves that were not already prepared.
Hahaha! I love that people think this about Americans. Thanks for making my day
We boil water on the stove, not microwaves. Although electric kettles are more common now.
[deleted]
….no, that is not something that Americans generally do 🤔
No
I think that's a good thought on it, too.
I'm a Swiftie but one thing to remember is she is an excellent lyricist and songwriter. I wouldn't reach to call her a poet, yet, in the academia sense. There are similarities between lyrics and poetry, but they're not exactly the same.
Imagine your kid bringing home their homework and showing you their interpretation and you go on a 2 hour journey together about how their answer is wrong 😅
That is exactly what I think the album is saying about Taylor. Jumping into it saved her from her grief for the fortnight, but when it didn't work out with Matty she had the two breakups in one.
"The first relationship had been collecting interest."  


This is so true of many things in life. If you don't deal with your feelings right then they don't go away. You have to deal with it all later... with interest.
Dunno how to format the "right way" on mobile so 


"The first relationship has been collecting interest."

That reallllllllly hit for some reason. Wow
That's why you're supposed to be alone for a while after ending a long-term relationship.  Though, fwiw, I don't know anyone who has actually done this, including myself.
What a great way to say it…the first relationship was collecting interest.
This. I ruined my life for someone I thought I was “saving” and really the saving was I saw someone worse off than myself and that gave me the will to live. It was awful, it literally ruined areas of my life I still can’t fix but I was not okay mentally. 
Now - it would never happen.
I can very much relate to that. But truly, that line hit me good. Use that spark when you can! ⚡️❤️‍🔥
I think there is an extra level of heartbreak when a relationship doesn’t work out not because one of them did something bad (which can help a person move on) but because they want different things. If Taylor wanted marriage and children and he didn’t I’m sure that manifested into feelings of unworthiness and lost time.
Deux Moi did say that Matty never ended the relationship, he got on a plane and ghosted her. I’m sure that did a number on her if true
Ya I think there’s a good chance loml is Joe as well, or maybe a mix of both idk. After listening to How Did It End loml seems way more to be a Joe song
RIGHT??
I actually think 10 is more about pop culture as a whole, and the fickleness of being put on a pedestal to the point of dehumanisation while people are ready to tear you down.

> So tell me everything is not about me, but what if it is?

> Then say they didn't do it to hurt me, but what if they did?

To me, this is making me think of things like the sale of her masters, and people saying it was just business. Or people saying that she's self-obsessed and critiquing every small thing she does as "making everything about her" (the thing at the Grammys was probably too recent to be an inspiration for the song, but it reminds me of that)

> I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me

> You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me

She's grown up as a celebrity at the centre of pop culture, and that would be enough to drive anyone mad

> So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs

The 'you' throughout the bridge feels like a plural you, but especially here with "you kids". 'Sneak into my house' brings to mind obsessive fan behaviour around Holiday House and Cornelia Street.

> I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?

> That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn

> That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong

> Put narcotics into all of my songs

> And that's why you're still singin' along

Again, this feels like catty pop culture stuff - she's obsessed with herself and playing the victim, she's litigious, she's not actually a good songwriter, she just manages to 'put something in it' and make people like it anyway.

I think there are other lines that fit with that interpretation too, like 

> The who's who of "Who's that?" is poised for the attack

> But my bare hands paved their paths

makes me think of other people who are supposed to be notable/important but aren't on her level of fame - possibly other artists, possibly industry executives, possibly people in the media - waiting in the wings to tear her down if she's being cancelled. "But my bare hands paved their paths" - they got where they were by profiting off her raw talent or following in her footsteps

> So I leap from the gallows

Fits with the idea of being 'executed' for 'crimes', possibly being cancelled again

It's all feeling very Mad Woman to me.

**Edit** to add my thoughts on the other songs in the main album: I'm not 100% sure who 1 is about, it doesn't feel entirely Joe or entirely Matty to me. Possibly semi-fictionalised based on one or both? Or some secret fling that the public never heard about? 2-5 are 100% Joe, 6-9 are 100% Matty. I think given that I think 10 is about pop culture and cancellation and it's in the middle of the Matty songs, it's directly related to the Matty controversy. 11 is 100% Matty. 12 and 13 feel like they could be about either Matty or Joe, and I wonder if that's intentional? As in, once the rebound ends she's processing both heartbreaks at once. 14 feels more like Matty again. I think you're right that 15's about Travis, there's a lot of football references. And then 16 is back to pop culture like 10, but less angry and more contemplative.
🫶🏻
You said I’m the love of your life. 
You shit talked me under the table, talking rings and talking cradles. 

I assumed this was about Joe but later she said it was legendary and it was momentary. Maybe it’s Matty also?? But if it’s Joe she’s calling him out for being a POS.
Agreed. I think it's exactly what she said. An album about sleepless nights spent thinking about the past, which is something you do when you're trying to figure out your feelings in the present and imagine your future. You looks for parallels. Am I doing that thing again? Will this time be different than last time?
I think this is beautifully explained and see it as the most rational and realistic take on the album. It would also explain her release of "You're Losing Me" as a vault track right after the announcement of their break up went public.
I found that there were a couple of songs where — even reading the lyrics closely — it was hard to tell whether they were about Joe or Matty, despite them being really quite different people. There's songs where I lean towards one of them, but then the lyrics have parallels to a song that I lean towards being about the other.


And I think that ambiguity is probably intentional and reflects the fact that when things ended with Matty she was essentially processing two similar breakups at once — a familiar person who she loved and saw a future with, who she'd broken up with and got back together with before.
100% Agree@
okay but when she said “tattooed golden retriever” in “the tortured poets department” i fully thought she was talking about travis kelce — sorry, but i wouldn’t think to call matty healy a golden retriever — and i was living with the funniest mental image of taylor playfully telling TRAVIS KELCE that he’s “not dylan thomas” and he’s just like “yeah sick! love you, you’re the best!” and then they high five and he orders a really nice pizza on caviar and lets her choose the movie, and they have a lovely evening. he had no idea what that comment was about, he doesn’t know who dylan thomas is, but he doesn’t care. he just won the super bowl and he’s a happy guy. 

come to find out this is not the case. should have known TK isn’t leaving typewriters at her apartment for no reason. i prefer my version tbh
So high school!
The Alchemy
the alchemy
There are multiple references to a "short time" it was over quickly, etc. Even her IG post calls it a "fleeting moment in time". That screams Matty.
What is the Jehovah’s Witness suit referencing?
Lots of people listened to the leaks and had an extra day and a half to sit on the songs and dissect them. There are a LOT more about Matty than you think.
Because they (unlike Taylor) can’t get over the Joe relationship lol
I’ve been a “Joe is not a bad person, they just weren’t right for each other anymore” swiftie since day one, and maaan did I have to stay quiet for most of the past year. I felt like I was in the trenches bc if we defended him we got called “Joe dickriders” 😬
Yes these were my notes too except 7 I'm leaning more toward Matty but it may be purposefully blurred
My theory is Guilty as Sin was written around this time, thinking about Matty whilst still being with Joe, however rocky that relationship was at the time. I think her and Joe were spotted together last in Feb.
Yes! If Joe was the whole sky (according to this poem intro) then her dreams of marriage and kids with him are even bigger than the whole sky
My initial thought on very first listen. But I think the miscarriage theories kinda took over and didn’t leave room for other theories. Sure, It's a vague song so it could have multiple meanings. But this tie to the album note is interesting.
I agree with this theory too
I don’t know that it’s about miscarriage but I suppose it could also be her wanting kids but he didn’t. I feel like it’s still grieving a loss?
I absolutely feel like this and hoax could be about that but I don’t want to speculate about those things they didn’t choose to share from their relationship.

Even if they aren’t specifically about that from/for her, both of the songs relate to some people who have experienced that kind of loss.
“Never meet what could’ve been you”. That’s not about a dating relationship.

The part about flapping wings in Asia is about the randomness of the universe causing a bad event. Taylor and Joe didn’t just randomly break up. They were not compatible for a number of reasons they eventually realized. 

Why would she play this song at the concert after Ana in Brazil passed if it weren’t about a death?
You can definitely cook food in a microwave. Was honestly kind of life changing for me in college when I learned your can totally cook chicken breasts in a steam bag in like 5 minutes. They came out super evenly cooked too, it was great.
There are full cookbooks dedicated to “microwave cookery.”
Gotta say, didn’t have intense conversion about microwaves on my bingo card
i make boiling water for tea or hot cocoa in the microwave almost every day 🙈
Which? I sometimes use the microwave to reheat food, I boil water on the stove. I cook on the stove top or oven

But I love my multi-use air fryer!
This is exactly what I was explaining all night! Turns out I just needed to get some sleep to find my people 🫶🏼
♥️🖤
Loml definitely felt like a bit of drawing from both to me, especially where she says things like “sell love quick”, but then has references to marriage?
No I saw that as Matty offering all the things she wanted with Joe but I think Joe kept saying he was t ready. Like he used her venerability to say what he knew she wanted to hear. Then when she said ‘your the loss of my life”  I think she means it was the final blow to make her so depressed, more then she had ever been before. It’s like shame and embarrassment she fell for it all and she wanted to go away again and not be seen. Maybe felt 2016 was repeating itself but her tour was the distraction and not a man (for a change)
And when you’re in a 6 year relationship, there’s some past pain there too, even when you’re still together. So I could see some Joe stuff sneaking in too. It’s not necessarily **about** him (it’s not really about any ONE guy, really) but he makes an appearance sort of deal.
Hahah stopppp why can I see this so clearly
I'm fucking dyingggg at this mental image
Same experience here. Joe’s only crime was being too depressed to love Taylor properly, but a lot of twitter swifties talk about Joe like he’s John Mayer 2.0 or something.
I think the song Peace perfectly encapsulates this. She says she’s wasting his honor and his integrity makes her seem small. He seems like a very good guy, albeit anxious and cold and introverted and bad at expressing his emotions. But certainly not the smallest man that ever lived. It’s almost like Matty was the exact opposite — no integrity, only wanted her in public, was using her, shallow, small piece of shit that she wanted to fix.
7 (Fresh Out The Slammer) is her thinking about Matty and wanting to be with him, but the in-between is about Joe: "Another summer, taking cover, sat in the shade of his feelings, he doesn’t understand me, etc." 

12 (loml) is very interesting because I think this where the lines blur and her feelings about both relationships are muddying themselves together. "A conman sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme" screams Matty showering her in affection and love bombing her and promising her everything she wants (talking rings and talking cradles). "Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry." Matty. But a line like, "I can’t get out of bed cause something counterfeit is dead" makes me think of Glitch and Joe. "The coward claimed he was a lion." —The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived vibe, so Matty. 

1 I think is a mixture of both. 2,6,9,11,14 are definitely Matty. 13 I think is a mixture of both again. The Alchemy is honestly giving Joe: "These chemicals hit like white wine (like she’s still intoxicated by him), what if I told you I’m back? The sign on your heart is still reserved for me." Like this is her going back to him after Hits Different, maybe. Or another time they were off. Especially because she uses the term "bloke" in the song, which is a British slang word.
I think it started long before that though. He was on the record saying they had worked on music for Midnights that didn’t make the album. Jack connected them when he was working on BFIAFL with Matty. So likely they’d been reconnected for about a year and were spending pretty intimate time together if they were making music together.
That's exactly what I got from it. I'm not convinced she didn't have some overlap with the two, even if she was just talking to Matty while she was still with Joe.
Yeah I totally agree - at first listen I thought it was grief about the person she could’ve become, and it really hit me thinking of my 13-year-old self who desperately needed therapy for undiagnosed OCD! And then I came on reddit and everyone is talking about miscarriage and it kinda made the song less meaningful to me in the sense that it almost didn’t allow for other interpretations as this one was so personal/heartbreaking for many. 

That’s all to say BTTWS is obviously about grief, and I think we can interpret that metaphor however we want. The stories are ours now anyway!

Edit: I have more 😂 with Emma Stone saying “I love you bigger than the whole sky” to her daughter, I wonder if Taylor actually heard it from Emma first and it made her grieve for the future she thought she might have with Joe and being able to say that to their kid too? I’m projecting here but I’m also running on very little sleep lol
Right, like grieving their hypothetical kids. She’ll never meet what they would have been since at that point, the writing was on the wall that they wouldn’t make it that far.
[deleted]
Absolutely, I'm like I want to share my thoughts but also it's deeply personal so I don't wanna assume anything if that makes sense?
“What could’ve been you” certainly could be implying a marriage as well. There also are some lines in TTPD like “learning the right moves to the wrong dances”. I think that it was random in the sense that it wasn’t working out despite what they initially wanted
Get an electric kettle, babe! Totally worth it
To me, this is the most clearly outlined reference to jumping into something too quickly and then having to grieve both relationships at the same time - realizing that the first one (Joe) was the loss of her life, and while the rebound helped for a minute, it just made everything so much worse
Honestly, the way they *despise* him is unbelievable, considering most of their criticisms of him are just assumptions and have not even been proven (like the cheating thing)
I think it was an emotional affair for a while then because her and Joe were clearly rocky for a while. But she’s singing about both of them there.
I have the same personal reading of BTTWS, as an ADHD kid that got no support growing up. I’m ok now, but I could’ve been so much farther by now if my parents had done any research. I think she wrote this one purposefully open ended so that we could all relate it to our own experiences.
Totally, it made it less meaningful for me too. Like the miscarriage meaning kinda bulldozed what else it could be about.
I don’t think that fits, but it’s a very creative take. She heavily uses metaphors but she’s usually a bit more straightforward than that.
Could be. I just also wonder if it means the relationship in general. I think that a lot of the lyrics could mean a person but could also just mean a thing
I agree - no one can convince me otherwise. 💔
I don’t think so after that stanza on the bottom left, but it’s probably never going to be confirmed
Exactly, it relates to people who have experienced loss like that for a reason, but I would never want to assume that is why she wrote it.  It’s possible they are about that type of loss and she only experienced it vicariously.  And it such a personal and painful experience I wouldn’t want to apply it to anyone who hasn’t openly claimed it for themselves
Agreed, that was literally my note when listening to a couple songs. Screams emotional affair.
“Industry against me got me feeling caged, they don’t wanna see drizzy Drake when he rage”😡 😡

Drake needs to drop an album with some melodies, we don’t like him when he act tough. 

He gonna drop on Drake every special occasion this year 

Juneteenth Pop out - “How many more black features till you finally feel that you’re black enough?

4th July - “You not a colleague you a fucking Coloniser.

Probably 25th Dec - “Hey Drake, sorry to bother you n**** thought I’d pop out and wish you happy Hanukkah n****, on k dot naughty list, best take a holiday n****”
😢🦉 hoo sobs hoo
OV HOEEEEEEE

You gotta tell us who he's working with, this is a trick question.

Sad part is that Owl been bumping Euphoria non stop.

It's a beautiful bird, though.
It’s over drake lost or better yet he paranoid and now spiraling
"Heh heh-heh-heh. Fools. This is all according to my plan." *smirks maliciously before fading into the darkness*
Drake gotta cut you a check for this one.
**sad owl noises**
Drakes nail is chipped 💅 😂😂😂
“I never even abused my pet owl like that, my owl is much happier than what you just suggested.” “Why would I have a torture dungeon for owls?” 

-Drizzler AKA BBL pedo
I think, this might be a reach, but this part was a little stretched (how long it was on screen for), as if Kendrick was either giving Drake a message or all of us one. I think it was that Drake is caged, either that Drake does not have permission to respond no more because of UMG. Drake is tied to something.  
Or he meant "I got you trapped" or "you belong in jail". That's prob it.
It's the Hogwarts owl.  Hufflepuff is not happy.
Hmmmmmm I was rly trying to keep it PG......

I'm just trying see little kids pee pee
I was really tryna keep it pg..

Drake actually rapped that? 😂😂😂 oh no no wait is this what J prince was trying to say would be going too far with Pusha T? Him “raging”?😅
Kendrick, you're getting on my bad side 😡 I'm telling your mom 🤬🤬🤬
That owl 🦉 cute af until it does the demonic head twist
the video shows the birds POV before this shot, there is no cage. is a metaphor for drake not seeing the prison he already lives in, caged in by addiction, insecurity, hatred, greed, hedonism. 

also could mean that theres low key an investigation into ovo that kendrick caught word of and is saying that drake could be behind bars soon.
Like an owl in a cage, My eyes wide open  
Checking her ID, my eyes stay SHUT.
Are these actual lyrics? If so, they’re clunky as hell and shite.
In my head cannon the owl is in the cage for what he did to Mr.Mackey, mmmkay
God's plan 🙏
Laying low in a cell, but I’m the 6 god like Icarus so fly through the cell.
Side note: Drake would gloss over the fact of Icarus wings melted from flying too close to the sun. As a result, he fell into the ocean and died via drowning.
Just change this to another Kendrick sub at this point

This beef is boring
Trash. He doesn’t even write his shit.
god how pathetic. This has to be one of the lamest moves in rap history. 
So y’all cool with throwing an owl in a cage for a music video just because it owns Drake?
But if the owl was truly committing the misdemeanor that was being conversed about, wouldn’t it be residing in cellular block known as One?
got a Dark Lane Demo Tapes Drake double tryna creep on Dot 🤣🤣
That's Drake's cameo. He wanted his participation trophy for being involved in the beef.
If this ends up being a reference to Stranger Things when 7 / Milly Bobby Brown knocks people away, going to be insane.

I cheer myself up by reminding myself that it’s just an actor, and it probably got lots of treats for putting on such a convincing performance after the cameras cut 
that bird represents drake locked up for being a pe**
All part of his plan.
I gotta go bad I gotta go bad 👿
Think that was him hopscotching over 10 boxes ngl 

This is him saying the caged bird sings

We should really all be talking about the 17 push-ups in a jail cell though lol
Hard to tell who the dancer is with the face down and all black outfit but the hat being clearly standing out as ‘COMPTON’ makes me think it’s just Kendrick saying you can’t sneak up on me, my city has my back. Probably something to do with drake putting out money and nobody flipping on Kendrick or producing dirt which resulted in ‘propaganda blowing up on him’

Drake always gonna have his diehard drizzy fan base who thinks he incapable of making a bad song or album but as far as this beef between kdot, this moment is always gonna linger over his career
He’ll likely continue to have hits, but his brand is forever damaged. Certified Lover Boy will now forever make people think “Certified Pedophile,” OVO will make people think OVO-Hoe, Drizzy will be P-Drizzy.
It’s not like you were listening to Drake anyways 😹
As a lover of Camp, I rocks with this.
Indeed
Let's talk about how the cage was painted black

Why did it need to be black?
I'll become an ovhoe
Man I totally forgot about Kool Keith , apartment 223 baby.
I once waited for Kool Keith to show perform until 3:30 am (should have started at 10 pm) and hearing his hype man saying every 15 minutes, “*Everybody get ready for Kooooooool Keiiiitthhhh!!!*” was so funny I couldn’t even be mad. 

A Drake x Dr. Octagon collab would be truly hilarious.

Good for you. I think it’s fucked up. Put you in a cage for a music video, I’m sure no one would care either.
When Kendrick said "pass me the ox" I had no idea it's prison slang for a razor used in jail to mark a pedos face😲
you guys are hilarious😭
Ahhh Mother I… Mother I… ahhh… Kenny just fucked me up… wop wop wop
Lmfao😭
The age Drake likes his women, which would put him in the jail cell Kendrick is rapping from
He better sing instead of rap.
Guy did 17 “prison pushups”, in a jail cell, while saying Drake should avoid going to jail for touching 17 year old girls... it ain't deep at all lmao, if we're using the reading analogy, this shit a picture book
What is it with this generation and its lack of poetic sensitivity? Why are nonchalant attitudes about art so popular with yall? 

It's OK to read into art more meanings and inferences beyond the surface. One man's "reach" is another man's "poetic connection." 

I'm not even trying to argue with you. I'm just genuinely concerned. Poetry keeps a man's heart alive. Otherwise, you become dead inside.

You fuck around too hard and Drake might offer you a job. 
i found my spirit gif! no drizzy,  every bitch gettin lit while i hit no drizzy
What should he be behind bars for realistically? Sure he’s done some shit that is weird and creepy but y’all need to relax lol. It’s like you want Drake victims to exist when there aren’t any as far as we know right now. He’s a weirdo for waiting on some of these chicks to become legal to fuck them for sure but there isn’t any real pedo evidence.

Why should he be behind bars man you guys have really let Kendrick convince you Drake is Epstein 2.0
Every Drake fan are still Drake fans doesn’t matter if Kendrick or Drake haters don’t listen to Drake they weren’t listening to him anyway so nothing will change that’s what people don’t understand 😹
I mean, if he continues the run he has since he stepped away from the beef, that will very well be true.

you’re referencing one instance that kendrick admitted and got therapy for. drake literally has a decade long discography of how he emotionally and physically manipulates women. kendrick admitted he was a dog at some point and got help. drake admits and embraces it. they are not the same. at the end of the day bro whitney  is the one in the relationship, not you. she decides what is right or wrong for her. but drake stans won’t understand that i’m sure.
Give it a rest bro. Comes across as a desperate attempt to taddle tale at this point. “But Kendrick did this” ass lol.

It sounds like you’re the one that needs to move on dude, you’re straight up seething about Kendrick on multiple posts right now, lol.
yeah it’s no wonder drake never dropped a video for family matters that was clearly made haphazardly. that would be thirsty as hell.
hey buddy, remember who released a music video first?
Dropping a music video is one of the lamest moves? Is that what you were saying when Drake dropped one?

What has Kendrick actually done? 1 tweet announcing NLU. 1 concert. 1 music video. Nothing else, not even 1 other post on social media. Drake? He’s been posting a lot more about how “unbothered” he apparently is and voting on IG polls about who won.

Lastly, is that what you were thinking when Drake was doing victory laps for over a year after Meek Mill? He still tooted his own horn about that even after losing to Pusha T. It’s not like he’s any different.
[removed]
Kendrick puts an owl in a cage and all of a sudden you Drake fans are animal activists?🤣
Calm down man it’s not that serious. They put the owl in the cage for a quick video ending. They probably took in out of the cage as soon as the cameras cut, it doesn’t appear to have any harmful markings on it. Owls are shy around humans so that’s probably why it looked so scared at the end.
Look, if you feel this way about all animals in captivity, more power to you. I certainly think there are ethical ways to handle such things, and we know nothing about this owl, so I think for now I’ll just enjoy the symbolism.
…do you think they just wrapped up and left the owl there or something?
I think he meant “pass the aux” bc he says “sweet chin music and I won’t pass the aux” meaning he’s beating Drake’s face in (metaphorically) and won’t let up
He doesn't say "pass me the ox" but cool.
Also did you know it's called "Meet the Grahams" cuz "graham" sounds like "gram" which is slang for drugs, and Kendrick is saying he wants to burn Aubrey up like some weed drugs? 🤯😵‍💫🤢
It’s “pass me the aux”

If you don’t know what that is, you’re too young for this shit
I don’t wanna diss you anymore shit got me second guessing…. You can drop 100 more records I’ll C ya Laterrrrrrr
Wait a second …. That’s that one song where you say you got MOL13sted!!111!1!
Also Drake told him to do pushups and Drake would stop caring after he passed 17
LOL
he did say he like drake with the melodies not when he try and act tough👌

Chill.

There is a difference between something an artist intended to do and something someone believes an artist intentionally did when it was either a coincidence, "happy accident", or a misinterpretation. All dude said was, "Yo, I don't think Kendrick intentionally did that as a hidden meaning. I think that's just your interpretation."

It's not about "poetic sensitivity". Ppl can still be open to interpretations but also be realistic when it comes to an artist's intent. All this "you become dead inside" is ridiculous. You're obviously an emotional person, cool. People enjoy and connect with music all the same regardless of their opinion on the validity/truth of certain meanings & inferences  derived from a song. Something can MEAN something to YOU. Something can be reasonable. That doesn't make it true. In terms of diss tracks sometimes the artist hides something hidden in a creative way and other times ppl over-analyze & come to conclusions that don't seem realistic or likely.

That's it.
respectfully, NLU is not poetry. it’s a clunky collection of verses over a throwaway west coast club beat
I know right just like Whitney wrote help while crip walking
Everyone out here claiming “reach! Reach! Reach!” When it’s proven time and time again that Kendrick is incredibly calculated and everything he does has a purpose, when will they ever learn lmao

>That's it.

I call it "dead imagination syndrome" or a "dulling of the senses."

There are deeper meanings all around us. We can choose to go through life as mindless and heartless husks with no imagination, or we can be poets, mining the gold and diamonds of life.

Isn't that what hip hop is all about? Finding beauty in the mundane?
This is the argument that people come up in fifth grade when they didn't like having to analyze a reading sample from Hemingway.

Most people just get beyond it and realize "author's intent" is not nearly as important as the child thought it was, because we all share the story, we all share the interpretation, and the stories that live on in our culture say just as much as us as about the author.

It's kind of the same idea as when someone watches an artistic film and wants to focus on whether the plot was realistic (or heck, the same with an action flick). Like sure, do that, but be aware it's like a tiny fraction of what is interesting and useful and relevant to talk about, not definitely not the most important fraction.
lol you can’t criticize Kendrick or his stans on Reddit man, they’re an army of reachers.   

You’re right though lol the 17 thing is particularly dumb because he’d only be put in jail in a handful of states.  If he intended their interpretation, the number of pushups would have been smaller.  But in fantasyland where Drake is a grooming pedo (who somehow, apparently, only is into 17+) trafficker, he’d go to jail.
Respectfully, no. It's poetry. Period. 

It's rock-headed to think otherwise.
i mean, you got like a video or something where kendrick is all “yall i was wearing yellow shoes whilst holding up my 3rd and 5th digits. obviously this is the ukrainian sign of peace” or some shit?
Which makes it funny that's the first person Drake links up with after the beef.
[removed]
Bro I would do anything to be in Drakes camp on a forever contract

grooming who? who exactly
How did you even come to this conclusion? I said there’s no damning evidence he’s a pedo and you assumed I’m cool with grooming lol.

I’m tired of dissing you. 

It was nice to get the pen working again.
Just say you regurgitated philosophical concepts/ideas to sound smart to yourself to combat your pathetically low self-esteem.
Found the faux-intellectual & pseudo-philosopher cornball. Look, dawg, don't let these upvotes gas this cringe behavior because I promise one day you'll look back and grit your teeth at your own comments 😭 Cute relativism of "meaning can be derived from our imagination" but in the case of a diss battle with actual disstracks then it's important to determine what an artist actually said/did versus something that purely exists in our imagination. It's literally how you determine who was actually the most clever. It's a disstrack, it's a video to a disstrack. If it was more like, "This is what it means to me." Then cool. But if you're saying shit then concluding/suggesting Kendrick intentionally did something then falling back to "use your imagination" & "where is your poetic sensitivity" when someone disagrees then you're beyond corny as fuck, lmfao.

Most people who analyze disstracks go in trying to be objective and realistic. Not with the intent to just consuming "poetry" and finding out what it means to them. It doesn't mean they lack imagination or "poetic sensitivity". There is a place and time & for this that is how they choose to handle it. So at the very least you ironically have a shallow view & the nuanced of people are lost to you in your attempt to seem "woke" (the real meaning" to your peers on here.
You're just corny like everyone downvoting because in terms of rap disstracks the intent is important. Not at all similar to if a plot to an "artistic film" (lmao) is realistic or not.
I wasn't even siding with anyone either, lol. These ppl are just shallow trying to feign a kind of depth they don't have. They're just cornballs & pseudo-intellectuals. It's obvious shit in terms of disstracks/diss battles to differentiate what the artist actually said & did versus something that we prolly just interpretated. Because people have an insane capacity to create something out of nothing it's important to keep this shit in mind when determining which two dudes came out with the most clever "art/poetry". "You're not poetically sensitive and so you're gonna become dead inside ☝️🤓" actual fuckin cornball bro.

So you’re talking about when I was 7 years old? Great comp. You must have stopped learning anything at that age. Hell, you may even be 7 years old.

Should Kendrick Lamar have cited all his innuendos for us in MLA format to ensure there is no misunderstandings? Yeah people reach too far all the time but the fact that some of these crazy reaches even seem plausible speaks to what the world thinks of Kendrick, and it just keeps happening in every drop. That is a whole lot of coincidences. If he’s just accidentally ripping into his opponent this hard that is even more impressive and deserving of further examination.
Look. I get it. Some people have a more poetic bent than others. Some people are more imaginative than others, writing and painting and the like. And some people are made to just break bricks and row boats. But don't pretend that everyone should be just one way. Based on what you just typed, which category do you think you would fall into?
Watch out everyone, the Don’t Think Too Deeply About Art Police are here. He’s gonna write you a ticket for being corny!
Regardless of your intent here, this just reads like like you’re incapable of picking up on meanings and thus assume everyone else is. 

As the OP commenter though, I’m curious: what did I say that’s relevant here? Was it pointing out him jumping over 10 blocks? Or that a bird was in a cage? Or that he did 17 push-ups in a jail cell while alleging Drake could go to jail for being a pedo? This is all surface level stuff lmao

Lol y’all say anything about Drake in here. He has a bunch of commercial music of course but why sit here and pretend he doesn’t have a very broad catalog of music?

Makes sense now, you vegetarian too ?
Hope you don’t eat any meat, go to any zoos, and don’t watch any movies with animals in them.
Mess with my seed now deal with his dad I gotta go bad 🤬 I gotta go bad 😤
I am except when I eat orca whale and owl. I try to follow the trophic system, but it’s hard sometimes.
I definitely eat meat, don’t go to zoos, but also don’t trap and use animals in music videos. How many takes you think it took for that owl to nail its part in the cage?

A friend spotted this at Wembley. There must be others out there. 
In Munich I saw a bald man who wrote “blank space” on the back of his head 😆

Saw this on Twitter
 At my show in Hamburg was a guy with a shirt that said “the fella over there with the hella good hair”. He was literally bold and had rhinestones glued all over his head 😂
i saw two tall guys with „TALLEST MAN WHO EVER LIVED“ on their backs
At my show there was a pregnant woman and she had "I'm having his baby" on her belly. 
Ha! I saw a similar one that said “I’m a Swiftie Dad. There are teardrops on my credit card”.

I also saw a shirt that said “Ask my daughter about her friendship bracelets”, and he had a young girl with him. That melted my heart.
I saw a girl wearing the midnights bodysuit and her boyfriend in a hoodie with a picture of a chair printed that Taylor dances on during vigilante shit 🫣🫣

I felt this one at Wembley deeply.
My husband was very proud of his costume he had a bed glued on a hat and wore the cardigan and went as the cardigan underneath the bed!

I saw a couple where the man was wearing a shirt that said 'I love a Swiftie, it's ruining my life'. Personally found it pretty funny
I saw one on TikTok yesterday that was the “queen of sandcastles he destroys”… she had that on a sash, had a cute two piece set on in a blue/green colour, with a bunch of shells/sand toys/beach related things made into a tiara and on the entire outfit. It was adorable and one I haven’t seen yet.
A dad with a T-shirt that said “MILF - man I love folklore” (maybe should have been DILF - damn I love folklore)
Saw some parents with ‘The Tortured Parents Department’ shirts!
My friend, who is paralyzed and uses a wheelchair, asked me to make him a t-shirt that said “time won’t fly it’s like I’m paralyzed by it” on the back for our show. It was a hit!
There were two girls at Wembley with shirts that said ‘here’s to my mama’ and the mum had a shirt with ‘had to listen to all this drama’ we lolled
I saw a couple wearing deer onesies with name tags.
The tags spelled "john" and "reader"
I thought it was very clever and cute 😍

My 50 cents from yesterday :)
A shirt that said "WIDE EYED GAYS"
on Friday I saw a dad wearing a shirt that said “SWIFTIE BY CHOICE!” and then in small writing underneath it said “(my daughter’s choice)” lmao
This person who was going with her friends James and Dean, and they had three matching football jerseys:


JAMES


DEAN


DAYDREAMLOOKINYOUREYES



Absolutely brilliant
I saw a tall man at Wembley who had a shirt in the 22 style which said 'Too big to hang out' on the front and 'slowly lurching' on the back.
I can't remember any of them but the number of dads wearing dad jokes on their shirts tells me they win at lyrical puns.
Last night we saw a couple, the girl wearing a t-shirt that said ‘Karma is my boyfriend’ and her boyfriend was wearing a shirt that said ‘Karma’ which I enjoyed.
in the style of the 22 shirts, "we are never ever getting rep tv" made me giggle

When we went Eras I made my husband a shirt that said “Dear Jon” instead of John. His name is Jon.

my husband and my bestie’s husband went as spider boy & king of thieves 🤭
In Zurich N1, I saw a video woman with a veil/wedding head accessory and put „FUCKED“ on her forehead. It was amazing!
Made my bf the obligatory “karma” shirt but then on the back wrote “emotional support boyfriend” with an arrow that could point to me. Then he proposed at the concert so we sharpied our boyfriend and wrote fiancée underneath 😂

Not the eras tour but favorite costumes of all time were two girls dressed as Enchanted and Wonderstruck (literally wearing like, big round paper mache type structures around their bodies). Iconic.
Saw this one in Vienna lol

https://preview.redd.it/qtld69apkejd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f3668292d60e2995f821351e7e3ac6352c9e459
Not necessarily especially creative, but at my show, Taylor wore the 'A Lot' Red shirt, and the girl who got the 22 hat wore the 'Not A Lot' shirt!
I just saw a tiktok of a girl who went with a white dress and a marker, and a sign that said “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and asked people to write the names of the smallest men in their lives on her dress. Her dress was covered in names by the end of the night and I love that idea so much

I saw this last night: "It's me. Hi. I'm the dad. It's me."
I am cracking up at all of these. I wish there were pictures for all of them.
The two people who dressed as twin flames and holding blue paintbrushes - they will always be famous to me. See them in action: [https://www.tiktok.com/@priscillatbrown/video/7227818118926880046?lang=en](https://www.tiktok.com/@priscillatbrown/video/7227818118926880046?lang=en)

here’s mine from friday 🩷
i called my husband last night to ask if I could impulse buy a Wembley N6 ticket on our credit card and immediately sent him this picture 😂
I saw someone in the post about outfits from the Vienna cancellation with a shirt that had 11 turkeys creepin up on me, and that made me cackle.
Spotted a guy at Wembley on Friday wearing a shirt that said "Who's afraid of LIDL old me" 😭
“The oldest swiftie who ever lived”. Can’t find the photo now but it’s a very very sweet older gentleman with a red-era t shirt format. He’s adorable

Snow on the beach in Denver
A bloke in sydney walking around with a Suzuki Swift t-shirt
Not a pun but had to share. Was walking behind someone and thought they had a giant traffic light costume on, they turned around to talk to their friend and it turns out they were wearing a giant refrigerator costume! Pretty sure it was a reference to “dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light” from All Too Well.
at my show I saw a man wearing a cut up prison jumpsuit look with a board that said "sentenced to death by a thousand cuts".
my husband wore a shirt that said “it’s me, hi. i’m the husband it’s me” and received LOTS of compliments 😂
On Cornelia Street (Corneliusgasse) in Vienna, there were two girls dressed up as a ball and Aristotle. I think that was peak comedy
I made a Death by a Thousand Cats shirt 😋

I made these for my group! Such a fun time
I loved seeing a mom with her daughters wearing "milf man I love folklore" in the folklore font in Dublin
I was amused at the amount of Chief's stuff I saw, but also pleased, because it allowed people to wear a jersey or a sweater or whatever and still get into the vibe of the show with a little bit of dressing up, while still saying comfortable.
I don’t have a pic but yesterday I saw a girl dressed in a black bodysuit with a plushie of a cat on her shoulder that looked just like Benji…. She was recreating the Times cover photo and she looked so on point!

I love all these! 🫶 I had printed a Red style t-shirt for my bf saying 'So magnetic almost obnoxious' where the magnetic was red. He loved it 👏❤️
In Gelsenkirchen I saw a guy whose shirt said "Swiftie by choice...my girlfriend's choice"
All ya had to do was.. PAY
Not a pun, but my boyfriend likes to smoke weed so he’s wearing a “no it’s Becky” shirt
A girl with a shirt that said “They say I did something bad” and a guy with a shirt that said “Something bad”
I saw two 20-something guys wearing soccer jerseys and thought they were just sporty bros.  That was until I looked closer and realized they were Taylor themed — number 13, SWIFT on the back, etc. They looked so much like what a real soccer club would wear, down to all the details.

I got my wife this one and she wore it proudly
I made my husband a tortured husbands department shirt for Vienna
Saw a swiftie dad with a 22-style t-shirt at the show on Thursday that said “spending a lot at the moment”. (A LOT was in red). That might be my favourite one so far, made me actually laugh out loud. it was great seeing all the parents dressed up and getting in the spirit of it too (:

My sister made these shirts for my husband and his friend at Gelsenkirchen N2. They are both over 6'5".
A shirt with Jake Gyllenhall's face with a red X over it
Warsaw N2. I saw a dad with two girls. The dad was wearing a giant friendship bracelet wrapped around his torso, like a sash, which had beads that said: IN MY DAD’S ERA.
My shirt would say, "it's not my fault.  I like good music"
She is, because my Vienna refund hasn’t hit yet.
She stole his card and his hair lol
I love this!
That is pretty funny. And relatable.
Lmao that’s a great shirt

I saw a couple where the woman wore a tshirt that said i love taylor swift and the man wore a tshirt that said i love a swiftie 💕😭
I love word plays, puns, etc so when I saw a girl with “My reputation’s never been Warsaw” on her long black cape I died dead. N2 of Warsaw ❤️
At the Dublin n2 show I saw a woman with a cast on her leg from the knee down. She had bejazzeled it so it said *'I can do it with a broken foot'.*

Oh my gosh I wish I could shake his hand.

I saw this guy!!!
I’ve made my very tall bf a friendship bracelet for our show saying “the tallest man at the gig” with the rule that if he sees someone taller he has to pass it on!
Omfg ☠️☠️☠️
This is funny, but why not just -- "he's so tall and handsome as h---"?
I wish my husband could have worn this. He’s 6’5 so taller than most people I see
I made a jacket with this on when I was pregnant for my show!
I told my husband that if we have a baby, I’m gonna incorporate that lyric into our announcement lol.
I saw this too on Friday!!
I’ve never been more upset that I have to miss my show due to my pregnancy. This is so funny
That’s so sweet!
I’m 28 weeks pregnant and wore a t shirt with this on to Saturdays show which I dragged my husband along to. Got so many compliments and a lot of lovely people stopped to trade bracelets, was so lovely! 

Actually don’t think my family fussed over my pregnancy as much as those swifties 😂🩷
I did this in Munich!
We love a supportive parent!!!
Wow. People are so creative 😂
damn, that’s SO GOOD
Hahaha brilliant
Damn
I wore a “I don't know about you, but I’m feeling 52” shirt at Amsterdam N1.

I saw at least three mother/daughter pairs wearing these last night! Super cute
I saw this at my hotel before wembley yesterday! I wonder if it was the same people🥰
It’s criminal that song isn’t on the set list. Biggest regret is not seeing that live, with the fountain and everything.
I think I saw them (in June)
That is very sweet. Also, love that they went hard on a theme but kept it comfy too. Goals!
“I hope that’s how it’s spelled” made me actually lmao
This is amazing
I saw a couple with these shirts on!! Which show did you see this? Maybe we were both there!
I saw similar one, “swiftie by marriage” 😂 I wish my bf would come with me, the ideas here are gold 🥲
YESS! I was behind him in the merch line and audibly laughed!!

It was me! lol Just got home and recently just washed it....My son had the same thing but it said on the bottom "my sister's choice."
LMAOOO that is hilarious 
Made me laugh out loud. Amazing
A couple at my show (Stockholm N1) did this too! They'd basically bedazzled some cheap sunglasses and glued on letter beads along the top, with hers having "Karma is my boyfriend" and his "I'm Karma". Adorable!
Love that!
They were sat in front of me!
I got my boyfriend a Karma (I‘m the boyfriend) shirt he wore at our show 😅
Damnnnn love this !!!!
Ugh I bet they looked beautiful ❤️
It took me so long to understand that it wasn’t a tv monitor on a weird desk or possibly a strange brass instrument but HALF OF THE MANDOLORIAN HEAD.
One of my friends did a similar thing - his name is Taylor, and his shirt said "Who's Taylor (his last name here) anyway? Ew".
Yes! I was there! For a moment I couldn't see the "T" as she spun around and was tryna figure out what they were, but when they turned back to face my direction I gasped. Amazing outfit haha
I think I was sat right behind you!!!
I must have been sitting just a few rows behind you!! London N5 club! Their outfits were amazing 🤣
maybe the image posted by u/thinkingindigital ?
This is so resplendently dork and well-read! I LOVE IT!!!

This is funny! Did he pass the bracelet?
As someone who is 6ft 7in, I wholeheartedly endorse this
“No I’m not but you should see your faces…but really I ammmm!!”
I read that in the TikTok “everybody so creative” voice that comes on with every god awful recipe video
my wife would buy that, hahaha
I’m also a big fan of the “add your own names” smallest man who ever lived white dresses. 

The one guy who dressed up as Bombalurina so well that Taylor spotted him, pointed at him and did a rawr with her hand.
Oh cool! Didn’t know they existed! Kinda want a milf one now haha
I would never wear it out in public, but it cracked me up when I saw it! And I do love folklore 😆 might have to get one as a pajama shirt.
Haha same!!
Haha! Enjoy the show!

I was about to comment that but I saw yours. I saw a couple like that in Warsaw on N2. Shoutout to them
Not at the Eras Tour, but I went to a book event with Ali Hazelwood, Julie Soto, and Lindsey Kelk, and Lindsey wore a double sided shirt that said 'Who's Ali Hazelwood Anyway? Ew' on the front, and 'Who's Julie Soto Anyway? Ew?' on the back, and she had a 22 hat that she gave away to the first person who asked a question. It was brilliant.
Woooo Wembley n5!
I too spent a while trying to decypher the outfits but they pulled them off so well 🫶🏼
Oh wow really? That’s funny 😂 

Wembley n5 forever 🫶🏼 (even though I think Taylor referred to us as n2 at the end of the champagne problems applause when she said we won)
Everyone’s outfits were great I agree! N5 club, we won 🫶🏼
Yep that one! Different person, but I'm sure it was quite a hit!
Thank you :) 🫶🏻
Not uncle travvy, but someone’s dad for sure 😜
Didn't it just make your little heart chuckle? Lol. He was so proud of himself.
yes! if you had a code you could buy on Ticketmaster cause they were still releasing some. there was also resale as well and people selling theirs at face value!
I think it is! I don’t remember but the time kind of matches :) so cute
Night 3 (sorry for the late response)
We’ve not had our show yet! I’m hoping by the end of the night it’ll be with the tallest person in our section of the stand at least!
My boyfriend's brother is 7'10".

Edit: Oh I'm sorry, my boyfriend said he's not sure but he's over 7'. I'm inclined to believe 7'10" cause my boyfriend is 6'1 and he looks tiny compared to his brother lol

Their dad is over 7" as well.
I'm glad you got the reference!
*You don’t gotta do this, but if you do…  I’m not judging you, but the 30,000 other people there, I can’t speak for them, but if you feel good, then you look good. Get on with your bad self. Who cares if you look like table during a 1st grader’s art class, you’ll never see those 30,000 people again*
It ain’t goin down easy if it ain’t cheesy
I’d buy that for my wife 😂, she would SO wear it!
Yeah seeing his shirt wasn’t helping me hold back from looking at more TS merch shirts 😂
Good bot
Good bot
Thank you bot
Good bot!
I think she was genuinely surprised by how loud our stomping was 😅
I don't have a code but where's the resale at? I did a quick search when I realized I was going to be there on the day but the prices were not face value at all lol
Please, update us, and have fun at the concert!
7'10" is crazy if accurate. That's taller than the tallest NBA player of all time.
That lady is a treasure. “This looks like something you wouldn’t do but were doing it…”
I knowwww… was window shopping the whole concert 🙈🙈
check twitter accounts that vet resales! also check resale thread on this subreddit. hard to come by, but you can get lucky! I subscribed to notifications for the @erastourresell on twitter

there are a lot of scammers out there so make sure you request to pay using PayPal G&S. if they don’t accept, it’s a scam.
Yeah I know He's literally like insanely tall idk if it's 7'10" (obviously nether does my partner lol, and it's his brother!!) but if not, like 7'5" lol that's my guess he's literally a giant it's crazy!!!
Thank you!
BBC media graphic subtitle for Ronaldo Penalty miss vs Slovenia
This is unbelievable from a sportcasters point of view. So many players miss penalties and I've never seen anything like this. 
Add to the fact that he didn't even "miss" the penalty and they should be crediting Oblak for an incredible save instead.
Have had to lock this thread as it's degenerated into xenophobia and personal attacks to the OP.
You've never seen UK broadcasters make a bad pun? I can only assume you haven't seen much UK broadcasting.
The BBC analysis always has dumb puns as a title, this is a complete non story I can't believe people are getting mad about it
Lol they do this all the time
Op can take jokes just as well as cr can take free kicks
How will Ronaldo ever recover from being lightly mocked in a incidental caption on the BBC? 

Thank goodness he has people like OP to white knight for him. I'm sure the thank you letter is in the post as we speak.
I genuinely thought this was soccercirclejerk with your description. Get a fucking grip
Hilarious that some people seem genuinely upset by this. Absolute melts.
He didn't even MISS the penalty, lads!!!!! Stop having a laugh at my poor beautiful millionaire!
Weird thing to get worked up about mate.
OP crying more than Ronaldo after he missed the pen
The amount of both teenagers and grown men who I’ve seen getting their cocks twisted over a little pun is actually hilarious
Not as bad as Sky's 'Shawhand Redemption's after Luke Shaw's handball against Brighton.
Imagine being this soft.
r/soccercirclejerk leaking
They was enormously sycophantic and complimentary towards Ronaldo, despite his terrible performance, and you still complain.
Classic English banter, also this wasn't used during the game but in their analysis.
Op is in shambles lmfao
Inject this whining straight into my veins. Jesus Christ have a laugh for once in your life
> I’ve never seen anything like this

You’ve never seen a silly pun on Match of the Day?

Do you ever watch the BBC’s coverage of football? Have you ever watched Gary Lineker make daft jokes before? Or are you someone who doesn’t actually watch the BBC but gets very angry about them making a joke because you don’t realise it’s what they always do and think that they’re singling your special little boy out?
Can someone bring me some pearls?!

I need to clutch my pearls and faint
Fucking hell mate, get a hobby
I hope OP is ok? 

I’m not sure how he’ll recover from this

Truly devastating
An all timer of a head loss by OP here, it should be studied. Brilliant.
No one as fragile as a Ronaldo fanboy 😂😂😂
The forced outrage on this sub towards anything the English do is incredible.
This is normal for BBC analysis. They love their puns. MOTD2 even used to have a section called "2 good 2 bad" where they would take the piss out of players, managers and even random people in the crowd. 

I mean every single BBC football match ends with the host looking at the camera signing off with some stupid pun. It's normal, no one is picking on Ronaldo, they do this to everyone.
Is this your first time experiencing British media?
That’s pretty funny. Ronaldo fanboys are so sensitive. What happened to supporting teams rather than players?
Jesus Christ some of our international fans are so insufferable
This is fucking bloody british humor and it gave me a chuckle.

For this a few more fat noisy Brits will fail at EU immigration into Portugal for vacation and the matter is settled.
Ronaldo fanboys literally have the thinnest skin on the planet.
Top banter tbh. And pretty common on motd. Non issue unless you are part of the cult I guess.
Talk about an overreaction OP.
Is this real?
There are tweets with thousands of likes calling for a BBC boycott haha
Loving all these strangers getting their feelings hurt on his behalf
Ronaldo fanboys are such fragile little snowflakes.
It’s not even that bad besides it being normal for bbc to do. So many cry babies in this thread. Just like Ronaldo when he missed his pen
I thought it was funny
didn’t realise bbc hired messi fans from football twitter lol
Worth my license fee.
BBC  Banter Broadcasting Corporation
Might actually pay my TV license now
[deleted]
>Add to the fact that he didn't even "miss" the penalty 

Eh i'd say "missing" to describe not scoring a penalty is pretty common, even if it's on target. If it was like a young English player I'd agree with you, but I don't know why our media would refuse to take the piss out of Ronaldo
Missthony Pentano here, the internet's busiest music nerd
Come on people, lighten up. It’s just a joke.
Was hilarious.

There were about ten minutes in that match that even the best writers couldnt have done better with
If it was Messi on the other side of this joke the people getting offended right now would be creaming. Lighten up, it’s just a shitty pun lol
It’s literally just a pun. Why are people upset over it? He’s a fully grown man who just didn’t play well 🤷‍♂️
Wait, this ain't /r soccercirclejerk
Hilarious
How many more crocodile tears will be shed over a billionaire in his LATE 30s not getting things his way. 

Stop moaning! These CR7 riders are worse than swifties atm ...
Unbelievable, they should have just gone with 'Rapist' instead.
This is hilarious 😂 One of very few good things the bbc has done lately
Butthurt Ronaldo stan
I can't believe people are actually upset about this. Develop a sense of humour ffs.
The worst one of these was when they did a Halloween based XI of puns. Martin Skaretel & Robin Vampiresie were more offensive than this because it was not funny.
outjerked by the BBC?
Savage
That’s pretty fuckin funny actually
Tbf that's a good one.

If Messi pissed himself, can guarantee it'd read "Pee-onel Messy"

You read too much into this. Every back page (and including MotD here too) will look to slap a pun where they can against who they can.
Silly joke but this whole thread and OP's meltdown are a classic for the ages
I can't believe Jude Bellingham did this! Not very mature at all!
Awww booohoooo it hurt my widdle feelingssss
The smol beanification of ‘CR7’, lmfao
Some young memelord is working for them, welcome to the new age!
That’s hilarious. How did I miss that last night
It's super funny
Pretty fucking funny
It's just light banter ffs. This outrage culture has gone too far.
yeah, I was watching a pirate stream and saw this too. Laughed out pretty hard.
Nice one! 😄
I thought they gave Ronaldo an easy ride personally. He tried to make it all about him the entire evening, missing like 4 free kicks and a penalty and got bailed out by his goalkeeper, then they were all gushing over the penalty he scored in the shootout
I think this one is really funny. Anybody expecting completely serious coverage from the BBC is looking in the wrong place. On their website, they've always straddled the line between serious journalism and tabloid. They've been very much on the wrong side of it sometimes, but I don't think this is an example of it. A better example of it is when they had a headline after Robert Enke's death that didn't refer to him by name, but by 'suicide keeper'. I still can't believe that one.
😂
This is funny
What nonsense some media say just to get attention, it's not funny
Loved it. Hopefully he misses more penalties.
OP this thread hasn’t went the way you thought it would has it lol
*no lies detected*
I love Ronaldo and I find this hilarious.
ok bruh but this has been posted like 10 times today already
Great stuff

That's disgusting, laughing about a rapist and a dude that doesn't want to retire, and if he is not in the fist XI he is giving you a tantrum, is pretty disgusting.
Thanks for that and Ronaldo brownnosers like you make this even funnier. Not sure how anyone can still support this guy. It's like supporting Drake.
Very unprofessional for a state broadcaster, amateurish even and I'm far from a Ronaldo apologist.
Bants of the Day.
That's funny. Portugal is through and Ronaldo stepped up first to take Portugal into the lead which is always huge in a penalty shootout. No one cares about that earlier miss anymore. Chill out.
Ronaldo haters in full force, you guys are bitter

Saka misses pen:

Death threats, racist scandal.

Ronaldo misses pen:

Its funny bro.
Honestly BBCs commentators pissed me off so much last night dick riding Slovenias game plan whereas if it was any other team they would accuse them of playing boring defensive football. But because it was versus Portugal, they could do no wrong. I get they're a lower ranked team but playing for a draw to go to pens because you have one of the world's best goal keepers is fucking pussy behaviour and should be called out accordingly. They couldn't even counter effectively because they left all their players firmly on the bus the entire 120 mins. Football terrorist behavior
bunch of wankers in comments sayin this is jUsT bAnTeR. if it were Messi or any other player of such high caliber, those same wankers would be rioting and sayin its peak disrespect. most ridiculous subreddit ever lmao.
BBC are cringe, nothing new
People are weird. I know that people are saying it's top banter but it's utterly unprofessional for a worldwide organisation to do this.
Ronaldo didn't miss. The Keeper saved it.
Cheeky or not, it's still a ridiculous thing to post. He didn't even MISS the penalty, it was saved!
Proper disrespectful
Every time Lineker says the closing line on BBC Sport he ends the programme with a bad pun.
[removed]
Yeah, I'm assuming OP is Portuguese so they're pirating a stream then complaining about a minor joke. Bet they couldn't handle Lineker's puns on a weekly basis.
I would say it's more clunky than bad but yeah they do this all the time.

Also the fella doesn't get how the word miss is used in the context of a pen.
Also, imagine pulling these kindergarten puns when your team is playing like dogshit the entire tournament.
I heard Jim Beglin call the Etihad the Emptihad instead and he came out and apologized after.

Also you didn't see these puns when their great star boy fluffed his penalty. It's tacky and unprofessional.
They do this cheeky humor too in Eurovision, so I am not surprised.
>I can't believe people are getting mad about it

Welcome to the internet my friend
They can make fun of anyone except for Ronaldo cause that wakes up his groupies
It’s because it’s against their beautiful king this time
Now I've not actually seen anyone getting mad about it, but it does not surprise me at all that a Ronaldo fanboy would do so.

Edit: I've now just seen that literally OP did. What a wet wipe.
Mate I LOVE that people are getting mad about it. It's so pathetic. It's just a stupid BBC pun, as you say they do it all the time. Can't believe people bootlick football players this much.
Not just BBC that do it either. I remember BT sport having Craig Dawsons goal against Lyon in the Europa league as "Ballon D'Awson ## min". 
Maybe in poor taste here when it's more mocking though.
You shouldn't be surprised when you consider the fan base your dealing with.
But OP has never seen anything like it, and surely they are smart and observant.
[removed]
Because viewers abroad never see the dumb puns and don't know that specific context. At least scrolling through the comments clears it up.
[deleted]
I definitely find it funny, but I also find it a bit weird. Also, was this during the live broadcast or like a recap later?
There's a difference between an analysis and a live telecast. Pundits do all sorts of goofy shit in an analysis and banter is expected.
This is literally in the middle of the game. 

I have a lot of people saying "oh it's just the BBC" but yet someone to link me to when they last did something like this in a live game.
No no no, CR7 is a very special victim
Can you provide an example?
You kicked the hornet's nest...

But if you were Cristiano you would have missed LMAO
I watered down my cold brew with Ronaldo tears this morning 👍🏽
[deleted]
I'm all for the bantz but c'mon, the media shitting on Ronaldo is getting boring. Didn't see any graphics pop up when Kane missed against France or Saka missed his pen or even Messi against Chile.

This is schoolboy "jokes" they should keep it for the cesspool that's Twitter.
do you think it is funny to laugh about a guy who did not goal 50 free kicks from the 51 he had at the NT? Your envy is talking big time brother.
Over 60 replies by OP to people in this thread and nearly every single one of them mass downvoted for nonsense, wow, even for reddit standards that's genuinely impressive!
Why are they white knight Cristiano but no one defending john Terry? Crying shame that is
You say that but Ronaldo doesn't seem like the most stable chap, this is how Ronaldo's version of John Wick starts.
Compared to the racist attacks the English media did to Raheem Sterling and others, this is absolutely nothing
if OP had posted this on scj and was being entirely ironic it would be an all-timer, this is far funnier than anything that's been posted there for months
The only ones genuinely crying over this are Ronaldo fans.
[removed]
He's probably got the big B on that illionaire at this point.
Don’t forget rapist! How can the BBC be so mean to him
Waiting for some friends at the beach, have a bit of time on my hands that's all haha
Last time I cried was watching Dunkirk and all those boats came to take the boys home. Terrific movie.
It's all that CeraVe, gamechanger for your face trust me.
yeah I listened to the Guardian football podcast this morning and they were scathing about how fawning the BBC coverage was
They captioned the penalty miss that knocked us out of the World Cup "Harry Pain", we do it to ourselves as well.
Laughing at the responses on this thread right now lmao
Waiting at the beach for my friends and the fuckers brought the footba but forgot to bring the cones for the goals, so have some time to kill
Only copious amounts of cerveja will save me from this terrible situation unfortunately 😞
Could be worse, I could have been as fragile as a Phil Jones fanboy.
Well they call dinner tea, what do you expect? Fish and chips are certified banger meal though.
They seem to be commenting on any BBC sport posts on social media now. Seen a few comments under unrelated tiktoks and insta posts. Crazy fans (of anyone not just Ronaldo) really are on another level.
Yeah top banter if you are a 5 year old.
Arsenal's ucl are funnier😂😂😂
at what point is keeping pepe and ronaldo for 120 mins elder abuse
If Belgium were through we'd have both doing 120, imagine that😭
They did. Messi was trolled for his missing penalty against Chile and also for crying. Now the same people are angry on trolling Ronaldo for doing the same. Such hypocrisy.
Penaleo Missi. xD
CR7 riders still exist after what happened in Qatar?
How many more crocodile tears will be shed over a state owned mega corporation that's one of the biggest broadcasters and journalistic organisations in the world not getting things in their way because of a reddit post.

Stop moaning! These BBC riders are worse than swifties atm ...

Also "bbc riders" see what I did there? Hehe
Ronaldo fans are the ones that can’t take a joke
It’s football, relax
The commentators spent the entire match fanboying Ronaldo, even when he was wasting every free kick Portugal got. And if you can't see the difference between a team like Slovenia and a team like England playing defensive football then there's no hope for you.
Do you honestly think that the BBC wouldn't have the caption with Lionel Miss-i if he missed a high profile penalty?
the weird people here are the ones acting persecuted bc of some minor banter
They do it all the time in their post-match/half time analysis. It’s an extremely minor bit of fun and has never been an issue until yesterday.
Did he score his penalty?

The game was on TV for everyone to see lol no need to pirate anything
You constantly hear and see these puns lol. Are you English?
Lol we don't meme our own players but we're very critical of them, just before the tournament saka was the face of a loss despite not starting
Aww, the BBC hurt golden boy and his army of stans' feelings. I feel so bad now :(
Jim Beglin doesn't work for British TV and he accidently called it the Emptyhad, it was a slip of the tongue...not an actual attempted pun hence the apology.
Listening to Graham Norton slag off every countries presenters is what Eurovision is all about.
Been watching a lot of Dragon’s Den recently and sometimes I think they only let some of the entrepreneurs on the show because they have a bunch of puns they want to use lol.
its ridiculous lol, its fucken football, it core purpose is to entertain us, spreading a bit of satire should be very welcome. 

The idea of someone in the world having their feeling hurt because they don't want some millionnaire athlete to feel a little bit bad at night is soo fucken funny they deserve their own pun lol
I know, right, makes me so mad!
You have people calling for not shitting on players but also the beebs making cringe Twitter level graphics on players. 

It's not fun for anyone on a professional broadcast.

I think Lukaku is absolutely terrible, but I'd be complaining here if they called him Lukaka on live telly as well.
[removed]
This wasn’t during the live match, this was during the half time ET analysis section,
Have you never watched Match of the Day in your 35 years of watching BBC? They do them all the time.
the latter
It wasn’t in the middle of the game, this was during the analysis at HT in extra time.
You don't understand, this analysis section always has a pun or jokey title, that's every game on the BBC, half-time, full-time
You need to lighten up
It's British. That's how they roll. Nothing is sacred to them. Just chill out.
I really hope you're not a fully grown adult, dickriding Ronaldo like this.
Gary Lineker also signed off with the worst Oblak/black and white pun ever, this is what the beeb does
Thought I'd actually go and source an example for you been as you leep moaning, so [here you go](https://youtube.com/shorts/41iWg91yFv0?si=zoRRFzMqWe1JUUbm)
Google Ronaldo Las Vegas for more information.
Yes.  One *can* be a rapist and a victim.  They're not mutually exclusive.
They literally captioned Harry Kane’s missed penalty against France ‘Harry Pain’, and that was one of our own players, and we had been knocked out.
There's always a 'Toffees come unstuck'-type one when Everton lose. There should be plenty of evidence of that.

It's something they do all the time across BBC. They did start to do it before ad breaks on Sky for a while as well. I think it was sponsored by a betting company.

None come to mind but pretty much all the highlight video packages on MOTD have a pun of some variety.
https://www.reddit.com/r/EnterShikari/s/4mnsmlEtCn

Enter Shikari are a British rock band if you need the context
If you watch MOTD, Lineker almost always signs off with a pun based on a players name or a silly joke about a team based on that day's play. Here's one I found on youtube:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls3A1EnAzDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls3A1EnAzDs)

He signs off like this almost every time.
I personally took my morning workout up a notch by swimming in a siuuuuu of his tears!
They’ve been doing silly little jokes like this on every post match or MOTD for years
Why lol, it's entertainment not a political broadcast and missing a penalty isn't a protected characteristic.
Still funny tho
"I'm all for the bantz" *clearly is not for the bantz at all*

The Harry Kane miss got "Harry Pain" not very clever but you gotta got for it.
“All for the bantz” and then proceeds to hate a bit of banter.
kane and saka are two of the most criticized players in the world what are you talking about
Kane gets memed for not winning anything all the time, and saka gets memed for his limp, messi got memed too but tbf he gets the most protection, and all of a sudden r/soccer has decided that they wanna dickride cr7 too lol
>or even Messi against Chile.

The beeb has Copa America rights?
Saka against Italy, Kane against France, Mbappe 3 years ago against Switzerland, all got made fun of.
Slovenian coach for bringing Ilicic just for the pens got made fun of.
Lol Messi used to get crucified for 5 years for that miss until they won the Copa.
The media shitting on Ronaldo will never get boring
You being an American larping as Portuguese and defending CR7 like this is so incredibly cringe 😬
Why are you talking like this as an Indian? Bantz? Beeb? Like relax and just be happy about diogo Costa.
Saka had it worse. The racists were on his throat. And how you compare that kinda of abuse to UK media banter is beyond nonsense. Messi spent almost 2 years being being trolled by media and social media.
Lol yes how is it not funny, especially when he clearly leverages his status to keep on taking them 😂
Yes, it's extremely funny. And just gets funnier with every free kick the commentators give the big build up that he ends up smashing into row z or into the wall.
I read the caption and then saw serious comments and checked the sub title again. What an incredibly lame thing to post. The worlds tamest pun shown on a football show is too much for this CR7 fan!
and ronaldo himself
Now imagine the pain of cricket fans on Reddit

They're going harder than ever now, you can watch a Portugal game without having six players be blamed for a Cristiano fuck up. Nobody should be above criticism in this sport .
"HeHe" yah my friend ain't nobody give a fuck about the BBC outside England.

However, every week this dumb fan base finds a new target to cry about and piss on.

Rooney, Neville, Fifa , Bbc, the Saudi league, Cancelo, Bruno... Silva.. Who else is running everything for the great idol this week? Also, BBC is definitely getting things their way since you're talking about them. BBC not going to get bullied by the internet like that little Moroccan girl from the 22WC tho.

Shameless behavior.
I literally said I get it's a lower ranked team like Slovenia? They were fanboying Slovenias snooze fest of a game plan just as much as they were talking about Ronaldo, if not more. Now imagine it was a team like Scotland instead of Slovenia. You really think they'd have the same sentiment? Similarly, if Slovakia played like that versus England you really think the commentator would be just as complimentary to the team?

This is tabloid rag behaviour, not what I expect from the BBC.
Lineker literally called them shit on his podcast recently
*picture of the Eiffel tower*

“Oh I wonder where she is?”
And for decades before Terry Wogan did the same
And then there’s Touker who just needs people to use his office space.

A pun isnt exactly satire.
What is it satirizing?
Come on mate, we're from the UK. It's Pookaku.

It's a silly joke. What are you complaining about?

Daniel Agger scored the only goal of a game and they went with the simple but obvious “Agger Do”.
Distinctly remember one being “Reality Cech” after he made a mistake once.
I’m a Liverpool fan so this game gave me nightmares, but when Alisson made those mistakes against Man City they had the caption “Alisson Blunderland” which got me
More than that; it’s British culture to bring inflated individuals back down to Earth. It’s just part of our national psyche
Classic. "Oh they do this all the time, I just can't think of a single example"

EDIT: A lot of downvotes and a lot of responses saying it happens a lot. Only a single example mentioned and it's something positive about a Crystal Palace player.

Cool. Did the BBC meme them on the live cast of the game?
Yes now show me the broadcasters that made fun of them on live TV when the match was going on.
I'm not Indian. That should be your first clue.

TBF, it really is only in the Match threads. The actual Sub is quite well regulated, so you don't get too much idiocy.

lovely demonstration of projection
Bro is being downvoted for pretending he's chilled out after making literally 70+ comments in this thread.
Some guy called me a woke snowflake for posting this. Maybe the downvotes are because they think a snowflake should be at the beach or I'll melt.

So nice of them to care about my well-being like that.
Thanks mate, trying to make the most of the summer this year, hope you are having a good one too.
Orrr some of the replies people have been sending me are actually funny and I want to respond
Seems like you have the greater facets of trolling down pat, have a book I should borrow?
Obviously I care, he was asking about my hobbies you dolt
Got that PA++++ sunscreen drip, but thanks for looking out 😀
I will let you know if it works, and will have one for you, cheers brother.
I was joking mate cmon, love England, they gave us this sport and also Joy Division who I love.
You're talking crap, it was entirely possible that if you listened to just the commentary from that match to think it was 4 Slovenian defenders and a goalkeeper vs Ronaldo because they literally could not stop fanboying Ronaldo, they even started making moaning noises during some rather dull play when he'd do basic things on the pitch.

BBC didn’t have the coverage for England vs France so they couldn’t do it.
Do you not remember “we needed Gary lineker, we got Chris waddle”?

Edit: ITV to be fair, but still a top broadcaster rather than a tabloid rag
Lol watch any episode of match of the day and see what they label the replays when doing the analysis.
I remember reading "Harry Pain" in the screen for that replay..
It's a game mate, you'll be fine.
lol fair

The penalty is at 2:42:43

"The caption" is at 3:05:10 during the **FT** analysis, after extra time, before the penalty shootout.

Besides, if it *WAS* shown during the live game you'd still be able to see the live score and time in the top left in your pic... but it's clearly not there https://i.imgur.com/ZRneyYf.jpeg

Oh yeah, I remember that one! I was going to say that this sounds all "fellow kids" to me, but I guess it ain't that bad after all then.
I'll be honest, if i was the person that came up with that i'd immediately take the rest of the day off.
Pretty sure there’s been at least one “too eze” for palace, can’t remember basically any because they’re normally shit and innocuous, this is just getting heat bc it’s ronaldo
Okay, i'm sick of people like you so i've fuck all to do at work and went and found some examples for you precious snowflakes.

This took me 5 minutes. I'm not going getting any more, but you can kindly piss off now.
Because it’s so common if you watched literally any analysis ever on BBC/MOTD you’d see a terrible pun at one point in the analysis - none of us are arsed to go hunting through clips of match of the day because we are exposed to it every week watching BBC coverage
Can't think of an example because they're on screen for like 3 seconds multiple times a show and are completely forgettable.

The only reason this is being mentioned is it upset the poor Portugese people's widdle feelings because they poked fun at their poor king.
They do do it all the time we just aren’t obliged to go hunt for footage on a whim you melt.
Because it's so frequent no one pays attention to it mate, no one's been taking notes, it's a split second joke. 

It's mental that people don't understand the concept of a running joke. Use a VPN or something and go watch MoTD on iPlayer, it's there for you to see.
It's like asking why is the sky blue, IS IT REALLY BLUE? 

Yeah it obviously is, we all grew up watching titles like this on MOTD it's normal for us but strange for non-english fans.

It's obviously all a conspiracy!
It genuinely happens for every clip shown on match of the day usually.

All of yous crying on over absolutely nothing.
[deleted]
They do it so often that none spring to mind because it’s so normal and not a big deal.

You’re just upset and don’t understand it’s normal
Yeah the fact you had to use so many words to even vaguely describe their sound means you're definitely thinking of the right band haha.
you are correct but not weird and absolutely fun
Handanovic saving that Penalty was a microagression.
You haven't watched the coverage, thats pretty clear. Pundits have been tearing the England team apart on both ITV and BBC. Quite rightly.
Because it’s not as funny to us when they miss
The BBC pundits all shat all over Kane at HT and FT on the Slovenia game.

I don’t know why you keep repeating that this was when the match was playing, because it wasn’t. You can just repeat it until your bullshit becomes reality.

what makes me laugh is i didnt even mention Ronaldo in my initial critisism of the commentators, its totally and reasonably fair for me to criticize the commentators for creaming their pants over Slovenias shitty, boring anti football game plan. Yet all you can say is "yEaH BuT wHaT AbOuT rOnAldO"... you're deluded by ronaldo hate. bet your face turned a bright shade of gammon when you saw him do a shit juggle of the ball with his back turned to the goal.

I've watched a lot of broadcasts of Sky, Chanel+, and about 10 other stations and I've never seen this stuff in a live broadcast of any game ever.

I've never seen BBC do it live for any podcast either. If you have an example, let me know. It will just further my opinion that it's a shitshow.
I mean, its still there. Just north of Manchester
They'll be back in the Premier league in no time mate just hang on
Not towards the end, which is why he stepped down, in fairness to him.
Satire is using parody (often through irony or exaggeration) to expose or criticise a real thing. It's basically criticism through comedy, usually regarding politics, social issues or current events.
https://i.imgur.com/ZRneyYf.jpeg this was during live...ive captured it myself
... where is everyone?
Thank you, finally someone who actually answered.

Damn wide open
They’re both pretty funny, the Agger one is just a bit lazy but had clearly been bottled up the day he joined whilst they waited for a chance to use it.
There was a UK novelty song in the 1980s called “Agadoo” (pronounced “Agger Do”).

It’s dreadful because the lyrics are pure nonsense, but it’s simultaneously fun because it’s so ridiculous. Everyone in the UK knows it because it’s played at every disco and party ever.
Yeah, if this was about Ruben Neves for example people would take it as a joke, but Ronaldo? Don't you dare!

They also sponsor their home town football club, st albans city.

Oh wow, it's almost as if we are on a soccer subreddit talking about something that's soccer related.

So you go to the referee's union office when there's a bad call or come here to talk about with others who watched the game?
It was in the live telecast of the game when the game was paused. I asked the commentor above for similar graphics about the examples that he mentioned.

There aren't.
Wow its almost like people can have parents from multiple nationalities and family across different nations.
It's almost as if people can over time become citizens of other nations.

Ironic, you are complaining about me complaining about BBCs shit joke, while complaining about my shit jokes.
You should look up what tongue in cheek means
Are you dense, like seriously? Did they remove your brain before posting.

You said they where constantly bigging up Slovenia, that's just completely untrue - it was an almost complete fanboy-fest of Ronaldo, how is that irrelevant to your point, you're talking about what the commentators where saying I and I am correcting you, how is Ronaldo irrelevant in a debate about the commentators constantly fucking talking about him? Which is actually what happened, not the shit you're talking about.

Jesus Christ, it's amazing you're going to respond so arrogantly and fail to even display an ounce of sense you absolute melt.
[removed]
You can't have been paying attention then. They label every highlight they show during the break and they give some of them funny names. I have no idea why you think football should be a serious comedy free zone.
What a load of bollocks, you're so enthusiastically wrong
Just don't expect it to be as Athletic as advertised
Ew.
Hah, didn't catch that auto correct.
Why are you ignoring the video [showing the Slovenian players in the huddle just before they do the replay](https://x.com/_24kings/status/1807898989511004623?s=46&t=pNnvw7ZGvsUKY5y1lOCPug)
That's obviously not live because it doesn't have the score/time in the top left. It's a replay from the half time analysis.
This is just blatantly false. First of all, the live view was from behind the penalty spot (as it is for most penalties in the Euro's) and this is clearly missing the scoreboard.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/sLJnjDB.jpg) is a screenshot of the actual LIVE view of Ronaldo taking the penalty.

And [here](https://streamable.com/o04s5l) is a clip of the title appearing during the post extra-time analysis of the penalty. You can see it is CLEARLY after extra-time as the players are in the huddles before the penalty shoot-out.
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POv-3yIPSWc)
Here’s an example from 2008 (the first episode when you search full match of the day episode) of BBC describing Carlton Cole as “in the hole” a clear play on his second name and double entendre. This is normal they make clever remarks or puns like this on analysis titles all the time, it’s been happening for the best part of 15 years on MOTD, but the problem is, you’ll then ask me to go find 10 more!, why should I, anyone who watches MOTD knows this to be normal.

very cool
The kits are absolute beauts too
No but there is no place to call to complain about the refs. Unlike the bbc.

Its also lesser game related. Its not something in the game but a pun a broadcaster did. Dunno what ur trying to achieve with this post
Mate no one can be bothered to find one because most people aren’t this insecure about someone making a light joke about their favourite player and tend to forget about them straight away
But you made two directly contradictory statements. How are we meant to trust your opinions on the BBCs highlight caption pun when we can't even trust you on your own nationality?
Your joke was shit
My guy it’s been two hours enjoy the beach instead. You are so deep down the rabbithole of cringe and in defensemode you’re never gonna snap out of it. Put your phone down, take sunk cost. Worry about being able to take a joke later. Just get off reddit
That’s incredibly funny after dozens of comments complaining about a tongue in cheek caption!
you're blinded by Ronaldo hate, take the horse blinkers off and go rewatch the commentary on iplayer. The commentators were applauding Slovenia for reaching pens as if they had won the match...
"this is a real 50/50 duel" i heard a one point when Portugal had 70% possession and Slovenia hadn't been outside of their half of the pitch in 15 mins.

I wonder if you would of had the same sentiment if Slovakia played the same way versus England.
I'm stealing "enthusiastically wrong" for my next project meeting haha love it.

And yes wrong about when it happened but still right about the level of cringe.
Gonna need u/redditRaven33 to acknowledge this in some form!
Then maybe this post is not for you :)
Its simple, you don't, just like people don't have to be racist and make stereotypes about Indians in this post.
I don't even care about Ronaldo, why would I hate him? You're fanboying so hard you're making a point that is irrelevant to me.

I didn't say they was wrong or right to fanboy Ronaldo, I'm saying that how you described the scenario is completely different to reality, they absolutely focused on Ronaldo above everything else on that pitch, he was having a relatively average game if not worse than usual and yet almost all mentions of Portugal mentioned him, not the other 10 players on his team.

You're so blinded by the fanboying that you are rewriting history.

>I wonder if you would of had the same sentiment if Slovakia played the same way versus England.

Considering I expected Slovenia to get battered, I think it's pretty fair to point out how good their defence is considering they took it all the way to penalties and had a pretty nice chance to win the game towards the end if it wasn't for some great goalkeeping.

But hey, don't let the fanboying and bias get in the way of a good fictional story.
Okay bro i acknowledge it..maybe i was a bit drunk...so i didnt really remember...

Also people trying too hard too prove whats right or wrong over a trivial topic..its funny...
Maybe football's not for you if you're going to get all pathetic and whiney over a joke which is in reality very funny. 

Or are you just one of those people that thinks Ronaldo is a god so can't be targeted for japes?

You're like Maga to Trump
You're like Russians to Putin
You're like North Koreans to Kim Jong Un
You're like Scientologists to L. Ron Hubbard

The only problem here is your devotion to your cult.
I'm one of the people who thinks NO PLAYER should be targeted for japes on a live broadcast by a national broadcaster.

That includes Messi, Vini, or any other player that is controversial or has a large following.
Drake's Defeat: The white flag is out
The Heart Part 6 is him bowing out while saving face for him and for his people. 

Drake fans, it is time to admit what we have all been saying since meet the grahams. Your boy lost.

Dont wanna hear anymore goat talk about Drake. Hip hop history has been solidified. 

Man this was a wild ride. Glad we all could enjoy it. Hip hop wins in the end. Cheers.
I didn't need a response to know he lost two nights ago. 


What's crazy is this dude came out and said he's just too famous to get caught diddling kids. Like...who the FUCK says that?
If they really plotted, why would you not give shit like a fake name, location, bm name, etc. Just doesnt make sense
"The ones you getting your stories from, they're all clowns"

5 lines later...

"We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information" 

Bro 😑
He sounded like he was giving a trial defense
That monologue at the end was something else.
Kendrick isn't going to allow him to bow out on this note though, let's be honest lol.

If there's one thing we've learnt in this beef... Kendrick with some hated is a straight up devil.

There will be a response from Kendrick, and no further response from Drake, and the response from Kendrick will possibly be the most devestating we've had yet... As each of his drops have been.
I don't think it's over because I really doubt kendrick thinks it's over. But drake fans ain't gonna just stop supporting him anyway 💀
Kendrick got Drake cornered and this was his response, Drake took the L
In The Heart Part 6 he mentions the latest diss that came out yesterday, so he recorded the diss track today... but he planned ahead for weeks but he just did the diss track today? It doesn't add up, why wouldn't he have the diss track ready the second Kendrick dropped Meet The Grahams, it kinda sounds like he just saw conspiracy theorists online saying that he planted the information and he just took that narrative
r/Drizzy in their denial phase now 😂
Why is drake the first person to bring up Millie Bobby Brown? And who out here comparing stats? It sounds like drake tried to do the ol’ “I know what you’re going to say so I’ll counter it before you even say it” but looked more like Wimp Lo than anything.
Drake planting a paper trail for his future pedophilia trial
Drake really reaching at this insane idea they fed him that information. If he did that, craziest 5D chess of all time. But come on dawg everyone know that shit ain't true
As someone past 40, I must ask: is Drake REALLY in the GOAT discussion? Seriously, I want to know.
If anything, I cannot believe I’m going to say this, dropping a, “everything you say is fake” song then dipping may have been a good career move. It was inevitable that Drake would lose this. KDot is at the point of being up there with like Andre 3K and Nas in rapping, a hit maker that merges rap, r&b, and pop isn’t competing. The best move for him was saving face, making sure his core following can at least say, “where’s the receipts”, and justifying him dipping so the general public can forget.
So gross of someone trying to beat "predator" allegations to use someone else's alleged childhood victimization and trauma as a "gotcha"
To be honest, never understood the appeal of his corny ass music anyway. Only takeaway from Drake's diss tracks has been that his understanding of Kendrick's music is as vapid as his own music is.
If Drake really gave him that info why doesn't Drake release the text chat? The phone call? Anything?! Drake ran to Reddit for conspiracy theories 🤡. My god he is done.
Kendrick literally on Not Like Us sang "he's a fan, he's a fan, he's a fan" then Drake does The Heart pt 6. Kung fu Kenny has been preemptively calling out Drake's disses before they even come out. He called out the "attacking the family front" thing on euphoria then Drake did family matters. Drake and his fans are both not understanding what's going on.

How are people who fed Kendrick info the clowns but then Drake admits to being the one who fed him the info. I highly doubt there's a double agent working somewhere so this diss actually made drake look worse.
We don’t believe you you need more receipts 🔫🔫🔫
“Im not a pedo, I’m famous” is the single worst lyric of all time
It was garbage and I wouldn’t expect anything different from the child predator
tbh it seems like most of the internet is with kendrick. there’s a lot of proof of drake doing weird shit with minors but that wife beater accusation was from a nigerian blogspot 💀
Two days ago I could not care less about Drake. Now I actively don’t like him ….
Drake pulled the parachute
not until Kendrick says so. this diss was lame, only info his stans are using for days, kept the prank mole info and even mocked Kendricks trauma
Anyone saying Drake was in the goat convo to begin with is fried
Maybe I'm crazy, but if Drake has been plotting and planning all this, why didn't this drop have the insane production values that Family Matters had?

Family Matters was dope. This one has a very different video than FM.
Kendrick should just re-record this same song, lyrics and all.  Nail in the coffin.
They gotta throw hands atp
I’m a goofy die hard kdot fan, but I thought the heart part 6 was a good response. I definitely noticed he kinda mentioned twice he was done with this like ‘I’m done dissing you’ or something then ‘I can’t fight a women beater’ does seem like he’s trying to create a clean exit for himself
Can someone please tell me why nobody is mentioning the video of Drake kissing a 17 year old or his extremely sus lyrics?

I mean KDot being with Kodak is something i wanna know more about too. However, KDot gets more grace because of his character.
The real winners are watching both sides invest so much time and emotion into a specific side.  Both of them gave us songs to bump too.  lol
Yeah he went out sad with this one 


Dude sounded exhausted defending himself
In family matters he even said he was going on Vacation, but he still responded. I dont think he is done...
![gif](giphy|j9mqKgQvkNOziGICfd|downsized)
I'll give him this I've never heard a man drop a track where he claims he tricked us into believing he's a pedo before tiredly exiting a beef before. That's some new shit.
My honest opinion: I think that revealing Kendrick’s mistake in taking a bait was actually something he must’ve done to get at least a bit of breath out of this battle 

BUT 

Drake’s life is so fucked up that people find out other rumours around about hiding unwanted kids , so that move didn’t really worked out well.

After 4 diss tracks he hasn’t barely scratched Kendrick writing level, 6.16 in LA was a lyric masterpiece. Kendrick story telling is so good that even things we already know about Drake sounded ten times harsher.

Drake last respond overall is another bimbo whim, with some good bars but no actual complexity in it, drake is a limited artist when it comes to expression and that’s why I can’t see him winning this battle.
Obama picked Kendrick, sorry drake, it's over
There are people who still defend the people who lost the civil war. Some never admit defeat
Drake is not a goat just zesty
I mean, it’s Kendrick Lamar. Drake brought a water pistol to a gun fight.
Everyone is saying that Kendrick won’t let him get the last word but I think Kendrick, at this point, knows the goose is cooked and thinks it’d be beneath himself to respond when he’s already won.
Drake really went out sad.
Drake is the goat, euphoria and MTGs were snoozefests, drake handed Kendrick his first #1, Pulitzer Prizes and Grammys don’t mean shit because they’re voted on by boards not the general public, Kendrick is a wife beating midget, cope
Not a fan of either, but enjoyed the beef so far. And even as a Canadian who knew Drake as a teenager (went to HS with him), Kendrick took this.
Wait , i thought it was good , as in the song wasn't a good diss or a catchy song (like family matters) but i thought drake said some shit that i was thinking of as well , like Kendrick completely sidestepped the wife beater and his first kid not being his . unless i missed something . 

  
Also , i felt something weird when kendrick dropped not like us , since drake already got bodied by meet the grahams . I did not understand the reasoning behind doubling going back to back , back to back.  
idk my two cents . I still think kendrick is winning thought , he hasnt won yet , unless he probably names the next track the story of '..... and do a pusha T pt2
he didn’t bow out
We just gonna ignore that he baited Kendrick?

Kendrick stans saying drake needs proof of a claim Kendrick made… that’s not how that works
I'm so confused on why this is a white flag lmao. Drake has said shit like "im too budy/big to reply" in EVERY DISS dawg 😭 actually crying at the massive fucking reach jfc even my partner who doesn't listen to rap said "HOW???" When I said you clowns are on here saying the heart is him bowing out lmao.
Kendrick hasn’t seen his child in 6 months

Kendrick beat his queen and cheated on her 

Kendrick co-signs Kodak Black and brings him in tour and on stage after the sexual assault convictions 

Kendrick put hands on a woman in a LV hotel 

I guess we were wrong about Kendrick, he really is a hit maker 😂😂😂
Ohhhhh the goalposts are moving now got it ok
You can type without seeing the screen? 
Drake gotta bring 2012 Gucci back or Big sean
I need like a TLDR. I don't listen to rap but this is all I have been seeing and I am curious what Kdot must have said to make Drake seem so finished
He cant give up its only half time
I’ve been getting so many posts from r/drizzy pushed to me today, first time I’ve ever been pushed something from that sub. Anyway. All those goofs are completely unhinged and delusional. Their adamancy is just embarrassing at this point.
Drake fans are celebrating like they won the Super Bowl lmao.
I didn’t think people could be cornier than drake fans but Kendrick fans are up there now fighting for 1st place 
Yeah. It's nice being able to see that clear line now. Commercial artists and more creative artists. Not that the commercial artists aren't creative but they'll sacrifice it more often in order to achieve commercial success I believe.
I need K-Dot to do one more to FINISH HIM!
🗣️Draaaaaaaaaaake!😂🥴
Drake said he never hooked up with a minor. 

Drake was a virgin until after 18 confirmed.

He say everything he say is facts but he just said on record he never looked at no teenager when there's literally a video of him looking,touching and kissing a teenage girl .
Drake really hadn't been able to stop taking L's since Pusha buried him years ago. He's been a changed person from it, and it shows. He lost a beef to fucking Kendrick Lamar of all people. Drake has become an embarrassment.
Yeah Kendrick got this.


Unless either have solid proof, where else can they go from here? lol. Drake seemed to put out this track to try and shut Kendrick up, when he himself can't prove anything he has alleged either.


This shit is done.
They both threw accusations, neither have proof. but Kendrick is right about one thing that Drake has been told before. Hes a white boy, surrounding himself with hoodrats so he can feel like hes from the hood.
r/Drizzy is basically twerking saying he won. Meanwhile every other sub is saying drake is cooked. It’s wild as fuck to watch 😂😂
Yea I think this was the only option available to him. At the end of the day, he’s still Drake, and we got several great tracks out of Kendrick. As a rap fan, this has been a hell of a time to be alive!
yknow it’s obvious who’s winning, when every subreddit besides r/Drizzy are siding with K-Dot 💀
They won’t admit it
So my question to all of you was what could Drake done to approach this I was watching Scru Face Jean if you know who he is and he said this was Drake only angle he had to double down on what he said and rebuttal but maybe yall see it definitely and he could have taken another route with this diss
It’s easily to tell Kendrick won…because I guarantee, Drake never mentions Kendrick ever ever again!
I don’t know, it depends who’s actually telling the truth..
Such an embarrassing track and i feel bad that it’s got that title.
Hip hop wins? Who’s writing this?!? Lmao wtf
He called himself a woman in the track, Drake knees weak from getting boxed up by Kendrick, misinterpreting mother I sober like nobody listened to the song. That ozyempic fatigue hitting him hard.
Who the hell is the OP to say who lost and who won 😂😂😂
Rapping about a plot that your opponent gave you is wild. He had Kendrick gassed like he found some shit out. Lol basically dropped some dud diss tracks
Listen, I like the back and forth disses and all that it’s fun to hear. But some of y’all taking this too serious, I’ve seen people comment.

“This is war” “Y’all aren’t ready for this” “This is gonna change the world” “Our lives are about to change” like y’all really letting two grown men arguing change your lives? That’s crazy.
Is this the official announcement? Lol fuckin egomaniac
I am a huge fan of both, but the Kendrick stans are working over time astroturfing this beef lmao 1st it’s Drake didn’t address the pedophile shit and when he does it’s just “omg I can’t believe he denied it who believes that?!” Kenny didn’t address anything just sounds bitter af. Kdot dropped 4 disses that are all mediocre songs. Drizzy definitely up
I didn't know that Drake from Nickelodeon's, "Drake and Josh" became a rapper, wow! Although, I must admit that I'm not surprised that he, "lost" (whatever that means) at being a rapper.
Who cares neither of them is gonna let you guys blow them
It’s crazy there’s real allegations that Kendrick beat his woman and no denying of it from his camp and Kendrick rapped a bunch of fake intel yet y’all say Kendrick won? Delusional…..
The rap is one thing his attempted convincing that he’s a Machiavellian mastermind. But then explaining it for a minute after makes it worse like a joke that you have to explain the punchline
He has a daughter or nah? A couple of tweets make him a pedo or nah?
In terms of album sales Kendrick waved the white flag a long long time ago.
That pen dried out years ago drizzy
what are you going on about?
lol if this was the plan they would of had Ak on live with the proof the moment meet the grahams dropped
Who gives a shit, stop worshiping celebrities.
He sounded so pathetic the whole time, like he’s really on his back foot. Just denial, denial, projection, more denial…etc

Also saying he’s “too famous to be a pedo” in this era is fucking wild. Read the room you goddamn creep.
It's funny because Drake basically implied that was his last response, which I don't blame him, if that's all he can say than he's eating a big L...

What a great weekend!
If he plotted and it was fake he would've been joking on kdot for using the info
Alot white people on here hating on Drake, lol
Why does anyone care. These rap feuds are so lame.
Had he taken a breath, he could’ve rapped to his fictitious daughter about how Kendrick taught him valuable lessons on how to treat women, how not to beat women, etc etc etc. 

But instead he went with “Got’em”.

Telling you, Kendrick isn’t done. His nail in the coffin should be called “To Catch A Predator”.
Started from the bottom now hes where?
There is no potential double agent. If they were feeding Kendrick fake info, The Heart Part 6 wouldn’t exist. He could end this beef and Kendrick’s reputation with a simple IG post with proof on Saturday. 

The fact he interpreted his opponent’s song wrong, used fan theories and basically said “I don’t diddle kids”, he lost in the eyes of his peers.
I don’t understand what the gotcha is supposed to be if Drake actually fed info tho. Like, he still fed the info and clearly got it from someone at OVO. It’s not like he made it up out of thin air, he wasn’t lying. 

Like, wow Drake so cool you told everyone you’re a deadbeat and pedo so Kendrick would make songs about you and make everyone believe you’re a predator.
If Drake planted the information he’s still a fucking idiot for getting his ass kicked anyways. Sure doesn’t look like he had the leg up on information basis cuz he’s the one looking stupid
“Don’t wanna hear any more about Drake” *makes a million comments about drake across a dozen subreddits*
Jcole still dropped the most listenable track out of this whole ordeal.
Ok Kendrick
I have a few posts on here saying that’s his best bet, cuz Kendrick is kicking ass.
Drake didn’t back out yall Trippin
I can’t believe there would ever be Drake GOAT talk. Rofl. It would be like talking about Eli Manning being the GOAT.
So Kendrick was so desperate for dirt that he spewed lies without fact checking. 

His kid's aren't even his own and Dave Free is with his woman. 

and Kendrick is a self admitted woman beater. 

This ya'll winner?
Famous dudes who diddle kids
R. Kelly and Drake apparently
Exactly! Not saying he has, but the people who get away with the longest are the rich, famous and powerful!
FRANK FROM ITS ALWAYS SUNNY!

DONT DIDDLE THE KIDS 🎶
Wanted to add to that Millie Bobby Brown bar. Drake tried to dismissed the whole accusation on heart part 6 but what is funny is that Kendrick never mentioned a name. Self snitching and didn’t even realize it 😆
Yup. Drake fans should have been embarrassed about being Drake fans before any of this anyway. Fake ass actor Canadian and people talked like he was real. 
Drake crying into his champagne as the whole club dances to him being called a pedo

"...got em with that fake daughter tho..."
Bro who sends out pictures of them with a date rape drug prescription and receipt and be like, “ha now the whole internet will accuse me of fucking underage girls, which is already a rumour that’s been around for years, Kendrick won’t be able to resist!”  That would be insane behaviour, the guy is gaslighting on wax 😂
They didn’t plot. It’s all a front. Drake says at the beginning “the ones you’re getting your info from are clowns” sometime later in the song he says “we plotted for a week and then fed you information” 

Dudes a walking L
He contradicts himself in it too by saying the people leaking info are clowns but then suddenly they plotted for a week?
or why not use a text or something as the cover art? or release the day after? or include a reference in your song? or like mock him more when it happened or anything? it makes no sense i don’t think anyone is actually buying this
Drake is really a sore loser using Reddit theories in order to look like he's calculated, without any proof whatsoever lmao Still, it was a great battle and we should applaud both of these men for participating. The only niqqa who took a L is J Fold.
He literally says they were planning to but dude bit on the information that was there already…
Not to mention they could easily provide proof by sharing a screenshot..
he really read twitter and reddit posts from his stans to figure out what conspiracies they were coming up with to save face, and then he just played into them. None of it makes sense at all
Did Drake just called himself a clown?
He tells Kendrick to fact check next time yet he can't even proofread his own songs
"I tricked you into thinking I was a pedo!"

Uh.... Cool?
Bro saw the r/drizzy Reddit post about him playing 4d chess and just ran with it
[deleted]
Drake was so ready for this to be over he didn’t even proofread. Worse than his ususal AB Dr sues rhymes.
Give him a break, his ghost writers bailed after meet the Grahams
The whole song almost sounds ghostwritten by Kendrick as a sneak diss to Drake. Like he’s just reinforcing everything Kendrick said on MtG without realizing it…
Drake when his 2nd favorite ghostwriter came up with the line:

![gif](giphy|12q3xMbs2Ph5gA|downsized)
I said this elsewhere but the whole “faking being a deadbeat dad to 2 kids instead of 1” is serious “SIKE that’s the wrong number!” Energy. Him and his yes-men think it’s fire but it’s corny as fuck.
OMG this just hit me lmaooooo
This stood out to me as well. Sounds like he’s struggling for a response and getting sloppy. Gotta be crisp with it my boy, can’t contradict yourself like that.
I think he is calling the mole a clown and saying that they gave dot incorrect information which Drake knowingly fed the mole. 

I don’t think its true, but I don’t think its calling himself a clown.
😂
A week? Tf? 6:16 to Meet the Grahams was like 2 days. 

Clown ass logic..
The ghost writers weren’t collaborating. They must be working from home.
Yeah this made me scratch my head like is you stupid stupid?? L
Different ghost writers
These lines aren't contradictory? Drakes team gave kendricks team false info (thus kendricks team who tells Kendrick the stories are clowns)
everyone in these comments not understanding the logic behind this are showing their room temp IQs
[deleted]
Drake literally confirmed that there are moles in ovo who tell people shit about Drake. Which makes pretty much everything Kendrick said feel a lot more realistic if drakes inner circle is giving the info
Bro is rehearsing
Man, if I was a jury, and the man accused of pedophilia said, "I'm too powerful, rich, and respected to be a pedophile." I'm gonna be inclined to be convinced the man is a pedophile unless there's absolute evidence he is not.

Can't believe he bungled that up so hard. Like, not that pedophilia is wrong, no, he sjust too rich for it. If he lost some money, then for sure he would partake.
Shoulda used metro boomin's bbl drizzy beat
He doesn't want all the investigating that's gonna happen
My client pleads “nuh uh” to all charges, your honor.
There was nothing new on the offense and it was mostly obvious defense mechanisms from Kendrick’s allegations.
PR team feeding that dude bars.
these days, disses have become a bunch of allegations/gossip in a rhyming scheme

It takes away from the actual "punch" of the diss. Kendrick still did it better, but unless he shows proof for the stuff he said, it kind of becomes useless. Still way better verses.
Catchiest deposition of the month
i cant believe he said "feels good to get the pen working" 😂😂😂
MAN SAID "THIS WAS GOOD EXERCISE" AHAHAHHA

bro, people dancing and calling you a pedo.
Not the AB rhyme scheme for the whole song? His attempt to mimic Dot's choppy flow and it completely breaking down? Then copying his spoken word... I just know the whole class groaned whenever he read aloud.
He actually says he doesn’t want to fight Kendrick in the song. Almost feel bad for the crodie
Holding back tears he can't believe he and his team of ghost writers are getting out paced by one guy
Reminding me of Nicki talking nonsense at the end of Big Foot
> feels good to get the pen working

Is a crazy line when that’s literally you’re whole job description lmaoooo
To be honest with you, meet the grahams was his most devastating. The last one was a bop and he had a couple of lines in there that made you go oooh, but meet the grahams was his best one yet.
If we believe his 10 bars in Not Like Us then he has 6 left. Release that shit everyday this week. Don’t pull what Drake did the Push or so Drake says
[deleted]
I want Kendrick to give the finishing blow and release  the receipts. He's toast.
I think this was Drake giving himself the loophole not to respond. Now, no matter what Kendrick says, it is “where’s the evidence?” Even if Kendrick provides evidence, his fans will be skeptical.
Aside from just getting more good music, I don’t even think Kendrick stans care for another response. Dot just needs to capitalize and use the momentum to drop a proper single. Drake is dismissed.
It's over as in Drake lost. Kendrick still has to finish him. I don't see Drake responding again. And if he does it will be some weak shit like this where he just plays defense the whole song. It's over man it was fun though. Thanks Drake I had a blast!
Look at r/drizzy they think he’s on top
This isn't a rap beef where both sides just wanna win.

This is a rap beef where Kendrick wants blood. Kendrick wants nothing less than Drake not having a career after this.
Would love one more strong nail in the coffin. Just Kendrick spitting on the grave. He has enough hatred for him already.
They are propping him up to take another beating

I think thats cool
I think this is a manufactured ending by studio execs hoping to save as much face as possible. They stepped in to minimize financial losses from allegations against their golden goose 
Kendrick has way too many people on his side for it to be over. Rick Ross has some sort of vendetta too
I was a Drake fan. After this? I unfollowed him on all platforms and deleted his music from my Spotify.
[deleted]
Yup lol they partying like it’s 1999, balls deep in the “plant” narrative
Dude they swear he won with the bait 🤣🤣 they're delusional asf rn 😭😭
They're all like ohhhhh Drake denied the allegations, that's a wrap beef over
They had a whole thread about how Drake kissing a 17 year old on stage and kissing Kylie at 16 wasn’t weird because “they were fans” I’m staying out of there for a while
There’s a few lines in THP6 that make it pretty clear that the ovo crew is scanning social media for ideas. It’s like he’s responding to the whole internet rather than Kendrick.
"I'm bleeding, making me the victor."
We purposely trained him wrong... as a joke
"I'm bleeding, making me the victor"
This song not a response to Kendrick, this song is a response to the Internet. Even if drake wanted to keep the beef going he can't possibly go on the offensive with pedo claims. Those allegations are bigger than any Kendrick diss or song for his career. So he went on record to address the rumors, I think that's what people miss about the track. He pointed out and disparaged every rumor about him on the track. It may have been wack but it hit its goal.
“I’m bleeding, that makes me the victor” lol
>more like Wimp Lo

"I'm bleeding, making me the victor"
Lets not act native like when drake was seen in the public eye next to Millie folks was cracking jokes about him being a pedo.  It's obvious what KDot was doing.
Ross did bring up MBB in champagne moments. He also addresses her after the Ross plane line.

Not defending anyone tho that's just how I heard it
If he fed him the info, why not check Kendrick as soon as he drops? Why wait? If he doesn’t hesitate he wins. It doesn’t add up
Ain't no way. "we plotted for a week" when there was 2 days between 6:16 and mtg. 

🤔
Drake is too stupid for that
No serious critic or fan considers him the GOAT. He’s as close to being the Hip-Hop GOAT as like, a mixture of Usher and Nelly. He makes club bangers that people vibe with and like to dance to. He’s never been a top tier lyricist, the fact he doesn’t write his own shit (proven by song writing credits, consistently), and the recent inconsistency of his work, nobody should seriously consider him the GOAT.
Yes
I think he's #1 in pop right now. He's got unreal cultural durability across multiple eras. He's absolutely, undeniably a hitmaker and a kingmaker. Now, is he a legendary rapper? No.

*Edit: not the Goat.*
Im gonna be objective and say before this he definitely was, to signify the shift in hip hop towards popularity over lyricism. Most new rappers care more about voice, production, and image over lyricism and that's objective. Carti, ken carson, travis, lil baby, gunna

But his legacy might actually be tarnished after this beef, and his impact definitely doesn't compare to guys like future, young thug, lil wayne
Hell no, never came close
Lol no
The funny thing is Kendrick proved he can beat him on his own terms in this beef. Not Like Us is the bangerest song to come out of this entire thing, and that was supposed to be Drake’s terrain.
That only “works” if Kendrick lets this diss slide which I have a very big feeling he won’t
Kenny didn't even get molested. That song is about how he *didn't* get molested but Drake knows his mouth breathing fans won't fact check
Meanwhile in r/Drizzy, they’re posting why is okay for Kendrick to say he should die for being a predator but not okay with Drake to make fun of him for being allegedly molested
Shits disgusting especially when ur begging people to not think you’re a sex offender
That was the part I took the most issue with. 
Like first of all, that song is about the trauma he has after being asked over and over if something happened when nothing happened, so Drake’s just missing the whole crux of Kendrick’s song.

Second of all, it sounded an awful lot like an admission of guilt to me, because “you got molested as a kid, lol” sounds like a bar only a sexual predator would spit.
This. It’s rap beef I get it’s not supposed to be nice but Drake is contradicting himself.
That's cuz his music isn't for this sub. He might wish it was, but that's not the audience.
You might even say he’s stuck at.. a minor depth

💀
Fantano said he doesn’t think Drake or his people are actually paying attention—or understanding—what Kendrick is even saying. 

Like the massive misinterpretation of Mother I Sober was the biggest self inflicted L of this whole thing. Kendrick has laid his flaws out for people, so it’s not hard to call him on certain things. 

But it’s a bit like Eminem, autobiographical rappers are sometimes hard to really attack because they’ve already written songs attacking themselves for that shit. People beefing with Eminem just resorted to you’re white, you’re unhinged, you don’t fit in, you beat your woman—all things Eminem had been actively making records about.
Nah his last 2 songs were good but this new one was ass
just Ninjas being uncle toms against themselves like usual. lmao 

same ppl in here are the ones that INSTANTLY BOUGHT KATT WILLIAMS BULLSHIT
100%. Barely knew who he was two days ago.
Are you saying that Drake accused himself of pedophilia, in order to get Kendrick to publicly accuse him of pedophilia?

Is that what y'all believe?
Goat of hip hop ? Fuck no
Whenever I heard Drake say he was the GOAT, or the best ever or whatever the fuck, I figured it was just boasting. I would never think he believed it so hard he would go up against an actual all time great like Kendrick. This went exactly how we all expected.
I had very similar thoughts because if this was such a premeditated and planned move on Drake's part, then there definitely would have been a bigger emphasis on the big "gotcha" moment and reveal. This only proves that Drake and his team are chronically online, not that they actually "fed" Kendrick false information. They didn't show any text messages, emails, recordings of the "planted evidence," or anything else to validate the claim. If not a music video, then at least show video proof of the alleged set-up taking place. 

They clearly saw the online conspiracy theories and just ran with that shit. Drake saw an out with this beef and an attempt at damage control and took the coward's way out. He knew he wasn't winning. 🤷🏾‍♂️
trying to combat allegations that you're a predator and pedophile by clowning on someone getting molested is such a wildly stupid move who told him this was smart
This is the equivalent of a bully calling out the quiet kid and when the quiet kid pulls up and swings, he turns around and plays victim saying he was just “joking” and to chill out lol
This is Drake seeing J Cole keeping his career intact, and trying to do the same. Bowing out is all he can do.

Maybe next time he won't diss people who can actually write good rhymes lol
You mean the people that call it "The War of Northern Aggression ".
Lyrical talent aside, you went to school with Drake, you already know his entire persona is manufactured. Lyrical talent included, yeah Kendrick burned Drake.
What was Aubrey like in hs?
you going to the same school doesnt mean you “knew him” or anything lmao what a weird ass way to say “KenDrIcK WOn” lmao
[deleted]
Can't bow when you're facedown on the mat.
*currently getting stomped on* i didn't bow out tho nerds
the “baited kendrick” thing comes from Drake stans grasping at straws. If he TRULY did bait him, we would’ve already seen some type of proof (which we haven’t). Text messages? Dms? Nah, we haven’t seen anything at all. Drake’s gonna try silently dip, and hope we just forget about the beef itself (which we won’t).
He baited kendrick into making the whole world think hes a pedo then waiting days to respond with no receipts? Good bait brother
I mean, he made a whole “diss track” that contains more responses to the internet compared to new shots at Kendrick. It’s very obvious Drake is grasping at straws to keep himself in a losing battle. And before you call me a Kendrick glazer, i been neutral this whole time. You cannot lose against an already prepared Kendrick, especially when your name is Drake. It was a lost battle from the beginning, but Family Matters was a good attempt atleast.
He also makes songs with Future who takes care of none of his kids lmao. 

But wants to call Drake a deadbeat for not taking care of his imaginary one.
You’re reading a lot of opinions on Kendrick winning, in my opinion, because Drake is a very polarizing figure.

To give a quick rundown as I know it, it kinda goes back over the course of the last decade. Kendrick and Drake have been “sneak dissing” each other, which just means the rhymes they write are clearly about each other but no names dropped so there’s always been some deniability.

This past year Drake released a song with J Cole titled First Person Shooter. On that record, Cole makes many references to the “big 3” of hip hop, meaning Drake, Cole and Kendrick. It was a big record.

Fast forward to just about a month or two ago, out of nowhere Kendrick dropped a verse on a song called Like That where he explicitly says things like “fuck the big 3, it’s just big me” as well as calling out Drake (he called out Cole lightly as well).

That prompted a response diss track from J Cole pretty quickly thereafter but almost immediately after release, Cole bowed out. He said his spirit wasn’t in it. He initially got a lot of flak for that move but looking back, he probably had a good idea how ugly a lot of these accusations were going to get.

Since then, Drake dropped a couple diss tracks in a row basically just hounding on the fact that Kendrick is short, accused him of cheating on his wife and slapping her around, and claimed he heard one of Kendrick’s kids is actually not biologically his among other things. Kendrick then dropped a couple diss tracks also back to back in which he claims Drake is a culture vulture, master manipulator and, most scathingly, a pedophile.

This latest diss track dropped by Drake is a what makes a lot of people think he’s waving a white flag as the energy in his voice is down and he’s spent a lot of time denying accusations made by Kendrick.

Neither artist has dropped one lick of proof, mind you. Everything you’re reading online is just speculation and people taking sides. That’s pretty much the long and short of it based on what I know. Hope it helps.
EXACTLY
There’s the rub
Drake confused his producer with Gayle King for a second there.
That fake daughter thing is another example of him using an underage girl for his benefit and pleasure.
💀
Drake out here like Hiliary Clinton, “Pivot!”
It's the meme of everyone dancing at the party to "A-minorrrrr". 

And drake is all: "I bet they don't know I was on Degrassi".
> the guy is gaslighting on wax 

Makes sense he’s a master manipulator and a habitual liar too
He didnt talk about the prescription pills and shit just the daugther.
lol, he’s playing into the whole master manipulator who isn’t calculated theme. It’s in his best interest to walk away. Kendrick will cook him for days then dance on the carcass of his pretend-hard rap career. Drake will always be a successful artist in some form or other but whatever street cred he was trying to attain been over.

This was entertaining though. Glad it brought attention to some of Kendrick’s works from the Vault and Ep days to Mr Morale to folks who might not have been hip.
That's also the problem with having 20 ghost writers working different shifts.
Also in that line about how he doesn't wanna beef with Kendrick because he's a woman beater he accidentally calls himself a woman
You would at least have thought through your reveal to ensure you don’t accidentally call yourself a clown if you had weeks to think about it
Also why does it take a week to think of a handful of misinformation?  
  
What the hell is he even talking about?
He’s not writing the lyrics and he can’t comprehend shit since he got Kendrick’s song all misconstrued.
“I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!”   
“You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?”
Dog it’s literally social media theories
He really is 37year old showing up as 7. Kendrick was right about him in every bar from every diss. Read this fake b***h like a book
“Yeah Drake got a baby momma named Alyssa out in Turks, the baby’s name is destiny”

Look how easy that was
![gif](giphy|FUgmWRgVOLDdS)
Yes 🗿
He even says at the end, "damn, it was good to get out the pen"...did he also confess that he did not write *any* of the previous tracks for these past few days?
> I don't wanna fight with a woman beater, it feeds your nature

Lmao this line made it also sound like Drake called himself a woman
He needs to fire his proofreaders.
Dude:

“Stop buying views and bot comments, you may as well keep the paper”

Come on! Like Drake you think we stupid bro! The audacity.

Must be spending a fortune to control the narrative. 
Ghost writer #7 wrote the first line n ghost writer #22 wrote the second line. Not drakes fault he didn’t get the lines till he was in the booth.
He can’t understand Kendrick’s songs either if he thinks Kendrick got molested
"haha joke's on them I was only pretending"
I'm sorry bro, there's no amount of hate, love, or money on the planet for me to fake being a pedo in real life.
"Haha you really believed I was a pedophile? Gotcha!"

Bruh everyone knows you groomed Bella Harris and MBB. Let alone the groping a teen on stage. "I never look twice at a teenager." Literally false.
they're insane, it's like qanon in there
That’s what i commented on YouTube and thought, I said “atleast this one sounds the least ghost written” yeah I think drake wrote it too
You can tell this was quickly written, and it also exposed that Drake isn't built for battle rap, he leaves so many openings and it's well known going on the defense is a death sentence, his ego and narcissistic personality got in his way on this one big time.

His gaslighting might work for his Stan's and anyone who isn't a hip hop head..but the total whiff on the Mother I Sober lyrics plus the doubling down on Dave Free/Wife beater without presenting a new angle was not the play.

Plus the "I'm too famous to not get exposed for fucking teenagers" line is WILD
I think union rules are that they can't work weekends.
They must’ve been the moles lol
Fuckin guy should have just used ChatGPT but he’s too fuckin stupid. 

It’s like all of OVO left the group chat and let him to rot. 
Yo what if the mole is the ghost writer
[deleted]
![gif](giphy|lw75Al819OAvcsPcRu|downsized)
A responsible father wouldn’t put his family into it, especially with what Adonis had to go thru with Pusha T.

Kendrick warned him but he did it anyway.

Now these kids have fucked up futures because of this guys ego and pride.
He got his track from Reddit and Twitter posts of his delusional fans. He didn't come up with a single idea of this on his own, or from his team, he stole fan theories and then didn't comprehend that they poke bigger holes that would require proof he wouldn't have. He played himself so hard, and he knows it. You can hear it in his voice.
Dude did a poor job expressing his thoughts then.
Im pretty sure it was the same day. Like, less then 24 hours apart
And its not believable whatsover because Drake didnt take advantage of that at all he shoulda have had another nuke ready if that was true. Not this weak ass bullshit. His heart isnt even in it you can hear it in voice. He just wants to go on vacation and stop dissing
It's like he lives in a fantasy land where the rich and powerful are subject to the same justice system the rest of us are as opposed to the exact opposite.

Pretty sure 99.99% of people would think the fact that he's rich and powerful would be the exact reason he could get away with it if he did it.
That would have been hilarious, but Drake's not that clever.
Until metro gets it pulled from all platforms
This shit did not sound pr fed, though, unless he has the worst PR team ever
He doesn’t have to show proof. Everything he said that matters (meaning except the daughter) has already been established. 

Example - Eleven, the stranger things girl. The girl on stage that told him he was underage. The guy in his inner circle who was arrested for sex trafficking. People from Toronto saying he’s weird. 

He’s at the very least a sexual deviant, and at the most a serial child rapist and trafficker. I’m sure the truth falls somewhere in the middle, but it’s not Dot’s responsibility to put together a prosecution’s case lol. He said what he needed to say, the proof is out there, and I’m sure more will come out. 

I’m also not sold that the daughter is fake. Everyone expects Drake to cop to it right away, but we’ve learned Drake doesn’t learn from his mistakes. Last time, it took him 6 months to admit Pusha T was right. I’d be absolutely shocked if there’s no secret daughter honestly.
Drake the type of dude to write a diss track and then say “feels good to get the pen working” 
Its actually hilarious he said that after the spanking he just got. Probably wrote that line with tears in his eyes
He just scribbled on paper to make sure it was still working, muttered to himself "ah feels good", and then handed it to the dude next time him to write the lame ass response.
Hahaha I caught this! Ol ghostwriter having ass
He’s like wow I even wrote this one myself
It feels very Trumpian
Ghost pen?
He got the pen out to write an emergency check for the lyrics. 

"Thx, Beam!! You came through again. Phew. That oughtta do it. C'mon, you guys. Gilmore Girls is on."
Drake's like oh shit bet you didn't know this many words end with "-ation"
The first line was also from the first few bars of Euphoria lol
I felt like the second one was to make one you could dance to. Kendrick wanted to beat him at his own game
When Kenny opened talking directly to Adonis my downstairs neighbors had to shove my lower jaw back up through the newly-made hole in my floor with a broomstick.

Downright disrespectful, and I was hooked.

And then when he was done with that, he was like “ok, now lemme talk to mom and dad.”
The last one didn't rely on as much hearsay/speculation and the last verse about Drake's career path as a culture vulture was insane
I agree but I think not like us was basically Kendrick saying I can beat you at your own game by making more of a hit song. This dries by Drake was him trying to do the same but to Kendrick.
Yeah MTG and Euphoria go crazy lmfao
Not like us was dancing on the grave after meet the grahams. But I think he should drop 2 more not like us type bangers to really nail the coffin
Meet the Graham's was the most devastating content wise, but Not Like Us is going to greet Aubrey at every club he goes to this summer. That's some long term devastation.
True, but in like 5 months, nobody is gonna remember Meet The Grahams.


But Not Like Us? That shit is gonna be blasting in clubs for a *while*.
5 more. Not Like Us was his 5th and referenced it like 3 times in the song itself.
He will just get lipo
He’s got an ozempic prescription remember
True for me. I don't care to hear more about Drake. Never liked his music. Not for me. I like Kendrick though and would like more music that isn't diss tracks. The diss tracks were fire though. Lol
If Kendrick is threatening to release more information about Drake’s and OVOs involvement in sexual predation, how could you not want another track? Especially with the Diddy stuff.

Kendrick is one of the only people ballsy enough to say shit like that with names in recent memory on a track. If its all true, how could you not want to see Drake or whoevers responsible in prison?
I mean, I'll take both? I'd be fine with another response but I'd also like a proper single/album from Kendrick too.
Tbh I can see Drake dropping a track as soon as Kendrick does, ONLY if he has receipts to back up what he said. If not, like you mentioned, this is probably the last one we’ll hear
Delusional
Holy fuck popped in and there's a buncha weirdos in there
"I'm bleeding, making me the victor!"

Seriously that track was straight garbage. Only the most deluded fan boys are even pretending that it was good.
Eh, I guess but his song has like 2k likes and twice the comments. I dunno if they're as pumped about it as one would expect
"Haha kendricks an IDIOT clearly this was all set up drakes on that aizen shit"
I hope they hoist his ass RIGHT into the spotlight. Let the internet do its thing and start digging into him.
This is literally it. Went from “nah nah you following through” to “well this has been fun”
and the worst thing is that drake just put himslef into a position where he has to show the receipts haha
Drake denied it so it’s obviously not true! /s

Spoken like true cult.
I just read that, holy shit

That sub is like Charles Manson esque obedience.
That’s my whole thought. 

The “drakes camp baited Kendrick with a fake kid” thing has been floating for a few days now. If Drake actually did bait Kendrick, why not respond immediately with the proof. Instead he waited days to respond. 

It feels way more like drakes team found the rumor online and tried to make it a reality without any proof. Cause if you had proof you got one over on Kendrick, he would have dropped that immediately for max impact. 

If Drake dropped a track right after meet the grahams was dropped talking about how he feed that info to Kendrick then it would have taken a lot of air out of the track for Kendrick. Instead Drake let that be the narrative for 2 days while not saying a word
It's so funny that there are all these people over in r/Drizzly claiming they predicted Drake would use heart part 6 as the title. They probably invented the title for Drake. Listening to THP6 was like reading r/drizzy super uncanny. Meanwhole every time Kendruck drops, it's catching People off guard
because he had to peruse reddit for ammo first lol
Exactly. He would’ve danced on his grave 

Went from “drop drop” to “I’m over this beef” really quickly. I hope Kendrick keeps killing him
If I was feeding my opponent false info I'd have a video of me telling my boys to send that shit to him with a time stamp and that shit would have been uploaded seconds after Meet the Grahams. This response stinks like a panic defense
With proof of the leak so when Kendrick used it he post the receipts 👀😂 since he “planned it” for a week and all
Why not make proof of the plant beforehand and include it in your response vid
6:16 and mtg was the same day. 2 days between euphoria and mtg. Then a day after mtg, not like us dropped
This is a good way to put it Drake is like Usher / Nelly Tier

Kendrick is Nas / Pac/ Biggie / Andre 3K Tier
I appreciate the answer. I assume the Mt Rushmore at this point is Biggie, Pac, Nas & Eminem. My knowledge isn’t too deep, but I grew up in the 90s.
No shot Drake over MJ tho. Michael's career was like twice as long as Drake's and MJ has a deeper catalogue. Drake is on pace, but he's got a long way to go to dethrone the King of Pop.
As somebody who’s been the victim of CSA it’s extremely fucked up of Drake to try to use that as ammo. I never liked Drake before this but he’s dead to me now.
Mhmm, “GOAT” of redirection and missing the point
Drake himself cant fact check, he said he knew Kendrick was gonna use the Epstein angle when dot actually compared to him as weinstein. Drake doesnt wven know which pdfile he’s being compared to 🤣🤣
Yeah he’s just throwing Kenny the alley-oop for a massive dunk on him though. His fanboys will think it’s hard for about a day until Kendrick drops again and it falls apart.
So gross, the false equivalences, but they don't want to hear Kendrick, they just want to (One) Dance

My theory? They're d\*\*kmatized, the d-riding has only gotten worse since that video got leaked 💀, Drake must've leaked that video for r/Drizzy all along... 😉
Also can’t forget how his beard is weird.
I’m just following this through Reddit but what parts are drake saying he leaked? Cause as far as I can tell from the comments Kendrick called drake a pedophile and dead beat dad is there another part the Kendrick side is ignoring?
That's the card Drake is trying to play and he looks like a clown for it.
Yeah that's the goofiest shit I've ever heard
Definitely something a predator would do
Just a prank, bro
Lol Kendrick dissed him, we all know Kendrick is the better lyricist. I respect drake for giving it a go, he really didn't have to respond to anything but said f it
Seems like it but idk. I really hope Kendrick has something tonight
Kinda stuck up and nerdy. He was away a lot because he was on Degrassi. He lived in a nice neighborhood even then. 

This persona he's created is based on nothing. I never heard of him hanging with anybody or doing any dirt. What he is now? I don't know anything about, but there have been rumors of him paying people to do things.
[deleted]
😆
This comment is wild lol
Holy shit I'm legit crying laughing
Damn bro he’s already dead, why you digging up the corpse.
That was a lose-lose for his dumb ass anyway. Kendrick is either spot on and the truth comes out, or he willingly admits he has a leak in his crew that is is neither willing or able to do anything about. Talk about weak shit.
Standing on they neck can't let em breeaaathh
Kendrick definitely the Barack to Drake’s Hillary Clinton
Do you think that if Drake didn't tell lies about Kendrick, that Kendrick wouldn't tell truths about him?
Him and Nicki are two peas

This whole thing made me despise Kendrick for his rate of output over the years. Also can't think of the last time I've heard him this inspired. 

Man needs to learn how to channel this energy.
And also by saying it feels good to get the pencil out implies he hasn't written himself in a while.
That’s not what he’s saying, but it is what it sounds like he’s saying. Definitely an L line.
Worst was the bsharp, d flat d majooooor line. That was so fuckin bad. like man you serious? 

What family “member” green lit this shit? 
it honestly seems like his head is spinning he’s too online
Not to forget him calling himself a bitch basically 

*"I don’t wanna fight with a woman beater, it feeds your nature"*
And we heard what happens when he gets out the pen.... lol
No wonder you got ghostwriters drake my bad, i didnt know your condition was that terrible.
Why you reaching lmao he obviously not just saying he got the pen for this song only?
Someone called them 6anon lmaoo
I just went in there, they're really just quoting "when I hit you back it's a lot safer" like he eviscerated K.Dot. it's like a different reality they're living in.
Almost like he doesn't trust those around him right now. hmmmmmmm 🤔
He tried AI and it didnt go too well for him
[deleted]
That ghostwriters name? Kendrick.
ChatGPT snitching to Kendrick :x
The diss track is coming from inside the house!!!
Narcissism for you
Yeah so def not a week..
It was like an hour wasn’t it?
He really doesn't have any artistic integrity... Want to troll, then troll, he could have used the BBL Drizzy because his rapping wasn't anything special he just ended up talking or was it publishing statements in good faith to be played back in court?

Also he didn't have to name the single the Heart Part 6 unless he specifically wanted people who enjoy Kendrick to back off and stop advocating for Kendrick. This is damage control and gives Drake a lot of relief.
First time he’s written anything in years
4 credited writers on the song lmao
This shit writes itself
Lmfao this has to be a skit
Please don’t give Drake any ideas.
He was only missing hateration and holleration and that's how I know he's a white man 

/s
You're right I didn't even notice, the first thing I thought was "damn the beat ain't even that hard on this one"
Not to mention its a bay area vibe channeling mac dre/ E-40, kendrick knows the game hes playing
Yeah,  Not like us is a present for DJs and passes the car check.
Yeah as soon as I heard "dear Adonis, I'm sorry that that man is your father" I knew I was about to hear some crazy shit
He called the whole family down to the principals office to talk about how much of a disappointment Drake is.
V12
I mean, sure. If he wants to double down and bury the dude, I’m not complaining.
No beef has ever been based on whats factual. Its always been whos been the more popular artist. Nas beat Jay-z because people saw Nas as more real despite Takeover being the better song.

50 cent beat Ja-Rule despite Ja rule having receipts. Its always going to be about public perception and Drakes perception has always been corny weirdo who makes club songs and is weird around young girls. He had to come as hard as a he could and he didn't and Kendrick won.
I don't get why people selectively ask like being called a pedophile and having to fight those allegations didnt change the whole beef. There is nothing he could say on wax to Kendrick without clearing that up.
How do you prove you don't have a kid though. I agree with everything else
And it doesn’t let me post this over there DRAKE EPSTEIN RECEIPTS 🧾 https://x.com/mzicyobe/status/1782393593837019440?s=46
100%
Nah he even had a victory lap at the end of Family Matters. 

He thought that should work, but Kendrick stepped on that so hard.
So.. def not a week by any chance
I honestly believe if depends on what generation you’re from. I think the consensus is Pac/Biggie +2, but I’ve heard other entries vary wildly; Jay-Z, Nas, Eric B & Rakim, Dre, Wu-Tang, Ye, Eminem, Andre 3000, etc. I think there’s a good argument for quite a few of these guys to make the cut—including Kendrick at the rate things are going.
The key difference is that MJ wrote his own shit, Drake will never cleanly take the king of pop title even if his numbers become similar to MJs unless he consistently starts writing his own music. 
For real, there's genuinely NO EXCUSE, and that seems like the kind of joke.. only a predator would make. Take Care used to be one of my favourite albums, mostly for nostalgia purposes, but he can keep those ghostwritten verses.
I think we'll hear more soon enough.
Kendrick would do well to put a nail in the coffin one receipt would do it, at the moment I’m at the both don’t know shit for facts about anything they’ve said but he said she said. 

Everyone’s heard the rumours that Drake fucks with kids been knowing that since 2015. No pusha moment on the kid with no evidence, no snitching proof. No women beating proof besides insinuations from mr morale of domestic issues. 

We right back where we started but il always rate Kdot for saying what everyone been thinking by calling Drake out and making him tell on himself for the pedo shit like DMing Millie Bobby brown shit buying her shit, busting through sweet 16ths and the video shit with that 17 year old, grooming that other kid when she was 16 and buying out the restaurant for her when she hit her 18th birthday. Thats public knowledge but ain’t nobody give his name up for it in any diss like that yet. 

He can say he ain’t been fucking kids alls he wants but you got candy around your mouth and the empty wrappers in your hands, nobody saw you eat that shit but you looking suspect with all that around you.
BURQUE STAND UP!
This is a great analogy. 

Who's Cole? Elizabeth Warren? Sanders?
Shoo shoo shoo shoo bi hi bi bi
I really wish more people made this connection. She’s married to a pedo, while he has a crazy infatuation with her and far too many allegations of interactions with women under 21.
Wayne the only clean mf from YM as far as I’m aware. Thank god.
😂 Like I [implied in another thread, Kendrick the Jordan of this shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/s/VEKPqRQqOU), he gets inspired through revenge. Not uncommon for athletes. Anyway it’s rumors an album coming this month or next month and I think even Drake’s latest diss alluded to this.

![gif](giphy|VIVWFx6c91AAwWLwWB|downsized)
I get wanting to hear more from Kendrick, but this man doesn't owe you a regular release schedule haha.
Zero chance he wrote this all himself. Actually maybe, a ghostwriter would have noticed his media illiteracy and pointed out that he completely misunderstood Mother I Sober.
[deleted]
Trying to counter the instant classic "A MINNOOOORRRR" line with a redditor level pun about B#, a key that only actually exists under a different name, is peak "R&B pop artists pretending to be a rapper" shit lmao
Yeah, bro needs to hire some ghost editors too
When I first heard the song, I definitely took that as Drake calling himself a woman.
Oh god thank you I can’t believe how little recognition that line is getting lmao my head turned completely sideways when he said that shit🤣
ROFL this is exactly how I interpreted this line… I was like “did he just… diss himself?”
 Bro!! LOL!!! 6anon got me good 😆 🤣
The longer people shit on this song, the more obvious it is that this was Kendrick’s plan.
He been down so long it look like up to him
Lol this is drakes next story
AND THEY MADE IT BAD ON PURPOSE
It's hilarious that it's not impossible, but absolutely no one would ever believe it if it did happen and you would get non stop clowned if you even tried to suggest that's what happened
Nah fam if I’m kdot i see Drake take my heart pt I’m gonna go full Guts in the berserker armor on him
Bold of you to assume Drake wrote this. Pretty sure the pen he was talking about was paying his ghost writer via check
And it’s obvious
✨ felt like home for me ✨ 😁😁😁
and it's a fast one
[removed]
Ether is widely regarded as a better song than Takeover. Before Ether dropped, people were saying Nas doesn’t have it in him to win/battle.

Source: I’m 41 lol
We get downvoted for speaking truths lol.
Not even weird man you’re downplaying that shit, Drake IS a predator he is ON VIDEO molesting a 17 year old girl on stage and then doubling down talking about her breasts.
I’ve been making a similar point
People with patterns of grooming underage girls have no business starting rap beef.
He would need to show proof that they faked the leak to Kendrick’s camp. Like show texts or emails dated a week ago talking about it. 

If they Drake can show that, then yeah he’s got Kendrick locked. Otherwise, it sounds more like he just ran with an internet rumor with no proof
The expanding image dot used for euphoria and meet the grahams, Drake should have had the full image with him posing in it for THP6 as the cover. That is how you nuke a men and show proof
Really lol
He 100 percent thought that family matters would be a nail in the coffin that people would be talking about all weekend. To see his face when he found out meet the grahams dropped would be priceless.
Most of the songs should have been on house of balloons anyway
“Gotta definitely write a song about how we don’t diddle kids” -Frank “drake” reynolds
Cole is 100% Cory Booker. They share a painful earnestness. Also, both of them vaguely gesture to socially concious goals while being too embedded within the corporate machine to truly offer anything different beyond new branding for old ideas.
I dated someone who insisted on listening to that posse cut where Drake talks about staring at Nicki's "titties" over and over (can't be bothered to remember the name), and even before this beef the weirdo creep vibes coming off that track were so thick you could cut them with a knife
And this is why he isn't involved
That mf has every vd known to man. He is an hpv reservoir.
You think little Wayne clean….. 😂😂😂 bro ask me how I know he isnt
I actually think he might have wrote it. 

Just compared to Pushups & Family Matters, The Heart 6 just takes a massive nosedive in quality.
I mean my interpretation was that he didn’t want to fight Dot because he’d just take his anger out on his wife, feeding his nature. What it SOUNDED like was Drake saying he’s a woman, and he didn’t want Dot to beat him. I’m team Dot in this fight, just so we’re clear, and I think Drake’s response was sloppy and nonsensical. I just don’t want people to hyperfocus on a line that Drake fans can go “ummm actually” on when there is so much on this track to call out.
He studied the art of war. Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake.
Bro frrrrr I saw the title and thought to myself ‘this guy really does want more smoke’

I’m a Canadian and I still don’t understand wtf is going on in that Drizzy brain of his
His ghostwriters would have put something more coherent together
he definitely wrote this because its some hot trash fr
Takeover’s a great song but Ether is not a different level. Its become a verb at this point 😂
Takeover is a good song but Ether is surgical
I don't understand why people are downvoting you for saying this because THE VIDEO IS REAL!!! I Saw that shit today and it was cringe. He was rubbing on her, asked how old she was, and she said 17. He then made comments about how thicc she was and how her breasts felt against him and then proceeded to kiss her and make weird comments after knowing she's under age. If he's willing to do that in public, he's willing to do more behind closed doors 🥴🫠🗑️
This is now the inspiration to THP7
Facts- especially Practice, that was written by the Weeknd anyways
“Only” with wayne, nicki, drake and CB? I still wish he had a rap verse on that song. Im positive he would have had a solid verse
The silence from Wayne is notable. There is NO ONE coming out to defend drake. Well, except Ak lol.
Well that’s a different type of clean than what I was insinuation LMAO
How
Yeah, this one was so bad it might actually be him. 
[deleted]
You're right but the other interpretation is more funny.
Everyone he knows has told him he's a genius voice of a generation for a decade and anyone that said different got left behind. He's finding out the truth in real time.
SpongeBob meme “how many times we gotta teach you this lesson old man” lookin ass Drake
I heard someone speculate the first verse was written by someone else—hence why it’s the most coherent and fluid part—and that the rest was written by him and therefore is a dumpster fire.
Glazing famous people will always be mfs mission
Yeah, pretty sure that's it. Just always felt like I needed a shower after hearing it
Ak, who is also accused of grooming minors and sexual assault
Idk about defending him but I’m surprised that some notable old heads like 50, Ma$e, and Camron saying Drake won and staying quiet on Kdot’s drops.
I def didn’t even think of this. You right.
Bruh. It's like Zeus looking down on Hermes getting jumped and leaving the chat like "nah he made his bed. And f****** my b**** when I was in jail"
I damn sure knew you didn’t mean clean as in sober 😵‍💫
The things you see or can’t unsee when doing EP
New York just never forgave the west coast for hit ‘em up lol.
And they stay taking L's oh well. Let them support Toronto's finest pedophile publicly it's okay. Coming from a n**** that ran to god to run from diddy and a n**** in all pink that gets diddy invites on the low, they not saying much
[Premier League] One of Erling Haaland's teammates left a message following Haaland's hat-trick vs Ipswich: "I'm sick of writing these match balls"

The one on the right of it also sounds like frustration 

“Again you Norwegian”
That ‘ Again you norwegian’ is more likely to be Jack
Everyone saying it's Grealish ignoring the fact it's too well written to he him. My bet is De Bruyne
It was Pep.
He believes in motivating him even more to become a villain.
Jack.
I think it was Bernardo
these match ball
“Again you Norwegian…” lol
It's Kyle

https://images.app.goo.gl/YNkmQAdWe14JXzzVA
Ofcourse it was the match ref
Plot twist: it was Haaland.
Why would Savio write this smh
>match balls

Ball
definitely Grealish
lol those squiggly lines right below it are what it looks like when I have to sign my name on the little pad at the supermarket or somewhere, you could I’m practically a premier league footballer 😎
its grealish isnt it
Its def Ederson
Foden or rico Lewis
Whose signature looks like the Palmer writing method lmao
All PL teams are sick too lol
Haaland so pleased, he didn't want to spend his allowance on the new ball.
OP's title is grammatically correct but not the one on the ball. Hence it's Jack
> “… signing his match balls”

I can imagine it haha
Definitely Bernardo.
I don’t get the “Big Man Top Dogw”. Did they not know how to spell dawg?
translation:

I'm good enough to get the headlines, then some scandanvian robot takes them all. no more. Will not do this again (will be signing again)
BallS
So that is why no one passes to him when he makes those runs
then stop scoring you twat
'Again you Norwegian' is obviously a history buff referring to hairy Norwegian long held practice of laying siege to Ipswich.
The real reason Bernie wants to go
Had he only left out the word "match" a whole new genre of fan fiction would have been born.  
Poor millionaire has the write a few words on a soccer ball for children!
Which roughly translates to “fucken Nordic cunt” - pep
Lol completely missed that one
Actually not the complete message, we just can't see the rest. I've got in on good authority that it says "Again you [amaze me, you beautiful] Norwegian [hunk. Can't wait to make love to you later. Pep]"
[deleted]
There is no way Jack knows how to spell Norwegian.
Loiners (person from Leeds) up in arms.
Nah, pretty sure geniuses like de Bruyne have writing that can't be read by other than him and his mother.
It's actually Erling himself that wrote this.
yeah. no way Grealish knows how to write.
He Is gonna stop providing assists at some point
"let me write, LET ME WRITE !!"
My first thought was also KdB. Could be Grealish though tbf.
It's not. That's Kyle Walkers signature
Can’t be, it’s not written in crayon
Nope, not written in crayon or primary school cursive
You mean Jaime Tartt?
Don't pretend he knows how to read and write
For sure, he is the only one clever enough who might make a grammar mistake...
Has Bernardo Silva written (figuratively) all over it
It’s also possible Kyle just signed his name a bit underneath what was written, cos I don’t think Kyle is that witty.
That man has seen things
only if he has a ghostwriter in the locker room
It's interesting how everyone here thinks Grealish while City sub is convinced it's Bernardo
Ederson is more likely to just leave a thumbs up
might be top draw
The child known as Haaland
English please
IT SHOULDVE BEEN ME
it's Cyrillic cursive
I’m sure he could look it up in a dictionary, if someone explained to him what one was.
Norweegin
It's his 8th attempt. Trial and error.
Seems like he smudged the marker to avoid having to spell the whole word
Then again the ball says Norw̶͍̱̘͓̜̳̩̦̱̦̏̐̈͝ė̸̯̭̄g̷̡̧̥̝͕̦̬̺̬̳͐́̿͌̅̾̄̅̓͠i̴̢̠̯̤̫̥̐̋͊̊͘ͅan
In fairness, it doesn't look like he quite managed to successfully spell it.
“Noreginn”
Doctor de Bruyne
The sentence is grammatically incorrect, so it could still be Grealish
Funny since you can’t write his name either.

edit: name was edited.
Could be, but it could also be one player who wrote "Im sick of writing..." and then Kyle only writing his signature. 

Since the sentence is grammatically incorrect, I feel like its a foreigner who wrote it (or Jack).
I thought it was because he ate all his crayons...
I can fully imagine Jack pulling out the red Berol handwriting pen
ooh! Bernardo is a good shout
🙂
If he can’t spell “Norwegian” there’s no chance he’s spelling “dictionary.”
You have to know the first letter of the word to do that, so…
A wah?
“What is a dictionary?”
>if someone explained to him what one was.

A dictionary or a Norwegian?
He couldn't find London (where he was born and raised) on a map, and you think he knows how to use a dictionary?
It's incorrect in a foreign way though. I don't think a native speaker would make mistakes like this.
You’re giving Walker a lot of credit that he might not be due. Walker is not a smart man.
Kyle Walker is easily as thick as Grealish. Dumb and Dumber comes to mind
Mate, foreigners have far better English grammar than us English, innit
What color do you think is his favorite flavor?
👍
🙂 _tell him you're sick of writing those balls_
He knows how to say "siri, how do you spell norwegian"
"A big book of words Jack...A book is collection of paper with words on them...Words are the magic lines that tell people things...It's ok Jack go back to your toys, I'll sort everything out"
He is from Birmingham
He wasn't born and raised in London, he's from Birmingham
Jokes aside, would a person born in England actually write "these match ball"? (I'm not english, so I wouldn't know, could be slang).
Hmmm...probably Garden Green
Purple
👍
Leave him alone, wouldn’t expect a scoucer to know what they’re on about.
A dumb one would. 
Forgot the S maybe
Kyle Walker is simply put, not very smart so I could absolutely see him writing it that way. These guys are footballers who rarely need to write.
No. Jokes aside, that does read like typical non-native English. Even the most uneducated Brit understands plural vs singular.
Bold of you to assume a Liverpool fan on Reddit is a Scouser
shocking how often i forget to put an S for plural words or simple shit like crossing my t's when writing something
Kyle Walker seems like the kind of guy that holds his breath, when he has to write something
He's more active on r/nba and r/nfl . I really wonder where he's from.
Or asks the nan he’s got with him to write for him.
Or mouthing each word slowly, as he writes it on the page/ball
Sounding out each syllable as he goes.
Lazio fans with a special banner tonight for their match vs. Celtic

It's never not funny to me that lazio of all teams have ss in front of their name.
Another shot fired in the Potato Europe-Tomato Europe War.
They have such a way with words
As a Celtic fan: lmao
Jokes on them potatoes are delicious 

Edit: you all are making me hungry 😂
Friendliest Lazio fans
Most intellectual Lazio fans
pretty tame for them TBH
For those wondering about the geography, there's an infamous sectarian song called the Famine song to the tune of Sloop John B that has lyrics nearly identical to the banner.

Ironically, nothing gets Orange piss boiling faster than people from Rome telling Scots what to do.
Can't be Lazio fans, it's not upside down
Absolutely amazing
/r/2westerneurope4u
Hey, that’s uncalled for guys! Says me eating a big plate of spuds.
I thought we were pasta this.
TBF

Gnocchi is my favorite pasta
As an Irishman I found this confusing and fucking hilarious tbh
Follow your leaders Lazio
Lazio fans have had 4 years to make a banner to match the “Follow Your Leader” the Green Brigade came up with and that’s all got? That’s the most offensive part, they didn’t even try
Good job it's not a Palestine flag, or UEFA would have to intervene and do something about the banner. This is OK though.....
Would expect nothing less from those wankers.
So, Lazio vs Celtic is the one to watch tonight? Noted.
Ironic since both teams are probably more international in their roster than they are domestic
Fucking Nazi cunts. Follow your leader you shitbags.
Wouldn’t expect anything different from that club
They, too, can hang from a lamp post.
I'd rather be accused of eating potato than being a fascist.
Also so many *poor and hungry* italian immigrants fled their country during WW2 and had a chance to rebuild their lives elsewhere.

Just look at New York. I wonder who will tell the Lazio fans about italiani immigration they are in for a surprise...
I would have preferred an insult around IRA and bombs rather than this, but each to their own..
Expect anything else from racist fascists? Every one of them should end up like their leader
Smartest Lazio fans
Literal racism. Wouldn’t expect less from nazio fans
Cheers Nazio.
Greaseball scumbags. The punchbags of Italy
Wow fuck these pea-brained cunts
That's some weak banter
Can I get a high res version for the in-laws Christmas card 😬
Embarrassing banner. They literally just scrolled through old rangers banners and picked their favs. Absolutely zero originality. Wouldn’t think Italians would like knock off gear. I thought they had style.
Game is, in fact, not gone
Throwing flares into the away fan section

And showing Irish flags with SS Lazio on it. Hmm
What a despicable club. Hope this racism is punished appropriately.
Bit weird catholics using anti catholic rhetoric 😂
Nazio strikes again! 🫠🫠🫠
Do they think Glasgow is in Ireland?
SS Nazio at it again
Nazio at it again.
Just tell Italians neither coffee, nor tomato are native to Italy and they just bastardized the foods. 

That should send Lazio fans crying. (oh, basil too)
Fair play to Lazio on their level of research, finding the chants from my primary school
Fuck Nazio
Fucking nonces all of them
the third reich being over doesn't stop lazio fans from being nazis
Nazio scum

Some away fans had tickets and such were the queues they gave up
They've got SS in their name for a reason.
I used to like Lazio because of Hernanes.

The more I know about them the more embarassed I get 😭
Is it bad to eat potatoes? I really like them…
No Pope of... Rome?
Has Lazio never heard of Rangers? If they think this is offensive they've never seen the old firm Derby. 

Rangers fans are sitting at home thinking "thats it? That was shite"
The Potato Eaters Vs The Nazi Tomatoes Eaters

What match!
11th in the League.. yikes lmao even Chelsea can banter 'em
no doubt rangers fans were involved in helping lazio come up with that amazing patter
Seems like this should be in r/soccercirclejerk
SS Nazio
Racist Lazio strikes again. Not surprised.
Such a shit banner but surprisingly it has actually got people raging judging by some of these comments
Literally SS nazi sc-um-bags
(great banter)
Just because potatoes are better than pasta !
Full Nazi
Poor effort that. Are Lazio fans edgy 12 year olds?
potatoes are great, i would happily be called a potato eater
Well I did Nazi that coming.
Obligatory. Fuck these fans. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JyLnbjtBLX4
I thought potatoes was an Irish insult, but also I fucking love a hot tatty with tuna and cheese.

I'm too old and uneducated for all this shite.
Can we ever expect something good to come out of most italian fans?
Ok so Celtic fans are celebrated with their continuous political provocation, including Palestine and calling Lazio fascist. 

Now that one team finally hits back, everyone's so offended

Can't you see the double standards?
Anti-Irish racism. Are we going back to the 1890s or something? Nazio fans are to racism what zoomers wearing tweed jackets and playing the banjo are to the music scene, I guess. Proper hipster shit.
Whats wrong with potatoes?
Cringe
I have no idea how to react to this I can’t lie.
Down with this sort of thing
And go home they did.
Potatoes vs Pastas
Oooo shiver me timbers
Wild 💀
Mamma mía!! Una patata en el culo dela Nazilinis 🤌
always a considerate group of fellas
Equality. Fair play to them.
Classy as always
Game's back.
Wholesome
 👍
Thats actually funny
Classy as ever.
Lmao
games back
Racism?
Lazio fans have been facing a (happiness) famine their entire lives, don't be too harsh on them
Hopefully they get reprimanded for it. But why does it read like it was written by a bunch of valley girls?
Stay classy Lazio
SS Nazio back at it again
Keep it classy Lazio
Lol that's funny
Nice. 

Celtic is a vile club with vile supporters.
Not even my favourite Lazio banner today but all these banners have been a great read haha.
Stay classy Lazio…
Can someone ELI5? I’m out of the loop what’s this banter supposed to mean
F lazio.
Game’s not gone
Funny 🤣
That doesn't make any sense
Celtic should of called em spaghetti dicks
I really dislike Lazio and their fans but that did make me chuckle.
Heh. I chuckled.
Okay that's fucking funny
That banner manages to be against germans.. belgians.. irish.. Truly Lazio has the most welcoming fans.
That's actually nicest thing you can get from Nazi fans.
game’s not gone
Man I have a real soft spot for Lazio.
The spanglish do patatas bravas.  *fucking chefs kiss*
The UCL is the real farmers league, go figure.
Damn
That’s fucked
Close 2nd to the banner some other lower league team put up a few weeks ago of the opposing sides' manager hanging himself.
I don’t understand - wasn’t the potato famine something that went down in Ireland!? Or is *that* the joke??
Well that's not nice nor is it welcoming.You's think there was this huge historical rivalry between Lazio and Celtic.
And that Mussolini’s grandson plays for them. He’s actually called Mussolini. And best of all he plays right wing
Wait till you hear of SS Straßburg, [the club of the literal SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG_SS_Stra%C3%9Fburg).
Sometimes nomen really est omen
Benito Mussolini's 20-year-old great-grandson, Romano Floriani Mussolini, plays for Lazio (he's currently on loan at Pescara though)
I thought nominative determinism was only for people, but Lazio seem to have proven that wrong.
The biggest irony is that Lazio was the club that resisted Mussolini's attempt to be merged into the city's singular club - Roma.
I'll try and leave a similar comment here once more.

I understand the easy irony, but S.S. stands for Società Sportiva (which in case you need a literal translation means Sports Society). 
Lazio is one, if not the biggest sports club in Europe, with sections ranging from water polo, to rowing, American Football and much more.

Historically, S.S. Lazio was founded in 1900, a good 20 years before fascism became a party.

It is a very unlucky coincidence, but having right wing ultras today is not associated with any historical reasons.
SS Nazio Rom
what always made me laugh is that mussolini and the facists made all the small clubs in rome merge and become as roma.  they wanted a big roman club to compete against all the big clubs in the north.

lazio was the only club that said no and stood up to mussolini and the facists. but now his descendants support lazio.  and roma fans generally lean left now.
What is SS?
It’s hilarious that neither vegetable is native to Europe lol.
Tomato Europe 2 - 0 Potato Europe
So tomatoes are fascist now?
Potato your Europe wife tomato is Europe dead aubergine Ted..
Potato eaters didn't really work either. Their ancestors probably ate a lot of potatoes, but these days Scots with an Irish background live off shortbread, haggis, and deep fried heroin, like everyone else in Scotland.
That's the correct response
Took them since 2019 and that’s the best they could do as well
Yea I wasn’t sure if they were trolling or just massive racist
Gazza wants his liver back.
Have you tried potatoes with eggs and chorizo 🤤
What's a potato? Never heard of one.
Fry them, bake them, hell even boiling them, always good.
"Haha remember the time you got genocided? Lool."

- SS Lazio
You have to give some credit to Rangers ultras for lending their banner to Lazio for this big match tho, shipping cost must have been a nightmare
They had more outside the stadium https://twitter.com/FBAwayDays/status/1729589237463306435
pretty tame in general imo, Celtic's banner was arguably worse because of the BR logo, I don't get what's so shocking about the 3 I saw
what is orange piss?
LOL! I like the reference
spuds are class though
Obviously gnocchi
although in rome they do gnocchi with wheat and not with potatoes
You’ve never heard of the song?
[deleted]
Nope, they'll almost certainly get fined for it. You do know that UEFA didn't fine Celtic *during* their game, right?
who's gonna tell bro
I wouldn't hold my breath on being able to watch it live now.
Lazio literally owns Mussolini. There are many things to attack them for. This is not one of them.
live Mussolini reaction: 🙃
You mean fascists shitbags because the nazis were a little farther north.
can’t waste all your best ideas on the first chance
A club which has the grand son of a man who carpet bombed Ethiopia is in no way to talk about IRA links
Tbf I don't think that would've exactly been insulting. I would love to see Lazio fans get the IRA back in people's heads.
Honest question, how the hell do you become a Lazio fan?
Why are you being downvoted lmao what is wrong with people
Celtic was founded by Irish immigrants
Most football fans with Irish ancestry in Scotland support Celtic
Celtic are a club with massive Irish rooots. They have tons of Irish fans and many aspects of the club are culturally more Irish than Scottish. Lazio fan's aim is not off here
No, Celtic fans do though.
They’re saying to go home as in go back to Ireland I’m guessing
No, Celtic fans do.
It's referencing this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuu8vgW0LME)
Celtic wants to be Irish like Rangers want to be English.
They got spaghetti from China through Marco Polo.
In this context, as in calling out the famine and then calling them potato eaters is pretty significant ethnic slur.

It's referencing a huge number of Irish immigrants going all over the world, during the Irish Potato Famine. https://www.history.com/topics/immigration/irish-potato-famine
Why would I be annoyed at the time my ancestors got genocided? smartest reddit user
What about gnocchi?
Can't be poor if it has people on here all hot and bothered tbh
Celtic were founded by Irish immigrants and their Scottish fans have large connections with Ireland, lots of Irish Celtic fans as well.
It's almost like holding abhorrent views makes people treat you differently. Who knew
Surely it’s gotta be harsher than just a reprimand if Celtic got actually fined for fans flying Palestine flags right? …right?
Yeah, laughing at genocide is hilarious. Fumuppetwickoffucktard.

Fairly well known Rangers chant referring to Celtic’s Irish roots
Scumbags
Does he play inverted winger like his grandfather?
He even actually changed his surname from his dad’s to his mom’s iirc. Probs wanted to fit in at Lazio
Anyone else remember when Ogenyi Onazi played for them?
Even better, he is 1.**88** meters tall.
Adolf Hütter just over the border should be their next manager.
Whenever the name is brought up, I like to mention Romano Mussolini, Benito's son. He was an excellent jazz pianist.
*great-grandson, you had me confused there for a second
[deleted]
For a hot second I thought this was an active team. Glad I read the article.
Criminal that their home and away shirts are both white, I knew them SS guys were bad eggs
Dissolved 1944?
Considering the one thing the ss had was cool uniforms you would think they could design an actual away kit
Lmaoo it says they had the SS symbol as the clubs crest, thats horrible💀
Also:
> Despite his surname and lineage, Floriani Mussolini stated he has no interest in politics.
This is not an accurate representation of the politics. Roma was forced into being by fascists as part of the merger of 3 other Rome clubs. The fans of these three clubs didn't want this. Lazio was exempt from the merger because high level fascists were fans of the club. 

It's like if all the London clubs were forced to merge into FC London and Sunak's favorite club was Chelsea, so he left Chelsea alone.
And now the Roma fans sing Bella Ciao, while Lazio has a sizeable mass of right wing fans.
> but having right wing ultras today is not associated with any historical reasons.

So why are Lazio's ultras in particular so right-wing? I get that many ultras in Italy are political, and many if not most are right-wing, but there's no denying that Lazio's are at least more vocal or seemingly more extreme
>  if not the biggest sports club in Europe

I don#t think they are close to that...like what

Other big clubs like Bayern and Barcelona are hugte in other games too (Bayern in Basketball and barcelone in Handball for example) while having much, much more members.

Lazio being the biggest in "just" Italy is a stretch already
And they are both closely related to each other

believe it or not the Italian futurists (who were a large group of artists/philosophers/writers/etc) in the 1920s who supported Mussolini and fascism pissed off a large amount of Italian fascists because they argued Italians should stop eating pasta and tomatoes

can't believe they eat heroin deep-fried; so unhealthy smh

Boil them, mash them, put them in a stew. Po-tay-toes.
Yeah honestly think a lot of people are missing how awful this banner is, even some Irish people laughing it off probably don't fully understand the history of the famine

Rangers fans definitely feeding them lines lmao
"Did the fenian bastards take shower today?" is so shit it's actually funny. But maybe that's the aim? I don't know
They definitely emailed the Rangers supporters club for advice 😂
Is there any negative connotation attached to the word "fenian"
they mean orangemen/loyalists 

who are pro union and therefor tied to the church of england and as such not the biggest fan of the pope (people in rome)
Like it goes back to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, wherein Protestants from the Dutch House of Orange overthrew the Catholic and therefore friendly to Scotland James II.
In this case its Rangers fans. Rangers fans would have strong connection to a sectarian organisation called the "Orange Order" who like to march around N.Ireland and to a lesser extent Scotland proclaiming their "Britishness".
Orange order - a Protestant organisation that discriminates against Catholics that mainly exists in Northern Ireland but has a built up following in Scotland and some other areas of the world. He'll be referring to the irony that a big part of their history includes conjuring up fear of papist conspiracies against the state in Ireland and the UK - this includes when Ireland sought after Home Rule in the late 19th century and early 20th century, where certain messages responded with "Rome Rule" to insinuate that Roman Catholics allegiance would be to the Pope before nationhood.

If they had an anti IRA banner then everyone sensible would be forced to agree with a Lazio banner. Seems off brand.
He was probably born in Rome and that's it. Or do you think that being fascist is a requirement?
Because you are born in a certain area or family. The same reason for 99% club allegiances unless your plastic.

Also, you do realize that tha majority of Lazio fans are not Nazis right?
We've always been fair game as far as I see it. You can say what you want about Irish people and nothing will happen.
Ah so that explains Celtic's badge
Everything was founded by Irish immigrants.
Well I'm pretty sure the founders are dead now.
[deleted]
Most but not all. I know a few Rangers fans with an Irish grandparent, but on their mums side, and she had married a Rangers fan.
Lazio ultras really did their homework then. Shitty banner nevertheless.
How does rangers want to be English? We tend to be pro british but English and British aren’t the same thing. Flying a Union flag doesn’t make you any less Scottish and it’s literally flying our own countries flag. Celtic fans tend to fly the foreign Republic of Ireland flag which has nothing to do with Scotland.
Double standards. Celtic fans cant go on a mission to spread hate and antagonise people then scream cry when they get back. I dont like Lazio either but they only did the same kind of thing Celtic fans do
Mongrel carbs.
man a gnocchi in a vodka sauce is just amazing.  Now I'm hungry.

Holding what views? 

The only accusation which is based on real facts is Celtic supporting a terrorist led state
You are right, It should be harsher, it's pure racism.
They were actually founded by a Catholic priest. The club's support originally came from Irish immigrants who moved to Scotland though
Precise reason why lmfao


They just make your bloods boil.

This went over my head. What was inverted winger about Mussolini?
Bloody goal hangers.
Sir I’d like to congratulate you on the best fucking joke I’ve read in a Reddit comment section ever 👏👏
 His second name is Benito, he has both surnames (Floriani Mussolini, not just Mussolini), but his mother, Alessandra Mussolini, has been supporting more progressive views in the past few years compared to earlier periods.

Still, I wouldn't be that proud to give my son that 2nd name and that surname when it's not even necessary
That's not true, his shirt name is "FLORIANI M.", he uses the other surname.
He didn’t change it, his parents decided to give him both surnames
Like that Namibian politician named A\_olf H\_tler
I don’t think he’s that great 👀
Opposite of that actually. His family name is just Floriani but his parents also added his mother surname (Mussolini) to make Floriani Mussolini; which is common in Spain or with royalty/"famous" bloodlines but odd otherwise in Italy.
They wore Hugo Boss kits
Wait til you hear about [Mandela United Football Club ](https://historica.fandom.com/wiki/Mandela_United_FC).
I don’t know if you heard but some shit went down.
After the SS was kicked out of France, there wasn't much reason for them to keep existing, so yeah.
I don't know him personally but know several people who do and afaik, that part is true
Is that like Buffon who has no clue what 88 means and Boia Chi Molla is just a t-shirt he found in the shops and liked the pattern?
Was not aware that the fans were against this. The basis of this was "we want to be our own club" or a dislike for Benito? Asking this because I remember that until the war he was sort of liked by your average [non-jewish] Italian.
That’s not really true. A great part of Roma fans are right wing. *Roma marcia ancora* was one of their statement last year to celebrate the centenary of the *March on Rome*.
>  but there's no denying that Lazio's are at least more vocal or seemingly more extreme

The funny part is that they aren't more extreme. They get more press. The other ultra groups in Italy are just as extreme in their views, and for all the antics Lazio's ultras pull off the other groups do have a larger tendency for deadly violence.  

Lazio has never been liked by the press, some would argue so much so that they have had a whole Scudetto stolen from them (and they don't have a bad case for that claim tbf). The club has always been an easy scapegoat in Italy because of the two clubs in the city, Roma has always had a favorable view in the press despite heavy anti-Semitism and racism as well by their ultras.  

It's not like anyone here is going around digging into local Italian news papers, who may or may not report on what happened accurately. There's been more than one occasion where the press has straight up lied and attributed things to Lazio ultras that were other ultras disguising themselves as Lazio, or things that never actually happened.  

It's somewhat relevant to note that Lazio has many left-wing ultras now as well, and has had them for some time. You just never see any reports on it.
Weirdly I found this out because the potatoes I grew in my garden got little tomatoes on them. Very poisonous don't eat.
Now that makes it just more european. Europe be like: „old me would go to war - killing millions up until Gertrude Van Schimmernick and Carlos de la santissima Trinidad-Tobago marry. But new me is just gonna burn cars of unrelated people“
Inca. Potatoes are native to Peru and Chile. Both, at least in part, former Inca territories.
Eh maybe technically, but in terms of how you use them, they are a vegetable.

Hey, where’d you get those clothes, at the toilet store?
Because he's so in demand?
Celtic were formed to feed poor Irish immigrants in Glasgow, over a million people emigrated from Ireland during the famine with a lot going to Glasgow.

The famine is over why don’t you go home is a saying used to offend people of Irish origin in Scotland.
The famine caused lots of immigration of people away from Ireland in the 1800’s. It’s why there’s so many people of Irish descent in the US, UK and Australia (granted many were sent to Australia by the British authorities as it was a penal colony. 

Glasgow was one of the cities in the UK which the highest number of Irish people settled. And Celtic was initially set up in 1887 as a charity, whose purpose was to raise money for the Irish people in Glasgow who were living in extreme poverty. 

We’re now a few generations down the line but Celtic and its fan base has kept a strong connection to its Irish roots. 

The phrase “the famine is over, why don’t you go home” is used by *some* rangers fans (and bigots in Scotland in general) to tell Celtic fans/people of Irish descent to go back to Ireland.
*Suddenly, /u/Tifoso89 realized the origin of the name.*
Discrimination based on ethnicity has long been accepted as a form of racism and Irish people faced discrimination based on their ethnicity for centuries.
Yes easily I'm of Irish descent and I've been called a potato muncher
Racism doesn't necessarily have to be strictly race-based, at least in common parlance.
With Lazio ultras, it usually is.
Ireland vs. Italy, a tale as old as time on the streets of Boston <3

Hate to break it to you but that story just copied a relatively famous TV show in the UK
Reddit mind thinks if you genuinely care about anything, up to and including genocide, you are a loser and teenage "offensive humor" that always punches down is the funniest thing ever so they will upvote the token who's OK with it.
My great grandmother was born in a workhouse because her parents village literally got wiped out. 

The older I get the more I realise how little time has passed since the famine. Three generations ago is no time at all. The word ‘trauma’ is thrown around too casually these days but so many families are still suffering the after-effects today whether they realise it or not. 

The population being cut from 8.8bn to 4.4bn says it all.
What’s the Pedophile one in referring to? Is it in reference to a specific incident, or is it a general anti-Catholic/sectarian thing borrowed from Rangers?

Because if they’re trying to use the whole anti-Catholic someone needs to tell them they are from ROME
Likely a reference to [THIS](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/celtic-write-fans-reminding-wash-6451792)
Yeah in Northern Ireland and Scotland its used as a slur against Irish Catholics.

Interestingly the Fenians were actually legendary warriors in Irish folklore, so no idea how it ended up becoming a slur tbh
COE? Surely you mean Presbyterian although they are pro union.
Tied to the church of England? Fucking lol.
Scotland was a majority protestant country then, arguably moreso than England even.
If only it was that simple. King William fought under the papal banner of the Grand Alliance against the forces of Louis XIV of which James was an ally.

The irony of Rangers fans and Orangeman celebrating fighting *for* the Pope blows my mind.
They even have a branch in Canada (Toronto I think)
A minority of Rangers fans, certainly not all.

I would think that I would choose Roma over Lazio for this exact reason yes, but I probably have a very naive and biased view of roman football rivalries.
It wasn't just founded by Irish immigrants, it was founded with the very purpose of raising money for the poor Irish population of Glasgow (fun fact: They stole that idea from Hibernian, who also have the Irish harp in their logo). Celtic is deeply intertwined with Ireland, the fanbase is in big parts in support of Irish republicanism and to large parts catholic, although especially in recent years, that isn't neccessarily the case for all fans.
Always annoyed me that their badge is a four leafed clover rather than a shamrock. Proper plastic Paddy that.
They also have a very strong connection with their Irish background, Celtic have still got a large amount of fans who are Irish/of Irish ancestry
They sure are but the Irish connection is still there. And I’ve been to Celtic Park once and there were lots of Irish flags, more than Scottish flags dare I say.
Yeah must have taken a lot of time to find the big green shamrock on their cresr, and thousands of Ireland flags in Celtic Park
It’s a fairly well known rangers chant
Yeah, this is a very specific reference to a rather horrible song that gets sung at Celtic fans/Republicans and the Irish more generally.
What hate calling fascists fascists
Funnily enough celtic did go around molesting their own youth players and have still yet to receive any punishment so your point doesn’t stand.
"Poor effort" typically means that no one is bothered and whatever it is didn't achieve its intended effect

You can call it a lot of things but I don't think "Poor effort" is one of them
lol bringing up the molestation of children, why am I not surprised?
Didn't know Glasgow supported the IDF
OK sweaty

His mother threw the world's biggest shitfit when Celtic fans turned up to a Lazio game with a banner of Benito hanging upside down and the text "Follow Your Leader" which never fails to make me laugh.
Oh I liked my version better :( but yh still a wild decision to rock that name by choice
Wait no that’s too specific.

We’ll call him F Mussolini!
He's still 20, give him a chance.

Make sense. Were he to go into politics it would only be a hellish life no matter what he chose to do.
Before the racial laws of 1938 he was actually pretty popular among Jews. One of the four leaders of the March on Rome was Jewish, Emilio De Bono.

Very well put, and very true. I wish i had the energy to respond to all the misinformed comments on this sub regarding lazio as well as you did lol
> They get more press

Well, honestly for the vast majority of people, they associate Lazio with fascists because of Di Canio's Nazi salute.

Then you have Mihajlovic another idiot. 

Fans will always be idiots but Lazio has this legacy of former players that it never addressed.
Yet you show a banner which is highly offensive to Irish immigrants
Lazio ultras get more press, not because there’s a grand conspiracy to ruin their reputation, but because they actually are more extreme than others. 

Other ultras groups in Italy right-wing and racist, but Lazio’s are quite literally self-described fascists.
You can actually graft tomato plants onto a potato plant and grow potatoes below the soil with tomatoes on top

Referring to a big scandal involving coaches at Celtic youth teams who abused boys in 70s and 80s. 13 suicides are linked to boys who played in the teams in those years.
The Celtic boys club scandal. Despite the name of the club it had no "official" connection to Celtic football club.

However, there was a very close relationship between the two clubs with many Celtic players coming from the boys club (now called st Patrick's sports academy) and there is some evidence that Celtic knew about the abuse of children at the boys club and swept it under the rug while allowing the abusers to keep running the boys club despite knowing about the abuse.

Celtic refused responsibility for the abuse insisting that the clubs were "separate entities". 

Recently, a class action type claim has been submitted and it seems like Celtic  are working to come to a settlement with the former players
Big Jock knew.
Thanks I assumed so, otherwise the comment about not taking a shower seems tame
Not sure about in Glasgow specifically but Presbyterianism and Anglicanism can both be tied to Unionism (although it’d be misleading to characterize the historical Union/republican conflict as purely sectarian, lots of famous Irish rebels were Protestant)
did they have test acts?

He also started out left wing and then inverted, you might say, to the right.
Ah gotcha. Knew he was lynched. Didn’t realise he was upside down.
It also kinda works in another way, since Mussolini started as a socialist but was expelled from most socialist/Marxists groups in Italy.
She didn't know it was gonna come off like that
Aka, the average politician
Scratch a liberal I guess
And when Jim Carrey had a go as well
You'll have to ask mummy
Hugo Boss (the company) didn't become a "fashion" label until the early 60s, when it was not run by Hugo Boss (the man) any more. Before that they just made regular workman's wear. The perceived "stylishness" of Nazi uniforms is unrelated to Hugo Boss, who manufactured some of them but didn't design them.
Yeah Hugo Boss always does it reich
>As a Korean, we had to wait till 45. 

I mean technically so did the Germans. I just think the SS had better things to worry about than football by the end of 1944.
The original Stop The Count
Or he could get elected, like other Mussolini spawn
How about *Scudetto delle pistole*? You robbed us the title in 1925 because of the fascists.
You're about to get downvoted to hell for Mihajlovic. And it's true, dude was a hateful degenerate
Well in similar fashion Celtic regularly runs a banner directly supporting terrorists that killed innocent Italians. All ultras are shit.
> Other ultras groups in Italy right-wing and racist, but Lazio’s are quite literally self-described fascists.

If you think the others aren't also fascists and/or they are non-violent angels compared to Lazio ultras then I have a bridge to sell you. Roma ultras even are quite renowned for their tendency to send people to the hospital. Milan ultras once marched on a city with machetes.

You very clearly are not living in Italy, or versed in Italian culture so I didn't expect that understanding to begin with.  

The Italian media is known for making shit up just to sell papers. Not "oh they twisted the truth". Straight up falsifying things. There have been several recent stories in that past couple years alone where either the newspaper made up something Lazio ultras didn't do, or other ultras dressed up as Lazio supporters and did things to land the club in trouble.
am i in the right subreddit?

This deserves its own sub-reddit.
But it is also definitely a vegetable as are all other fruits.
That's like saying "technically strawberries aren't a fruit, it's the seeds on the service that are the fruit". You're correct in terms of biology but if you stick a tomato in a fruit salad, you'll learn that being technically correct doesn't matter.
I was, in fact, talking about the potato. I interpreted his comment as if there could be a possibility that a potato is a fruit as well. And as I said, if that is true I give up.
Guess I over-analysed the "idk about potatos" part. Thought he was leaving the door open on potatoes being fruits.

It's just bottom barrel standard anti-Irish racism in Scotland and almost absurd-level Ironically in N.I. 

They sing it for their [wee walks.](https://youtu.be/fshpQJYMrME?si=zTBEozNXetrhQZhH)
Not really clever mate.
I mean it's just straight up racism
Ya the origin of the name doesn't make it irish origins, even though it is. I think the name was probaby chosen to show how the two nations have deep history with each other as celtic people. That's purely a guess but I couldn't imagine it's a million miles off the mark.

And ya from quickly googling it there that's exacly why they chose the name. Hibs came first and then they decided on a different name for Celtic FC.
Some are, Gaelic Scots, but Lowland Scots are more Germanic by culture
Celtic are the club of Irish immigrants.
Celtic are Irish in every way, but location.
It’s a reference to how the Irish fled to Glasgow during the famine and saying they should go back home to Ireland now that it’s over. It’s actually kind of impressive how Italians would know that, proper inside racism that
That's the point of the banner, the famine in Ireland is over, go home to Ireland (from Scotland). Its anti immigration from over 100 years ago. It doesn't really land when it's an Italian team saying it though.
I think that’s the point
Cuckoo. Has Andy Samberg, Greg Davies and Helen Baxendale. And Taylor Lautner and Andie MacDowell later on too.

Anyway, the reddit story pretty much ripped off a story line from the show.
> Celtic refused responsibility for the abuse insisting that the clubs were "separate entities". 

At least Rangers *want* to own the history of their "separate entity"
Yes but COE isn't really in Scotland unless you are meaning Episcopalians?
>The significance of the hunger strike was the prisoners' aim of being considered [political prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner) as opposed to criminals

I don't think so brother. I guess i politely agree to disagree.
Celtic have always been complete frauds.
Chelsea fans feeling awfully left out at the moment.
I guess we are reading a different comment section then lol, agree to disagree
What do you want from here, some kind of in depth debate on Israel/Palestine? Its a fucking football forum you melt
Pretty sure she did.
Why are you scratching people
This content has been deleted in protest of how Reddit is ran. I've moved over to the fediverse.
Everything you have said is [very easily refuted](https://fashionelite.com/profile/hugo-boss/). Why do you lie?
I don't see why he would. He gets to be a top level futbol pro, his family has plenty of money if he fails. Why have a mean life? Especially knowing Italians, I'd be scared to get stabbed to death in the streets or my house broken into regularly. I wouldn't bother, and I don't blame him for having that mentality either.
Yeah, I know. Sorry that happened. Fascists then robbed us of the 1927 scudetto.
Did someone hurt your dear Mussolini
Your posts in this thread are a perfect example of gaslighting. Subtle and mischievous
top comment nazi lazio, 2nd highest comment how to grow potatoes/tomatoes. wild thread :D
He's wonderful
It's no tomacco but it's something
I love random Tuesdays on r/soccer
Yeah, well the life support machine called . . . .
The actor Sean Connery said if you want to know a Scotsman’s religion all you have to do is ask him what football club he supports. Rangers had a policy of not signing any player who was a Roman Catholic, regardless of nationality well into the 1980s or 90s.
Ah ok I didn't know that
Good old well thought out racism.
Suspect some Lazio fans have contacted Rangers fans for the ideas...
Wow, I had no idea! Just seen a clip of it. A bit of a shame really. Never saw the show but remember it being on.
> At least Rangers want to own the history of their "separate entity"

[no, they don't](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44126217)
Yeah, forgot we were talking about Scotland for a second tbh
Really weird to link an article that doesn't disagree with anything I said. Perhaps my line about regular workman's wear implies that they didn't make Nazi uniforms, but that was intended to be more about the level of clothing produced (as opposed to high fashion). Here's a line in the article 

>With the country’s restriction on clothing manufacturing, Boss established his business in manufacturing uniform and work wear

In the next line I say that the company manufactured Nazi uniforms. Nothing in your article says that Boss designed the perceived "stylish" uniforms. The SS uniforms were designed by two members of the SS.
>Especially knowing Italians, I'd be scared to get stabbed to death in the streets or my house broken into regularly.

We're not Caracas man
It’s simply funny to me that Lazio tifo will readily admit how shit their ultras are and don’t like them

Yet every Celtic fan I see avoids admitting the obvious support (and sometimes avid celebration) for modern day terrorists and flat out excuses the horrendous actions
Yeah I love it! Pomatoes aren't too bad though
That made me snort/laugh
Wait! Yes! That's what I should have said! ...ho-hooo!!
Let’s try to keep things civil. After all, we’re living in a society here!
You see, you're not dealing with the average racist anymore
if youre going to be racist, at least be a bit creative, is what I always say
He designed the iconic suits that made him famous in the 1940s, not the 1960s, like you claim. He was also a proud Nazi, having joined the party in 1931. Nice whitewashing job, though. /eyeroll
One man's terrorist is anothers freedom fighter. The British army terrorised and decimated Ireland for 100 of years
I could hear that ho-hoooo.
>He designed the iconic suits that made him famous in the 1940s, not the 1960s, like you claim

What do you mean?

Also, I never said he wasn't a Nazi, where did you get the idea that I thought otherwise?

Read this [AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gysdhn/how_did_the_clothing_brand_hugo_boss_manage_to/) comment for more about Hugo Boss

>It's not until the 1960s that it began to produce the kind of suits it's famous for, and the level of prestige it has now seems to date largely from the tenure of the original Hugo's grandsons, who took over in 1972 and got the brand involved with fine Italian fabrics as well as racing sponsorships. By that point, they were generations out from the man who had joined up with the Nazis and operating on a more global scale, with customers who had no idea of the firm's bad history.
LMFAO they literally killed innocent Italian citizens my man, and they purposely show their banner whenever playing Italian clubs. So please justify that shit.

This is ridiculous what you just said and I hope everyone sees exactly what I'm talking about.

Drake has become a laughing stock
From "Meet the Grahams" being one of the best disses I've heard in decades, to "Not Like Us" literally being played at parties and people chanting OVHoe, to even Metro dropping "BBL Drizzy" and Drake not being coined P.Drizzy by people. This beef is looking like it's coming to an end for Drake, how he responds (if at all) decides how this ends. A conversation still needs to be had about the pedophile allegations though. 
Drake is now victim of two top 5 diss tracks
Drake gotta drop the hardest diss in the history of rap in order to come back from this one 💀
Metro Boomin released a diss beat and released it for "civilians" to rap about Drake.

Shit is diabolical.
Kendrick did him like my girl approaches an argument. Brought up some random stuff that bothered her like I didn't take out the trash or something ( Like That ) so I defend myself ( Push Ups ). Then she just doesn't talk to me for weeks. So I try to talk w her again ( TMF ) thinking I got her good but then she launches into her real argument and uses all my words against me ( Euphoria, 616, MtG, NLU ) and I'm left in shambles to consider all my terrible choices that have led to this point.
that was the objective. he implies multiple times he has more ammo and his team said it ends monday. while Drake said friday that FM was the last time he would talk about this
Kendrick really went Back To Back on him. TWICE.
The boy's been the Nickelback of rap for years and now all the real g's are taking him out of the game on some real shit. Rip Drake.
Poutine Puffy had his time in the sun.
Future chillin so hard rn after kicking off the biggest rap beef of the 2020s so far
#RipDrake
My one issue with all of this is that they only point out misogynoir when beefing so they score points in their diss. I wish they’d actually take it seriously, you know? Meg has been calling out Drake for that stuff for a while now. But now that KDot says it everyone is like, yes yes Drake DOES do that. 

Idk man it’s tiring.
If the things that are said about drake actually ARE true, this is a problem beyond what we’ve ever seen in rap. What will come of this? Will it be investigated? Will he continue to deny and try to save his career? What a time to be alive
Damn I was studying for finals, got distracted and now this shitshow is going on. What have I missed? Tracks from Drake, Kendrick, Rick Ross and what else?
I like drake. I like kendrick. This is good for the culture. This is good for hip hop & rap music. I'm loving every bit of it
In the span of a month people said that Kendrick wasn’t battle tested to now he is one of the top three diss artist of all time. 

2Pac, Ice Cube, Kendrick. 

And fr if he bring for the receipts for the daughter it’s a wrap he number 1 of all time.
In hip hop circles, he’s always been a laughing stock. It was only a matter of time before the MS audience figured it out as well
Drake finna retire after this,  well Drake's music was good while it lasted.

Hopefully we get a 30 year anniversary thing in like 2050 something.
I know I’ll get downvoted but Kendrick needs some receipts. One woman has sued him in his 15 years of fame for SA and ended up loosing, and the police clearing him and she had to repay the money. I know about the ‘on stage incident’ and messaging a young actress who said it was never sexual, but the shit Kendrick is alleging is very serious. 

If he’s really some giant predator, get him out of here, but if not, then the internet cheering on Kendrick flinging false sexual allegations and a fake daughter is a pretty fucking lame way to ‘win’ a rap battle
What, IMO, has made Kendrick's disses so hard is the lack of actual anger in his tone. You can hear the malice and hate in his words but you're not distracted by the booming anger. It's next level calculation.
BBL DRIZZY! OZEMPIC DRIZZY! OVHOE!!!!
He’s been a laughing stock, but I thought Family Matters had some good bars with serious allegations and ghostwriters or not, the dude can rap. Kendrick just put out better songs with better beat selection imo
Dude Metro has random dudes on Twitter dropping shit in a contest too.
https://x.com/luvkurby/status/1787053208579219771
wonder if Lil Wayne or one of the ogs will back Drake in this beef, lots of big names will probably have to pick a clear side if this beef keeps picking up
Lol. This isnt gonna hurt Drake at all unless the pedo/sex trafficking stuff is true.
I really wish people would stop using the word Pedo on him - maybe Predator instead
Laughing all the way to the bank.
So I jumped to something in Meet the Grahams I just realized not everyone did. 

When Kendrick was talking to the daughter he was talking about how talented she was "had a gift", and kept describing her though it's supposedly someone who's a secret. I assumed it was someone famous immediately. He wasn't talking about her age when talking about her 11th birthday. 

Eleven= Millie Bobby Brown

That's how I took it anyway.
He always was 😭😭 are you new in hip hop? Rick Ross is fat too, if you missed it
![gif](giphy|xTiTnnm7kR6MczdYEo|downsized)

bro isnt catching no brakes 💀
Drake has always been weird it’s true. He goes after women who have had work done, talked to young artist before they were 18, messaged girls in relationships brags about taking peoples girls. Weirder is he gave a bbl doctor in Houston an OVO themed scrub set, for “making women beautiful” which falls in line with Kendrick’s verse of women that fuck with him consider themselves real women
I'm not taking the pedophile allegations any more seriously then I have all these years. But this is opening up a good opportunity for anyone who might've been a victim to come forward.
If I had a nickel for every time a rapper made a diss track exposing Drake for having an illegitimate child, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
He was always a laughing stock
Could Drake sue for defamation if all of these accusations aren’t true?
In one year Drake will still be topping charts and reference these disses with jokes in a top charting song.
He was the best selling rap artist in 2023. Clearly has tons of fans.
According to his net worth Drake makes approximately $10 every second. I’m sure he’s absolutely fine with everything.
No Vaseline is the goat distrack
Has become? Has always been
He already was a laughing stock
We can agree to disagree on the “has become”
Hit ‘em up, Either, No Vaseline, kill shot, Piggy Bank.

Honorable mention Meet The Grahams
This sub has become a Kdot circlejerk, holy shit 🙄
sorry but when has Drake not been a joke? mfer *Aubrey* is from the richest neighborhood in Toronto with a silver spoon up his ass from day 1. he was literally a child star; he could have picked any career he wanted and would have been set up for success, no questions asked.

if you’ve ever lived in TO you know all his fans are spoiled asset managers who do shitty coke in overpriced restaurants and can’t shut up about “hustle mindset”.

he was always a rapper for people who don’t like rap, and who can’t go to any hood from NY to LA without looking over their shoulders in white-fuelled fear.

the idea he could ever hope to go toe-to-toe with a real artist, from Compton of all places, and come out on top is fucking laughable.

fuck Drake; fuck OV-HOES.
Back to Back to Back
He can't respond with a rap song anymore.

He either has to fight, make a live statement or issue a press release.

There is no more battle rapping for him.
All my buddies who were drake haters told me they were genuinely impressed about how Drake handled himself in this battle. They still think Kendrick won but Drake rose in their esteem so 🤷‍♂️
This aged well.
Wait I thought Drake won? That's the consensus over in r/Drizzy anyway...
Drake always was a 🤡
True I'm not sure how tho. Family matters was a great song. Kendrick's disses cut way deeper but damn if this wasn't a fun battle
The Kendrick D riders in here are hilarious.

Taking what the man says as gospel because he posed with a crown of thorns.
Kendrick aint said nun new saying the same shit in his diss
How is meet the Grahams one of the best diss tracks when he got baited into a false rumor??? Drake has no daughter lol
There won’t ever be a conversation about the pedophile allegations bc it’s probably not true. Just enjoy the entertainment aspect of it.
I haven’t heard family matters yet so listening now but i’m almost socially embarrassed to have drake playing on my phone, went behind the building. kendrick ended him imo the collective social attitude towards him has shifted a lot this week
When everyone gets off Kendrick's balls, make sure y'all zip his pants up. Jfc I'm not even a Kendrick hater but this all this shit is high key mid
[removed]
Some people *been* laughing
wait wtf is bbl drizzy. I kinda live under a rock when did that drop lol
Good, he was always a hump.
Kid shit
Drake has always been a joke.
Drake has been a laughing stock for over a decade, this week didn't move the needle.
He’s been a laughing stock for a long time, this is all just confirmation bias piling on
Nobody gon have a conversation about the pedo shit. Sad reality is that shit is way to common for anything to come out of it. We all need more Jesus
It's music for shopping.
I drove by an elementary school this morning. 


Made sure to say No Drizzy.

50 cent needs to get in on this stock
Drake been a donkey.
That’s what you internet fools think
He was already a laughing stock
It annoys me that so many people are more concerned with making jokes and laughing than worrying about the sex trafficking ring allegations
Drake is like a 90s boy band for boys
Drake is gonna have to start wearing g pink and making emo now
Drake brought this on himself I fear
I genuinely didn’t think Meet The Grahams was good lol

fabrication and weak disses. The beat was great but the use of it was mediocre. Euphoria was great though
I don’t know R. Kelly lasted awhile…..
Is there a Spotify playlist of all the songs in order? Keep finding random dudes rapping over the beats
yall pretty much been hating on drake since 2009. per usual, itll all pass over then hell be right back on top...and yall will be mad again. never ending cycle.
I wonder if this shit gonna actually affect drake long term with deals and album sales
You mean that wheelchair kid from the Canadian teen mellow drama? *Shock*
so im out of the loop, wtf is going on?
“I’ve heard in decades” as if you’re not 15 🤣

Metro Boomin is **DESTROYING** Drake.
Guess he'll have to stay in his safe space of high school girl's basketball
I don’t listen to either of these guys. Decided to dive in and see what the hype is. So disappointed. I despise drake and have routinely shitted on him for various reasons but after finally hearing Kendrick Lamar I’m reassured we need better hip hop representatives. I suppose as far as insults (having now heard the context) Kendrick wins. But I think my view of hip hop is further destroyed now. Half the tracks sound like I should me lighting lavender scented candles and making out with a chick.
[removed]
Drake 🥩 riders in shambles
Fuckin based
Kendrick got Drake to finally rap too
….on Reddit. You guys are in a bubble
Yea drizzy needs some milk right about now
I want to hear it from Drake fans
Kenny won on Reddit, if this website was like real life Bernie Sanders would be president
Drizzy needs to come back with something we’ve never heard in the history of rap like MTGs or he’s done. Not saying he’ll disappear, but his image will be forever damaged.
Always has been a laughing stock lol no one ever took him serious.
I think it's comical everyone thinks Drake is the liar, and Kendrick is telling the truth. Why?
Spoiled milk post! Shut up and enjoy the music!
That sound bite of DMX RIP 🕊️🕊️ is not helping either X was the epitome of what a real NY street dude is and was more than vindicated in real life if he says he don’t like you than you really must stink 😂😂😂 Kenny wins
Has become? Always has been!
He just dropped
I mean he won't lose any fans .  The number of Drake stans is crazy.  He shares a lot with Ariana Grande so there's an endless supply.
Tf you mean all tracks are fire 🔥 I
He dropped just now claiming it was bait… what yall think?
Isaiah 23:1....Pusha T goes hard aftoo
But these diss tracks are filled with lies
[removed]
Become?
Recency bias, people are gonna keep flip flopping about until it’s done
This jockin is craaaaazy. 
You guzzlers want the best to lose so badly lmao. It's not happening bitches
Can someone link me up to WTF is going on with this? I listen to Kendrick Lamar. I love his work. I don't listen to or follow Drake. Just never really moved the needle for me. I don't really follow the news or celebrity feuds, but I'd love to get a back story before listening to the Kendrick diss track so I have some context going into it.
Honestly, I’m dying to know what the fabled “red button” really is lol

It’s all they talk about in r/Drizzy when they’re not glazing, but you’d think that at this point it’d be “pushed” … if it exists
I think he retreats into his pedo mansion now like Hearst. And in forty years, K Dot releases his first movie: “Rosebud.”
Wasn't he always a joke? We were making "Drake the type" memes ten years ago
Uh... technically, wasn't he already?

I’m ready to get all your hatred. What else has Kendrick said apart from lies and unfounded allegations??? I mean he also said that the people who Drake gave money to hated him since the beginning. But isn’t that a diss on these people and not on Drake???
I feel like calling MtG a diss track is putting it too lightly. Kendrick wants to end man's career
I don't care for Drake anyway.
To top it all off, Drake is acting like he won. “We planned it for weeks.” IF YOU WON THIS BIG HOW ARE YOU NOT BRAGGING? WHERE IS YOUR “NOT LIKE US”?

Are you going to “take the high road” like you did with Pusha? You gonna do an interview and then say you had all this shit, but you were told to not release it?

Why are you not stopping all this discourse with a crumb of evidence?

Why are you getting all your underage interactions to come out and defend you…. AFTER the internet laughs at your diss track (after we forgot the other one in about 30 minutes)
![gif](giphy|dJocIXW7hOQYNNY199)

Kendrick dropping songs giving Drake Ls
*Bro I ain’t no Epstein*. Uh, who mentioned Epstein?
Notice in that video when he says I can’t go to jail, he says I can’t go to jail YET.
He's fine lol.
Whenever I'm feeling down I'm going to come read the comments here to cheer myself up.
Yes, but it's all temporary.  Good music makes everyone forget everything. Drake better drop the best music of his career going forward.
I'm a neutral but Meet the Grahams was not it tbh. Family Matters, Not Like us, Euphoria were the good ones
The craziest part is Metro Boomin crowd sourcing a beat. And the beat is 🔥
It was like a fight between someone who plays a fighter on TV vs an actual fighter.
He DID respond and it was “I’m to famous to be a pedophile and you were molested as a child” which is about the WORST way to respond lol
Finally. Couldn’t have happened to a cornier grease ball. Aubrey’s always been a gimmick.
JCole out in the woods on a tree stump in the lotus position 🧘
Drake has always been a pop star masquerading as a hip-hop MC. 


He had no business engaging in a battle with Pusha T or Kendrick Lamar who are both worlds better than him as lyricists.
*In a row*, that's important. Whoever he beefs with next is going to throw out some "strike 3" comments and it's going to sting, even if it's the weakest rapper alive.
Just curious.... what's your top 5
Either hit em up and kill shot are great respectively
Lift yourself by Kanye is still my fav sadly
If Truth by Gucci isn’t on there the entire list is invalid
And a damn diss beat too.

Saw someone call the BBL Drizzy beat a "disstrumental"
[removed]
What is the second?
Every Drake diss is top 5
I say 3 lol
He's not capable of it, not with all the ghost-writers money can buy, because what Kendrick says is true, and Drake only has weak slanders and empty boasting.
too bad hes drake
If he was capable of that he would’ve done it five years ago against pusha T. All Drake had to do was not be an actor all these years pretending to be a hardened rapper. He could’ve just acknowledged who he was and stayed in his lane and made millions. He’s still made millions but he’s gotten embarrassed multiple times in the process now.
narrator: he did not
They actually putting some heat on the beat too lmao
I felt that bro. Try reminisce on a story you know involved her.. “must have been your other girlfriend”

Bruh.
My girl mad but my ps5 up 💯
Should’ve just took out the trash like ol homeboy ashy Larry
You are raising a manipulator.
Man you might have to accept that you'll be in the cuck chair in the hotel room.
Sounds like a you problem.
Drake definitely came with through thinking he could gas light himself out of it.
I knew Kendrick could destroy Drake but I never imagined him actually doing it, this was so surgically done. I go into r/drizzy to see what the sentiment is and I’ve never seen a subreddit simultaneously so delusional and depressed. This whole thing is wild
Did he say that it was the last time explicitly or was that just based on the line about going on vacation?
Where did Drake say FM was his last response, just having some trouble finding it
Where did Drake mention the FM would be the last he’d talk about it?
One is a dope club banger, the other is a deadly-serious message to Drake's whole family about what a scumbag he is. Hell of a one-two punch.
Back to Back and I like that record, I'mma get back to that, for the record
Nah bro, Nickelback wasn’t texting litte girls.
No, nickelback is ironically cool now.  They were overplayed, but they still slap because their brand doesnt SUCK
All the real Gs like Rick Ross and Metro? Drake is a cornball but acting like these dudes are any realer than him is delusional. All these dudes charlatans lol
All the real G’s 🤓
Nickelback of rap 😂 You guys are absolute geeks. Reddit on fellow sir!
Drake has been making music for almost a decade and a half. He survived the Pusha T beef and he'll survive this beef. Reddit and Twitter aren't real places. Drake will be fine.
Nickelback has more talent than Drake because they can play instruments lmfao. Chad Kruger might be an asshole but he's not associating with minors
Makes Nickelback look good honestly
😂😂😂😂
(Rest in Piss) Drake
I think a lot of us rap fans have known for awhile that Drake is up to some shady shit. It just feels good to have someone with power to confirm it, even if he doesn’t have enough evidence to put him in jail. It’s a similar thing with Diddy; lots of people knew but no one could do anything about it because the guy was so powerful, so why risk their careers over nothing changing?
It's because the more casual fans don't ever see what Meg has to say. But when Kendrick chimes in at this level it reaches enough eyes and ears to the point that it becomes unavoidable. My aunt asked me about the beef today and she hasn't listened to Hip-Hop since the Beastie Boys released Licensed to Ill. It's just a different level of artist bringing it up to an elevated level which is unfortunate but that's what it takes sometimes.
Going back to the Future verse on Like That is like 😬😬😬
Kenderick made sure to get everyone listening so he can drop receipts appropriately. He's going to make sure that you can't miss it, you can't misunderstand and that it won't be forgotten
Maybe because Kdot seems like a more serious artist because he doesn’t talk about poppin his pussy?
No one in Hip Hop has a leg to stand on when it comes to misogyny. Kendrick is hailed as the messiah, Cole supposed to be super conscious and allat, and yet they both only want to address that topic when it suits their agenda. Look at how Kendrick supported R. Kelly, how J Cole lashed out at Noname. Everyone’s quick to pile onto Drake now even though as you said Meg and plenty others were already calling it out. And if the Kendrick abuse allegations are true to then Drake’s just dragging him further into the mud too
You do realize if kendrick dropped a random song talking about this no one would listen. This beef has so many more eyes on it, including casual drake fans
It's not something we've never seen before, Diddy just fled the country because of it. This shit's been brought up before, many times. This is just the first time it's at the middle of a major mainstream beef.
If everything Kendrick said is true, and the feds really do a sweep of drake's estate, Kendrick really an instrument of god or something idk bro
That’s the thing, it’s all just words right now but everyone is saying RIP Drake and taking it as a fact. There’s a lot of hate behind the judgement of this feud. 

Also, let’s just recognize that if all of this is true and all of these guys kept it quiet they’re pieces of shit too.
I mean the chances of drake also having a hidden 11 year old daughter are probably low
MULTIPLE tracks from Kendrick in the space of 24 hours.. its wild

If what Kendrick is saying about Drake is true would you still play his music? I do agree this is good for the culture but I’m really just referring to bringing up how artists exploit and traffic young women. Regardless if Drake himself does it that is certainly the case in this industry.
Regardless of anyone's feelings on Eminem or his albums, it would be really hard to say he's not in the top 3 diss artists. His diss tracks used to be absolutely *vile.*

>Slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her.  
>She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya

Another of my favorites:

>Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk about how I nutted early,  
>'Cause I ejaculated prematurely  
>and bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling,  
>and said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling?  
>Or maybe you do,  
>but if I'm embarrassin' me, I'm embarrassin' you  
>and don't you dare say it isn't true
Missing nas
Everyone's forgotten about killshot for some reason.  Easily one of the top 5 diss tracks of all time
Yeah if Kenny telling the truth he protected a pedo by not spilling the beans over 15 years in the industry with dude, and he's snitching

If Kenny didn't tell the truth he's a liar and his career would be over. So I hope he has receipts but either way, he's a snitch even if it IS a pedo and worse he waited until he could personally benefit from exposing the pedo meaning he was content to let a pedo continue assaulting children as long as it didnt effect his bottom line.

He's a scumbag either way and been exposed as JUST AS MUCH OF AN INDUSTRY GUY as Drake.

Both dudes assassinated their own characters by particpating though.
Eh he posted up with an 18 year old he known and kept around since 15. All i know is I wouldn’t want my daughter around him 🤡
Kendrick literally used the word predator in Not Like Us.
All i know is I wouldn’t want my daughter around that pervert
Why
Why? If Kendrick literally thinks or even worse knows he is, he should call him as he sees him.
THATS your issue here ?!
Ahhhh haaaaa
the money, power, respect
The last one is better
Say, it's a lot of goofies with a check
Bro the daughter was a hoax get over it.
You miss the point. His point was obvious that people are now laughing at him while they bump their head to a song about him being a pedo. That is new 😭😭😭
Rick Ross just fell to his knees in wingstop
Slurp him up already sheesh
He will be fine financially but do not be so naive as to think he's fine. 

This beef has done DAMAGE.
Piggy bank was ehh
Ain't the biggest Drake fan too but am generally impressed as well. The type of intensity I'd want out of Drake songs and the back and forth with K dot was awesome
[deleted]
Not a fun battle, it's a gun battle

Drake beef hasn't been fun ever since the son tattle
Its not like there isn’t video proof and news reportings of Drake being an all around creep. And Kendrick doesn’t have a reputation for making stuff up
These nerds talk like Kendrick is their best friend
Are people not doing the same with drake!
Word 🤣🤣
Yeah and Drake has never lied about not having hidden children either, it’s fucked up
Except you can Google Drake being a pedo at his own shows
Now the move to end a beef is to label your adversary as a pedo. Doesn't matter if it's true or not he's gotta deal with backlash and people WILL think it's true regardless.
Is it not messed up tho?
Your grammar and word choice is so high key mid its not unusual you wouldn't understand
If the accusations aren’t false, Meet the Grahams is the greatest diss track of all time. Cope

Imagine Drake crashes out and disses Cole for leaving his side
r/whatwouldjcoledo
Jcole need to drop a treaty track to stop all this madness
J Cole set him up and now there is a top 2
After he rode his bike to go there
Ive never understood J cole's hype.
Man is the real Genuis
Can we be real for a minute 

Anyone else think Kendrick probably reached out to Cole and asked him to step aside?
Straight facts .
It's wild that him being like a brazen pedophile that's "involved" in supporting high school girl's basketball just gets totally ignored.
He has other writers credited on his disses lmao only writer credited on Kendrick’s is kendrick.
Agreed. He also had no business acting like a thug when he used to play a wheelchair kid on Degrassi
He's an entertainer not a rapper.
The moment Drake stopped doing pop music he got worse as an artist.
True but ultimately this wont affect him moving forward. They both have two totally different, loyal and blind fan bases 
 moaning over easy listening “star” !
If I had to guess it’s probably some mix of ether, hit em up, no Vaseline, story of adidon and meet the grahams
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan
Don't answer yet, Kendrick's dropping 5 more.
No Vaseline , story of adidon , hit em up , real muthafucking g's and meet the grahams
“We’re Famous” and “Linda Tripp” come to mind
Kill shot might deserve to be on the list strictly for the fact that it sent MGK into a whole different genre

Kenny channeled his inner hungry gf fr 🤣
My man
😂😂😂
Naw it always ends like We Cry Together
Babe?
Sounds like it was a surgical...summer? Spring?
That whole subreddit looks like the aftermath of a hurricane. They are shook
Drake doesn't even deny being a pedophile. Anyone still acting like a fan of his needs their head examined, or their texts reviewed for interactions with middle-schoolers.
Went to QAnon levels of delusion FAST
Don't forget bots are extremely prevalent and not expensive and drake has a lot of money. Same with Kendrick, but my personal bias doesn't let me honestly imagine kendrick paying for bots. Surely Drake has a PR team, and surely it is common practice for these people to influence opinion through online discussion like reddit posts.
You're mistake was listening to Drake fans, they're all morons.
Delusional? How so?
At the end of the song before he goes on vacation
He said he's going in vacation now and basically says that "Ya Dead" which is obviously cap lol. He thought "Family Matters" was gonna be the knockout blow but in reality it was just the blow that dug his own grave.
Club banger? 💀
This is what people are missing. 

If Michael Jackson, who was larger globally, got deflated. Drake easily can too. 

Prince outlived Mike Jack
Nickelback irl are some good dudes, not a fair comparison at all
The beef is a bunch of old millionaires yapping about bullshit

I'm ready for the next generation to takeover rap like they just took over the NBA. 

These dudes old and out of ideas.
You know, white 17 year olds with $8K streaming setups bought by their parents.
He's actually the tragically hip of rap and we'll accept no slander towards the hip.
Multiple people in my life who don’t care about hip-hop are talking about it because they’ve seen clips and reactions on TikTok. I think this shit is mainstream in a way that the Pusha T beef wasn’t.
He will mainstream wise but you know he cares about the culture and if the game says he got bodied, that will eat at him
Yeah what's with all these delusional weirdos thinking one of the biggest artists ever is just gonna die
All of us got our finger so far from the culture typing on reddit but some people here really acting like they do things
People overestimated what they called "career ending". I mean, is there any rapper got their career ended directly because of a beef?  

People keep saying Ja Rule, Benzino or MGK. Iirc, Ja Rule was already very weak after years beefing with 50 Cent and the FBI raid. Benzino didn't even have a career as a rapper to begin with. MGK always has pop-punk influence in him and I think he would switch to that genre no matter what. 

Unless there were an investigation and Drake got convicted, he would be fine.
He needs to be played in the club to stay relevant, and DJs are getting booed for playing his tracks right now. This is poison to his whole brand and image. It's not like he'll stop being famous tomorrow, but this is really really bad for him.
Right, people are so blinded with hate right now thinking this is going to stop Drake. If he announced a tour tomorrow that shit would be sold out. Drake and Kendrick's status are already cemented. If you liked Drake before you still like him today and the same for Kendrick.

*rot in piss
Most people I know have been calling Drake a creep and pedo for like almost 10 years now
Drake is literally trying to turn into Diddy
[removed]
YUP. And it’s all of them. Pointing out misogynoir only when it benefits you to score points is trash.
[deleted]
it's funny that the snitching code also covers pedophiles
But Kendrick can’t really say- you slept with this person when she was 15, unless that person gives consent, which seems unlikely that someone is going to want their experience of  sexual assault to be on the most streamed song of the week. 

But Coming forward as a survivor of one the biggest pop stars in the world is a lot bigger deal than a rap beef that viral this week.
Yea I’m here for the airing out but if these men really have know for years-maybe over a decade about his pedo tendencies and are just now calling him out…they’re just as bad as him IMO
So if they investigate Drake and find no bad things happen, does Drake win the beef? Are we gonna go back in time and look at Kendrick like a big liar if that happens?

Cause yall took Kenny at his word and called Drake a liar based on a few songs lol
We can't be 100% sure whether that's true or not though
Airing that out is absolutely a good thing, it needs to be confronted
That's not the good part. The MUSIC, the beef, the diss tracks. The actual Hip Hop is good... the stories within the songs is not what makes it real rap. The real rap makes it real rap

It'd have to be some diddy, r kelly shit for me to stop listening to drake. I don't think that's the case tho. I think its off putting that drake, a 37 year old, likes young girls, but I'm not sure if he's fucking 14 year Olds. 

But we'll see.
The reason Em doesn’t come up is because he’s never really battled any top tier MCs or legends (probably because they actually respect him).
Bro most people sleep on Em because of a lack of melanin.
A pedophile is equivalent to someone who exposed a pedophile; yeah sure bro
That wasn’t true either. It’s a daughter of someone famous who asked to take a picture with him backstage at a Rihanna concert. The dinner date was debunked, she wasn’t in the same state and it was someone else he was with.

He never ‘kept her around’, went on a date or anything like that with her. Just took a selfie with her after she asked for a photo

https://amp.tmz.com/2018/09/14/drake-no-date-model-bella-harris/

https://www.etonline.com/drake-is-not-dating-18-year-old-model-bella-harris-despite-reports-109707

The only two non debunked things he’s done that are questionable is kissing the 17 year old on stage as a 23 year old, and texting MBB which she is adamant was never romantic or sexual in nature. Everything else that people say is ‘proof’ is just baseless internet gossip
Depends how you define the words tbh, people use them interchangeably a lot these days but they can be different things
NGL I wouldn't complain being a goofy with a check lmao
Just stating facts
It was good, just so many good disses it would be in tier 2. Back down is tier 1 and better imo. Plus that diss with Busta and Eminem.
1y account too
Being a creep and having a sexual trafficking ring are on two sides of the creep spectrum lmfao
Except drakes supposed daughter? Both these guys are just spewing as much shit as possible and hoping something sticks.
He literally writes stories and raps them for a living.
I mean Drake doesn’t have a reputation either. Does that mean Kendrick is in fact a woman beater or do we have the perfect example of a heavy bias?
Lololol for reeeeeeeal. They’re hipsters that think a multimillionaire Grammy award winning critic’s darling is a thug. Drake and Kendrick both are full of shit. Some of the tracks have been fun at least
100% the Stan's are licking taint on both sides it's pathetic honestly
Drakes alt account confirmed. Bro log off
☝🏽🤓

My apologies for not speaking proper, sir. 

Once the followers and fans of mister Kendrick Lamar remove themselves from his genitals, may you please zip back his trousers? For he is exposed and being ridden upon as if he was a noble steed. Aforementioned in my past tense, the quality of his musical ability is mediocre. This ongoing dispute between Mr.Lamar & Mr.Graham is quite stale if I may add, for they have nothing to offer to a hip-hop enjoyer, such as myself.
And if they are then what

Not really as much as not listening to Drake's songs past If You're Reading This and Hotline Bling (not too rap too, but def a bop). Can't really get into Drake's vibe after that. The beat/flow switches is cool but just not my style lyrically anymore. Its just a jab that Drake primarily does pop songs.

His lines and delivery in the diss tracks are finally what I'm looking for from him. The voice changer song tho initial felt too sketchy or gimmicky for me. I think I'd prefer if that had Drake's own voice but just imitating pac or snoop for a few lines.
He’d be admitting to being a pedophile.  His hands are tied, he has to prove he’s not one.
Didn't he already on Family Matters?
One of the best subreddits I have seen! 😅
Subbed
There could only be ONE ☝🏼
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Damn, I had to look this one up and it’s true. I Guess he befriended some of the girls on the team. WTF!
Where ?
He got exposed as a weak lyricist.


You never want to battle against lyricists when you are not one.
I think you are correct but he will lose more respect of real hip-hop heads.


The people that like his hybrid pop hip-hop music will still like him because they never cared about lyrics and real hip-hop to begin with.
B-Rabbits finale against Papa Doc?
Bomb First? The Warning? Ether?
Kick down the door
Some forget “life on the Line” and “back down”. Ja was  putting out hit after hit at the time, then 50 just bodied his whole career with his label.
How are you not going to mention Dollaz and Sense? That’s like number 2 or 3 most vicious diss record of all time. Calling out names too. Dre Day. Cmon man.
I’d put Real Muthaphukkin Gs in there too.
Mickey!
Because I spit hot fire!
At first I wasn’t that impressed but he’s got some really clever lines
This is a legitimate point though. For all of kendricks impressive skills he actually brought us no new info about drake and i suspect none of the disses will have any actual repercussions for Drake. Unlike kill shot which actually messed up MGKs career and story of addition that also caused drake real world problems.
![gif](giphy|1qjZV8pMLOkc2N70Pf)
At least they’re coming around to reality to a degree
Because the cat they worship is a half way crook
to this day michael jackson fans still deny that the dude who threw mock weddings with teen boys was a pedo
I keep popping over there to get a good laugh
What do you imagine he meant? In what way might they be delusional right now, really ask yourself that question, and then come back and see if you need clarification.
Imagine Drake on a boat somewhere outside of cell service thinking he won meanwhile not realizing he lost 45 minutes after his track dropped
> Prince outlived Mike Jack 

That line hits much harder now tbh. He wasn’t referring to Drake being pop like Mike Jack. He was referring to Neverland Mike Jack. Daaaaamn.
BAHM
Then don't listen and watch, whatever makes you happy. :)
Ironic considering those are the people Drake been staying close to the biggest streamers for some months and even talking about them in songs.
Drake nothing close to the tragically hip
Yeah, fr. Most people that aren't into hip hop don't know Pusha.

Everybody knows Kendrick. This is different.

Btw, no disrespect to Pusha, I think he's dope. He just doesn't have the star status that Kenny does.
The Pusha shit was extremely mainstream, I feel like this is revisionist history. Drake was arguably bigger than he is now when he got exposed.
That’s pretty much me,  I barely know any hip hop.  I’ve been following this shit non stop though,  I’m now a huge Kendrick fan and have been listening to all his shit.
Yeah, I'm not on TikTok so I don't know that side. 

You are right this is bigger than the Pusha beef. The thing is tho Drake keeps making catchy music. Sure people might like Kendrick more after this but if the rest of the crowd is feeling a Drake song it doesn't matter. Are you just gonna sit that song out when the whole club is dancing? 

The only way this beef kills Drake is if he stops making catchy music. He could release his worst album ever 2 months from now but if one song makes the rounds on TikTok it doesn't matter.
Bingo. Even the Meek one wasn’t. This is larger 

and the Push shit got stepped on cuz I’m sure he was gonna tap into this or something else more shocking. 

And no Twitter and Reddit isn’t real. The streets are. And they’re doing a WHOOOOOLEEE lot of talking
Push's beef definitely went mainstream, what's more mainstream than getting a deal with Adidas cancelled and being credited with revealing a secret child of one of the biggest pop stars in the world?

That said...the fallout from this beef is going to label Drake as a chomo or at least a question mark in the eyes of the mainstream for sure no matter what happens, especially considering that a lot of his underage fans are going to have to beg their parents for ticket money and that's the takeaway their parents are going to have from it.

It might fuck with his money even more.

Tin foil hat time: I think Push might've dropped some of this in Kendrick's ear, I think he had a lot of it ready to go. 

I also think Kendrick's core support network and crew is a lot tighter and more self contained than Push's and whatever was happening in the background between Pusha T, Drake, and J Prince led to pressure on Push's people for him to fall back in a way they can't or won't replicate with Kendrick.
You are delusional if you think Drake is gonna fall off the map because of this. Like straight up stupid lol

The general public doesn’t give a shit. Even most people who are tuned into this saga don’t give that much of a shit

Get a grip
The culture is fake man. 

Kendrick talking about deadbeat dad but working with future. 

Talking about sex offender but working with Kodak. 

It’s all jockeying and positioning for top spot and eyes/attention.

Drake has played the game perfectly, and now Kendrick is. There is no culture and nobody cares about you.
Keep telling yourself that
MGK switched genres and made Tickets To My Downfall which went platinum. His first album to ever do it. 

So yeah you are right. People overestimate career-ending.

Just goes to show how pissed off K-Dot is.

I mean you can point that the Social Media Age plays a big factor, but still.
Not for me it doesn't.
We all knew it before these fucking songs you realize that don’t you
He made out with a girl on stage after confirming she was underage. He's a pedophile and we always knew that, people just conveniently forgot until now.
There is proof of Drake doing that shit in the past though, so is it really a stretch to think he's been doing it recently?
Drake himself posted a picture of him dating an 18 year old that he met when she was 15....
The fact that this is considered battle rap is a disrespect to battle rap in general. 

Eminem actually Freestyle Battled people, probably for like a 100 dollar grand prize and some radio slot. 

Now these child actors are making diss records from their Mansions on a remote island somewhere. Shit is wild how time works.
Why did he rent out a whole restaurant for their single date
What is questionable about a 23 year old man kissing a 17 year old fan on the lips on stage? It's already fucking weird some people defending Drake keep mentioning his age at the time.


Shits fucking clear as day and you're the one actually refusing to look. 
What's wrong with having a 1 yr old account?
a google search will show you Drake has more than a reputation
Ur ghey
Bro you Kendrick fanatics are more biased than swifties and beliebers
He is already on video kissing a 17 year old girl at a show, joking about going to jail, and then immediately talks about how good of an ass she had. Also there is the whole Millie Bobby Brown relationship.
I'm sure his intentions with 15 year old athletes are totally innocent, and that he's just a misunderstood Canadian TV star. 

Kendrick Lamar didn't just utterly embarrass him in historically brilliant fashion.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_Ups_(song)

Push ups has other writers credited, family matters I guess not

Still on all Kendrick’s disses the only writer is him.
You shouldn’t show up to a battle of wits unarmed
I wrote ether
I was thinking of the warning by Biggie when I first saw that thinking "Whose that aimed at? The 2 random guys who rob him" lol
Bro how do people forget about the warning lol. 

That's my top ever. Using Mariahs voice recorded in his own studio is next level savagery.

I was hoping Mariah would escalate because nobody in their right mind thinks em was bluffing about having more on her.
The Warning has no business being such a great diss track. Against Mariah Carey of all people too.
Actually a fucking colossal omission lmao, quik’s beats on that album man
The ones I can remember that hit for me were “I’d rather be 80yr old me than 20 yr old you” “even if I were 3 foot 11 you’d still look up to me” “as long as I’m shady you’re gonna have to live in my shadow” “how can him and I battle? He’ll have to fuck Kim in my flannel”

Addresses everything MGK said in like 10 seconds and spends the rest of it clowning him lol
Tbf, em has a lot of really good diss tracks, from halies revenge, bully, the sauce, nail in the coffin, go to sleep, his feature on I'll hurt ya with busta, killshot, the warning he done against mariah carey, quitter, canibitch, bump heads etc.
His whitey ford disses were pretty great too
I think you’re underestimating the potential real world repercussions of Kenny’s recent disses. Even if they’re false, Drake’s gonna be playing catch up for a long time dealing with such public allegations. Folks have always been saying it, but not at this high-profile. It also doesn’t need to present new info (Killshot didn’t) as disses historically just cleverly dismantle someone.
It’s so much worse now.
Agree. It's some heinous shit.
But guys you don’t get it Drake is playing 4 d chess, he actually WANTS TO BE SEEN AS A PEDOPHILE
That would have been a lot better than what he’s done since then
Another thing that I think really plays into this whole thing is Kendrick’s speed. I mean, was it 45 minutes? 2 hours? He didn’t even give Drake a second to fucking breathe!
We won’t see him for 40 years. Then he’ll turn up on an island in the pacific, and then it’ll be like those Japanese soldiers from ww2 who never knew the war ended, and people will be airdropping newspapers to try and convince him what happened. 

But like those soldiers thought those newspapers were just carefully crafted American propaganda at first, Drake will think it’s just a fake newspaper Kendrick had made to hate on him. Hell also be very confused we’re still using newspapers.
Genius wouldn't let me annotate this when I tried because it wraps it up into a bigger section, but I think this is also way more layered than it appears to be *in addition* to what you just said:

Kendrick is also calling himself a prince, the heir to the throne, tying in to the big 3 theme. 

And as a prince he's surviving a "mic jack"; stealing a rapper's mic (voice) is basically what an assassination attempt is to a prince.

Assassinations are attempts to kill someone by stealth, much like Drake was metaphorically doing on his sneak disses in order to take Kendrick's place as heir apparent and coming full circle back to the mic jacking. 

It also works because jacking is theft by force, in other words he's also saying Drake trying to take what isn't actually his by "choosing violence", he does too and he'll survive the attempt.

Of course I could just be stretching but his choice of saying 'Mike Jack" and dropping the "-son" always stood out to me more than just trying to fit it into the flow.
It’s a good point my comment was more towards the perception of most streamers stanning for Kendrick hard. Rightfully so since they’re more into lyrics and wordplay wherein Kendrick absolutely dunks on Drizzy.
Lol what I find so funny about this is that it's the opposite. Like EVERYONE knows Clipse. My white friends 75 year old dad 10 years ago knew Clipse. You would be seriously surprised how little the gen population knows about Kendrick Lamar or any of his music. It is actually a shame tbh. He's very popular on Reddit and he trends like crazy every few years, but very rarely have I had a conversation with a friend who was casually into rap who could even make it through a Kendrick song.
I agree on the star status, as a long time Pusha T/Clipse fan.

I don't agree that it matters as long as one of the names involved is Drake though. He's one of the biggest pop stars in the world. As long as it's impossible for him to ignore without responding or just throwing subs out on otherwise unrelated singles, it's going to make news.
Can confirm, I'm just here for the drama and context

Never heard that name before
You chose the path of culture, brother
I mean, chomo accusations took out Mike. Also R Kelly although to be fair that wasn't at the height of his fame when it broke. Catchy music only works if you can afford to publicly ignore the allegations.
Of course the culture is fake, it’s manufactured. But it’s real in terms of $$$, and that’s all the matters
You just gave Drake more material ghostwriter 😂
?? It was just a comment I don’t really care what drake thinks, he just seems like the type to be bothered if people are saying he getting killed
To be clear, it was a different woman. He rented it out because he’s rich

Would you want to go on a date and have people taking pictures and asking for shit the whole time?
Nothing I’m saying it predates the beef
I'm rather a J. Cole fanatic tho. Just my preference, man. Sorry you got offended.
It goes beyond that, theirs a video on YouTube that goes about all the times he’s had a relationship even if “friendly” with a ton of teenage girls. Where he’s following and interacting with them from the ages of 13-17. Literally has invited girls to parties, after parties, studio etc. where theirs smoke theirs usually fire. Once again I don’t think Kendrick would be THAT straight forward if he didn’t know for SURE. Remember Kendrick doesn’t like fakeness, so if he lied he would be a hypocrite. Multiple times in the disses he goes, I’ll spare you, or that’s not even the leak etc.
Tyy
Hi Nas.
Are you Iceberg Slim?
Oh mb Idk how I didn’t notice
I was referring to The Warning by Eminem but it’s all good
Oh yeah, I’d love it if she escalated shit, get Em fired up to burn her again! It might be my #1, but there are a lot of great options. Can’t go wrong with No Vaseline, Bomb First, Story Of Adidon, The Warning, Killshot, Ether, Back Down, and these are just the first disses that are coming to mind. Honestly fuck it, throw Meet The Grahams in there too. Actually I wouldn’t bat an eye if somebody said Back To Back as well, that track might have the best bars Drake has ever spit in his career and it ripped Meek to shreds.
Cus it’s a song talking Shit against a female pop singer not against someone who’s gonna respond on wax..
"Cus you're a fuckin mole-hill and imma make a mountain outta you"
Eminem is literally one of the GOATs
Em might be the worst possible opp in a beef. Mans not afraid to say fucking anything about himself and can utterly disarm you while ripping into you simultaneously.
Also I'll point out, a lot of people who don't really care for Drake and don't follow him in the news might not have known about the allegations. They sure as fuck do now though
I mean shit that does explain his whole act all this time.
Worse 20 minutes
Wow, well said.
Fair point, but I think it's just a representation of the general opinion lol
prolly cuz it looks like ur from the east coast on the west coast man is huge
Yeah, other dude might be right, could be a western thing. I'm only in the mountains, not even the Coast, but nobody bumps Pusha (except me apparently lol) but *everyone* knows Kendrick.
Obviously the culture is not the what's making Drake hundreds of millions of dollars. White America as well as fans in countries all over the world who have nothing to do with the culture are going to ensure that Drake stays getting paid
If we are talking about money, then doesn’t that completely invalidate your argument? Drake makes more than all of them by a WIDE margin
I knew it!
Your brain probably read it as "either"
Yeah I realised that just didn't come to mind straight away
One of the biggest pop singers ever made a whole ass video publicly gaslighting him and he came with receipts lol.

He doesn't get credit for absolutely dragging her when she instigated it? Weird take but you do you.
shit was crazy cause he was probably waiting for everybody to start their Reaction streams before dropping his response. Waiting for Ak to get on his stream talking his shit then said "ok its time, let it go!"
Yeah, I just woke up lmao
Dead ass, my first thought was "no Vaseline over ether". I'm silly I suppose
Yo that’s how I read it too 😂 crazy brain tricks
Nah, it was even faster cause YouTube takes a few minutes to upload, and Meet the Grahams was published 16 minutes after Family Matters.  

Kendrick hit upload as soon as he saw the post on Aubrey’s page. He was just waiting.
Lmao I just woke up and I read it like Amelie wrote ether, as in, they were the ghost writer behind ether
DRAKE WON! Here’s why…

Drake won in the sense that he got Kendrick to produce 4 masterpieces that we may not have had otherwise.  Thank you Drizzy
Dude lost the second he decided to text and tell a 14 year old girl he missed her.
His tweets are wild but metro done something special for the culture with this one
Crowd sourcing diss tracks is next level
[deleted]
Drake’s Stan’s out here acting like Drake himself didn’t say something like “damn, I can’t go to jail yet!” in that video when he was kissing on that 17 year old. 

Even like 23-year old Drake knew it was wrong. 

Why don’t they?
drake too busy grooming teenager girls to win at anything. 
Have y’all heard the salsa version? El BBL lol

Hey Aubrey,let me take you shopping
I won’t lie. I threw on the BBL Drizzy instrumental on my way to work and just vibed. That beat goes so fucking hard.
He never stood a chance.

LET ME HEAR YOU SAY OV-HOES
Anyone who thinks Drake won has to look in the mirror and realise they are a Drake stan who lacks cognitive abilities. Kendrick won on EVERY metric. Could argue drake may win best diss song out of them all with FM but Kendrick beat him on strategy, streams, songs, insults, wordplay and range. Drake did his thing though and it was a great battle
BBL DRIZZAYYY IM THICKA THAN A SNICKER, DONT ACT LIKE YOU DONT KNOW!
YOU STRAIGHT OUT OF CANADA MY LITTLE MAPLE LEAF
Ahhh the new rick roll

IM ABOUT TO GO IN, NO DIDDDDAAYYYYYY
I'm done 💀💀💀😂😂
😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
Naw drake fans are doing mental gymnastics believing everything he says. Idk how anyone can think Drake wasn’t out strategized and out classed. But I’m also bias.
Not gonna lie Yuno Miles won over the other 2 nobodies having beef.
Biggest banger in the whole beef
Drake lost the moment he stopped using ghost writers
I downvoted off the title alone, then decided to troll you, saw the rest of the post, and gave you the upvote you deserve. Well played.

BBL DRIZZAAAAAAAY
Drake won according to the Drake sub, everywhere else though...
BBL DRIZYYY BBL DRIZAaAaAaAaAYYYYY
The fact that the man wearing the crown of thorns is sacrificing another man’s life to save rap has a tone of irony that I just love
You a goofy
Drake’s ghost writers working overtime rn
Idc what anybody Drake or Kendrick Stan say. Drake still had the best song in the battle with family matters but Kendrick still won the war
Nah Kendrick has been flaming drake so hard, I bet he's about to retire
Apparently he’s bouta drop again. Dude should just move along honestly though.
Drake the skinner

Drizzy the Skizzy
no he didn't win🤣
Drake the type of dude who ask his buddy if he can shake his dick for him after he pees.
I’m over this whole argument of choosing sides between a sexual predator and a woman beater lmao. They’re both shitty people, can we get back on schedule now
Rap and music in general lost
Ur not funny lil bro
The funniest thing to me is Drake fans shouting how far Kendrick crosses the line by addressing Adonis and telling drakes mom that Drake should die. 

Meanwhile old rap beefs were fucking brutal as hell. Like Tupac's famous track hit em up where he says "Fuck you and yo' motherfucking mama! We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!" And "All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you, die slow motherfucker
My .44 make sho' all y'all kids don't grow!" 

Going to show that drakes fans don't actually listen to rap at all and only listen to Drake. Because anyone that has listened to rap and especially any older rap beefs would know that there were regular threats to kill each other, and at times, they did kill each other! 

The cherry on top is drake then saying in The Pedo pt. 6 that he would slit Kendricks throat. 

Like how is that not crossing a line if what Kendrick said somehow is?

🤡🤡🤡 All of them
I went to the doctor today and he came in bumping that song on his phone
Lol
🧍🏽‍♀️🤛🏿🧔🏿🎤
I will stand by my man
KenDrake LaGrahm won yall
Drake won.
🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭🤣 wth
Ugh, fucking white people…
Freaky ass n**** you a 69 God lol
He won because he got Kendrick to be consistent for once lmao cause once his album drops in June we ain't gonna hear from him in another 4 years especially lol
Drake lost as soon as he starting writing his own bars
😂😂😂
Kendrick needs Twitter to write for him😂😂
You know I didn’t have a high opinion of the mfer, but after this beef, dude has fallen DOWN. Now I’m like…“You a Drake fan?” That’s a screening question
They are all wack
Is you like dat
Is this the equivalent of a Rickroll?
I am seeing a lot of discussion about Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Can anyone explain why they are currently a hot topic?
🎶Ooooo oooo oooo hooooo🎶
Stop it
Shut. Up. It’s over.
Kendrick by far threw the hardest punches  ... but he only hit air
No. He didn't.
Nah
Lol ok sure buddy
![gif](giphy|q2Ecf0mrSHf98U0d4U)
Look I really do like Kendrick’s music, and his records have been pretty aggressive which is great for a diss track. But Drake’s point is not invalid at all, if you have such bold accusations, you at least need to provide some kind of empirical evidence. I feel like people are falling into a confidence bias, where if someone they already like says something so confidently and brazenly then it has to be true. Idrc about who won or didn’t, but I’m not a huge fan of making wild accusations without any actual evidence to back it up.
Drake literally has longer meat than Kdot & metro PUT TOGETHER. Tip to tip measure their meat and then measure drakes. He is bigger I guarantee it
Cringe 

Fucking idiots
He did not lol
4? there's three right?
Or You Counting LIke that
He died so the culture could live.
Thank Drizzy. He made your Messiah rap again. Will probably have his biggest ever song and debut as #1 also. All thanks to Drizzy Drake
It’s still crazy to me that he did those all in one session, and there’s still five more we haven’t heard
Nah that was all part of Drake’s master plan. Really baited Kendrick with that one.
Actually, the fans lost when they knew about that and still listened to him.
He tried to strike a cord
I was just about to say this and name drops Millie Bobby Brown in the HEART PART 6 lol. He must really miss her now that's she engaged to be marry Bon Jovi's son and she's 20 years old now....
He was just playing 4D chess bro
How long were they around each other to miss each other?
Like recently? 
Regardless kendrick taking this beef and it's funny anyone thinks otherwise
https://youtu.be/P_Y7nABnOoA?si=2oV9JJf7LBkA0YUX
Just watched this. All his tweets/comments with timelines. Me me feel gross about listening to his music
He was just playing 4D chess bro
Wait wtf how come I never heard about this one
The world thinking he’s a PDF is a huge L.
Ya cringe as fuck. But I also think beating woman is bad. Whitney has yet to respond. She does not follow her brother or Kendrick. They both lose imo
Don’t worry, I’m sure Kendrick will come out in support of him just like he did for R Kelly 😉

You mfers love to pretend that yall have some degree of morals
I think the weirdest thing is everyone taking the word of a 14 year old girl with a crush with exactly zero proof. Almost as if people are just searching for a reason to hate Drake.
Funniest part is Drakes fans outrage over Metros whilst simultaneously defending Drakes actual predatory actions regarding underage girls.

Just got suggested a post from their sub where one of the comments was along the lines of "Rap beef is public opinion, so I think it's a tie". They live in a bubble.
It's like that satisfying, semi-emotional track that plays to the credits at the end of a good video game.
Plus the tweets were 11 years ago when he was like 19.
I still trust metro over bbl drizzy
I keep tryna tell ppl, because time really has flown now. But up until 2015 we used to joke about rape, homophobic shit and racism. It was normal to us because acting like the perfect human on the internet wasn’t a thing yet.

Yo see all the pedo stuff bout metro 💀
#metrogroomin
There will probably be a ripple effect from so many songs over the same beat in such a short time frame - there might even be samples of BBL Drizzy songs or the beat used in unrelated music at which point the cultural stain on drake is irreversible, even if it's one of the less terrible exposes against him
Treating his internet stans like a focus group to decide what he needed to say just to save the slightest amount of face with them.
Don't you criticize the Russell Wilson of hip pop
Yuno Miles > Kendrick > BBL Drizzy
Crazy part is that he continued with "you thick" and "I liked the way your breasts felt on my chest" AFTER she said she was 17...
Still waiting on a chopped n screwed
Is that boat?????
Ovhooeeee
It's what he gets for telling Metro to make some drums
Until his last track which was like “uh I actually plotted to fake an 11 yr old daughter and I am actually not a pedophile bc I am too famous”

Dude choked at the end. Was better off not saying anything.
TNT is playing a song about Drake being a predator as a bumper track for NBA games and BBL Drizzy has spawned hundreds of Drake diss tracks in multiple languages. I don't think there's any really any question about who the culture thinks won.
Kendrick won overall, I’d say. But I do think family matters is the best diss track to come out of this beef.
THE BEST BBL IN HISTORY
We don’t want him
why are so many people think i really meant drake won. I said sike!!! Ffs 😭😭
I know fans of gossip and whatnot have Kendrick on top, but Drake is obviously winning from a pure rap perspective and for people who appreciate battle rap.
And you’re basing him dropping on………?
Drake did win though… look at net worth vs Kendrick, look at hits vs Kendrick. I don’t like either of them, but there are some truly measurable formats for “who won”…
Maybe 😅 the drizz roll 
Bro…. Read the post 
Omg read the post its a bait 
Wtf…
This is straight up weirdo shit. Im a dude who loves dick and even I think this is out of pocket.

Your posts? Yeah you right
Your boy drop had to drop an explanation track and then ended it with I’m done. What planet you living on?
Read the post bro
3 on Spotify , one isn’t on there yet , and then like that , 5 total disses
I think they’re counting 6:16 in LA, which isn’t on streaming so wouldn’t chart
Was counting 6:16 in LA. We all know Dots got at least one more in the chamber too
6:16 in la and meet the grahams are not master pieces lmao. Mediocre af being gassed like crazy. Euphoria and not like us were bangers.
Kendrick is charting number one in what... 30, 40, 50 countries globally with that song rn.
drake paid the price for his sins and our blessings were legendary
PDrizzy doing us a solid on his way out
Crazy he couldn’t do that with his own disses tho…
He is a true master baiter

Ong tho, Kendrick had no idea that drake was guiding him to his down fall all along…..
And he really exposed Kendrick for the monster he his,hating pedos and all that.
So Drake is playing 4d chess?  Bullshit.. Pedo doesn't even know how to play checkers, and that's a middle school level game.  Maybe he can ask his girlfriend to show him how to play
I unfollowed all my old highschool friends I seen defending that shit👎🏿
At the time he hadn't yet made it a pattern so I can understand people giving him some benefit of doubt.

That changed once he kept doing it with Billie Eilish and then hugging on that 16 year old before renting out a restaurant when she turned 18.
She’s too old for him.
[deleted]
Nice one..

EDIT: I think I misunderstood this comment. Thought you were unironically saying Drake is playing 4D chess.
They go WAY back... To when she was 13.

Just altogether so sketchy. If they had hung out and her parents were around, and he didn't text her, then I could see it being overblown. But the text part specifically is what makes it so bad
He did it to himself. Weird ass MF’s
>she does not follow Kendrick or her brother 

This isnt high school bro they have constant access to each other 24/7 they don’t need to follow each other on instagram
If you’re being serious, how is that proof of beating women. I don’t have a lot of social media accounts and I have never followed/befriended any of my girlfriends.
I mean look at kendricks insta. It has two posts. New york times magazine cover from two years ago and 616 in LA from a few days ago. Why would she need to follow a purely media account? 

Agree beating a woman is bad if true. Unluckily for Drake grooming or pedophilia is worse.
Dude really said creepin on young girls is a question of morality. 


You know he about to fire back with some age of consent horseshit too. 
He doesn’t support r Kelly . His label threatened to remove the whole catalogue because of free speech in art and used XXXTentacion as main argument not R Kelly
My understanding is that it wasn't defending R Kelly's actions, but rather he had issues with pulling music from Spotify. 

Even if Kendrick was defending R Kelly (he wasn't) the response to Drake's documented and proven weirdness with minors of "well your guy did it too!" Is fkn weird
The thing about arguing with people on this shit is there are still going to be thousands more saying the same dumb shit

Kendrick didn't come out in support of R Kelly. He said it's not right for them to selectively try to remove only certain artists music, when we know all these rock stars that still have their music on with self admitted shady shit. Go read about Steven Tyler and David Bowie and all them dudes. Why we taking down the black guys music?
Crazy he never did that
Check this out 

https://youtu.be/P_Y7nABnOoA?si=2oV9JJf7LBkA0YUX
It's almost as if he's had 7 years to deny it but hasn't. What we have seen is multiple pictures of them together and social media posts from a now 20yr old Milly Bobby Brown doubling down on defending their friendship.
I love how their best option from the bat was to “take everyone down with him”. Like bro started at the bottom and the plan was to get others to come down?
It’s crazy to see the meat shiners

I saw someone say they’re willing to die for OVO.
I know I see so many Metro Groomin’ comments on TikTok and I’m like… I’m not defending Metro’s tweets but there is a big difference between a sus tweet and multiple credible allegations
I mean like OvO [has dudes out on a literal crusade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jcole/s/jnrMHdDvS2) against metro for some weird tweets  of him quoting lyrics in highschool college and fakin like they’re anti-pedo, but as soon as you check the post history every other one is defending Drake inviting the freshmen volleyball squad to his 37th, texting underaged and salivating when they turned 18, or grinding on them at 17, saying weird stuff. [Then trying to smear Kendrick as a wife beater by doctoring photos](https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/kendrick-lamar-addressing-the-rumors-that-he-beats-on-women.5602603/post-101473200).

The shit is embarrassing for BBL Drizzy. Almost as bad as the million dislikes on Heart Part 6.
Acting like it’s all bots and terminally online people when there’s videos of people rocking it in the clubs across the country.
😭😭😭
Yeah. I had to mute the Drizzy sub… I kept going to it when it would be suggested just to read the delusion. It’s bad for my mental health.
It is true though, if they believe that Drake won then Drake won, if others believe that Kendrick slaughtered then he slaughtered. At the end of the day, we the fans can just appreciate the music. 

Also BBL drizzy. 
Me when I spread misinformation online
💀💀 facts
Which makes him a year over being considered a legal adult, idk how this excuse makes it seem better
Funny when one of drakes crew literally went to prison for DV
I don't see anybody saying that they are okay with that. However doing anything to a child is worse in my opinion.
They both fucked up for that tbh. Doesn’t change anything about Drake tho “I’m lookin to shoot thru **any** pervert that lives keep the family safe”
Yeah but wasn’t he 18 tho? Still fucked up but no like he was 31 talking to a 14 year old like BBL Drizzy
Lets be clear - That era was the Dark Humor Apocalypse when EVERYONE was making jokes like that. Lets take those tweets in context

That don’t make them okay, but that context absolutely matters
He was a teenager posting random teenage shit
Yeah nah metro groomin wilding for sure but that beat is crazy asf
Hispanic here. It’s hitting our culture in Merengue style and I think a Banda song also came out

https://youtu.be/gt_9rcY0j_M?si=ygStD1F1WZ3YE9Dc
I just saw a clip of a comedian from a podcast years ago talking about the R Kelly situation and calling that Drake will be next because it is well known that "he likes them young."
Hol on lemme see if Twitter can do something with that lol

 Edit: https://x.com/dirtysouthbndit/status/1787669944789835798?s=46
You mean the one he actually wrote himself because he couldn't trust his ghostwriters?  Even admits it in the end of the song.
Nah he was already losing big when people were screaming “a minoooor” and “OVHO” across America. And apparently even Canada. He needed to try something or just accept the L. 

While most of us clown the heart 6 it offered his riders something they could cling to. And that was the purpose of it. Before that even the drake sub mostly acknowledged he were losing. Now they’re back to living in denial.
Yep was saying the same shit. Think it boils down to the pedo rumours gaining traction and him being a huge brand. He was definitely getting phone calls to squash it. But then it points back to the start of the beef, he knew that would be an angle. He even made Tupac say it so in hindsight I would have been staying out of beef if I knew they could play on that angle heavy. His pride got to him but he still gave it a good shot.
Fair opinion
Drake fans looking for any chance to thrive right now you edged them.

OV-HOEE
Are you in elementary school?
>pure rap perspective and for people who appreciate battle rap.

You sure as fuck do not speak for anyone with a brain that listens to rap.
😭bro saw his meat AND WANTS it like he ain't winning broski, them disses from Kendrick ARE way better than anything drake has put out especially the "you strike a chord is probably a-minooooorrrr" part
He really isn’t though lmao

“That stays in the texts” - Millie Bobby Brown
Ok but you would think she would be like... um no wtf.. in order to protect her man's imagine. But crickets is interesting to say the least. Her silence tells me NDA
It's not but no denying from either party is very suspicious. And then there's that old video circulating of that girl saying the girl got beat in Vegas by Kendrick

For the record, both are innocent until proven guilty. But it's a fact drake is creepy with young girls. Did it go further than creepy? Full on pedo? Idk but the girls are saying no. Still cringe...

And with no denial from Kendrick or Whitney, and that video... I'm leaning towards it happened. Engage since 2015, but not married and living in different cities? Something is up. Maybe kdot found out it wasn't his kid and beat her up... idk. 

Could be wrong for sure, but not a good look. All it takes is one tweet from Whitney and I would believe her.
What did R Kelly do with those young girls?
You can try to get by on that whole “he had issues with Spotify, he wasn’t supporting R Kelly”. But Kendrick then went on to collaborate and go on tour with Kodak after HE was convicted in a court of law for sexual misconduct with a minor.

I’m tired of the hypocrisy. If you want to denounce Drake and call his behavior creepy, that’s fair. But you can’t do that WHILE praising Kendrick.

Either denounce Kendrick and Drake, or don’t say anything. But don’t act like Kendrick actually has a problem with sexual misconduct, he doesn’t.

(I can edit the same comment and respond to each of you, because you all regurgitate the same talking point)
It’s not “your guy did it too”, my point is you guys are constantly praising Kendrick and shitting on Drake.

However, Kendrick came out in support of a man that was convicted in a court of law for grooming girls.

Every girl that yall accuse Drake of grooming has come out and denied the allegations.

So at the VERY least, for you to be creeped out by Drake’s behavior, you would have to denounce Drake and Kendrick.

Start from the bottom now we here, started from the bottom now my whole team fucking kids.
Bro I keep saying they are a new MAGA thing. Like it's craaaaazy
They keep supporting pedos and pedo behavior I'm sure there's somebody out there that would oblige them.
Most of the Sus tweets I saw from Metro where from when he was 17 years old so not exactly sure if I missed something or Drake fans are just reaching...
Almost like they are both pieces of shits?
except all of those allegations have been denied by the very women at the center of them. it’s def sus that he’s texting 14 yr olds but i’m a little uncomfy that we’re ignoring what all of these young women have to say. millie, bella harris, the girl from the video on stage. as a woman i feel a little like they are being erased here
Except its objective that Kendrick won
Well yeah, it's not like there's a rap beef judges Union or something LOL.
You don't see the difference between a 19 year old saying stupid shit and a 30 year old texting 13 year olds?!? Lmfao
Those tweets are gucci lyrics lol

Yeah like is it out of pocket, absolutely but also out of pocket tweets vs being an actual groomer/pedophile is apples to oranges. You can dig up tweets from anybody, but you can't find pedo dirt on everyone.

Shane Gillis on MSSP
What wording alludes to that ?
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's where he met Drake.
As I said, Drake has the bars, the punchlines, the rebuttals, but he had lost even before he released push-ups though as I'm feeling this is less about the beef and more about hating Drake.

I came into the beef as a neutral. I haven't been actively listening to Kendrick after GKMC as I find his flow chaotic and im not feeling his constant voice alterations, but I'm no Drake stan either. His releases after NWTS has been mid at best, but mostly downright terrible. As a big fan of Push and especially Clipse I was praying for a Drake loss during their beef, and Pusha T destroyed him even though I wasn't feeling the hiding a child-angle. I want hard hitting bars and punchlines.

Anyways, for me at least, Drake is up because of the reasons stated above. The fact that people are claiming Kendrick won by a landslide is laughable and is only showing their bias.
I was a big fan of Drake up until Views which I found terrible, and basically anything he has released after (except a few loosies and features) have been trash. I clowned him after Story of Adidon too.

In this beef though, Drake has far more punchlines, better bars, far better flows and he's actually rebutting. If, and it certainly looks like it, the daughter allegation is false it's a huge L for Kendrick. It's hard to come back from that, especially when his "nuclear bomb" is partly dedicated to this person who seems to be fictional. From a pure battle rap perspective it isn't even close. Drake's up. 

If anyone of them can produce proof of their allegations they win, but as of now we haven't seen it. I have to say though, the Kendrick meat gobbeling on Twitter and reddit is just crazy.
That A minor bar is elementary and any real musician has heard that joke a million times. It's played out just like the rest of his disses that y'all repeat a million times. "You really got that shit burnt out"
Thing is, I'm sure people who says that Kendrick is winning would says so even if Kendrick himself admitted defeat.

They probably can't clear the samples, or just haven't been able to do it yet, so Kendrick cant put it on his streaming profiles. 

Some random person, trying to capitalize on the song, who doesn't care about the legality, made a "Kendrick" artist profile on Spotify and then put the song up themselves. Not affiliated with Kendrick Lamar at all.
6:16 in la is mocking Taylor made freestyle by drake which had to be taken down cuz tupacs estate didn’t like the ai voice

Probably would if people actually believed Drake.
For me rap beef is not about denying allegations, 2Pac said I slept with your wife, Biggie made one comment on a Jay-Z song and it wasn’t even a denial just a little jab. I don’t know why that’s a discussion in the beef, I’m here for what can you say, who creative can you trash talk.
Lol even if Whitney denied it, people wouldn’t believe her. Abused people can be coerced into saying, “We’re good, I love him. He doesn’t treat me wrong.”
Pretty sure Kendrick said family matters was a lie in his last one.
[Regards the Vegas situation, he addressed it during an episode of the Breakfast Club](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/isfwZCqxh28?feature=share)
He did some weird shit with them.


You gonna run with the R Kelly angle since I called out the age of consent one?


Let's hear it.
But why defend Drake so hard tho? He doesn’t care about you .. your not a teenage girl 😂
>if you want to denounce Drake and call his behavior creepy, that’s fair. 

defense of the century. Get this man a law degree.
Kendrick's issue was with Spotify, and not supporting R Kelly. The slightest bit of digging would help you find that out rather than just blindly supporting everything Drake does. In Kendricks song We Cry Together he tells people to stop listening to R Kelly and other bad/problematic people, and has said similar things in both his music and in person 

R Kelly has writing credits on Certified Lover Boy, FYI. 

The fact that Drake was texting MBB anything about missing her, talking about boys, etc when she was 14 and he was in his 30s is mad weird. He also said on Billie Eilish IG when she turned 18 that "he had been waiting. There's a video of him touching on a 17 yr old girl after she told him she was 17. And that's not even all of the allegations, there's more. Even in the Heart Part 6 Drake's whole response was to say that he knew he'd be compared to Epstein and that he never touched MBB in that way!? Neither of those names were mentioned anywhere in Kendricks diss tracks???

Throwing your whole support and identity behind any celebrity as if they could do no wrong is weird to me. If there's legitimate proof and not just speculation of any artist, even the ones that I like, comes out I will of course condemn the actions of that person. So yeah I'm gonna go ahead and say Drake's behavior is weird af and should be investigated further, and I can do that because I'm not a stan 🤷‍♂️
Watch this clip. Receipts

https://youtu.be/P_Y7nABnOoA?si=2oV9JJf7LBkA0YUX
They not gonna acknowledge this
A young girl tells the press a 31 year old DM's her and takes her out for meals. Young girl and 31 year old are pictured out together despite having no reason to know each other/ work together. 

Young girl goes on to say the 31 year old man is messaging her saying he misses her and giving her advice about boys. Despite being a high profile figure the man says nothing. Despite the girl saying these things directly to the press in interviews and red carpet events he still says nothing. 

Why someone as high profile as Drake wouldn't correct the story or make Milly withdraw the things she's saying to the press is just crazy. Unless he knows that actually he can't force her to change what she's saying because she actually does have DM's from him proving she's not lying.

I'm not sure what Milly being married now has to do with it by the way? Is that some sort of defence? Oh well she went on to still be able to get married so just ignore the possible grooming.
Nah that’s the Kanye fanbase, Aubrey’s Angels are coping themselves into insanity right now but Yeezy Youth has been living in a state of that since like 2021
How is metro pos? Go outside
Well its simple. Women arent people to them unless they are 18+, so they cant understand grooming is a thing and therefore cant understand their situation. 

Basically they assume women must be protected and carry that mindset to teens who are largely more intelligent than the past and have resources for all this information that wasnt available readily before. Not believing women is the wrong approach.
Yeah except for Drake has already had to pay hush money to women he assaulted, he paid $350K to get a woman to shut up in 2017
[deleted]
Not really the Kendrick glaze is insane, if drake talked about Kendrick’s secret daughter and that shit was a lie drake would get dogged on. Drake never really had a chance as public perception would always be against him.
His tweets were far beyond "stupid shit" lmao
There's evidence of drake grooming. Is there any evidence of kendricks DV
He groomed them?????!!!!!!
Grooming 13-year-old girls like Millie Bobby Brown. Also I never said I was supporting any of them. Bunch of millionaires acting like little whiny bitches
'It's good to get out, get the pen working' implies he wasn't working the pen before.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Isn’t Not Like Us the Billboard #1?
I think you are in the extreme minority. I legit haven’t seen one critic argue that Drake won this. His bars are nothing special. He’s an average rapper and an average writer. He’s not famous because of his rapping. Meanwhile Kendrick has a Pulitzer Prize and has been showing us why. And if you don’t see the punchlines and rebuttals on Not Like Us then…idk what to say. Sounds like you just don’t like KDot’s style and that’s fine but acting like Drake is showing him up is just strange
>Drake has the bars, the punchlines, the rebuttals

LMAO ok
Ngl I just like Kendrick better so L opinion
Big coping
Drake secret account?
Well he hasn’t done that has he? So kind of a non point
I’ll take that L
Why hasn't she denied the wife beating? Pretty easy thing for her to do?
Hahaha but it's still on spotify

.. I’m okay with that , really not that important
Times have changed.. there wasn't social media during biggie/pac.. barely even internet. Things are happening way faster. These are real allegations to real crimes. How come everyone was up in arms when drake didn't deny anything at first?

If a beef is who can make up the best lies... then that's dumb as hell. I need receipts... until then I'm holding both in contempt.
Ya but I like Kendrick so I would believe her because I want it to be true.
Just use my same comment to the other dude.

you guys are constantly praising Kendrick and shitting on Drake.

However, Kendrick came out in support of a man that was convicted in a court of law for grooming girls.

Every girl that yall accuse Drake of grooming has come out and denied the allegations.

So at the VERY least, for you to be creeped out by Drake’s behavior, you would have to denounce Drake and Kendrick.

You can try to get by on that whole “he had issues with Spotify, he wasn’t supporting R Kelly”. But Kendrick then went on to collaborate and go on tour with Kodak after HE was convicted in a court of law for sexual misconduct with a minor.

I’m tired of the hypocrisy. If you want to denounce Drake and call his behavior creepy, that’s fair. But you can’t do that WHILE praising Kendrick.

Either denounce Kendrick and Drake, or don’t say anything. But don’t act like Kendrick actually has a problem with sexual misconduct, he doesn’t.
Casually ignores the Kodak point.
The Billie eilish comment was fake.
>A young girl tells the press..

So we’re taking the words of a 14 year old girl as the gods honest truth, with no screen shots of any text messages. Got it. 

>Why a man like Drake 

Maybe Drake doesn’t expect the public to immediately sexualize every encounter he has with every high profile celebrity of the opposite sex

…but here yall are. LMAO. I wouldn’t address it either. Saying something about it just feeds the awkward sexualization even more. 


>Im not sure what Millie being married has to do…

It means he wasn’t grooming her. She’s been in a relationship with her husband since she was 17. 

Let’s be objective here.
Interesting.  I've never had to engage Kanye stans. I known the Drake ones are living in a world of delusion and conspiracies and will die on that hill lol
[removed]
it’s you who cannot have a conversation about this without nuance. just like the rest of the internet. i believe this discussion erases all agency that young women have. 

this isn’t about drake. do you care that none of them claim to feel victimized? is what they have to say important at all? or do you just want to partition yr world neatly into good and evil? the child abuse hysteria is at an all time high and you’re just one more voice in the deliriously obsessed choir.

i think it’s interesting that i said ‘i’m a little uncomfy’ that we aren’t listening to them and you jumped to ‘stop defending a groomer’

just like the rest of the internet
Maybe drake could have had some public perception if The Heart Part 6 wasn’t an absolute stinker
Now I wonder what in Drake’s past turned public perception against him in matters of sex crimes and secret children…
Drake also claimed that dots daughter was Dave freeze’s with no proof. They both made baseless claims. But Kendrick also made a lot of true ones and just rapped at a level 10x above drakes.
Stepsis, F what they talkin bout, Kendrick roasted him, bars hit harder, jokes were funnier, shit was catchier, rhymes were more intelligent and he straight rapped circles around him. For all Drakes talk of Kendrick needed weeks to put together triple entendre’s, Kenny crucified him in a matter of minutes, hopping on a beat with lyrics that directly addressed everything Drake through at him and then some.

Even Drakes boy DJ Ak says Drake lost* (so far…he won’t admit it’s over even as his OvO slanted polls had Drake losing by 90% or something ). Please find one self respecting emcee who will claim Drake won this.
Something that got me thinking is when drake accused kendrick of not giving back to his city, I mean it’s on the bottom of the list of things from either side, but as introspective and empowering as Kendrick is, it would truly be a damn shame if that was true
Sorry your king got cooked, but getting mad at 13 year old tweets won't fix that for you
[removed]
He means before the beef 🤦 he was reflecting on the whole thing. I think Kendrick won/is winning but I swear y'all are just saying whatever as long as it's making fun of Drake lmao
That's a reach he's talking about the whole beef as a closing out song. He had solo writing credits on family matters also if that helps. Let's not be silly here.
It is, but so was good vibrations by Marky Mark
Well, in my circle it's more nuanced. Some say Kendrick, some give it to Drake. Though, as you say, there's no doubt I'm in the minority. Let's see if that changes if they suddenly decides to drop more though. 

I respect what you're saying, but he's an underrated rapper and writer in my opinion. He sadly chooses to waste it on garbage pop music which is the reason the fell of after NWTS.
He showed hints of what he's capable of on IYRTITL (Can't Have Everything is great, I love the off beat flow), but for some reason he decided to abandon that route immediately after.
You do you man.

I'm just enjoying the disses and appreciate them without any bias
It's just facts, just cause y'all elementary doesn't make it a cope
My point is that no matter how hard drake goes during this beef he isn't given his flowers. He's been killing it on every track, bar the tupac one which I found kinda meh
Right....if Kendrick did it it would open him up to potential lawsuits without clearing the samples. But if you don't care about lawsuits, you can go make a Spotify artist profile and upload it yourself
Hey hey hey run for yo life
You better get 420 up votes, and not a single one more.
Why? All rappers do is lie, true allegations just makes the diss sting more. Beef is nothing but trash talk, that most times get personal, rappers been talking about real crimes for a long time this ain’t the first time. 

The Drake thing is aye bro you do be around young girls, you have said/tweeted some pedo type things, you did lie about a bunch of stuff vs Kendrick why aren’t you married yet, how come y’all not following each other. Neither one is proof but it looks worse because of Drake’s behavior. To the Kendrick Vegas thing I can’t speak on it because I have no idea about it and it would be cause to go aye he might have hit his wife but I did see somewhere that that might’ve been a false story.
That's kind of a retarded way to think about it lol


IMO Drake and Kendrick are both innocent unless there's evidence outside of what they each say. Drake being friend with one girl isn't evidence. Kendrick's wife not following him or her other family members on IG isn't evidence either.


But Drake having multiple videos, multiple friendships with 13-16 year olds, being a fan of girls high school basketball to the point where he knows them by name, and the videos of him touching underaged girls when he knew their age... I don't know. That just seems different.
1. R Kelly's victims get the proceeds from his music now

2. Kendrick fighting censorship does not equal support

3. Association with someone who has done bad things is not good, but does not equal doing them yourself. Obviously i could hand wave a bunch about forgiveness and growth and penace but you don't wanna hear that. 

4. Drake is gross

5. Kendrick isn't
I didn't agree with Kendrick when he threatened to take his songs off Spotify if R. Kelly's shit was gonna get taken down. But I understood where he was coming from. 


You pretending Dot was standing with R. Kelly is fucking stupid though. It was a bigger issue than that and one that's plagued the music industry for decades.


I can't speak for why Dot brought on Kodak either. I also knew it was a dogshit look, especially for that specific album. Even more so now considering Kodak hasn't changed his ways.


But there you sit, pretending any of these things is equivalent to straight up letting a convicted sex offender and pedophile into your everyday life.


Sure, all the actions Dot took that you mentioned sends a hypocritical message. I can agree with you there. At the same time, stop pretending Dot wasn't at the very least push for a positive change.


What message is Drake sending by letting people know it's a holiday when his convicted sex offender and pedophile friend gets back? Especially when people have been eyeing him for decades for being a groomer? 


You willfully ignore all that because Dot gets "praised more." I thought it was he opened his mouth so give him a Grammy. LMFAO You dumbass clowns be on some weird shit.
don’t waste your time. 

My let’s not even start with the conversation that Kendrick was 100% down to let “pedophilia” and “grooming” slide so long as Drake didn’t diss him 😂 

that’s the angle Drake *should* be playing. The fact that this man with integrity & morals was completely fine with the “pedophilia & grooming” until he was dissed. According to his own fans, he even gave Drake 2 different songs (Euphoria and 6:16) to back out of the beef before “exposing” him. 

Hey man, I’m not no Kendrick Lamar in terms of integrity and morals, but if I have proof of pedophilia and grooming on somebody, I’m not just gonna stay quiet about it until they upset me & then tell the world about it as my defense…I’m gonna report it to the proper authorities & keep my mouth closed so as not to blatantly disrupt their investigation. But hey, I have no morals or integrity 🤷‍♂️
Kendrick shouldn't have worked with an abuser. You want the words written and mailed to you? 

Now address literally any of the points that I said. Your turn. Come on, you can do it. I believe in you
Her being married has nothing to do with Drake grooming the fuck outta her.
No we're taking photographic evidence of a 31yr old and a 14yr old "hanging out" together when they're unrelated as evidence that they did indeed hang out. Not sure what you find difficult to accept about that?

Maybe Drake could provide any credible reason for hanging out with a child that he's not related to, not friends with, or doesn't work with. Then there wouldn't be a way for people to "accidentally sexualised" their relationship.

That last sentence. Are you actually a moron? You honestly think that nobody who has been groomed has ever gone on to get married?

>it’s you who cannot have a conversation about this without nuance. just like the rest of the internet. i believe this discussion erases all agency that young women have. 

They're infantilizing them because their entire angle hinges on it. There's a conspiracy theory about how Millie's parents were complicit in it.

 They're literally in the same K Anon level conspiracy but they're "high off farts" rn.
The fact of the matter is children legally do not have the agency to consent to a relationship with an adult. It's as simple as that. It doesn't matter if they are fine with it or agree with it afterwards as that's the whole definition of grooming.
Heart part 6 wasn’t good but in my opinion until they prove drake has a daughter meet the grahams is gonna age just as badly especially with some of the Kendrick women beating stuff that came out( haven’t looked into it much but there definitely seems to be something there). I don’t think either person has won and if they both have legit dirt leaked it could just be a loss for both of them at the end.
I never said he won…. I’m just saying Kendrick didn’t win yet either, if the daughter thing isn’t true that’s straight up embarrassing and if any of the stuff about Kendrick that came out is true that’s also very damaging
Pretty sure Kendrick has donated a lot to the high school he went to and he does Toy Charity Drives like every year lol. There isn't an exact number on the amount he has given back, but he has done something.
It’s not.
Bro look at my comment history and you'll see I could care less about drake. Dudes a fucking scumbag. So is metro. Stop tryna defend the lesser of the two groomers
I'm not. Fuck that dude. Drake has mountains of evidence of him interacting inappropriately with teenagers and grooming.

So where's the circumstantial evidence about kdot?
Yeah while I think Kendrick won I'm not rolling with that reach. In those specific words he meant that he's enjoyed working on all the songs for this beef as it's his closing out song...come on. They will downvote us but whatever this is a reach. I'm not even a drake guy like that but family matters just has writing credits for drake & pushups has 3 or so.
I think he wrote both of them, and I think the difference in quality between something he took his time on and something he wrote overnight is very glaring. Like the point of the weird implication with the way he phrased it is less about 'did he or did he not use ghost writers on this song' and more about 'how are you going to let this implication exist in your own song'?

Appearances are important in a genre like rap, and shit like this just makes it feel unpolished. Another example is at the beginning when he says 'the people you're getting info from are clowns' and then goes on to say his own camp was doing the leaks. Like I see how that could get by you on a first draft, but did you not proofread your lyrics even once and go 'hmm maybe I should rephrase this so it can't be used to make me look dumb'? 

I thought Family Matters was a real good track, better than Push Ups and a fair fight against Euphoria but my overall impression of THP6 is that it just feels like a first draft. Drake should've taken another day to go over the lyrics, straightened a couple of lines out, and then dropped, rather than... this.
Sure, there are a lot of shitty songs that make it to #1.

There aren’t as many that make it to #1 and prompt a response like what Drake put out. The guy basically recorded a song that sounded like he was on a witness stand and coping with the embarrassment. That’s not what winning looks like…
There is some serious irony to thinking your own opinion is unbiased…
Bro the heart part 6 is him cowering with his tail between his legs

No matter how to frame it, Drake came with no heat lol
Word up good for us sheesh downvoting me for liking a song on Spotify 😂 ya'll be tripping
Freaky ass 🥷 he a 69 god
Got it. It’s okay to hang with bad people, as long as you aren’t one? I guess we’ll just ignore the domestic violence so we can say Kendrick “isn’t gross”
Take shots at Drake, I don’t mind. Just make sure to have Kendrick in the crosshairs too, that’s all I’m saying.
That’s all I wanted to hear bro. Acknowledge the hypocrisy. You’ve come a lot further than the other stans. 

I don’t have to defend Drake. Yall can think what you want. The girls have come out and said there was no validity to the grooming claims. Beyond that, if you want to call the dude creepy, that’s free smoke.

My only objective here was to make people acknowledge that Kendrick isn’t some paragon of virtue. 

If you want to denounce them both, I can totally see the validity in that. As long as it’s aimed at BOTH.
“Grooming” is a very outcome-dependent term, and two high profile celebrities taking a couple pictures together doesn’t quite fit the definition, fortunately.
I haven’t seen anything other than a couple pictures of them at public events at places the both of them would be expected to be at. Maybe you have screenshots of text messages and videos of them hanging out. 

Yes. Married women who have come out to being groomed have gotten married. But there isn’t any evidence of Drake grooming Millie, and if there were, Millie has every opportunity in the world. Drake isn’t in a position of authority over Millie.
Tell me what chIld did Drake dated or had sex with?
With rap battles it isn’t always about what’s objectively true, I think some people are missing that. It’s about bringing your opponent’s dark shit to light for everyone to look at. It’s about dissing them but also about how well your bars are written. There might not be a fake daughter but it got everyone talking about how he tried to hide his son. Some people are finding out about that for the first time thanks to Meet the Grahams
"Haven't looked into it" was where your truth ended. The ONLY thing that comes up is an uncooraberated story from some rando Drake glazers sharing a fuzzy video of someone claiming they worked at Hard Rock Hotel saying someone left from the entourage bloody from some rappers entourage and, no cap, it's been proven Kendrick wasn't staying at that hotel and the girl says she doesn't know who they rapper was, she thinks it was someone named Kendrick..... someone off camera says was it Kendrick Lamar? And she's like oh yeah yeah.... but does she look like she knows one rapper from another. Most people that can would know exactly what famous person they were near let alone one that left someone bloody. And she didn't even say he did anything just that some dude and chick left someone entourage bloody. I mean be objective bro. There is nothing there even tieing Kendrick to any action
It’s several things that he claimed about Kendrick that we know aren’t true:
1. Kendrick was never molested. The whole point of mother I sober was that it was his mother who was molested but she was traumatized.
2. Drake claimed Kendrick lied about OvO filing a C&D on “Like That”.  Metro came with receipts.
3. Drake claims Kendrick lied about him being a master manipulator but at the same time claims they planted the evidence of him having a daughter to fool Kendrick and Kendrick just didn’t do due diligence.

On that last one, both of those things can’t be true. Either Drake is a manipulator who planted the evidence, or he has a daughter that he’s hiding. In away it’s like perjury based on his own testimony. He also says clowns fed him the info but doesn’t realize he disses himself.

On the wife beater front fans have gone back to 2014 posts to show the story was fabricated and found the OvO Stan’s doctored the pics of Whitney from the rock climbing trip the next day by pulling up the original. This is getting embarrassing for Drake on the personal side and lyrically he was eviscerated.
What about Drakes unfounded claims? Would it not be just as embarrassing for him if his claims weren’t true?
the migos gave back to their hs. are they activists???
[removed]
I mean you're definitely right about rushing just look at the I'm too famous to be a pedo line. Like come on .... The clown line is understandable in that he could be just saying he was giving that dude the info because he knew he was leaking things. But then like you say leaves it open to interpretation. 

I think he was getting phone calls to deny the pedo rumours asap so just chopped it together asap. On the Joe budden pod they also said the chord B sharp doesn't exist. Still think it's a reach about him talking about ghost writers though. What a great collection of content we've got from the beef though. Feel bad for Drizzy though the memes coming out of it are destroying any credibility he had left.
Yeah man, I get what you're saying.

I understand what he was trying to do, and with the allegations Kendrick put out he had to address it. If I were him I would've chosen a different approach and focused less on the predator accusations (he dragged it out a bit, just say it's bullshit and move on - the Millie Bobby Brown/Whitney bar was clever though) and more on Kendrick and the alleged domestic violence etc. Then again, I'm just an idiot on the internet and not a Grammy winning rapper.

I feel it would've been better if he trusted himself more and not deviated from the route he was taking on Push-ups and Family Matters, which (in my book) are the two best tracks from this beef.
I'm kinda conflicted on the heart track. He said some shit, but should've taken a different approach. I'm getting what he tried to do though. 

Objectively you can't tell me Family Matters wasn't fucking good?

Either way I'm not trying to pick a fight with anyone, I'm just enjoying this battle man. It's been fire.
I think they're downvoting because I explained it pretty clearly and then you said "but it's in Spotify" lol
Fan
Maybe it's about accepting what you've done and trying to move on? I get where you're coming from but this in no way = what Drake has shown a pattern of. We've all got our little preferences, don't we
I thought it was a discussion of morals? Why do you wanna switch the goalposts to some other zip code and talk about hypocrisy now? 


You've never been hypocritical ever in your life? LOL


Absolute clown.
The point is that Drake stans aren't capable of acknowledging anything, which you continue to prove. Y'all are weird. It's weird.
I'm replying to someone saying that women of 14 to 17 years old are being dismissed because they're saying their relationships with a 30 year old man are okay. If you want to talk about that then we can have a conversation
I legit want to know how drake stans respond to this portion of the story.. so far ive seen them just disappear.

It goes: point, counterpoint, silence.

I also love that the second child is what they're concerned about... not the harsher accusations... we already KNOW Drake will try to hide his child.... but many less people "knew" it was someone elses children.... allegedly.
Who said anything about activism? The criticism from drake was that Kendrick doesn’t give back to his community.
Best way to know for sure is if you go and ask them.
Deflecting the point. Drake's claims aren't proven, however Kendrick was spot on about him being a pedo/groomer. And with Metro, all we really have is him posting some mad sus comments on Twitter (some of which were lyrics to a song).

Until I see some solid proof of Kdot attacking his fiancé and that lady at the Hard Rock, I'm gonna take that as Drake talking out of his ass. And until we find some more about Metro Boomin actually touching underage girls, I'm just gonna think of him as a weirdo.

Drake on the other hand has video and text proof that he's been touching and talking to minors inappropriately. And proof that he's lied about his son. Wouldn't be surprised if he's hiding another child with that record.
Family Matters really was good. I just think he made a huge mistake after…
But it's true!
Accepting what you’ve done and moving on, could you elaborate on that point? Is that in regards to Kendrick’s domestic violence or helping clear Kodak of his sexual misconduct?
It is a discussion of morals. And my point is, these rap dudes have none.
[removed]
He didn’t switch the goalposts. He’s saying either you have morals and should support neither, or you don’t and supporting Kendrick only makes you hypocritical as fuck. 

It’s really not that hard to understand I dont know why so many of you are having trouble here.
Strong difference in "doing work with an abuser" and "literally having a documented history of being creepy to minors and it's even on video and IG comments"
Sorry but everything you're saying is very disingenuous. Take the 17 year old because it's the easiest to defend. (There's no speculation possible so it's easier to talk about)

1. You said:

>The fact of the matter is children legally do not have the agency to consent to a relationship with an adult. It's as simple as that.

I hope you know that doesn't apply here because **legally** in that state a 17 year old absolutely have the agency to consent. 

2. They didn't have sex or a relationship.

3. She didn't interact with a 30 year old man, she interacted with a 23 year old man.

4. You're not dismissing a 17 year old girl you're dismissing someone who's a grown ass adult now.
‘actin like an activist; it’s make believe’
Yeah, I have no problem understanding why people feel this way

Please Europe, for the love of all that is good, protect the elderly and especially this fantastic specimen of a man.

This is the beauty of football: it can solve what politics has ruined!

This is great but it’s a shame so many people only care about filming it.  Enjoy the moment.

I was just going to say, there is a lot more love than hate going on this euro
Only one genocidal chant so far, otherwise been nothing but an uplifting coming together of cultures with good natured fans treating each other as equals.


Games gone
As long as you don't visit r/euro2024 as a Turk or Brit then yes
For some of us, anyway.

Source: a very disappointed glasgwegian
Euro 2020 happening during covid and then Qatar being dead as fuck has starved us of a proper international tournament. It's been too long...
when you hold tournaments in real countries with actual history in the game they tend to have great atmospheres
And soon after we have the Olympics in France, so the fun doesn't end.
Unless you're an England fan
For real. This is why soccer is the greatest sport there is.
Amen
Not for us Croatians since last night 😭
Unless you're Scottish
He probably still remembers when the turkish people came and saved our economy.

edit: so a lot of people seem to have something to say about the word “saved”. so here’s my two cents.

“save” is describing how 14 million people from all over europe, namely italy, greece, spain, turkey, tunisia and yugoslavia, rendered vital and essential aid in helping sustain what is known as the “[Wirtschaftswunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder)”, which (imo) is a somewhat glorified term for what is essentially the massive undertaking of transforming a west germany that was in all meanings of the word devastated from one of if not the most destructive conflicts of our human history. 

so no, the turks didn’t save our economy completely on their own, the italians where the first to come to our aid as a matter of fact, but their was a massive shift in momentum when the turks started to come, no other country send as many people a year as the turks. 

there is also other stuff, but to cut it short, the turks „saved“ our economy from severely taking a hit when we really couldn’t afford it, in a combined effort with other european countries.

also, I want to say I‘m not a history book, and one could probably argue that the term “save” is also a glorification. If you want to be sure of something, look it up yourself.
"we used to march like this"
90s vibes for sure
Wish we had the elections after the Euros. A happier and more European friendly vibe leading up to the elections would have surely helped a bit.
the euros is BY FAR my favorite tournament. Its just so most nicer than the world cup. I understand that its not as important. But it always delivers in so many ways
I saw a tweet with a picture of the aftermath of an area in Frankfurt after the England - Denmark game (needless to say, rubbish everywherem very unorderly). The picture was presented without context and the tweet said something like "this is what open borders will lead to, we need to close our border" with another person saying "Europe is for white christians only".

You could literally still see the english flags in the picture ...

Point being, these racist rats will see what they want to see. This is not about logic or vibes to them, just hate.
Kinda helps that it isn't organized by a (complete ;\^)) shit hole dictatorship
Every nation loves every nation. 

It’s beautiful. 

(Except England. We’re still hated 🙁)
for real. such a weird feeling to feel good and peaceful.
imagine how I felt in Russia during WC, so many people from all the countries were having fun and then you go on internet and everyone hates you lol
I'm so pleasantly surprised.

We've had a bit of trouble it seems but in general this has been such a nice Euros. Fans of different countries partying together etc, great to see.
its what the great game is all about
Yeah, why is every video from this tourney so wholesome? Its great, but not what I’m used to seeing haha
I still not am in the spirit yet completely, but fuck it if you don't need a bit of fun and optimism after these last few years...
I’ve had things happen to me these past 2 months that have made me think the world is full of bad people. 


These euros are helping remind me that there is a lot of good
Yes
the world was, is and will always be full of shit. if we stopped doing all events of entertainment, culture or similar, then it would just be shit and nothing else.
Getting me proper excited to see it here the next tournament. Nothing like football to make you forget about all the other crap
Essentially before social media.
It really makes you feel good and just proud to be a part of humanity.
Healed us from the Qatar fuckery
I am feel

Remember Qatar having to rent fans to even get a semblance of atmosphere? Wtf was that about?
Exactly what I've been thinking
Fortunately for global football, FIFA is only corrupt & not racist like they were till the early 70s (while "Some" Europeans like You still are even now).

Or maybe Europeans are too idiotic to grasp Euro's & World Cup are different things.
[deleted]
Maybe they could just make all of Europe Germany. I don't see what could go wrong.
Dreams can't be buy
I'm assuming this was ahead of the game in Dortmund. So, yes.
Ofc not.
Bro, the person that give the flag didn't accept the money,  let's try see the good side of things bcuz it's necessary in dark times
Fuck off
Sure, but we owe our chance to see this moment to the person who chose to film it.
Honestly, what do you think do you achieve with this comment?
It hasn't even lead to genocide in the Balkans yet.
it's good to go back to our national pastime of attacking the national team and hoping our club players just come back from germany unscathed, having saved their energy for more important endeavours like coming second to city
So basicly hold the euros each year for 12 months?
It’s the world rebuilding our sense of belonging after it was destroyed by COVID and nation-wealth erosion of our cultural experiences.
I think so much of it has to do with it being the first tournament involving European teams post COVID (I guess 2021 but that was scattered across the continent so we didn’t get these scenes) that isn’t in a deplorable country. 

There was the farce that was the last World Cup, and then 2018 was in Russia.
The Balkans are trying their best for that to not be the case
Let’s not forget the Albanians committing the war crime of breaking spaghetti in front of the Italians. 
I also think the fans in the Spain-Italy match chanted a xenophobic version of a popular song, could be wrong tho.
Jokes aside, I wish this hateful behaviour is taken more seriously and not just brushed aside as “part of the game”
Try being half and half 🤣
Why is that?
At least you’re not norwegian 😞😞😞
Wdym Qatar is a country with deep football hist... lmao I couldn't get through it
Tour de France first. My eyes will be glued to the TV until September. Considering how hot it is, I'm okay with staying inside until then.
I try to not watch any more haramball than absolutely necessary.
They're not part of the EU anymore so they have already gotten used to standing alone in the dark
To be fair everything other than 180 minutes has been pretty fucking awesome for us as well. Its just those 180 minutes which are... **problematic**
It's a good reminder of what can happen if you don't vote in the people in power. Southgate's football has been the biggest motivator to get out and vote July 4th.

This is sort of a joke
Scottish people thrive on footballing disappointment. For Scotland, the victory conditions are "England getting papped out on penalties" and "Our fans are better liked than the English ones". We've won every tournament so far.
Pls explain
"saved" is a exaggerated. they helped, sure
lol
Turkish are the biggest immigrant group in Germany and it's just very normal to be friendly with them. Almost everyone has at least one Turkish friend here. Not sure if it's really as deep as you describe...
Hopefully not for Serbia/Croatia/Slovenia
the 90s were shit too:

pre over-usage of the word "vibes" vibes
The English wished the Brexit vote happened after this Euros
I've been thinking about this a lot. In a world where Joost won Eurovision with Europapa and the elections happened after these Euros, Volt would have gotten 60%
lol, you think AfDler are in any way influenced by good vibes?
There are still some state elections in autumn for example in Brandenburg.
Or made people be more patriotic and therefor vote for the parties that are the most openly patriotic.
Not going to pretend, that there are no nazis in our country, but pretty sure a big chunk are some russian bots. [I will look out for these accounts in the future and mess with them lol](https://x.com/ADioumaev/status/1802977366207308278)
what a dystopian shit that tournament was. [Just look at these "fans"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIziSmwRxKs)
> (Except England. We’re still hated 🙁)

I just hate how you play with the group of players you have. Not fulfilling potential seems to be a theme footballing wise and politics wise. I still hate that Brexit happened and would gladly take you back (but please don't be too smug about it :P)
If you lads could only be a little more like the Scots. They seem to be universally loved at the Euros.
I thought French people were most hated except their language everyone loves the French language.

Btw I like British People
Same spirit for the Olympics.  A summer of good vibes
Have yyou been to Qatar ? It was way better than whatever is currently going on in Germany with all the drunk fat fucks stincking and pissing all over the streets
Yeah, this is what a real football tournament looks like.
I am Very feel !
Still bought though
Well said!
I don’t
It's a pretty hard sell, but slightly more plausible than a Gala fan :)
2034

2030 it's in Spain, Portugal and Morocco
Another tournament in the dessert. Yeey /s
Yeah it was all so fake.
How am I a racist?
well, I understand you. Perhaps I would have said that too if the Netherlands had won the tournament. but as someone who has now been to several tournaments I can definitely say that Qatar was the worst. maybe it had a nice finale but outside of that it was awful. I found the atmosphere very cold. The country itself didn't really have any charisma either. I never felt really welcome for a moment. Alcohol consumption was limited. And so I can go on and on. No, it really had no appearance at all and it all felt incredibly fake.
I think some guy tried that already
What do you mean? I’m ignorant
I'd rather see the person who gave the flag accept the money than some random scumbag take it off him a few seconds later.
Also it's just a bystander filming. Not someone doing the act and filming themselves just to post on the Internet.
# yet
Humanity has conquered all! We should do this football thing more often!
It would've if Greece got in over Georgia
Nah, but many of the participating countries are supporting a genocide being conducted by a UEFA member. So that's a thing.
Along with standard leagues etc. They can play more games easy
That and the last two major tournaments that were in one location involving European teams were in Qatar and Russia. Not exactly burgeoning tourism destinations.
How so?
I think the Albanian fans had a "Kill the Serbs" chant and were waving the "greater Albania" flag again.
Spain Italy fans ofc they would
So do you have milk in your tea or not?
That would hurt twice
Because racism in Germany is still huge and gets a big comeback with the rightist party AfD
Only a dozen or so nations really care about the Tour de France, so not quite the same as the EUROs or Olympics.
They got good company in Switzerland and Norway (we never qualify in my life time)
*cries in Remain*
What has the EU got to do with the Euros?
Give it a few years. Government is about to change and the one coming in were all remainers. Not going to instantly go back in but the feelers are being sent.
Tories hate Southgate and his wokery, though
> We've won every tournament so far.

I want the new Scotland kit to have like 17 stars above the crest to represent this lmao
Will be good to watch England lose a shootout after a 0-0 draw against like..Switzerland or something
https://www.dw.com/en/turkish-guest-workers-transformed-german-society/a-15489210
German turks like to think that they were responsible for the wirtschaftswunder, while they only were needed after the economy really geared up a notch and germany needed cheap labour from italy, spain and turkey to work the undesirable jobs germans felt too fancy to do themselves. They were supposed to go back, but the contract was changed in the late 60's and they were allowed to bring there family to germany and this started the first generation of german turks

I dont know why im getting downvoted but there is a literal source from dw in this comment section from clouty saying the same thing lmao
they provided kebab to actual workers to save economy
It was a hyperbole lol
if we assume this person lived in Germany in the 1960s then he will most likely remember the Gastarbeiter. But you’re right, I don’t know this persons motivations, he may be happy for an entirely different reason.
Well a lot of them *have* been chanting about killing one another…
Nothing special happened to Slovenia, just a minor 10-day war, because we weren't relevant for Serbs.

For Western Europe, the 90s were definitely great. The Yugoslav wars were of course right on our doorstep, but apart from that there wasn't much to be worried about. The Cold War had just ended, and with it came an end to the constant looming threat of nuclear annihilation, the fall of the Iron Curtain and the reunification of Germany. The economy was on the up again and new technologies like the internet were changing the daily life of many people. Climate change was beginning to become a mainstream issue but it was still thought of as a problem for the future. It was a fairly optimistic time with a lot of possibilities.

I'd say the time period in between the end of the Cold War up until 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis was probably the peak of 'Western' civizilation. Every time period has its own challenges as well and it's not like it was some utopia. Some things have improved, but the general optimism of that era is definitely gone. Of course the experience living in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa or the post-Soviet states will have been very different.
"I can't believe we were so dull that all the other member states have voted to kick us out of the bloc"
you reckon if would have made a difference?
Yup would’ve been good, another stupid conservatives decision
England is a special case. They come into every championship expecting that THIS specific time it will be coming home, but somehow their wives end up with bruises by the end
>helped a bit.

I wasn't implying the AfD would be destroyed. I meant that maybe turnout is just a bit higher for pro-European parties and perhaps we have a more positive narrative around Europe as a whole than what we had for 4 weeks leading up to the election if we voted on July 14th.
If you look at how many young people voted for them I’m convinced it would’ve. These people are heavily influenced by whatever narrative tik tok accounts are pushing right now and make their choices based on that. A peaceful football summer would’ve certainly had enough of an impact to change the mind of some of these people.
Many AFD voters are pretty much only voting based on (negative) vibes and nothing else...

Also this is a great opportunity to get them out of their media bubble
the voting in the eu-elections were very influenced by emotions. im pretty sure positive emotions with a lot of foreigners in our country would have lead to a worse election for Afd.

and i am also quire sure that afd-voters in general base their votes on emotions more than the voters of other partys.
The German right wing isn't patriotic at all. They are selloffs to Russia and China. Fuck them.
man, I hope that's what most of these are. But the amount of visible racism has grown so much on social media (mainly twitter and tiktok) that I feel like it's gonna have a negative impact even if most of it is fake because all the closeted racists will suddenly feel like they should be more open about their ideology as well.
Clearly fake fans. No english fan would ever sing „southgate the super coach“
Uncanny valley. Black mirror shit.
Not impossible to believe that some South Asians might actually like England. Sure, most probably don't have the best memories of British colonialism, but in a region of over a billion people, I'm sure some think of the period more fondly. More believable than similar fans supporting a completely random country.
Only white fat blokes are real English fans? Or what are you suggesting?
I’m not on the pitch, mate, and I voted remain!
I mean, the only way the UK gets back in the EU is by grovelling and accepting all kinds of nonsense they never got before - nothing to really be smug about in that scenario.

If Brits could be smug about anything it's (rightly) being called out for having a huge population of right-wing idiots brainwashed into thinking Brexit might have been a great idea... and then a few years later, seemingly every country in Europe deciding to let all their right-wing idiots take them into fascism.

Like, the French actually think letting Le Pen and her crew in is gonna Make France Great Again? Lol.
> I still hate that Brexit happened and would gladly take you back

The new government coming in have said they can't go back in but they have already admitted they're ready to get a better deal than what we got (which was essentially nothing thanks to the Tories and Boris) but the signs of going back in are already there.

TLDR: Please forget about us being cunts for the past 8 years.

Also yes, we hate how we play football too.
They’re never there long enough for people to get sick of them, that’s what it is!
Life without the yanks
I knew about the behaviour part, but to be honest I didn’t know they had weight requirements for the fans that they hired. Good to know.
That's not how buying things works.
He likely is, but I liked your initial comment anyway :)

And I love harira!
I'll take it, ^(I love you) have a nice day
With a bit of South America sprinkled in.
AND South America for a bit.
Oh yeah the 2030 WC which they hold in 3 continents (with SA games for some reason too) to justify them holding it in Asia (read Middle East) again the time after
Because only idiotic racists write garbage like you did trying to gatekeep a global competition with the insinuation that it should be held in European/Western places rather than places YOU deem to not be civilized or sporting enough.

This is EXACTLY what a Racist does and what FIFA used to, Literally pre-Havalenge. 

Fortunately Football is no longer in control by morons like you and rest of the world gets to share in it.

You can keep the Euro's, non-Europeans aren't vying for hosting it. 

World Cups or Olympics & any Actual Global Event WILL continue to happen in rest of the world, including West Asia, China, India, Africa, South America.

Get used to it. Or not since that is usually what racists do.

As an IK Start-supporter you should be used to constant disappointments by now. I know I am. God I miss the 90s…
I would hope so, I love visiting the country and have probably seen more places than the average Brit but all the additional hoops to jump through now you're no longer an EU country made me go elsewhere for short city trips.
Downvotes come from the tone and way you're belittling, generalizing and putting down the largest minority group in Germany.
okay sure, but what exactly would have happened to the german economy if those folks hadn't come in to fill out jobs germans didn't want?
well, its very common for germans with turkish ancestors to claim that it was saved by their parents and grandparents and that they were responsible for the "Wirtschaftswunder"
They secretly love each other deep down, wishing death on each other is just how they were raised to show love for their neighbours
A lot of them is nice way to say, Croatia out of those up there
Fantastic country though. In my experience Slovenia is the best of the former Yugoslav region.
Ah yes, the war which lasted 10 days, but Slovenia still captured about 20% of the entire JNL army.
according to the Serbian government definitely not a genocide of Bosnians
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars
Possible. There is actually a fairly well-documented effect of the German parliament voting on unpopular laws during major tournaments, as both the people don't care as much and the press prefer to write about football. For instance during both the 2006 and 2010 world cups, taxes were raised.

As for Brexit: People just tend to be happier during big tournaments, and happier people tend to vote less far-right. Brexit was in essensce a far-right position that Cameron somehow brought to the mainstream.
Not even sure but it would've been better than what they got now
[deleted]
That's just nonsense really. It's basically only Rio Ferdinand who really thinks we're going to win every time
Agreed. For us in Germany, these Euros might also give an economic boost that if it's quickly noticeable (no idea how long this stuff takes to pass through to the statistics), could have an effect on the Landtagswahlen in the east.

It was painfully obvious that Qatar paid some people to act as fans. Wasn't just England but a bunch of countries.

Yeah it's ridiculous. I thought the example of brexit would show people how stupid people like Lepen or the afd are but alas...
Tory bashing is easy but Cameron wanted to stay in the EU and fix it from within. He let democracy take over but didn't prevent Boris from lying about the £350m a week we'd be saving.

They only did this so they could host it in Saudi Arabia without a competing bid from South America.

FIFA needs a democratic revolution. The question is not when at this point, but how?
Nothing I said had anything to do with race in any way. It is nothing personal against it’s people. I would say the same if it’s hosted in the Australian outback.
I’m happy you liked it. For me it was hot, boring, strict, lifeless and fake. The parties that where there were either small, very enforce of just extremely boring. 

I was in Hamburg last weekend. The whole city was partying. Every bar or club was full of people having a good time. No matter what country you are from. You could have a drink on the streets. You could go to the stripclub, walk through the red light district. It didn’t feel like being watched all the time by the police state like Qatar. And my female friends felt like they had way more freedom. And inside the stadium was so much more noice. Qatar felt like a library compared to Germany.
Ah right. Cheers. Every day’s a school day 👍
Cheers! Learnt something new today. I knew that there was a large population of Turkish people but I didn’t know that it was centered in Dortmund.
My favorite food I had in Germany was kebab

True. My ex's family were Iranian and I think that's a similar sort, pretty tasty.
Correct answer
If you get something like Yorkshire tea or just pick up some teabags called English breakfast, you can try. It's very different to tea in Turkey. If you wanna go even crazier, go Malaysian style and brew strong black tea and pour some condensed milk in to sweeten it, it's very nice (just not healthy haha) 
I am born in 96. I dont know the good times of us winning the league
What hoops are you referring to? 

We were never in shengen so I don't see what you're talking about
One of the many issues with Brexit. Was "supposed" to make everything easier but now everything is 10x more complicated.
But this is just the truth, no matter how it sounds this is just the simple reality. Im not putting them down, im just explaining history. Germany needed people to do the blue collar jobs, so we could meet the increased demand because of the economic boom.
Businesses would have just made the payment more apertizing for guest workers to come
I grew up in Germany too you know. It's not that they claim they saved the economy or whatever, you're missing the point. It's the once bad neighborhood/areas that were full of immigrants that have transformed it into a better place is what they're trying to say

Or chanting [“Vladimir Putin”](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMr6D2Adg/) when a participating country is in an existential war against Russia?

Nationalists of any kind can eat a bag of dicks, but to try and point a finger at one of us — when we both know how deep this shit goes on all sides — is disgraceful.
It does help we were part of Austria/HRE for 1000 years. So thank you:)
It was also the richest of the lot, so that helped, I guess.
I think this is an idealist view that probably wouldn't have been reality. 

England have been shit. Half the England team is not white. Racism abounds and racists aren't smart.
> Brexit was in essensce a far-right position that Cameron somehow brought to the mainstream.

Pressure had been building since around 2008 when Farage went from 1 Question Time appearance every year or so to 3 -4 appearances a year. Cameron got backed into a corner by his backbenchers and instead of fighting off the revolt he buckled, gave them what they wanted, and then fucked it
Brexit is not a far-right position, given the fact that many on the left (Labour) supports it as well in the name of workers' rights. That's why Labour never officially had a position on Brexit. Part of the reason Corbyn lost so much in 2019 was Labour's confusing manifesto on Brexit. 

Immigration / trade protectionism in general has historically been not a right vs left issue. In the US for example, Bernie Sanders used to be against illegal immigration, and against trade deals like the TPP, on the grounds that it would hurt US workers. That is until his voting base made it clear to him that they were pro-immigration.

To be very clear, I do not support Brexit. I'm just pointing out that Labour / the left holds a fair share of blame for the Brexit mess as well.
Cameron chose to have the referendum in the first place. That's probably what they're referring to
It's not about specific countries or direct connections within Europe. It's more about the general mood of the people. If people have a bad mood they are prone to doom scrolling or believing in bad news more (even if they are fake). If they are in a good mood this doesn't happen as much.
Now kith
He primarily called it because of a vocal minority in his party and fears of UKIP growing so tried to do that to squash them permanently and protect himself and it blew up in everyone's face. So even though he wanted to remain, his gamble is one of the worst gambles ever and it's still costing us to this day. But at least we know now that he's not the only one there who likes to gamble.
dont get surprised you if next copa america is in saudi arabia or some shit, corrupt mfs
> Nothing 

You LITERALLY mentioned a country that has Literally NOTHING to do with Euros.

You did not invoke 2012 Euros when it was spread over 2 countries that barely were able to meet the economic conditions of hosting this event.   
You did not mention 2016 when event was expanded the quality of the Sporting performances itself (as expected) dropped even more.

You Intentionally leaped to mention a Country, i.e. People's of a part of this planet, as somehow undeserving of Hosting a Global Football Event. 

Even if is one accepts one had a brain fart moment and forgot this is Euro's and not a WC, Yet that brain fart moment is itself subconscious socio-culturally ingrained racism, because no sane person thinks like this to begin with. Racists (overt or those who hide it in non-anonymised public setting) think like this and this is not that uncommon in West/US/Europe. It will be seen again in 2 months when Olympics happens. 

It's an age old trope & you used it and yes it's Racist because it's targeting a People based on their place/origin/ethnicity & culture/traditions/norms & different stage of development historical arc. YOUR football traditions are NOT Universal or Absolute and as stated fortunately FIFA agrees.

There is NOTHING wrong with Qatar or China, India, Africa, South America hosting the Football World Cup. Those who disagree are INDEED on racist spectrum and actual racists when context aligns (which your's did given World Cup has nothing to do with Euro's).

Now we even have Sahin as our manager to represent it well! ALtho he's from slightly south of the centre of Dortmund haha
There are many in the Ruhr altogether. Enormous populations of them came to mine in the 20th century. That’s why Gelsenkirchen is a depressing lil thing but gosh the food cures the depression faster than the weather pushes it.
Döner?
Your pfp makes the reply so much funnier
Hahaha we are a rare bunch that's for sure! 
Don't listen to this man, tea should never be mixed with milk. That is blasphemy!
Born in the early 80s mysef. I never experienced winning a title, but from like ‘92 to ‘98 we were in contention for the title almost every season and had a squad that arguably should have won at least one. Mykland, Dahlum, Strandli, Eftevaag, Lydersen, Belsvik, Svindal Larsen, Frode Olsen - I’m sure I’ve forgotten a few, but these names will forever be a part of my memory.
I'm not discussing history.  I'm just trying to help you see why you're getting downvoted, but you seem more keen on defending your statement than learning.
>It's not that they claim they saved the economy

Thats quite literally what I often read.. or "we rebuilt germany after ww2" no mate thats a few decades before that
> Since when is it acceptable to say ‘Kosovo is Serbia’?

They still consider it as part of their country, and many countries don't recognize Kosovo's independence. Why would it be unacceptable?
Where does the name slovenia come from if i may ask? Cuz as far as i know there was Duchy of Cilli and small County of Carniola in hre right from the current slovenian borders
That's the spirit!
I'll kiss you if they won't :*
A location doesn’t have a race. The people for as far as I’ve met are perfectly fine. The location was just very shit. And I mean very shit. Nothing to do with race or anything just location. Nothing personal.
Man woke up and decided to spend his day virtue-signaling on Reddit.

The fact that Qatar had to rent fans to create a semblance of an atmosphere is more than proof than it was a terrible location for a host.

But hey, racism I guess.
You're the only one bringing race into this
Who says I have to? I said I could? I had the freedom to do so. It didn’t feel like a police state. My female friends weren’t being told to shut up every time they wanted to party and sing. They could dress however they wanted to. 

And like I said Qatar felt like a library. The atmosphere that was there was quite, boring or/and enforced. Perhaps that is your thing! That’s cool and all. But I prefer a more atmospheric setting with the freedom it comes with. 

And perhaps the slave labor etc gave it an even a more awkward feeling to it all
Yep!
So you’ve never had chai?? Billions of people drink tea with milk lol
I remember Start in 2005. Almost. 9 year old me was gutted
This wasn't even a harsh tone imo, but let us just agree to disagree
Yeah I'll be honest I never heard that before? 

After ww2 you had a lot of yugoslavian gastarbeiters who immigrated to Germany to work and a lot eventually settled. This was 60s-70s, where as a large Turkish influx didn't happen till later if I'm not mistaken, so how could they claim they rebuilt it after ww2?
Sure, “many” don’t recognize Kosovo.

The majority, however, do:

> As of 4 September 2020, 104 out of 193 (53.9%) United Nations member states, 22 out of 27 (81.5%) European Union member states, 28 out of 32 (87.5%) NATO member states, 4 out of 10 (40%) ASEAN member states, and 34 out of 57 (59.6%) Organisation of Islamic Cooperation member states have recognised Kosovo.[4]

And the International Court of Justice ruled the secession as legal per international law.
One of the first mentions was by our protestant reformer Trubar (one of most important persons in Slovene history), when he wanted to address all the Slavs living in the area where people spoke Slovene language (as ''dear Slovenes''). That of course means the term was in use even before that, probably to describe a specific ethnic and linguistic group of "Alpine Slavs" that later became modern Slovenes. 

It started to be used widely in mid 1800s with the spring of nations (with idea of United Slovenia, when in 1848 Slovenian tri-colour flag was first waved in Ljubljana). And Carniola (Krain) you mentioned was a part of an Austrian state where Slovenes lived, along with few other regions.

A Location doesn't exist in a vacuum either, there are people there, no shit. 

You didn't peddle it be Sahara or Amazon or Antarctica (which is equivalent to the non-specific adage/saying of "*In the middle of Nowhere*"). It's a fictitious attempt to now suggest you didn't mean to invoke Qatar in any way other than to be disparaging and demeaning to it. That's the entire point of your original comment. 

Qatar WC was more than fine (outside of Sporting terms, because in that context it was anyway THE greatest WC in history of this sport).  

It was within a 3-hour journey for 2+ Billion People spread over 3 Continents, never before has such a thing happened.   
Perfect Timezone for a global event (2014 FIFA data itself showed and 2026 will corroborate it *After* Normalizing for expanded nature of it, i.e. True Global Events held in Americas has NO peer in the world in being worst, because that is how Earth's Geogrpahy it, they can't help it).  

Qatar WC also was the safest WC in history for Women travelers and other fans in general too.  
Also the teams enjoyed it as well since travel time between matches was cut down and thus allowed them to Rest & Prepare properly (Players like Messi have spoken about how this helped them).    
Same for Fans, a huge chunk of whom watched 2 matches in a single day and some even more than 2. Something that has never happened to this degree before.

There were Videos made by British traveling fans who got invited to feasts and parties in random Qatari folks home, whom they met at fan hubs & on streets. It's literally on tiktok & youtube.

YOU are the ones who created this ridiculous comparative dynamic of Football cultures explicitly mentioning A Place. 

Qatar saw ALL the European teams fans being THE worst in creating an atmosphere in the stadium. It was a theme. Pathetic display. 

Even Americans fans were better than them in stadium. African teams had the best fans and then South American and Asian teams. Somehow only Europeans travelling fans were affected, Human beings coming from rest of the Actual World were having a blast.

So yes your comment WAS racist.

Least of all the fact that Qatar had a World Cup, you are peddling a narrative that is contextual on there being a regional/continental competition, i.e. Euros.

That is unhinged subconscious socio-cultural honed attitudes spilling out in the open.

Edit: Just stumbled upon this Pitches in Copa America 2024 stories that's going on. You didn't bother to mention that as representative example, i.e. An actual International competition being managed incompetently of the highest order where Players can not even play properly, let alone every thing you thought was credible for hosting an Event.
It is essentially our national dish. Not even joking - Germany has a lot of different regional foods, and almost none of them are well-liked throughout the whole country. But Döner is universal. It's a favourite in every city and village, and there will be a Döner-shop in every single one. With a kindly Turkish man who calls you "Chef" (German for boss) and just knows it makes your whole day.
Love it!
Yeah, that season was almost like a fever dream, but sadly it was a fluke. Ended the next season 6th, and degradation in 2007. But man were Doffen, Strømstad and the rest fun to watch!
We all disagree
What? Yugoslavian Gastarbeiter after WW2? No.
Yugoslavian Gastarbeiter started after 1968, the contract between Yugoslavia and Germany came 7 years after the one with Turkey.
Right, so it's disputed by Serbia and not recognized by almost half of the UN members. Not sure why the EU and NATO states matter in this case. It's like telling Albanians that Russia doesn't recognize Kosovo. 
At best it's a disputed region.

I'm not arguing the status of Kosovo. I'm just saying that either Serbs or Albanians saying it's theirs isn't anything terrible .

What's really unacceptable is when they chant to kill Serbs/Albanians/etc.
Tnx for the information,i always wondered where the name came from
Indeed i have for a decent amount of time then started reading history books
Extremely long story buddy. Still doesn’t make me a racist. I really don’t prefer this location and that has nothing to do with racism.
Not to mention inflation being measured mostly by Döner price.
What do you mean no? I have family who literally were this lol
“I sent a fake mole to give you fake information!” Might be the worst lie, if not, the worst executed plan I’ve ever seen in a rap battle
After sitting down and really thinking on it, Drake’s shock on IG to Meet the Grahams/Not Like Us, the way Meet the Grahams seemingly addressed Drake’s tactic in Family Matters, on top of it being released only 30 minutes after, which could only be possible with a mole. The time it took him to respond if it was all apart of his plan, the lack of video/proof of him setting up the fake mole with his guys, not even a name drop or hint to said fake mole….It’s all just makes me facepalm because if this fake mole does exist, Drake went about carrying out the retaliation so poorly.

And that’s not even the worst part once you consider more lyrics in The Heart Part 6. Kendrick called him a habitual liar, to which he responds with something that’s looking more like a lie by the day (a fake mole). Kendrick said he would, “Fabricate stories on the family front cause you heard Mr Morale” to which he misinterprets Mother I Sober as Kendrick getting molested instead of his mom….

It’s all really just a pitiful end to something that started off as so great from both sides.
My brothers, the man literally said:


"If I was really fucking young girls, I'd already be arrested." 


and


"I'm too famous to be a pedo" 


In a fucking diss track. Drake fans claim he's some god tier lyricist but goddamn that shit is some of the worst lines in hip hop history.
“Shape the stories how you want. Hey, drake, they’re not slow” hits harder after we realize drake is full of shit
The same guy who dropped bars about Kendrick rapping like he's trying to free the slaves which gave Kendrick an entire verse to bury him with.

People really think he's playing chess and shit. Dot had that man mapped out a wk ahead of time he was so predictable lol
It’s definitely “jokes on you, I was only pretending to be retarded” meme vibes.
- I planted a fake mole with fake info!
- yeah Kendrick knew the entire contents of family matters and directly mentioned the track on euphoria and 616inLA. And then immediately dropped a diss responding to the track within minutes making me look terrible. But it was actually all part of my plan that Kendrick out maneuver me!
- it just doesn’t add up. Man had too much info that was correct. If he leaked it himself he’s the biggest idiot in rap
Compare the time between the Meet the Grahams release after Family Matters, and how long it took The Heart Part 6 to release. There was no triple agent lmao.
“Don’t tell no lies bout me, I won’t tell truths about you.”    

“Rabbit is hole is deeper I can go further I promise.”
-I planted fake info for Kendrick to make a diss track about

-but I didn’t have anything prepared for when he’d do it and had my “red button” roll out without a single mention of this mole plan

-also I don’t like that Kendrick is spreading the fake info I gave him so I want to quit

this man is spiraling???
Furthermore, Family Matters (good diss ngl), Drake makes outlandish claims like saying Kendrick never goes back to Compton to plant any money trees (when it's well-known Kendrick is active in Compton often and has put money there), and says Kendrick called the Tupac estate and begged them to take it down (sounds utterly unbelievable, but ironic when Drake tried a cease and desist on Like That). Add them all together, and yeah, all Drake managed to do was successfully prove Kendrick's point. What an idiot (and what a truly dreadful person).
I'll admit if it's true then it's genius but he is undercutting himself. The Heart Part 6 was objectively bad after the fake mole bit. He hurt himself more on the pedo allegations, and the Mother I Sober misinterpreting is glaring. Let alone naming the song THP6. If you go back and resd the lyrics to THP5, it's about the culture and what that meant to kendrick. One of the main accusations is that Drake is a culture vulture. 
Appropriating the title to a song about the culture to defend himself from culture vulture allegations is some top tier colonizer shit.


This was just so bad and the longee it sits the worse it gets. Kendrick has been the only one to provide receipts - Meet The Grahams picture and the 20 minute release after Drake dropped Family Matters. If Drake wants to stay in the game he's gotta show some proof past quoting a Twitter thread x.x and even then he still didn't properly handle the pedo allegations. Invoking Epstein (instead dof Weinstein) in the song and following it with, "If I was a pedo I would be arrested", and "in too important to be a pedo." is absolutely wild. How does that get through the final edit..
To me the most slept on bars of the whole battle were at the very end of Euphoria where Kendrick says "if you takin it there, I'm taking it further, and that's something you don't wanna do" then he ends it with an ominous ghostly "oooh" sound. Hearing that in hindsight still sends a shiver down my spine.

This was a warning shot to Drake not to release Family Matters and that the respons(es) to it were already locked and loaded. There were so many hints in Euphoria that Kendrick had heard the track before it was released and was ready for it. 

"I can even predict your angle. Fabricating stories on the family front."  Then the whole "Family Crodie" verse.
Kendrick used supersonic 

Drake became confused 

Drake hurt himself in his confusion

Drake fainted 

Summarizes this whole battle.
He said something like whoever sending you information is pussy  a few seconds later same song he said he planted it
If Drake is lying about the mole that’s obviously a huge L for him. If Drake is telling the truth then it’s still a bigger L for him than Kendrick. You tryna tell me you gave this man your Ozempic script when you just clowned Ross sayin he uses Ozempic, you gave him a sleepin pill bottle of shit used for date rape when you expected him to call you a rapist and child molester, and let him step on your release just to you could say haha you believed I did the same deadbeat dad shit I’ve already been busted for before? That was your whole plan? How does that make Kendrick look dumber than Drake? Not to mention the way he played himself with “the leak’s a clown, it’s me I’m the clown” bars.
I think the moral of the story is don’t try to rap battle a Pulitzer Prize winner when you use ghost writers.
Drake makes music for people shopping in Target
I been a deadbeat in purpose so you can call me that but I really am a great dad! Bro it doesn’t work like that!
At first I thought this was a half decent angle, but the more I study this track the more I find inaccuracies and contradictory statements. It makes me question how anyone could ever put the words 'introspective' and 'Drake' in the same sentence. SMH man. SMH
It’s so funny because I actually do believe that the mole was fake and the daughter stuff is B.S. I just think that drake is so fucking stupid that he actually fumbled the bag this bad💀. 

Like mf’er how are you gonna call yourself a decorated war general and then literally fuck up the only thing you had to do. The man drew ever piece of exodia and forgot to play them💀
It’s fucked up because drake knows he can just say anything and his core fans will just take it as gospel and back him. Even if drake ends up getting raided and arrested they would probably say he was set up
The fact drake STILL hasn't show a single piece of proof ... that dude is lying AGAIN lmao 

The simple fact kendrick directly referenced things said on family matters proves he actually has a mole in drakes circle. If not, that's one of the greatest songs to ever to written in 10min.
I’m not even mad Drake fans are riding him at this point, they don’t matter. The people have spoken, we don’t want the cultural appropriator, we want the rapper who’s been authentic his entire career. Why would Drake stupid ass think lying about something he can easily prove to be true? Dude showed us how brain dead he is with THP6
To top it off, the “info” he claimed to plant for Dot was the “fake” daughter story. Why would you plant something that can only ever be proven? It’s impossible to disprove the daughter story, unless we test every girl in the world I guess?
Bros security guard been leaking inside juice and got shot for it lmaooooooooooo
Drake’s already been caught lying in this beef hasn’t he? Dude said he didn’t send a cease & desist on Like That, but Metro showed that they actually did get a C&D from his label, right? He even accused Kendrick of having Tupac’s estate do a C&D on Taylor Made lmao 

Idk how anyone could listen to that final line & think he isn’t talking out of his ass lmao. Metro’s screen cap just further shows he was making shit up at least since Family Matters
Using AI Pac is unforgivable. Perfect demonstration of how fake Drake is. He's the real Canadian J Roc especially after Tom Mickey D's endorsement. Never thought someone would make Vanilla Ice more legitimate.
On MTG Kendrick says “you lied about your daughter”. Drake never said anything about a daughter ever before, I don’t think. That very line could be him knowing it was a lie all along which would really put him 3 steps ahead of everything.
Heart 6 was ultimate proof that Drake:

1. Has yes men around him, cause no way anyone that has some balls would let him say some of those lines in the booth

2. Had ZERO prep for this battle cause this whole track shows he was all over the place.. “clowns fed you info”… “i fed you info”… dont wanna argue w a woman beater it feeds ur nature.. ok so u a woman now?… millie bobby brown bar? Oh lord

3. Posts screenshot of Dave comment but not proof of setting up Kendrick w fake info? WHAT!?

4. Outro was def him finding a way out and on the defensive after Kendrick dropped a MASSIVE bop

5. Most important…hes so out of touch with the culture.. slave line was what the fuck moment..then he turned a whole coast against him and gave power to Kendrick without Kendrick having to do jack shit to force him into it

Hes done.

He will still do numbers and wont be affected in mainstream, but he wont ever be able to post another pic w Sexy Redd or do an ATL feature without getting clowned.
Even if he planted a fake mole he still lost lol that’s the thing
“I only wanted you to think I was a dead beat dad and a pedophile! Got you!”
I think Drake sent a fake mole that turned on him

How else would Kendrick be in contact with OVO to get the MTG cover ?
So many SKU's
Something I haven't seen brought up alot in this is that it looked like there was something else to the left of meet the grahams cover. So if there was something else to zoom out and show why did drake only list the things already revealed in the photo as planted?
Drake got owned, that's it. His raps are terrible. He's not a battle rapper, and when he tried, he flopped
Drake failed the QuickTime event
You do realize that line he says “whoever gave you this fake info is a clown” and then two lines later he says “I fed you this information over the course of a few weeks”. He called himself a clown.
Man really said “I’m famous, if I liked little kids I would be in jail” uhhhh that’s your argument bro?
You know it's not true because nobody would plant info on themselves that there's a pedo. Who does that?
Idk but I’m still gonna listen to both of em and that’s all that matters.
Doth protest too much…
Drake going to his creative team like...

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmDcCpD1gc
Show the kid. This could literally have ended 20mins after the song
comprehension skills are low in this sub
I dont think Dot is that dumb also if you planted it you should have recorder some evidence and i agree it will give Drake the win of this whole beef.
Drake said Kendrick was a hypocrite for supporting R Kelly. Wouldn’t that mean that Drake was a sex offender as well? Drake basically admitted guilt with that line.
It's not just a worst lie, it's also the worst truth to admit to. "Yeah man, I actually wanted everyone to think I was a two times deadbeat dad and a date rapist".
I’ve never seen so much hate for one person on this app lol.
I listen to Drakes music and he’s one of my favorite artists but my god he‘s done for.. he already lost the battle. He really is weird af though as a person.
There is one place in all this where we know Kendrick was lying and where Drake told the truth.

1. Kendrick lied when he said he didn't have a hating bone in his body and

2. Drake told the truth when he said he didn't fuck with Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers. Because he clearly didn't listen more than once
According to Drake, if we run with his sloppy narrative, they thought about giving Kendrick a fake name and destination. Basically, the info Kendrick would need to figure out it was fake.

Dumbasses.

Story makes absolutely no sense and has no credibility. Instantly dismissed as top tier bullshit.
My thought is this:

If Drake's camp was feeding Kendrick information in order to play him,  why not say so after Kendrick released 6:16? The picture is clearly the cover art for 6:16 just not zoomed out.

If Drake addressed that after 6:16 but before Meet the Grahams, then Meet the Grahams doesn't happen and all the Kendrick's momentum is gone. And Drake would presumably win since he would have give Kendrick a bunch of blanks to fire.
Drake actually did the "I do not diddle kids! It's no good diddling kids!" song from It's Always Sunny & his fans are sticking with him
i was driving to work in the AM listening to the heart part 6, i was in shock at how bad it was and somehow it ruined my entire day 💀
Kendrick actually had a mole while Drake claims to have a mole lol
The only part that might have been an intentional leak was the 11 year old daughter since there is no proof of that just yet, but no way you take the photo and not have a video setting it up if it was fake.
"The ones you're getting your stories from are all clowns" to "We plotted for a week and fed you the information"

so is Drake calling himself a clown? I am guessing the mole is real and BBL Drizzy is trying to play it off like he is a mastermind.
Thank you for noticing the last thing you said. Mother I Sober went over most peoples head. Matter of fact i think whole Mr Morale album did
If the mole is real, then where’s the proof?
I think one of more cringe parts of the song is where Drake tried to respond to Kendrick’s “A minor” silver bullet with that D major shit
Kendrick gave Drake too much credit by calling him a master manipulator. He’s a really shitty liar
Drake is a fake flake who deserves to be in the fire lake. He obviously is no shaman, but he should be ashamed for being a con man. Hopefully people see right through this joke. He's so transparent you don't even have to poke.
Can’t be he if fell for it. Some of y’all be on some other shit man…
Indeed: let me put out fake information so that I have to go on the defensive, and then tell everyone that I planted that information in the most unconvincing fashion ever. 


The man is truly brilliant with the 4D chess /s, even if what he claimed were true. 
I think the planning would have seemed better if the execution was better
People really have nothing going on in their life huh 🤔
If people are calling you a pedo, you don’t go on a diss track and say, “I’m not a pedo and here’s why”. The question that immediately raises is why you would feel the need to address it if it isn’t true?
Nah he just on another IQ level than anyone that thinks it’s implausible.  Y’all gotta stop doubting this man he’s unstoppable.  It’s been almost 20 years of this j1gga.

So thats less believable than Kendrick actually rapping about a fake daughter?
None of them have proof so the burden doesn't just lie on Drake but also Kendrick, why can't you at least try to be unbiased.

He is instilling doubt in Kendrick saying he did get molested. Using distrust as an angle to explain Kendrick's obsession with pedophilia. Attempting to reopen his wounds and deliberately not believing Kendrick to relive his trauma. Kendrick himself hinted that he still had doubts whether he was molested in Mother I by saying "still having doubts, hard to trust myself" after denying it. The point is it doesn't matter if it's true or not, Drake's using it as a weapon to hurt Kendrick.
The fact that people care this much is insane who reaps the rewards of these two beefing? UNIVERSAL does its also to distract from their CEO being named in the Diddy lawsuit but yea lets ignore that while the two biggest artists have a an argument over a bunch of hearsay shit man kendrick says right in the beginning “Hey drake i HEARD you like em young”note he didn’t say i KNOW or even “I SEEN” its literally a bunch of crap he seen online and ran with it its the equivalent of having an argument and yelling over the other person but apparently having no evidence is enough to make you correct nowadays shit man even pusha t had proof
I'm just gonna leave this here, this is fridgehiphop, a known kendrick stan.

People keep saying this. Where exactly did Meet The Grahams address Family Matters? 

Whereas the Family Matters has the mole scene, the ‘daughter’ sticking the finger up etc.

Then Kendrick drops Meet The Grahams claiming the daughter thing.. 

Not trying to pick sides here just curious. My take of Meet The Grahams was purely a drop on top to wash it out, not a direct response and I don’t see any reference.
What makes yall think that was a diss record? Yall don’t have to like it but with everything you know about diss records what makes you think that’s what this was? 

To me it was clear as day that it wasn’t a diss record? Sure there may have been so jabs in there but it was not a full on diss record.
Oh brother lol the way anything the man say is spun as a negative is tired. Switch the topics up at this point.
Honestly this was embarrassing from start to finish like most modern rap beefs. None of these songs are bangers anyone will remember 3 months from now nevermind actually listen to it again.
You're coping
Drop the receipts for the daughter or shut the fuck up. I think in reality Drake actually did bait Kendrick with the fake daughter story and all the Kdot Stan’s are in full cope by criminally investigating ozempic prescriptions
Reddit wants Drake to be a pedo so bad. Wild
Didn't kendrick beat his wife
[removed]
I’ve said this before but I really think Drake did get Kendrick and his team on the whole fake daughter which was why Kendrick dropped Not Like Us right after because the PEDO allegations were the true bombs for the diss. 

If he didn’t release Not Like Us then I think public perception would’ve stayed on the fake daughter topic more than the pedo allegations because no one wants to mess with that topic. I think Kendrick noticed that within the first few hours + the goading from OVO saying he got played so he had to keep going on the offensive to keep the attention on what he wanted to reveal about Drake. He never mentions the daughter again in Not Like Us.

My point is that EVEN THOUGH Kendrick seemed to have been fed bad information - it doesn’t fucking matter because he will just pivot and focus the attention on something even crazier. A real War General.
[deleted]
Don't forget the *"Drake is not a name that you gon' see on no sex offender list"* line. If he's on the Sex Offender list it isn't going to show up as Drake, it would be listed as Aubrey Graham.

On God he used ChatGPT or something to help him write it. It's not clever, half the lines either make no sense, bring up shit that kendrick never said (Epstein instead of Weinstein), or just contradict other things he said. And at one point his rhymes end in "-ation" for 14 bars in a row.
Lazy ass stuff plus completely illiterate as to the recent history of sexual absuse cases. Epstein, Weinstein, R Kelly, Diddy ongoing…there are so many cases of the rich & powerful getting away with all kinds of sex crimes. Took YEARS for Weinstein and R Kelly to go down, we’ll probably never get the full story about Epstein (not to mention all the super rich/powerful/famous people who may have been involved with that shit), and who knows how long legal drama with Diddy will go on for. 

Fame might be a bigger sign of guilt than innocence at this point 😂 (NOT saying Drake is guilty of anything, nothing is true until proven, just saying it’s a wild way for Drake to go about defending himself).
Shows what happens when he has to respond fast and doesn’t have writers able to write his stuff for him. 

TH6 has to be one of the worst diss tracks I’ve ever seen and his fans are acting like it’s the kill shot lmao
I guess it gets overshadowed by the stuff you and OP mentioned which is understandable but I also feel like the last “verse” of TH6 where he is basically just talking is so wack. He sounds so defeated and honestly almost like he’s on the verge of tears or smth
Right after he compared himself to Epstein, who famously got away with running a pedo ring for years. Like is he trying to make himself look guilty?
I can't get over that he doesn't even say he's not. He's just like "I can't be because *dumb reasons*". Oddly comes across ad not even quite denying
Drake: “Everyone feeding you shit is a clown!”

Also Drake: “Yea we plotted it and fed you shit for a week.”

I mean, he wasn’t wrong I guess lol
![gif](giphy|5hHOBKJ8lw9OM)
He wrote that listening to Satisfy You by Diddy featuring R Kelly
OJ put up better defenses than Drake.

Unbelievable
Well said. One of the issues I have with most “radio rap” like Drake is that producers are so good these days that lots of rappers have gotten fucking lazy.  Rappers who put a ton of thought into each bar are a dying breed.
Drake really hit Kendrick with the “nuh uh”
[removed]
He's almost definitely a pedo.
All his writers bailed on him. Now it’s just Jimmy from degrassi in his wheel chair
There's a reason why he has compilation vids of all his terrible/corny lines
You can tell he had no ghostwriters on that track 😂
Have you seen the mental gymnastics going on in that sub?

This is the same guy that that praises 2 women beaters while calling kdot a women beater 😭 dude be with baka and shouted out Chris Brown on a track he claims Kendrick hit his wife on it’s hilarious
And he has the nerve to say at the end of the song that he is glad that the beef happened because he had to bust his pen game out for once, which is a really funny thing to admit given the ghostwriting accusations and how terribly written the song is. Lol all around terrible response from drake
He said some corny line about split and pants might rip.  I cringed when I heard that shit.  It was just a poor ass metaphor if you could call it that.
How do you overlook this bar lol? I thought Kendrick fans were some type of intellectuals yet this is seen at face value.

The point is that Drake is so famous that he's on MJ's level. He has all of the spotlight on him and everyone is rooting for his downfall highlighting all his mistakes and missteps. Therefore he's saying that if he did do something horrible, he'd already be finished. All his darkest secrets have already been revealed. MJ was also someone who was going through false accusations.
> Hey, drake, they’re not slow

His fans specifically are slow af lmao just wait 'til they invade this thread
I’m starting to think Kendrick meant his *own* fans aren’t slow. Because them Drake ones? They prove that statement to be wrong. 🥴
More than a week.

Dot been on this since 2014.

Dude from ESPN thats from Compton, had a show where Drake talked A LOT of shit on Kendrick. After filming dude calls Top Dawg and tells them and Top says keep quiet say nun.

Drakes team then reaches out to delete the interview since its pre taped. They say no, cause its a massive scoop, then Drake threatens not to host the ESPYS that year so execs scrap the interview.

But TDE knew it happened.

Kendrick been knowing this was happening at some stage, which makes perfect sense that Euphoria is so damn flawlessly written compared to 616 or Not Like Us which while are bops do sound fresher tracks and not as mixed as well as Euphoria, which was even produced so damn well even to the snares and chimes in different sections.
More than a week, this has been years in the making for Kendrick and Drake walked right into it
Did you hear the line after the slaves line? I swear people are cherry-picking so hard
[removed]
Wait family matters was mentioned in euphoria and 616? What lyrics?
Do most rap lack critical thinking or are y’all 15 and just talking 

The mole is real and the mole leaked family matters to Kendrick, which is why Kendrick had MTG ready 15 min later. that picture for MTG is obviously something Drake set up, the picture ironic as hell and is an Easter egg to every person drake dissed this beef, also why would drakes dad have this stuff? 

That’s why in the heart 6 Drake says “who gave you the info was a clown” but “we set up the information 11 yo daughter I bet he takes it”  after the mole was discovered it’s implied Drake used this mole unknowingly to outsmart Kendrick.

Now wether you believe this or not irdc but y’all acting like this ^ isn’t the story is wild
Plus seems like he actually wrote the heart 6 with those cringy lines
Heart Part 6 literally came out a day, maybe a day and a half later. Yall acting like he took 5 business days.
The Heart Part 6 came out within 24 hours of Not Like Us. And it already had impressive flips and rebuttals to it like the B Sharp bar.
But pedo allegations with no proof are truths 🤣🤣🤣 yall delusional sound like Q’Anon supporters
Not enough people are talking about this. Let's say Drake's master plan went according to plan. You're mad and quitting because Kendrick is using the info you've been feeding him? Wouldn't this be time for a victory lap? It doesn't make any sense.
Also Kendrick removed the copyright on his diss tracks so the YouTube community can monetize their content to his music. Planting money trees all over
You forgot the most blatantly absurd claim on that record that Baby Keem writes Kendrick's stuff (let alone his BEST stuff). Even moving past the fact that Baby Keem was like 11 years old when GKMC dropped so was a child throughout most of Kdots career...

Baby Keem is a fucking producer rapper. There's been leaks from TDE and Kendrick's camp in particular, and the only ghostwriting going on, was Kendrick ghostwriting for Keem's tracks. Not the other way around.

Drake will literally say any lie he can make up because he knows his fanbase can't tell the difference between a truth and a lie.
I think the cease and desist in question was against French Montana. Rick Ross calls it out in Champagne moments.
That cease and desist email on like that made no sense and was fake dude lol, crazy how y’all run with that
The first one isn't an outlandish claim, It's a diss. Disses don't have to be 100% accurate. It's how you can humiliate the other person and bend the truth. Drake's suggesting that Kendrick isn't doing enough for Compton.
If it’s true, he wasn’t a genius. It may have been a good plan earlier on when it wasn’t so big, but now it’s just a worthless gotcha
There was no final edit, this was a first draft that Drake sent out by himself cause he felt the pressure to drop as soon as possible
And the restaurant that was in the video. And the ring!? He knew that Drake was shooting that video he knew what the main beats of the track were
And then Kendrick drops 6:16 that literally says “HEY YOU HAVE A MOLE IN YOUR CAMP IDIOT”
Both kendrick and drake knew about what they were going to talk about.drake also talks about how he'll bring the young girl angle and he did. Nothing extraordinary to be honest
>"I can even predict your angle. Fabricating stories on the family front."


Also something you might say if Drake was right and you are trying to get ahead of it.
Drakes the type of dude to “scurry” to the pokemon center
Said he doesnt wanna go at him again At the end because Kendrick is experienced with beating women as well

Basically calling himself a woman
I mean the labels could be faked but… man even still that’s such a hollow win. Maybe it would’ve been more significant before it became what it is, but now it’s just kind’ve a shitty gotcha
"We made you think I'm a pedophile, hiding more illegitimate children, and running a sex trafficking ring so you could bomb on me while I go on vacation. Now I quit because you ran with everything and have more tracks ready to drop". 

At best, there's a 50% chance you come out of this thing winning in the public eye if that's your strategy. If you're playing 4D chess, 10-steps ahead at all times, wouldn't you rig this thing wildly in your favor?
even if there isn't a mole, kendrick had false info and was so desperate to put it out he dropped an entire verse dedicated to someone that doesn't even exist

the info goes thru kendrick's camp, and his people tell kendrick, that's who he's calling clowns

gotta put genius annotations for mfs to get it lmao
Also that “decorated war general” bullshit is so fucking laughable after The Story of Adidon. Man took one W against Meek Mill then got monumentally and historically bodied by Pusha T
That might be even fucking funnier lmao
Oh man I can already hear it. “They only raided cause of Kendrick.” Or worse, “they planted the evidence in his house. It must’ve been the mole”
Where are the direct references?
there was no cease and desist, metro was the one that lied actually

i see kendrick lying about a daughter and then never bringing it up again cause he knew it was bullshit, he could pull another pusha t and everyone would go crazy, but he let go of that pretty quick didn't he

if we're gonna point out lies we should do it for both sides
I almost spat my drink laughing at the J Roc comparison lmao
J Roc was more authentic than Drake, and he's a fictional character.
Lie of omission mate, as in not disclosing he had a daughter is lying.
Speculation wise, the daughter drama is from 2015, although I don’t think Drake has spoken on it publicly, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a lie by omission
You really believe drake has a daughter just because dot said so?
[deleted]
It's a real mole, Drake had no idea about it until we did

Edit: spelling
Why did he delete the pic? And don’t give me “you can’t post real prescriptions” when you’re not allowed to post someone’s address on DSP’s
very compatible
Drake denying he has a daughter is not evidence to the contrary. 

He's faked this persona for over a decade, and lied about Adidon at first as well.
And it failed.
I agree with the interpretation of the 1st point of that bar, what I don’t understand is why not release proof of using this fake mole? It would have been such a gut punch had Drake dropped a recording of him feeding the mole in his group fake information, yet there is nothing, not even a text or some type of public reveal.

The 2nd point, if true from Drake’s intention, is such an INSANELY risky move to do it almost crosses the point of idiocy. Intentionally misinterpreting a song about trauma due to  molestation for a bar while under allegations of pedophilia, being a liar, and called out using Mr Morale to construed lies? That’s like…I can’t even think of an analogy because it is such a losing strategy.
It’s about the content. Kendrick warned Drake not to involve family, he did anyway. Thus, the response involving Drake’s family.
You buggin
His denial left a lot to be desired...
Even Twitter too lol. I think they just want to see someone at the top have a long fall y'know?
Not apparently, no
Prove it P.Drizzy stan
So he really got us all by putting out the fake information (if he even did). I know that if I wanted to diss someone, I would for sure do it in a way where I'm dammed if I retaliate or not.

If you believe that ridiculous narrative, then you have to accept that Drake is the biggest dumb fuck in rap diss history because he failed to capitalise on his set-up, which would’ve put him UP UP and humiliated Kendrick.

And he never will do. You know why? Because it never happened.
The cover art was taken down due it being a HIPPA violation. You can't post patients medical info online. Medication bottles with somone's name of them violates HIPPA. That's why it was taken down. Do research before you just talk out of your ass like Drake on THP6
I can’t get over him mentioning Millie Bobby Brown 😂 if somebody told me at the beginning of this beef that Drizzy would be the one to bring her up by name I’d have laughed my ass off. Such an obvious thing to bring up, kdot avoided it, only for Drake to namedrop her in a song that was supposed to be a fucking response to Kendrick. Truly legendary clownery.
I noticed that -ation scheme right away. Damn that was weak
They do put the middle names on sex offender lists, but it’s still a weird line bcs Aubrey would just be the better name to say since it’s his first name.  The whole song still feels poorly cobbled together though
This. Kendrick just showed the world what a rapper is. 

Most folks clearly have become accustomed to only dealing with rhymers.
I know it's not as bad as the pedo shit but I feel like its a crime to not also mention the corniest bar ever written

"You mentionin A minor, but n**** gotta B sharp and tell the fans, Who was it? You thought you left D flat, D major I'll slit your throat with a razor."
What gets me the most is his misinterpretation of Mother I Sober

but I'm glad he did it because MMATBS is getting alot of streams since then
He did use an ai pac and snoop… so you might actually be on to something with him using ai to help write lol
Dude crowdsourced a response off of Twitter 🤣🤣🤣
Late but that line is also a double negative which means it is in fact a name you'd see on the list, but given what he clearly meant you are correct Aubrey is the name you would see on the list.
That bar makes perfect sense as a Kendrick fan. Drake is his real middle name. Sex offender lists usually have the individuals' full name.
There’s no sex offender registry in Canada.
That's what happens when he actually writes his own shit
The other funny part about that line is that he uses double negatives, implying Drake IS a name on at least one sex offender list. I mean he’s not lying though lmao *cough *cough Drake Bell.
Not Chat GPT. I had the same thought so I asked and it said no 😂😂😂
For real, the ghost writer was on vacation that day or something
What’s even worse is that it’s a double negative. Saying “Drake is not a name that you gon’ see on no sex offender list” is literally exactly the same as saying “Drake is a name that you will see on a sex offenders list”. 

The motherfucker makes one song without his ghostwriters and he self snitches.
I actually did have chat GPT write some diss tracks from both perspective. It wouldnt get grimey but i've had the suspicion that Drake's line about being a general with a decorated jacket was AI cuz that shit was lame as fuck after everything Kendrick said and pretty on par with the AI generated style.
Not to mention, Canada keeps their’s private for some reason.
Plus, wouldnt Drake Bells name show up?
Not saying it was the best bar, but Drake is his real middle name and it would show up, and it’s a rap bar not an autobiography. We all know what he meant when he said it.
For me, if it's an "-ation" bar, it needs to be at least a few extra syllables rhyming as well, akin to how the n word is used as a rhyme enhancer as opposed to the only rhyming part.


Masturbation, laceration, faster nation, Pastor Satan, etc
Ahaha ChatGPT is diabolical
This shi is even funnier after i realized that bar “am i battlin Ghost or AI “
>it isn't going to show up as Drake, it would be listed as Aubrey Graham.

I don't really think this is the "gotcha" you think it is.  You really think Drake wouldn't know his stage name wouldn't appear on official documenation?

inb4 yeah he's that dumb
Seek some help big dawg
Crazy thing is the world knew about rkelly and it still took a decade
Stuff about Weinstein was coming out as early as 2000, possibly sooner.  He was on his shit since the early 80s.
It wasn’t a diss response, it was a thrown together band-aid for his fans to give them a reason to stay. He knew he was cooked with no way out so he just put out something to validate what his fans were already trying to use to cope. “Drake needs to feed false info to Kendrick through the mole!” became “I gave you those stories about a daughter and underage girls and you fell for it!” and his hardcore Stans suddenly had plausible deniability.
Fr literally the only parts of the song I remember are that part where he references Mother I Sober and this one snippet that someone hilariously cut where he says "I was fucking young girls, I promise". Everything else was just sad and forgettable
some people are delusional, i swear lol. saw a dude in another post saying TH6 > Not like us, saying it was lyrically better and whatnot 💀


edit: just realized it was the guy that was exhanging replies with you in the other post 😂
You know Drake wrote that whack ass shit himself. 


Cus ain't nobody randomly listening to Mariah's Touch My Body but Aubrey's corny ass. 
I fw Drake heavy but that was definitely a terrible diss track lmao. He’s no god tier lyricist, but damn he could’ve done way better.
Suicide is still a kill, I suppose
Fr that part is so lame. 
"I'm not gonna lie this shit was some good exercise, like it's good to get the pen working." 
Drake getting his ass beat on the internet and then says it's good exercise.
The switch from drop drop drop drop from Family Matters to "this shit is just so burnt out~" like a fucking Valley girl while trying to sound like he's hard...


THP6 is the epitome of Drake. Fraud ass. 
He did claim to be disgusted, to be fair. 


He just followed it up with the most Aubrey Graham shit ever and failed to deliver. 
Officers, you would have arrested me already if I robbed that bank!

Fun fact, Daylyt came out and said he wrote Back to Back for Drake. 


💀
Did OJ do it? Or famously, the men who beat Emmett Till? You think just because MJ was acquitted he didn’t diddle those kids? Because the men who killed Till, literally admitted it after the fact but couldn’t be tried due to double jeopardy, and they too, were found not guilty. 

Bill Cosby, was found guilty decades after his crimes. And was arguably MUCH more famous than Drake lmao. 

You genuinely think Drake with an actual line saying “saw a pic of you back in highschool, yea you was bad then too.” Is most definitely not a creep who grooms people? Birds of a feather flock together. You keep groomers and pedos around you, regardless of their court case status, you’re probably thinking and doing the same. Just because you have the money to pay an NDA, or the power to intimidate a witness, does not make you innocent
Bro tried to explain it like the bar had 3 different meanings but literally explained the face value of it. 


💀
The drake community is autofiltered to hell removing anything that goes against the specific narrative they’re pushing

In the intro, kendrick says, "fabricating stories on the family front cause you heard Mr morale."  Which could be alluding to drake making up the story of kendrick beating up whitney.
during the whole crodie part
If his plan was for Kendrick to stomp all over the release of one of his best songs in over a year that he clearly put some effort into both making and filming a video then it was dog shit plan.
Even if you're right, the plan was to get dot this stuff to set him up, and then use it to dunk on him over, and over so that he can mention it in a verse and show exactly no receipts with no public "gotcha" moment? 

That's a really, *really* bad plan.
The guy brought a camera crew to film the van being destroyed. Why wouldn't he hire a whole documentary crew to show him finessing Kendrick? That would be legendary. He ain't got any of that because it's not real. Instead we have to believe him based on his word when he can't even interpret Mother I Sober correctly.
The only one that said it’s his dad’s stuff was AK and he’s Drake’s mouthpiece. We gotta believe that?

We really don’t know how that picture came about. 

The only thing we know is that Drake’s story doesn’t add up.
“Haha I tricked you into making me look like a pedophile” is not really a good angle. Plus, if you really fed Kendrick information, it would be so easy to post the screenshots, videos, or recordings. Instead you’re letting these pedo allegations brew day by day? He can stop it or at least make Kendrick look bad with some proof.
I just wanna know why Kendrick made a whole verse about a person that doesn’t exist. If Kendrick doesn’t drop not like us the next day I think this conversation is a lot more grey than people are willing to admit. And I’m saying this as someone that thinks Drake got washed
[deleted]
The Heart Part 6 sounded haphazardly put together.
There is no such thing as a “B sharp” on piano as well which is what most people refer to when describing octaves and scales. That would just be a C lmao, so it’s not impressive. It’s actually something that shows how little music knowledge Drake has.
Lmao the B sharp line was so fucking corny, B sharp isn't even a fucking chord.

The last 30% of that track is also just a sad drake talking over a beat about how "this was a good exercise" while getting stomped out

That's all without mentioning the sub par best, no energy on the track, him stumbling on words at times ... almost like he's just reading what someone else wrote or something lol
It was by far the worst track I had the displeasure of hearing from Drake lol and I've listened to more than enough Drake to know that
You should not be impressed by the B Sharp bar, it's the most basic flip ever. "Only 24 hours" for a veteran rapper to write bars like this is not impressive in the slightest

Edit: also there's no such thing as a B Sharp
Imagine thinking the B sharp line is good. Like it’s some killer rebuttal because it has the smallest ounce of wordplay.  Imagine thinking the heart part 6 is good. 

I’m not even being facetious. Just imagine thinking this track is a good response in any way. Imagine what your life would be like. Your taste in media. What that says about you as a person. 

I’m trying to imagine it right now and I’m not sure if I’d be sad or if ignorance would be bliss.
If he kept it at B Sharp that'd be a good bar, but he ruined it when he kept going into D Maaaaajor
The B sharp bar was trash and D flat D major was even worse lmao 

You could tell Drake was trying to rebut or replicate Kendrick’s “A minorrrrrrrr” line but his attempt just fell flat (no pun intended lol)
what’s clever about it ? there is no such thing as a b sharp
Bro it’s a rap battle shits all fake and over exaggerated, It’s not like pac really fucked biggies bitch. And drake acting weird with underage girls sounds pretty pedophile to me. It’s all over the net, multiple times
The reaction community has been feasting heavy
Metro Boomin posted the email of the cease and desist. Unless that's been debunked.
Didn’t metro groomin confirm it
[deleted]
It's a play on words. 

Asking his label to not allow it released for radio play is akin to a CnD. 

The email is proof that Drake tried to suppress "Like That"
Yeah but i mean it’s not really a good diss if it’s just blatantly false lol
He could have ended the entire thing 10 minutes after MTG dropped if he just posted all the info about him feeding this info to kendrick.
Yup exactly. He had to hurry up and drop it, so he can continue with the “double agent” story. 

If there was an actual fake mole then, he would’ve had the heart part 6 pre recorded and dropped the 6 min song; 10 min after meet the grahams
The ring and the restaurant in the Family Matters video are references to what Kendrick said on Euphoria, not the other way around.

C'mon, you can't be that dense.
"I figured you would compare me to Epstein!" is not the ironclad defense Drake thinks it is
Bruh kendrick did not get molested by his cousin bro
💀💀💀
Skedaddle to the Pokémon centre *
yea fr, what tf wasthat line? even for drake its incredibly ass
I mean it’s gotta take quite a lot to fake scripts and how would Kendrick have guessed it would be the move to fake one for Ozempic unless he knew that line was gonna be in family matters?
Again even if that’s the case the Dude let Kendrick step on his release, reference shit he said in his diss that came out less than an hour ago, and put it out there that Drake has scripts for Ozempic and a common date rape drug just to come out days later sayin they fed that info after the internet guessed that it could possibly be the case and all that just to laugh at Kendrick for believing he hid a child that didn’t exist when we know for a fact that he did hide the child that does exist until Push outted him. How the fuck is that a win for Drake?
How about the fact he knew about him going after his family on the diss track he released 20mins after family matters? Or the reference drake made to his "leaked" dick Pic and kendrick also pointing it out and how he used it to further his own agenda
Lmfao didn’t I see you defending drizzy in another sub? You workin overtime for this & you ain’t even on the OVO payroll ☠️☠️☠️

Metro’s posted other screenshots that were fake— like the Billie Eilish screen cap where Drake’s like “been waiting for you to turn 18”— but the C&D email is probably real. Drake so in his feelings he was texting his mom about the rap beef *before* all this shit popped off— dude is definitely sensitive enough to try & pull C&D on a record he got offended over lmao
>and then never bringing it up again

lol wut? He just released the song a week ago. Where are you expecting him to "bring it up", his Instagram story??
I'm glad you appreciate that. At least J Roc was poor and living in a shady trailer park.
Thanks for that. Beat me to it.
He’s a dead beat dad even without the to be known daughter what you mean lmao

Also nice of you to ignore the pedo stuff lol. And yes I believe this. He texted a 14 year old that he missed her and gave her relationship advice lol that’s pedi shit fam
Well saying Drake has a daughter without proof doesn't cut it either
Itll be that security guard
It's still up on YouTube
Probably so he doesn't get it taken down like Taylor Made did. Same reason 6:16 isn't on streaming
>when you're not allowed to post someone's address

fucking lmao you're still whining that he posted the uber-famous celebrity's extremely well-known (gaudy-as-fuck) mansion?
Hiding a daughter for 11 years isn’t even plausible, lets be fr. He doesn’t have a daughter. 

Im gonna split hairs here, but not revealing a child to the public isn’t the same as lying. And even then he wasn’t able to keep that under wraps for a year.
It also simply just doesn’t make sense with how he worded it nor does a steelman position look any better.


So he’s said “that’s that one tape you said you got molested”
So immediately, we’re supposed to literally take the exact opposite of what he says and instead he’s actually playing another version of his family that said “well you were molested” essentially attempting to gaslight him . Okay fine, it’s basically attempting to make him relive his childhood. That’s actually not a bad angle. Evil? Sure, but if his goal is to torment Kendrick aye he did well..

But wait.. Drake tells us his angle. He says “oh I get it now, that’s why you’re going so hard to pin me down as a pedo” , because you can’t get over the trauma of your mother and family not believing you and heck Kendrick I don’t even believe you!

What? Kendrick’s motivation for calling you a pedophile stems from his own trauma of not being believed that his cousin wasn’t a pedophile?


Occam Razor’s tells me Drake just misremembered the song, skimmed through it a bit, and wanted to say something that would get under Kendrick skin. But who knows maybe he was giving some Freudian level childhood assessment of motivation for adult actions lmao
There does seem to be a pattern of physical abuse. The other day a security guard witness stated Kendrick assaulted a woman at the Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel.
Okliar.com , where drakes daughter at ? 😂😂
Your post/comment was removed for violating Rule 1: Be Civil

How would he capitalize on the setup? I’m not saying his team fed Kendrick bad info on the Pedo shit I’m saying ONLY the fake daughter information. How was Drake going to respond to the Pedo allegations right away? Even if he posted the setup it probably only shows the setup of the fake daughter and the pills but doesn’t address all the other allegations which probably would have made him look even worse than now. 

I’m surprised people are just accepting blindly that Kendrick didn’t get played a bit too. As soon as Not Like Us came out no one even cared about the fake daughter anymore. Drake clearly got finessed and I’m happy about it but I still think Kendrick got tricked but was clever enough to cover it up which is why he is amazing. He did that all within a day too because he references Family Matters in Not Like Us.
Dude dunked on himself and his fans still act like he won
Another "Eleven" that needed a good father figure and got Drake
Didnt kendrick say something like "you claim to like 10's but your girls an eleven thats a stranger thing"
To be fair, it’s a play on the Whitney & Bobby Brown motif
Really I didn't even make it through the track. Sounded like he was trying way too hard and honestly it's *not* hard to put a bunch of -ation words together.
Dude was panicking on rhymezone 
Bro thought he was really doing something with those bars 😭
im choking bc i dead wrote something like this when i first started rappin 😂😂😂
it was the the clout beat and i spelled out clout like "when they C me, they take Ls" omggg so cringeeee 😂😂😂
And for those that may not be aware.  B sharp doesn't exist.  Also yes, the bar was trash.
That’s the part that gets me the most, because of this mistake he actually diss Kendrick for having been molested as a kid. If he had been, how much of a fucked up person must one be to diss someone over such a thing? A terrible fucking person indeed.
Oh, so ONLY the middle name is on the sex offender list? Great to know!

Bro, just admit it was a stupid ass line.
It’s sad you have to say you’re a Dot fan to avoid being buried, but that’s the state of the sub 🤷🏻‍♂️
Uh yea there is lol
peepeepee poopoopoo
Bro TH6 is so bad and NLU is the number one song in the world and these Drake glazers are actually trying to say it’s better. You can’t make this shit up
That’s fair. I guess it was a kill shot 😂
Fair lol. Just comes across as that annoying guy arguing a technicality and avoiding the question, so later he can be like "Well I didn't say ____, it's actually _____".
"I couldn't have killed my wife--I'm too rich!"
Yikes. So according to you MJ is a pedo. Yeah that's not it. The entire point of the bar that flew over your head is that he's so famous, everyone's already obsessively staring at his missteps and waiting for him to make one wrong move. He's in such a high level of fame and hate, he'd already been caught if he did something horrible. Not a hard line to understand unless you're intentionally being naive.
That's something the Kendrick sub would do ngl
So you admit Drakes run has been ended by Kendrick? Sounds like his move was right.
drake brings up stuff on taylor made he knew kendrick was gonna bring up, is he a prophet and had kendrick figured out too now?
This could be cause drake is predictable to Kendrick but no evidence in the songs says he knew the entire contents of the song. That’s Kendrick Stan’s reading way too into it
To be fair drake didn’t make that story up he just brought it back up
I don’t even think family matters was done by then but he definitely knew about it by MTG
That wasn’t the plan lol, that was actually leaked 

Real leak: the song 
Fake leak: picture and daughter.

How y’all tell me Kendrick bars go over ppls head when y’all can’t read a Reddit comment.
I think ppl are under the impression I think this was a good plan or thought it worked, I’m just clearing up all these bad faith arguments, the plan wasn’t to let Kendrick win lol the plan just didn’t work
Another bad faith argument where we ignore the photo that Kendrick posted but it was really Drake trolling him and the mother I sober line was about Kendrick saying he wasn’t touched, Drake is saying he was after all.

Y’all keep downvoting me tho lol
How did Drake trick Kendrick into making him look like a pedo? Everything was already out there.

Kendrick stopped rapping about what he did on MTG and went full into the Pedo angle because he doesn’t need to prove that.

Let’s say the picture leaked, why those items? That all referenced the ppl Drake was dissing? That looks more like troll than mole.

Even if we don’t give Drake benefit of the doubt, why did Kendrick just pivot back to culture vulture and pedo stuff and completely drop the daughter stuff when that was his most hard hitting thing.

Y’all say I’m not making sense, but whenever y’all reply yall say he got tricked into being a pedo???
Exactly, dot has doubled down on everything he has said this beef except that. Pusha, had a name, location, time and place.

Kenny says “ dear daughter “ and never mentions it again after dropping another track doubling down on pedo stuff.

Idc if ppl believe it or not, but there is more to deny about the child than to believe, everything dot is saying about drakes fans are everything his fans are rn (let’s be real dot fans are largely cool, it’s the random yt girls and Drake haters who wanna be apart of this)
He’s referring to the beef itself 🤦🏻‍♂️
Well no B# does exist, it's just enharmonic to C.

Regardless, it's a whack line.
That's incorrect. The B sharp does exist enharmonically as a C. I've played the piano for 8 years and if you don't believe me, ask any musician.
Even worse than the one with the bed squeaking beat? Or your pussy is calling my name? I mean it's up there, but drake has some stinkers
I could be mistaken or maybe I didn't see it. What I saw looked like an email from the distributor saying they weren't releasing it for radio. I don't think that's a C&D
That’s not a cease and desist. People don’t know what a cease and desist is if they think that’s one.
Brother. I shit you not I ran into this guy earlier in the day like 7 am earlier
Bet he’s not even on payroll, kinda sad
[removed]
The fake info only works if you can convince people It's true, or at least has some basis in reality. If the shit you're spewing is the opposite of truthful, no one is going to take you seriously.

"But your reality can't hide behind wifi

Your lil' memes is losin' steam, they figured you out

The forced opinions is not convincin', y'all need a new route"
Funny, I could say the same about Meet the Grahams
It would at least be a verifiable thing. Beef would end, but the scars would still be there on Drake’s side, not that any of his fans outside of r/drizzy give a fuck though
Nah post wouldn’t work. Thats like if the mavs won the nba finals and 5 minutes later you “predict” they win the finals. 

He should’ve just dropped heart part 6, 10 mins after meet the grahams. You can’t make a 6 minute song in 10 mins
He almost certainly didn't shoot that video in 3 days dawg. It's somewhat possible to have turned around that production that quickly, but not at all likely. Drake was working on that from the moment he dropped pushups
Talking about Taylor made song which got released before kendrick dropped anything
Not the family stuff we are talking about. The DV accusation.
I’m not saying I believe the fake mole story, but it wouldn’t be hard for someone with resources to fake the scripts. The rest I’m with you on
Well I think it’s pretty reasonable to guess that drake was going to come at his relationship considering he spent the last album talking about having sex with white women. I’m unfamiliar with the line where dot talks about drakes penis tho you’ll have to remind me 😂
Well Kendrick is rumored to not even be with Whitney anymore after smashing white women on tour then rapping about it to the whole world so I don’t think he’s winning any father of the year trophies either. As far as the brown stuff he met the whole cast of stranger things and both brown and her parents said there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship and still all these years later brown is a grown ass woman and hasn’t changed her mind. Unless an actual victim comes out i think it’s a bit wild to jump to full blown pedophile. And dot literally did a song with an actual convicted sex offender who took a plea deal down from rape to sexual assault against a girl in high school so that’s a bit hypocritical imo as well
Kendrick wasted a whole verse on a fictional daughter on some fairy tale shit. How can everyone just look past this?
The one that got shot?
I’m talking about on Apple and Spotify
>Hiding a daughter for 11 years isn’t even plausible

My bad I thought we were discussing in good faith. If you're gonna start with some bs, I'm outta here
Wow a website that was just created, yall motherfuckers believe anything
my favorite self-own from that song is when the track itself disses him. at the end, during his ... bizarre rambling speech, or whatever that was, there's a part where he says something like, "im just speaking facts" and the voice audio in the track immediately responds with "proooooove it" LOL only rapper to get owned by 2 instrumentals. 1 being Metro's BBL Drizzy song and the other being the one Drake rapped/talked on himself.
[deleted]
Is there really any winning when 40 year old men beef ?
Don't be fair. He didn't HAVE to make a whitney / bobby reference, he added that on his own. Adding justification because it was apart of a bigger set up doesn't change the fact of how weird and out of nowhere it was.
It’s a very white rapper thing to do
It’s the 9th line in the song lol
Wdym by B sharp doesn’t exist?
He wasn't using a 12-TET system 🧠🤯🧐
The line is literally just communicating "you won't find me on a sex offender list".  Yall who are arguing over the semantics of "well ackshually it would be his full name" are being really obtuse
Yeah I think Drake whiffed on his response but this is a nonissue
Canada does not make sex offender info public.........................................you would never see Drake's name on a list if he fucked 50 first graders dude...cuz it's confidential in Canada and only law enforcement can see the info.
Everyone understands what Drake thought he was doing, but everyone also understands that R Kelly, P Diddy, Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, the Nickelodeon dudes, and Jeffery Epstein were all getting away with this shit for decades.

MJ himself was constantly mired in controversy and being called our for weird behavior with kids LMAO
People get the point of the bar, it’s not complicated whatsoever. The reason that it is dumb is because even more famous people, who have been under a microscope, have been diddling kids, raping women and sexually deviant for years (Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, Bill Cosby, Louis CK, P Diddy to name a few). These are the biggest names in their industry. So Drake sounds out of touch and guilty here. How are you not understanding that lmao
Ok. 


Anyway, Drake got clapped. 
Such as?
I mean, fair enough, that's just how I interpreted it. But he literally fabricated the story of kendrick being molested because he heard Mr Morale. It's kind of impossible to deny that.
Except kendrick never said he hit Whitney he admitted to cheating, so yeah he lied.
The only story is about some chick in LV Hard Rock. It isn't even related to Whitney.
It's not going over anyone heads it just really hurts your argument if you are saying everything else leaked is true but the daughter, since it was one of the least damming claims. Essentially you're lending strength to the rest of the things Kendrick said.
I think so too honestly. The only reason I don't think it was actually was Drake is that I don't think Kenny would be that desperate for a red button that juicy. At least not so early.
People downvoting you because your not making any sense
The photo that doesn't prove it was set up... Why would he include date rape drugs in the picture? Or why wouldn't he have a more zoomed out version of the pic where he's just cheesing next to the shit? Drake got a radar for people that been touched or something? It's ridiculous to think this dude set anything up when his ender family matters was stomped on within an hour.
The daughter stuff is more hard hitting than the pedo stuff? How? We already knew Drake is a deadbeat. That’s why Adonis exists. 

Being called a Pedophile as a public figure is the worse thing that can happen. Deadbeats are all over the place, it fucked up but that won’t get you cancelled. Leaning on the culture vulture / pedo stuff is more harming at this point in Drake’s career. That’s a deep stain you can’t erase. Drake continued to do well even after everyone found out he had a kid. That shit was a tiny spec on his image.

You’re right about what I said with Drake tricking Kendrick to call him a pedo. That’s my bad.

Regardless though, Drake is sitting on pedo allegations and deadbeat allegations. If he masterminded and truly tricked Kendrick he can put all of that to rest by showing the receipts and prove Kendrick as a liar. Why is he letting this hurt his image even more?
Suuuuure
If Drake can define the word “enharmonic” on the fly I’ll eat my sock and post proof
Yes thank you, it’s just not a musical term in general because of what you said. It’s a really fucking stupid line.
Wait what is a cease and desist letter

No dad?
No I believe that Kendrick thinks people like Drake should be dead, he sounded fr
What lies has Kendrick told that have been debunked? 

I'll wait. And no, a Drake denial or IG post ain't worth shit
What? I'm saying if he posted the proof that everything kendrick said in MTG was false.  Like texts audio video of Drake's "fake mole" telling kendrick this stuff.
Again, anticipating that somebody is going to call you a pedophile is a very questionable defense.

"Yeah, I bet you're gonna come after me for my years of weird behavior toward young girls, right? So predictable!"
.... cause you heard Mr Morale. 

I mean it's clear what he was talking about.
kendrick cant do anything wrong, havent you listened to mr morale!? he's a perfect being! do something wrong then make a song about it, it's like a clean slate
Ehh I mean in general maybe but he’s have had to get it done in less than an hour
Lol imagine thinking there’s nothing inappropriate about a 30+ year old teaching a 14 year old relationship advice and saying “I miss you” 

You really need others to tell you if it’s okay or not? Bro no context is needed that’s inappropriate as fuck. You’re slobbing a dudes knob so hard who you don’t even know that you’ll ignore some weird shit like that? Wild man wild
Literally the only part of his diss tracks that is as unprovable as ALL of Drake's claims (not counting Drake's already disproven claims).

Ya'll grasping at straws. Your king is a clown, always has been. Hope the 17 days waiting for Kendrick to execute him was enjoyable while it lasted. Ya dead.
Exactly. If the people in this sub gave Drake some credit in this battle then I'd respect that they're trying to be unbiased and would see their perspective why they think Kendrick won. Instead it feels like they already decided that Kendrick won before this beef even started lol.
it’s crazy. everyone is overlooking the dave free thing too. no one wants to hear anything unfavorable about the golden child
Its against there TOS to have pictures of another persons personal property without their consent is what I was told
For me it never had the picture up on Apple or Spotify
Idk
How is suggesting its possible in good faith? 11 years? 11 years and he couldn’t hide Adonis for 1????? Be real with yourself. Why aint Pusha mention it? Meek? Anybody else? 

Its literally never came up before this, now all of a sudden its possible? Yeah nah, you sippin the kool aid if you think its true.
My favorite self own was “I don’t wanna fight with a woman beater, it feeds your nature”. Like I don’t know how else to take that other than Drake calling himself a woman
I noticed that too. It’s funny how many accidental self owns is in this song. I thought calling it the “heart part 6” was so clever but now I think Kendrick should legitimately skip 6 so that this song is his canon in the Heart series.
They're literally children.
I would say that avoiding saying suspicious things after you've just been accused of grooming and pedophilia is a good place to start. Drake failed there
Nah he had been using the Whitney/Bobby motif since Pushups.

It’s weird contextually, but it is relevant for him to bring up.

Like I fully believe he grooms young women but the line has precedent.
It's not a note, half step up from B is C.  It goes A, A sharp (B flat), B, C, C sharp (d flat), D and on to G with E not having a sharp either.


He's trying to play off A Minor, which is a scale and chord and hit back with the only two notes that don't have sharps.
Just call it how they’re being they’re being intellectual assholes not obtuse lol they’re doing it on purpose
Its a rap battle, why wouldn't you be arguing over semanticists of the words, its like half the craft is the use of them
Taking the lyric at face value doesn't mean you are being obtuse, fucknut. If he said something along the lines of "my name isnt something youll find on the sex offenders list", NO ONE would have brought this lyric up. Instead, he made an illogical line which EVERYONE already knew because it was an impossibility.

Literally the only one being obtuse here is you because you're dying on a hill to try and misinterpret the criticisms about the line, good job.
And they were also arguing “he denies having a daughter but not the sex offender stuff”. 
  
They over analyze Kendrick lyrics but then be obtuse with drakes “oh technically he’s wrong”. 
  
Kendrick glazers are ridiculous. With that said though, it was a stupid ass bar
Yo that's fucked up , I had no idea but just looked into it, that's interesting because in the past we have had known sex offenders here , now I'm wondering how the I fo got out there
All of these people you have listed, already had allegations and trials ranging from the 90s and 2000s. To which Drake has none, in fact no victims have came forward at all. The "Nickelodeon dude" was literally prosecuted and proven guilty in the courts. But Disney still gave him a job after. If that was Drake, he'd be done because all the spotlight is on him now and every hater wants his downfall.
And all of these people you have listed have had trials and allegations ranging from the early span of their careers. Drake has none of that. If someone took Drake to court and he was guilty, everyone would know about it. Even Diddy, R Kelly and Epstein had accusations ranging from the 90s. They are just not on the level of fame and hatred he is on. Drake has no victims.
wrong and every real hip hop enthusiast not chronically online would agree but to each their own
But that was in the heart part 6 not family matters and the heart part 6 must’ve been written in like 24 hours and rushed out in which case drake just walks into it with the knowledge of the goad
Yeah he’s not going to admit to domestic abuse lol. I’m just saying drake didn’t fabricate that story it was already on the internet
It’s not my argument it’s what Drake is saying, the picture adds to drakes credibility while MTG hurts it, but Kendrick not doubling down on the kid angle but he has on the pedo angle seems like maybe he needed to do some more research and dropped not like us in the mean time 

There are many times in history where a government or a group has found out their info has been Compromised, and that person is then used as a double agent without them knowing.

Is it sooo far fetched to think this happened with Drake? It backfired on both of them. daughter shit is prob faked, but MTG is still a hard diss
I mean if we take Kendrick Lamar at face value, he hates Drake and everything he stands for, I can believe it. idc about this whole receipt crap cause it’s rap, but calling someone a pedo in todays climate is wrong if ppl are dig up his weird relationships, but ignore the many woman coming out and saying nothing weird was going on. Wether true or not (it’s hella weird) we have to take them at face value

Which leads me to Drake talkin bout Kendrick beating his queen, we all know undeniably Kendrick is in an estranged relationship, he’s said it himself. He moved from his wife and hasn’t seen the kids in half a year apparently.

You can make the same leaps to equally prove that either of these crimes are true so as a neutral opinion I see them both as false, but I do find it annoying how Drake gets heat but Kendrick does not.

Edit: Lastly I want to mention, Kendrick comes off as a hypocrite regardless, because if he’s lying about shit he’s everything he’s said about Drake in terms of a liar and a manipulator, if he’s right why tf did he hold on this info for a rap beef and if he’s about protecting the kids why does he have a convicted rapist on his last album. Kodak really doesn’t add much to the message
Okay, what does not make sense?
He’s not letting his image hurt even more neither of them have any proof lol.

He made the heart 6 to deny the Allegations (I’m to famous for this is so stupid lmao) woman have come out and denied the allegations. We can’t say he’s sitting around when there was an attempt.

My issue with this whole topic is that no one can look at Kendrick Lamar and see hypocrisy, no one can say anything accountable on Kendrick’s side. I’m not a Drake Stan I’m just tired of seeing how everyone can agree Drake bad, but Kendrick good when there is evidence on both sides that both people are bad.

Kendrick preaches black woman ontop and praises them in songs and music videos, but had an actual addiction to white woman. Calls Drake a deadbeat but moves across the county without his kids, and is clicking up w future (the biggest deadbeat in rap) and metro (being 20 and @ a 13 year old saying u wanna fuck is wild idc if it’s a joke). calls Drake a pedo but platformed a convicted pedo on his album and let’s keep it a buck Kodak contributed next to nothing (Mr moral my favorite rap album of 2020’s next to the forever story).

At what point do we acknowledge ANYTHING at all. Drake the main villian in this story but dot ain’t the hero lol
I mean I bet he can't and that's why its still a lame line. Like he's technically correct, but doesn't know. But as musician myself I can't just let people say "there is no B#", especially in an argument you gotta speak on facts even it means giving your opp some slack
Denoting a legally enforceable order from a court or government agency directing someone to stop engaging in a particular activity, which that wasn’t the case in metro boomin’s email
He rapped to a fake daughter bro
Ok that makes more sense.

Or maybe just drop heart part 6? Since it’s a rap battle
IF the whole mole thing was true, it’s likely that would’ve been fabricated long before any of the songs came out
Which claims have been disproven?

Also, Drake is up for me. He has the two best diss tracks, bars, rebuttals and punchlines. I'm expecting more from Kendrick and I'm surprised fans of rap are siding with Kendrick in this beef.
Because nobody gives a shit if one of the kids isn’t his.
Why is it so unbelievable?

It’s entirely possible that Push and Meek weren’t privy to the information.

To rule anything out at this stage is jumping the gun. And to rule it out because “it never came up before” is illogical.
He really does see himself as a bad bitch
Lmao this is my fav as well. He really must have kicked the ghost writers out of the room for this one🤣
Cube said not to trust a bitch with a prostitute's body 30 years ago. Kendrick listened and Fake became the prostitute.
I think the intention was that Kendrick was going to get upset by Drake dissing him and take his anger out on his wife. He should have seen how easily it would backfire though
oh man thats good, i like the idea of him doing his own H6 just to let Drakes fade into obscurity but keeping it in as an ironic proof of what he’s been saying through TH series would be very kdot
People are saying Kendrick should still make the heart part 6 but I think if he just makes the heart part 7 it would be funny as hell.
People keep forgetting that he didn’t just call it “The Heart Part 6”, he titled the track “The Heart Part 6 - Drake”.

He knows when Kendrick drops “The Heart Part 6” it’s going to be a wash.
But then this backfired because he claims to have known kendric would bring up his odd relationships with minors… so if he did why would he keep bringing up Bobby when he’s setting up an easy dunk for his opponent
Again, HE brought it up. HE HIMSELF did. If he NEVER brought whitney / bobby up, he WOULDN'T have to reference back to Millie Bobby Brown. Literally every step HE decided to look like a fool.

Why do you think because he made a weird connection in a prior song it somehow makes it more relevant to bring up now, as if he wasn't the reason it was brought up originally? Doesn't make much sense to me.
To be fair, it does exist in the key of C# major: C#, D#, E#, F#, G#, A#, and B#. Just very rarely used.  But yeah it’s the same note as a C.
True, but they also truly believe they are right.  It's such a simple line I'm surprised people are nitpicking it like this.  I don't even like Drake but come on, if you have critical thinking skills you know what the line means.
Because it's clear what Drake was articulating.
Lol if you say so
Yet with Kendrick lyrics, it’s ok to not take it at face value, and give it a million different meanings.
perhaps news stories.
This would imply that there could not be another super famous person misusing their power and influence because they would have already been caught. I guess we have just solved the issue of trafficking among the rich and famous because drake said it. If someone more famous than drake was found guilty of this type of stuff after all of this it would disprove the point you are making. Your assumption is demonstrably false and trying to flip around evidence to support your post hoc rationalization isn’t making your point.
"The Sheriff wouldn't have arrested them if they aren't guilty" ass logic LMFAO
Um no lol. Show me proof of Diddy and Epstein Trials from the 90s. Also, it took years for the others to go to trial, namely Cosby, but also Woody Allen and Louis. These guys are FAMOUS and get away with the shit. THAT’S THE POINT. Drake has been famous for about 15 years. He’ll probably get caught up here anytime if I had to guess
Drake isn't even hip hop though. 
Right which lends itself to drake being predictable to kendrick. I'm agreeing with you
He literally came out and talked about his mother being sexually abused. If you listened to the album, you would know he was extremely open and honest. Why would he open up about his mother's abuse but not touch on his alleged "dv". Please show me where it was already on the internet.
That is a fair take, I still am just not convinced Drake is that clever but I'm probably biased so it probably isn't as far fetched as id think.
I agree with you except on the image not being hurt part.

You honestly don’t think Drake’s image is being hurt when the #1 song in the country (Even Canada) is about Drake being a Pedophile and him being a “freaky ass n****”? Even if people don’t necessarily see Drake like that, he’s the butt of the joke everywhere.
[removed]
Yeah I get where you’re coming from and there really is a b# but for Drake it’s like he did a math problem, guessed the right answer, but all the work is wrong. 1/10 possible points on that question
I’m seeing this other definition that says it doesn’t necessarily have to be court or government mandated. “ A cease and desist letter is a document sent by one party, often a business, to warn another party that they believe the other party is committing an unlawful act, such as copyright infringement, and that they will take legal action if the other party continues the alleged unlawful activity.” I don’t know which definition is right
Where the hell'd you get that from?  A cease and desist is really no more than putting in writing a request along the lines of "don't do that (or else)." In contrast, a legally enforceable order is called, generally, an "order."
A cease and desist  tend to  be sent prior to taken  legal action.
How do you know that?
Ok
Why would Kendrick and them fake an Ozempic script if they didn’t already know Drake was gonna spit that line about Ross and Ozempic?
11 years, 11 years, 11 years, 🤦🏾‍♂️ 
Do you think this high profile man can hide a child for 11 whole years, and we know nothing of it. What don’t yall understand about him not being able to hide one child for a year? So how could he possibly hide one for a whole decade plus?
If executed properly, it would have been a good diss. The issue is the execution, which results in most people seeing this as a self-own where he is the woman in the line.
The heart 6.66
I didn’t say he was smart, I just see why he brought her up.

He was trying to defuse impact more so than anything.
But it was obviously a motif that HE was using, what are you failing to understand here?

I didn’t say it was a good look, I said there’s a reason for him saying it.
They do the same shit with the planting info. “Why would he plant info about being a pedo” clearly he was talking about the daughter and the pedo stuff.  
  
Also same with the clown bar
Tell me someone more famous than Drake who didn't get caught for running sex rings and molesting children. And someone who didn't have allegations early on in their career. Calling someone a pedophile is a serious accusation and throwing it around undermines real victims of child abuse, not to mention the damage it could do to someone's career. Something like trafficking and rape, leaves a trial that can't be avoided no matter how careful you are. Especially when you're on Drake's level of fame. If you don't have any concrete proof of it, then all you're doing is speculating.
It's literally eazy to find with a simple [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=diddy+first+alleations&oq=diddy+first+alleations&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTILCAEQABgKGA0YgAQyCwgCEAAYChgNGIAEMgoIAxAAGAoYDRgeMg0IBBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBRAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBhAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoIBxAAGIAEGKIEMgoICBAAGIAEGKIE0gEINDg2M2owajGoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Fact is, as of right now Drake has no victims coming forward against him so your claims about him molesting kids are baseless.
He proved he is with this diss battle. My respect for both artists have increased after this. We've never had a competition this big since Nas and Jay Z.
In 2014 Kendrick literally went on the breakfast club and addressed it. Also there’s a huge difference between my mother was sexually abused vs I physically abused my wife
I never said his image ISNT being hurt it is, I’m saying he’s not allowing it to happen, he tried to defuse and it didn’t work

You can’t prove that you aren’t a pedo

Nah 100% im with you lol
As a outsider from the front page here to read up on the drama. This guy JUST ran over to the dizzy sub and said

"Drake haters don’t even know what a cease and desist letters are, they’re stupid."

My guy could've just googled it in like 5 seconds but nah it goes against his argument so it's wrong and you're a drake hater!

https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist

Even if he sees that he'll probably subscribe to the "you can't use Wikipedia as a resource, you and whoever edited the wiki page are drake haters" club!

Yours
It doesn't make sense. Wouldn't the label be making money if Like That was on the air? Why would they listen to Drake (who isn't affiliated with Republic records?) to stop their bag
That’s the definition of a cease and desist letter, look it up, The "someone he works for" is UMG, whose signed artists account for 33% of the entire music industry. Like I said, he needs more proof than just someone not clearing a sample for radio because that happens all the time.

UMG is a $10 billion dollar a year company, Drake is hardly in a position to make them do anything lol
Kendrick has the burden of proof since he made the claim first
I’m saying Drake would be the one to have made the fake prescription, if his fairytale about the fake mole were magically true
Because he's not involved with the kid in any way except maybe payments to the mom. It's entirely possible
Yes. HE used it. HE decided to pick out a motif that HE would later link back to a teenager he was in contact with. What the fuck are YOU failing to understand? Do you think using a Bobby / Whitney motif is REQUIRED in a song, you fucknut? Again, HE chose to use it, instead of NOT writing that in within the first place. There were TWO instances where he could have chose NOT to do it, yet you still think it is reasonable he did? LMAO

You're excusing the poor bar by saying "well, it was linked to another bar, so it had reason..." even though there is ZERO reason he had to link it or even say the bobby part in the first place. If he had the second bar already planned out after the Bobby one, IT IS EVEN WORSE.
So if that was indeed the planted info, care to elaborate on his post after the drop then?
[removed]
Sure thing brother. 


Never heard serenading before in a diss track before Drake. 
That interview was about an alleged incident with some other woman in a hotel that has already been debunked. Please show me where he addressed dv with whitney.
It's like a "don't do it or I'll sue threat" meant to intimidate people who don't want to lose money
🤷🏽
I'm a lawyer, I've fuckin sent them myself. You don't have to believe me; your choice.

The song featured artists from multiple labels. All would have to agree to radio play. So this email is one rights-holder telling another "no radio." Metro Groomin claims that Drake was behind this. He's a UMG artist and Republic is a subsidiary of UMG. Epic is not; it's under Sony. So the circumstances make it perfectly possible that it is as Metro claims.

EDIT to add: Metro appears to be with an imprint of Republic, making the whole collab with Future a joint project between Republic and Epic. Kendrick is distributed by UMG so he and Drake and Metro are sorta all under that umbrella.

EDIT 2: i see you rewriting the comment I replied to. Cool. To your new points, yes, Drake clearly doesn't actually have the pull to keep Like That off radio. Doesn't mean he wouldn't try, or that his handlers at UMG wouldn't humor him by going through the motions. 

Look, I'm not saying it did happen. Just trying to explain why it's plausible, since y'all seemed to be wondering in good faith.  If you want to argue, I'm out.
I’m asking you. Drake has lied about this exact thing before
So you telling me he’s paying some woman enough for her to never want to go public and file legal paperwork getting him acknowledged as the father? Mind you his earnings have increased exponentially in the past 11 years and you think some woman with a legal claim to his estate hasn’t filed court documentation? Like be fr 😂

Funniest Reaponses to Trump's "I Hate T.S." tweet?? Post em for me
Here's mine
This is so childish of him and *that* is who people want to run their country? It is insane to me. 

Like, the amount of celebrities who have come out to endorse Kamala, but the one that gets under his skin the most is Taylor Swift. 

Oh Taylor, the woman you are. I’d be cackling like a witch if I were her. 

(Also, in response to the tweet - Ellen when Taylor refused to comment on who she was dating for 1013th time)

He’s trying to recreate the Kim/Kanye beef with Taylor so that she drops Rep TV bc he’s secretly a Swiftie
All jokes aside, as a non-American I am genuinely baffled by the fact that around half your country thinks this is a shining example of leadership. How many world leaders are going on social media to throw a legitimate tantrum about hating an individual in all caps. He sounds like a toddler screaming “I hate mommy” because mommy said he can’t have crayons for lunch.

Can we get Queen Clarisse on the line? Someone needs lessons in how to be a dignified leader.
If I did twitter, I'd say "Me, on opposite day:"


Childish remarks require childish responses.
The potential for comedy after his tantrum has been fantastic to see real-time.
A message for the smallest hands who ever lived.

Trump 2024! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 #MAGASwifty
What platform was this posted from originally? I tried finding the original post from Trump on X, but it’s not there.  Plus the picture is different.  Seems like everyone really easily buying into fake news.
This has become a Harris-Walz support sub now it’s sad. All you’re going to do is isolate swifties who don’t 100% agree with you, or don’t want to get mixed up in politics.

Edit: *Wow,* I poked a hornet’s nest with this comment! Thanks for proving my point.
well. the fact that you have a subreddit is pretty funny.  shouldn’t you be studying algebra?
I actually started cackling when I first saw the tweet. I’m sure she’s rotf
I used to be annoyed seeing taylor everywhere, nothing really personal against her, but now I kinda like her. It's great she has the strength to speak up unlike other celebrities, and her voice will surely make a difference. Also love the fact that she doesn't feel ashamed of not having a child, people need to piss off with those expectations.
He is bothered so much by Taylor’s endorsement bc of how powerful her influence is. Remember TAYLOR and Trump are both business people. Trump 100% knows how hard she has worked to climb to the top.
It’s funny too because she endorsed Biden four years ago… nobody should be surprised she endorsed Harris. Unless Trump is deep in the WAG drama on the discussion boards lol, which he did allude to in one of his interviews.
It's probs cuz he got caught faking her endorsement which made him look bad 🙈
He has shown publicly a dislike of Clooney also, but for some reason Swift has really gotten to him
He’s embarrassed because he previously posted her fake endorsement and sang her praises, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she’s come out against him in previous elections.
And never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!
I love this one. 

You do not mess with Swifties.
Oooh that’s a good one.
Sent my $13 in via [Swifties4Kamala](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/swifties4kamala)! They are $300 away from meeting their goal! LFGGGG!! 💙💙💙

ETA: $6 AWAY FROM THE GOAL!!
I'll make a $13 donation directly to the Harris campaign later tonight
The power of Swifties is unmatched
I just made my first ever contribution to a political campaign!
Well this is amazing!! Thank you my $13 is in 😏
Just added $13 more. I also like 13.

Don’t know if anyone here knows but are non Americans allowed to donate?

Best ending King has written for a while. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love his books - they are great stories just with consistently badly written endings.
We all know that the song "Hey Stephen" is about the legendary Stephen King. As she said before, his short stories were luminescent.

THE FIRST CONCERT AFTER MINE
I live in the US and it was cheaper to go to Munich Germany than buy tickets anywhere in N. America. I literally flew to Germany with my husband and oldest child just to see The Eras Tour. We were in Germany for 48 hours and it was totally worth it.
This is so real 😂 but it was worth it, but damn the cost
My CC still hasn’t recovered - everything about eras tour was a “Treat Yo Self” moment…except between outfit prep, lodging, food/drinks, merch, etc, that “moment” lasted way too long (and yet also not long enough & I regret nothing). 

I try make up for it by just wearing my outfit whenever I want 🤷🏻‍♀️
This is my favorite, too, because it’s full of facts.
I’m actually shocked he said he “hates” her because he’s been a fan of hers for so long, lol. Last time he said he liked her songs “25% less”?  

But he’s never been willing to say he actually doesn’t like her anymore, or to bring on the wrath of the Swifties. Two marks of insanity in my opinion 🤣
Remember, midnights mayhem with me ? staying up at midnight , fuck , what a time
Nah the double album for TTPD was worse for me
DUDE this was literally me for so long, just trying to be ✨different✨. When midnights came out I was finally out of that phase, so I gave it a chance and loved it. Then I went back and listened to all her previous stuff and became obsessed. I missed out on so much good music for so long 😫
This truly made me lol
Omg I cackled! 💀
This one is underrated lmao
This is good! 😂

It just occurred to me how annoyed she might’ve been when the fans figured this out, lol. They didn’t say it out loud and were trying to be sneaky, but it got clocked almost immediately (before they publicly confirmed the relationship for sure)
what song was it

Yes! This is the one
NOOOOO YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ME T.T

I like how he was interviewed back in November and this is what he said:

“I think she’s beautiful — very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she’s liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump. I hear she’s very talented,” he said. “I think she’s very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!”

He’s like that asshole bully who asked out the pretty, popular girl by “courting her” by saying compliments about her and posting AI images of her endorsing him hoping to get her attention. But then she turned him down for someone better so he goes into full on attack mode cause she hurt his poor, fragile ego. Good God man, grow the hell up!  But I guess we can’t expect maturity from this former president who also happens to be the smallest man who ever lived! 😕
As soon as someone disagrees with him though / doesn't worship blindly, he turns on them and starts whining and spewing endless lies to the public about how it's all so unfair.
secretly? Trump loves to blast Swift music

You could still indirectly. Planned Parenthood could always use donations, as well as Trevor Project (just to name two organisations that support causes Trump is trying to take down). If he should win (I HATE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE!!), they will need all of the support they can get
Why do you support him?
It's from his Truth Social account. Mind bogglingly absurd but legit. Here you go ..
https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump
Girl bye.
Maybe still unite in protectimg her from his hate and his fraudulent fake AI pics and his bestie who sounds like he is threatening her with rape? Oh , right, he has himself threatened her with rape in a roundabout way too.

You don't have to agree 100 % with  the politics to want to stand up for and defend her and condemn him.
Not really, it's a Taylor Swift support sub, finding the humorous responses (and there are many) to an absurd tweet. So ig by saying "isolate Swifties that don't agree w you" you mean that I love Taylor Swift and find it humorous to see the come-back zingers to a hate tweet?? Or are YOU the one bringing politics into the conversation? ....  If another public figure tweeted only "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT" .. say Kanye or even Harris, they'd get mocked too.  I would hope a sub like this could be for a laugh since the tweet is so unserious.
I don’t care who it is, if someone says I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT, most of us on this fan sub will take issue with it.
Godspeed.
I don't get your joke, can you explain? Is it that you're calling me a child because I find humor in absurdity?? If so, that's fair ig. 😋

..And I am aware that I have a typo in my title, I just don't care enough to fix it.
Oooooh! Burn! \s
Most definitely she had a good laugh about it 🤣 it's so absurd
Omg so much this ⭐️
It’s inconceivable!
Hahahaha this comment made my day! 😂

I was a lil bummed he didn’t include that part, but I get it😂

Did they change the goal because it looks like they are currently about 19k from the goal?
I just realized I’ve been donating directly so it hasn’t been counted 😭 loss of my life ugh
I’ve seen a couple of posters talk about donating $13.  Is there something significant about 13 in relation to Taylor?

<edit> thanks, everyone, for the explanation!
And I just donated 13 dollars as well!
That's amazing!!
Thank you for motivating me to donate (again! I have a weekly donation set up but have been meaning to send in another one-off)
Same!!
Sis I love Taylor but she is taking Kamala at face value... do not donate for vote for her. Trump is a clown but he's gonna get stuff done.
Unfortunately, we are not - loss of our life. Neither are we allowed to buy Harris/Walz merchandise from the official shop. There are however creators on Etsy who design Shirts and Sweaters reading „Swifties for Harris“ that we can buy from and who donate some of their gains to Democratic organisations.

You know the supervillainy threat is real when Liz Cheney and Scooter Braun feel like they need to join Team Swift.
Never thought I’d ever agree with Liz Cheney on anything.  Yet here I am….

She is referring to Taylor’s song, The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived. 

Please check out its lyrics :)
Right when you think you can't love Scottish even more
I hope they planted lots of thistle on their way out
I would die laughing if she RT'd this shit. Like that poor fucking girl. She's the only one with a legitimate gripe lmao
Omg that poor girl
That’s so awesome! Yes, every penny was worth it.
Ha ha yea it was our ten yr anniversary so the wife and I said screw it and treated ourselves. Life’s too short not to do something like this once in a blue moon.
>Two marks of insanity

You mean two MORE marks
I’m not- he has a track record of trying to incite violence from his cult following who hang on every word he says. His tweets may make him look even more senile, but he knows what he’s doing. (January 6, for instance- and the Haitian community in Ohio is already being targeted by rabid Trump supporters.) I hope her security is on high alert for the foreseeable future.
Taylor's music is so good she can openly oppose an egomaniac and he still only likes her music 25% less
The last time he said anything about her he called her beautiful 5 times in 20 seconds and thought she was still a country singer... I don't think he's a fan of her *music*
I couldn't go to bed before midnight for like a year after that
The last like 5 all posted at the same time
As a debut swiftie who was always seen as cringe and lame for liking Taylor Swift, these types of stories/comments heal my soul lol
My biggest personality trait in middle and high school was hating anything popular, so I feel like I could’ve written this. Not sure if I’m on the level of a Swiftie (and to be fair, I do still like other music more, but there’s no denying that TS is a talented songwriter and artist), but I’m so glad to have outgrown that attitude. Life’s a lot nicer when you’re not spending it hating things that don’t deserve it.
my son (9) became a big swiftie about a year in a half ago. i was not really anti-taylor but i didnt see the hype. now i have a favorite song from every album <3
This was me before I listened to folklore in 2021 before Fearless TV came out and it changed me

I'm genuinely happy for you and I also cannot complain about getting that absolutely STUNNING rendition of Evermore but I am such an Ivy girl that I yelled "NOOO!!" in the bar because girl what do you mean you're playing that song 2 miles from me and I'm not there.
"I might be a Taylor Antagonist, but some actions are too villainous even for me?!"
lol holy shit this is real
Omfg I’m shocked this is real lmaooo
This guy is just as creepy as Elon and Trump. He's JUST so good at manipulation that to this day a lot know him as Bieber or Ariana's Manager who bought Taylor's music. But not about how he's been trying to ruin Taylor's career behind the scenes for years now. 
When Scooter tells you you’re in the wrong… it’s time to look in the mirror.
‘Look, Taylor, I did something bad all those times and I’m sorry but we gotta team up against a bigger bad’ type of post right there
I think I've seen this film before, and I didn't like the ending 🥴
Scooter you don’t even go here
…what?
please explain
Your flair is the cherry on top! 😂
Sad to say I was in this boat. Love our girl but damn the old lyrics hit hard when you’ve had the MP3’s since limewire. My brain still refuses to realize picture to burn doesn’t say gay. It’s been years and I screw it up half the time I sing along.
Flair twin checking in!
Taylor is to Donald Trump what Megan Markle is to Piers Morgan
The thing is, in a lot of places there’s an epidemic on violence against women where a lot of women are getting killed. While I find this temper tantrum funny, it’s also so scary what sort of violence he could incite
That’s CLASSIC narcissistic personality disorder. I had a coworker *just* like that, it was hellish
Yes I agree he needs to take the truth for WHAT IT IS
Yesss and some girl in the tiktok comments is defending trump like girl byeee😭
Is it a real tweet? Yes. Is it referring to a real editorial? No, I don't think so, I think it's a joke that sort of recontextualizes the situation in a different time period.
You have my sympathies. Which doesn’t mean much as this dumpster fire continues to burn, but you still have it.
…this was in London lmao
I’m glad you asked instead of calling me names for having a different opinion, thank you.
Because America was in better hands when he was president, no new wars were started, we were all making more money.  And the fact that Kamala is a huge reason that our country is heading into a downward spiral.  Voting for another four years of recession is not what I’m about to do.   I don’t love Trump, but I really don’t like Harris.  She’s a Marxist/communist that wants to continue to fuel these wars and give money we don’t have to foreign countries when us (The United States) is in need of help.  There’s many other reasons.
Thank you very much.  I stand corrected!
Who said I’m leaving?

I’m more referring to the posts on this sub lately in general. I take issue with Trump tweeting this too.
I don’t like it either. As I said both sides have done disgusting things. Trump is an arrogant jerk. It’s understandable this sub would take issue with it and I’m not invalidating that.
Thankyou, and you as well :)
Exactly. I’m so tired of explaining this to my well educated SURGEON father. Dad I loathe Trump because he’s an entitled whiny spoiled bigoted bro.
Only the BEST 50 year olds are tired of Trump & donate to Kamala!

We looooooove to see/hear it!!! <33
I donate $13 every time I see this link come up lmfao
Thank you! Vote Blue! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Yes it looks like they raised it by $20k after they met the goal.
It’s ok, we got you covered! I’ve donated directly to her campaign as well but today I sent in my symbolic $13.
She was born on Dec 13, it's her lucky/favorite number and shows up in her videos a lot.
“She was born on December 13, 1989. She turned 13 on Friday the thirteenth. Her debut album went gold in 13 weeks. Taylor has said that whenever she has won an award, she has been seated in row 13 or row M, which is the thirteenth letter.”- internet somewhere
It’s her favorite number. Started from her birth date (December 13), I assume.

YAY!!!! Thank you!!
Yes, Swiftie!! Way to go! I’m so proud of you!!
Proud of you, Swiftie! 🫶
This was me in LA!
‘Stay stay stay’ & ‘All of the girls you loved before.’

Amazing show!
what does rwylm mean🙈
Wasn’t it with all you had to do was stay?
I'd genuinely cry
I appreciate them for this but I don’t like this timeline. Can someone get me out?
She really put everything she had into the January 6th investigation. Cost her her job, and she did it with pride. I don’t agree with a lot of her politics, BUT she’s not a bigot/asshole etc.
Her father called Trump the greatest threat to democracy in the history of the country when he endorsed Harris. 

First, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, but as someone who was 15 when 9/11 happened (and all of the lies about WMDs and Dick using the invasions as a way to enrich Halliburton), I am so uncomfortable being on the same side as him… mainly because the threat to all of us is so much greater than Cheney could machine up, since he does have some standards. 

To paraphrase Hamilton, “Cheney has beliefs, Trump has none”
I see, thanks.
god me too. i wish all the recovered swiftie haters would make the effort to listen to her *old* music tho, like the country stuff. she’s made so many bangers longggggg before folklore and midnights.
I commend you for being a fan from the start 🙏
Me too. I thought she "only wrote about exboyfriends" and she did boring pop, folklore came up and I was bored and got into it and then I realised she was much more than what the media portrayed.
help this is so funny. i'm never looking at ttpd the same way again
Truth lol
I absolutely REFUSE to let him take that song from me
But what if you did?
The plot thickens.
This is my truth.
I would feel the same!! Lol I was outside of the stadium the night before when she played Evermore and we were all just looking at each other shocked at how absolutely amazing she sounded!
The enemy of my enemy etc etc
I only have a screenshot cause I also saw one, and had to check for myself it wasn’t just a joke 😅
Agreed. The issue is that if anything the Masters issue blew the mask off. He's lost almost all the respect he once had.
Okay, so I know she’s called him a bully and that he’s been awful to her- but I don’t know what he’s actually *done*. I don’t know why she claims he’s a bully. 

So I ask… what has he done? (To be clear, I completely believe her)
*Dick Cheney entered the chat to call Trump the biggest threat to democracy in this country’s history*
“Whew; I’ve been replaced as #1 villain of the Swifties!”
Your flair 🙏🏼
Oddly enough I just heard the “you’re gay” version at a local car wash chain a few weeks ago.
Ah, yeah, when I sing along, I still sing the gay line. But I'm not messing up. ;P
It is scary.. he is trying to bully and scare.  He is hoping she gets threatened and maybe harmed. The thing is.. there is nothing we can do but laugh and make fun of it at this point.  It’s just using humor as a form as coping with a really horrible man.
Yes that happens in places where men with the same attitudes reign supreme and there is no equal rights and there’s opportunity for corruption. It can happen here too, but more underground. Look at Jeffrey Epstein.
Absolutely, and so many workplaces seem to have them - makes things so hard for people just doing their job honestly.
And this is what half the country wants more of for the next 4 years?  It’s actually terrifying.
Thank you. It's pretty stressful. And I already lived through the Reagan years!
What led you to the conclusion that Harris is a Marxist / communist?
This fandom has always been accepting place for female empowerment and LGBTQ+ friends. People of all ages love Taylor’s art from women in their golden years to tiny little kids. I do not want to hear any “both sides” when one side is misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and has repeatedly said that school shootings and domestic terrorism are a fact of life. 

Claiming both sides are equally bad when you haven’t given an example of what bad thing Kamala has even done just excuses every single hate filled, bigoted, racist, evil thing about Donald Trump. This election is a chance to perform your ethical duty for the good of disadvantaged groups who live around you. For the young single mom who needs food stamps. For the gay kid in the middle of Mississippi. For the woman who was abused and is being denied an abortion. Acting like you just don’t want to be involved speaks to a massive level of privilege and willful ignorance. 

And that’s not even touching how republicans attempted to overthrow our democracy during a critical count of votes. Only one side staged a violent coup to take all of our representatives hostage with zip tie hand cuffs. You really think they just wanted to talk??

Miss me with that both sides, and enjoy your self imposed isolation.
[removed]
That's fair. But imho it's healthy to have debate and varied opinion and people who can't take criticism need to suck it up. Why should some feel isolated if others disagree with them? And why should it be made to be my or others problem that some rando's feelings were huwt? Who cares.
Nah, we’re not going to both sides this election, sorry. One side is fronting a calm, collected leader who can form coherent sentences and is at least acting like she wants to be President for all Americans. The other a convicted felon who tried to overturn our last election and sows hate, chaos, lies, and dissension with every breath.

They are not the same. You don’t have to be a Democrat or agree on every one of their policies to see this. (I’m not and I don’t).
I’m not sure what Harris/Walz themselves (not the internet brigade) have done that could be considered “disgusting?”
YEP. My aeronautical engineer dad is a Trump voter, and I'm just shocked that someone so book-smart could vote so stupid. He thinks Trump will protect his money but that's laughable. My dad isn't even a millionaire; the leopards will come for his face soon enough.
Thank you ! 🙏
Herself said that actually lol
*gasp* i was born in the same year she was born in but I am 6 months older O.O
Love all of the girls!!
lol were you swiftie clara n2?
Right Where You Left Me!
DITTO!!!!
Since tRump's illegal, shit term in offic!
FUUUUKKKKKKKKK!
It’s clear that in 2015 Marty McFly split the timelines and we got stuck in Biff’s world.
This. I hate her politics, too, but I respect her as a person (Adam Kintzinger is another)
This!
Seriously, she could have kept silent and toed the party line like all the other sycophants (Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, ect...) but instead she chose to light her career on fire to speak out for democracy.
Bonus points for the Hamilton reference.
Absolutely. I was 11. I was FLABBERGASTED. Dick Cheney is one of the most war criminals to war criminal for us.
My response when Dick Cheney endorsed Harris (and calling Trump the greatest threat to the country in its history), other than feel really weird because I was 15 when 9/11 happened and I know how much that man ratfucked the country afterwards because of his ties to Halliburton…
I fear we may have to wait for her memoir.
I might be wrong. But i think he was working with Kanye and had been vocally pro-Kanye, anti-Taylor.
Iirc, the main thing is that he was Kanye's manager during the whole snake-gate situation, and it is believed he was one of the "brains" behind the whole event, to promote Kanye. As we know the whole registering the call and editing had to be planned in advance, and it is believed Scooter participated in this. Then there's a direct mockery to Taylor when he posted a picture with 2 of his clients (Kanye and Justin Bieber) with the caption "what up Taylor" days after the incident when she was hiding
Comic book geek ref:

Lex Luthor sees Darkseid. 

“Dammit, I got to team up with Superman on this one.”
Sending love and hope to all of you 🫶🏼

Still feels silly to say it since it’s votes that matter, not positive vibes from across the world… but if it helps, every American citizen I personally know is firmly anti-Trump.
[removed]
Yes healthy debate and different opinions is great. I love it when people who think differently have a civil discussion. It’s when one or both sides starts being rude and vilifying the other that it gets unhealthy. And there are a lot of people in this sub who do that. My feelings aren’t hurt at all, but like I said swifties like me who don’t subscribe to many leftist beliefs are going to feel isolated in a fandom that is largely a leftist echo chamber. I don’t actually have a problem with your post in particular since I don’t support Trump either. This just happened to be the most recent post so I commented my thoughts here.
👏👏 .. Don't forget about the spreading of racist dog-eating misinformation, that's a good one too.
Travis was too! Invisible string
June 89 here too 🙋🏼‍♀️
It was so good live, even though I only experienced it on a live stream. 😍
Yes!
In terms of Trump, she will be on the correct side of history. 

And I highly doubt that historians will look kindly upon Trump and his minions in the future. I’d like to imagine that he’ll be mercilessly roasted when people discuss him 100 years from now. Too bad most of us won’t be around to witness that!
That makes sense. The only things I can find are masters related and forward. But she seemed to have strong opinions about him before the masters were sold- like pleading not to sell to scooter specifically.
Yeah but that particular info will only be found in the "dark heart" edition (hardback, spring release, magenta index pages) $39.99+tax
Yup. He was Kanye's manager during the Famous video too, like you said, orchestrating the call, the making of the video, mocking her when she found out, bullying... that's not a person you'll be happy to buy and own your art
[removed]
Don’t forget adjudicated rapist and felon.
I'm not getting political just how unbelievable it is, there's been others that came forward and agreed it was true. The immigrants come from a country that's okay from. China does it.. Google it, 2020 was the first year 1 providence in China banned it.  The people are broke, they have limited funds, free range meat they're used to. Sick as hell but doesn't mean it's not true unfortunately.

And by IT - I mean they eat dogs.
me and my partner were lucky enough to have got tickets to N1, and a whole year later she happy to bring back rwylm on my birthday lol. That song is gonna stay undefeated forever.
Sadly, I think it will depend on who wins the war- they write the history.

Taylor gave me and coworkers $100 tips
So I work on suite level @ M&T Bank Stadium and got word the freight elevator would be closed from 1pm-3pm due to her entourage and security. I had to deliver some things but she arrived around 1:30ish. We were forced to stand in the back corner while she walked past but I only caught I glimpse of her.

Fast forward to the end of the game. I was moving some things downstairs and needed the freight elevator but yet again they had to hold it. This time none of our bosses were there to dispel us so security let us hang around. She was feverishly thanking everyone (employees) for our help and thanked us repeatedly. A coworker got her attention by calling her name then she walked over and asked her “Do you work here?”. She then announced she’d tip all of us for our service and pulled out a blue money phone inside an envelope, very modestly. She personally handed about 4 of us a blue note while thanking us before taking off. I still can’t believe it happened. We lost but what a day. Thank you Taylor!

Sorry, what is a "blue money phone"? Silly question but I can't visualize what this means.
Wow thanks for sharing super cool to hear the details of this! We’ve heard she does this but I always wondered exactly how it goes down. Hope you treat yourself!
I love this because she probably knows her being there is making workers day a little rough and she seems to always try tip everyone involved
This is so cool! And even though she’s uber wealthy, just thinking about how much she spends on tips during every outing—crazy. Meanwhile, I'm over here complaining about spending at least $100 just stepping out the door.
Awesome! Thanks for sharing!
What a cool story! I’d probably keep that bill forever lol
I’ll give you $200 for that $100
What are you going to spend it on? Hopefully something souvenir-like. You can say "Taylor Swift bought that for me" lol
sharing this cool things
As a Marylander, I love ppl not knowing the Baltimore slang 🤣
She sounds like a lovely person!
Shoot, I work downstairs in section 130 and made $900 in tips yesterday. Wish people were that nice all the time.
Wait so does a US $100 bill fold perfectly to show the number like that?
I need more details 😂 was the envelope in her bag? Pocket? Or did somebody hand it to her? Did the notes have an elastic band around them? I know it’s tragic but I’m asking anyway
I love that she spreads her wealth everywhere she goes!
I don’t like her music, but after hearing all these stories you realize what a good person she is. Being an a hole is standard with many in her industry, but not her. She thanks everyone and seems so genuine and kind to all that she comes into contact with. I’m rooting for her and Travis. Someone as kind as she is deserves all the happiness that’s out there for all the good she puts out in the world.
JLo takes away tips. This is a wonderful thing 🥰
Very heartfelt , a very nice down to earth thing to do.
What an interesting way to fold it. Most people fold bills in half, with the face showing. This one looks like it's been carefully folded into fourths, with the vertical 100 on the back showing. It makes the bill smaller and easier to quietly hand to someone, while also making the amount obvious.

How absolutely perfect. It seems like everything Taylor Swift does is well-thought-out and considerate. Thank you for showing us this picture.
Thanks for sharing this
@drejwalker did she hand it to you folded like that? I’m trying to envision this entire scenario I’m so jealous and excited for you!
man, if she signed those $100 bills, i'd never spend it!
I don’t understand how anyone could every even dislike her. I’m sure if I met her right now she would be a kind, caring soul. This story among countless others proves that. I’m a chiefs fan since like 2 years old and now spend most my time defending her in front of my fam during games. She’s fantastic
Amazing human being.
This is amazing 🫶🏼
She's well known for her generosity. Taylor seems like a lovely young woman inside and out, doesn't she?
Aw, this is so cool! Truly makes Taylor the most generous kind person! So cool you got to experience this!
Aww this is so sweet!
Glad you posted this. Makes this Ravens fan feel a little less bitter in the aftermath!

This is awesome! Thank you so much for sharing the story
OMG, I would die if this happened to me! Congratulations on a lifelong Swiftie memory! ❤
That's so awesome. I can't lie, I'd probably frame the money lol
What a sweetheart
she gave all her employeed like a half mil christmas bonus
That’s cool, I wouldn’t be able to spend it haha
What is a 'blue money phone'? Am I way out of the loop..?
Frame it and never spend it.
If this happened to me I would get that $100 bill framed and never, EVER spend it
what the fuck is a money phone
What in the world is a blue money phone? And I know all the slang or whatever but this one doesn’t make any sense
Don't care
Blue money phone 😂😂😂 god people are dumb
Lame
[removed]
I’m not believing this at all
Cut your fingernails
That is amazing - she is god
What’s a blue money phone?
Very nice story.  Awesome!
What’s a money phone?
Should've taken the chance and asked her to sign it.

I kid but thanks for sharing that story.
I saw this post earlier. And i just saw that it got picked up by Yahoo. Congrats!
"Ready for it" go chiefs!
[deleted]
Why couldn’t it have been me 😩
There’s nothing that I’ve ever seen about her that has been anything but good. She seems like an exceptionally nice human being. This is coming from someone who doesn’t follow her music.

I wish all the happiness in the world for her.
the way it’s perfectly folded😍
How can anyone hate her, class all the way 🫶🫶🫶
I don’t see a story, just the title. Can someone help me find the story?
Taylor is grateful knowing that all of you were inconvenienced at some point and time because she was there and had to use a different means to get to where she needed to go safely with little interruption to the flow of the stadium crowd attending the game. Being a celebrity she has to take precautions. It her way of showing her appreciation to the employees inconvenienced by her having to use the freight elevator . She is a very special person indeed. I am thrilled she made your day a memorable one. ♥️
Frame it
I would literally frame this $100 bill.
I just saw your fb post lol searched “blue money phone slang” an this popped up lol
She’s never lost sight of her fans. They are her career.
Just give everyone a money phone.
Wait where is the actual story?
She's too good for this world 😭
Gosh she’s the best
Taylor swift is buying votes! /s
Money phone = a stack of money people hold to their ear

Blue = the color of $100 denominations
the more people explain what this is, the less I understand.

but let me see if I understand this....Taylor Swift was holding $100 bills in her hand. She gave some to employees. Right?
Thank you I had no clue either (not American) 😆
Literally came on Reddit to ask this 😂
Cracking up at this. Sir, this is the Taylor Swift sub.
Sounds like a wanna be gansta' thang you'd find on insta and tik tok
Thank you. I wondered the same!
Thanks for asking. I wondered the same.
I’m gonna look on urban dictionary
Money phone is Baltimore talk now

Taylor doing a rap album next!
No one knows what that is because no one talks that way.   Weird.
I'm poor, American, and old apparently, 🤣🤣 I had no idea what it was until this comment thread
It was very surreal. She didn’t come off as inauthentic at all. She pretty much reimbursed me for the game merch lmao
[removed]
Yeah it definitely adds context to why she does it. Not saying she shouldn’t tip folks randomly but it’s interesting hearing how her being there causes challenges for their work day and it sounds like this is her recognizing that.
Definitely a long day but it’s the little things 😪
She has to have a wild discretionary fund in her budget!!
Well I’m just going to assume you have much much much much much (sorry) much much much much much (I’m really sorry) much much much much much (I could really keep going but I won’t) less money than Taylor Swift does, so why even compare yourself to her, it’s not a fair comparison.
Well... TS with her 1.1bn usd net worth giving a 100usd tip is the equivalent of the average American giving a 0.068usd tip. With that amount of money 100 USD is equivalent to literally less money than is currently down the back of my sofa.
The memory is better than the bill I’ll tell this when I’m 70 lol
Save a $100 bill? In this economy? 😉
Neah, that goes on eBay 
Tell me you’re rich without telling me you’re rich.
Should of asked her to autograph it
[Your wish is my command](https://www.ebay.com/itm/156032416529)
Underrated comment
Bills. Us normies spend money on bills, not gifts for ourselves lol.
Right? It’s cool that she’s mega rich and famous but still sincere and grounded enough to personally hand out tips!
From Taylor swift or who
You can fold crisp bills very easily
Yes, you can fold a US $100 to look like that. And no, I don't have this money laying around my house. I used to work in a store and had to be able to recognize real bills.

[deleted]
I noticed that too, lol. I’ve only held them a couple times in my life!
Yes, Do they not in other places?
Where exactly was the money located on her person? In her purse? Which pocket? How much security was surrounding her? What are the blind spots? Asking for a friend
She better be careful. She can only do this 9.9 million more times before she's broke.
Totally agree, not a fan of her music either, but she’s a great person.
You can’t leave us hanging without a story. what happened?
My moms friend was a make up artist for her once and said she was the biggest diva. 😭 that was in probably 2005 or something. I hoped she had changed 😳
I had a sort of run in with her once. If she was a man, and not surrounded by bodyguards I would have broken her nose. What a loser!
I’m assuming OP folded it since he said Taylor had a money phone (aka big stack)
You could sell it for at least triple its value with a signature.
I agree. Considering her fame, she is an exceptionally kind person. There’s a lot of miserable people in this world.
Honestly can’t even remember too busy tryna act normal
I’m wondering this as well!
I’m from Baltimore and I ain’t never heard of a blue money phone
It doesn’t sound like OP even served her. She was tipped for being in the vicinity while Taylor needed the elevator. That’s pretty generous. I don’t tip random employees on my way out of a restaurant or establishment and you don’t either.
lol, what? Tips aren’t based off how much money the tipper makes.
What makes the stadium employees entitled to her money?
So you're telling OP how she should feel? Lol ok
😂😂😂
The guests don’t take the elevator. Our food comes from under ground so it’s used for employees. They shut it off so employees wouldn’t sneak up there. I’ve been with the ravens for 4 years and have never met anyone. (I did at other places I worked) There’s thousands of employees. It’s impossible. We do get to watch the players and other team warm up so it is cool seeing people like Kelce and Mahomes warm up when no one else is there . The players have an underground private access. I live in the same areas as the players so I see John Harbs, Marlon Humphries and tons of players out shopping and eating more than anything. & one of the housewives mom came in my work (doctor office)
I genuinely needed this explanation, thank you! Also this story is so rad, thanks for sharing it!
Oh LOL yeah that makes sense, thanks haha
…Okay, I’ll ask the next stupid question: why are they holding it to their ear?
“Pocket look like phone book, blue yellow page” - peewee longway
What does the money say to them?
I still don’t understand what this means 🥲
Ok I learned allot from you today. I feel so much younger with this information 😂
New blue money phone who dis
I am still so lost, but sure.
God I'm old. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
I still don’t get it it even after the explanation
Lol I am American and have never heard this in my life.
I'm an American, former bank teller and was totally clueless!😳
Definitely not American. Never heard of those terms in my life.
Your team may have lost but, sis, you friggin won. What a cool experience!!
Sorry the Ravens lost, but that's a really cool experience to tell your friends and family! 

The defense was insane yesterday.  Really was a good game.
It's been pretty documented that she goes out with a stack of cash to give money away to people her presence may inconvenience.
when you’re that rich the only thing you *don’t* have is a budget
💸💸💸💸💸
Haha, I know. Not comparing to make myself miserable, just picturing how it would feel to have that much money and be like 💸💸.
Sure, but a lot of big stars don't tip at all, so it's nice in that regard.
Net worth =/= liquid cash. She would have to sell her houses, her music and anything else she owns to be actually have a billion in hand.
I think her tip was very nice. She obviously can't carry thousands of dollars on her person for tips. Taylor is well known for her generousity wherever she goes, with donations as well. None of this does she announce, the public only hears about it if a recipient decides to go public with the details.
I’m pretty sure the average American doesn’t take the up to date size of their retirement fund into account when calculating tip percentages, but okay.

Why are you trying to downplay someone doing something good by comparing it to the maximum possible good they could do? Taylor is a great example of consistently doing good—why do you think that that’s not something to be glad for and expect from rich people, just because it “could” be doubled?

Real talk man, when my kids do this, let’s say with whining about how I could have got them sprinkles for their ice cream that I got for them? They’re get nothing next time around, because getting spoiled isn’t how you learn respect or gratitude.

No one’s entitled to her money, so yes, it is awesome that she’s giving out 6 cents worth of her billions.
$1.1 billion is not money that she has liquid, and how much actual *cash* do you think she carries around to tip people?
What amount did you use when you assumed an average American here? Just wondering
That… doesn’t mean she has all that as cash on hand. She has tons of real estate. She’s still rich either way, but comparing her NET worth to cash flow is wonky.
There is one in every crowd…today, you are it…
Bad take. You aren't here to add context. You're here to be a pompous ass. This post is about how much the gesture and the $100 meant to OP, not what it means to her.  🙄
This is tiresome 😮‍💨😮‍💨
100 is still 100. If she was handing out thousands or millions everyday she’d go broke . And she doesn’t have 1B. That’s her net worth of her catalog properties stock etc. you must be really sad of a person to bring down anyone for doing anything nice for somone
Yeah. but if she is passing the money out every week to every random stadium worker she sees that adds up really quick. Not to mention all of the generous donations she makes in each city she performs in.   I think she's doing just fine in the tipping/donation department.
Definitely frame the photo of the bill ♥️
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love that you plan to donate 50% to the food bank
THIS should be the top comment! I hope some lucky fan snatches this up from you OP
gross.
No, real normies overspend beyond their means and buy frivolous things and struggle to pay their bills. Check out Mr Moneybags over here responsibly paying their bills! 🤣

😉
If you're gifted money, you should remember that it's a gift. A portion of that money should be treating yourself, if you have debts and bills to settle. Just be disciplined with a percentage (maybe a tithe 10%) and spend just that amount on something. 
That's what I love about her
From customers. Just saying, I wish people were in happy moods like that every week.
Yeah, I think our bills (US) are a mix of linen and cotton
where do you live?
Please allow me to speak on behalf of the 200-ish countries that aren’t the United States 😋

To be honest, I’d never thought about it before, and can’t remember the last time I handled cash.
And how did she smell?

LOL no joke, I wonder what perfume she wears.
I heard she likes Givenchy L'interdit and I was thrilled cause I love that scent myself. What I read about her choices in the past also fit to my personal taste. So I wonder if she's wearing something new that I could also like lolol
YAWN...
There are a few stories online that have popped up about JLo with this. The one I saw was where Ben Affleck had left a tip somewhere, but she picked it up and left a smaller tip (something as low as like $5) before leaving.
She also famously shut down a strip club to film Hustlers and did not compensate the dancers who worked there for lost wages, not did she hire them to be extras in the movie.
it’s an open secret that she is unkind, especially to people she views as “normies”
Nope. She leaves nothing or $5 bills. One of my friends waited on her entourage after the final perfume release about 10 years ago. Roughly 12 people. $1000 worth of food. Dishes cleared. No tip. Demanded the venue had $80 diptyque candles and fresh linens with white paint in all the rooms she was in. Her contract rider is basically going to the moon for dust. Beyond selfish and evil. Tiktok recently did entire stitches on her. I was not surprised.
Ok you can't leave us hanging... we need the story!
As a European I had no idea either, so thanks for asking! 😅
Hard to keep up with all the slang
It’s a flex lol so much money in a stack it looks like a phone? Google the term and you’ll see
Okay, but ... a phone and a phone BOOK are two very different things. One is a phone. The other is a very large book.
Spend me, Seymour! Spend me!
Apparently, it's a dumb way to say a stack of hundreds
😂
Neither had I
Same here!
Same lol
It is American. It is Black slang. I've heard it in Baltimore, which has a history of having its own local slang, but also Pittsburgh and New Orleans.

There are so many report of Brittany mahomes not tipping staff anything, I hope she sees this and it rubs off on her
But, even if we divided it by 10 million (which is 1% her net worth and I think easily accessible to her in cash), we must remember that $100 to her would be 1 cent to most of us (if we have 1,000 in the bank).

It is WONDERFUL that she knows that $100 to her is nothing but SO helpful to the average person. It is truly inspiring that she gave her truck drivers a 100k bonus.

But I think putting this into perspective it’s good for the average citizen. It helps us remember that disparity in income. It helps us not be hard on ourselves.
I wish there could be a law requiring wealthy people to be just like her. Or Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, etc
I don’t think they were complaining. They replied to a poster who said they complain about spending $100.

So they just wanted to provide context.
and maybe journal the story
No I'm sorry, that would be going right toward paying off my credit card debt. Cannot afford to be frivolous.
The United States. I’m just a poor elder millennial 🙃
Dang I was a server for years so I always had 100 bills in my wallet from end of the night tip out. I know a lot of people don’t handle big bills like that regularly tho
It's been online recently she wears Santal Blush by Tom Ford :)
Flower Bomb and Santa’s Blush.
Wow. I hope that isn’t true! That’s so strange, and disrespectful not just of the workers but of her husband who has made his own fortune and can do what he likes with it.
I was in the restaurant biz for a while and saw wives do this 3 different times. Hubby would leave two 10s or two 5s whatever and the wife would pocket one of the bills. She was probably jealous because their waitress was young and pretty.
She was one of 12 producers on the film (I just looked it up). You can’t put all of the blame on her.
So unfortunate. Her persona that she makes money off of is “sweetheart Jenny from the block” too 😩
I love watching her perform and all that. But she is a terrible person and idk why everyone is all "AAAAHHHH, BEN AND JEN AGAIN"
Poor Ben.
I was staying in a very expensive part of London sitting in a sidewalk cafe having coffee. Four big black SUVs pulled in front of a hotel about 50 yards away and guys started hauling in at least 2 dozen, maybe 3 dozen matching pieces of luggage. Then I saw her being escorted in, but I didn't recognize her.
15 minutes later, the SUVs come back and all the luggage was loaded back up. I walked down to see what the hell was going on and just as I turned to walk into the hotel, she and 2 bodyguards were walking out and she yelled at me to get the f*ck out of her way.
I still didn't recognize her. After they left I went inside and the hotel desk people told me who it was and that after she got up to her suite she decided she didn't like the color of the room so she left and went somewhere else
As an American, I had no idea. Haha.
I googled and it looks like it was much more of a flex in the 90s when phones were the size of our heads 😅
It’s funny because nowadays phones are pretty thin
Ohhhh…Okay. 😅 Thanks!
Underrated comment
I'll make it worth your while!!?
Thanks, I don’t think it’s dumb though, it’s just a saying I’m unfamiliar with
Same
nothing more american than an american saying that something that is indeed american isn’t american lmao
[removed]
Ah yes, but she’s exactly the person *you* think she is because you have such superior knowledge.
Brittany machines ain’t rich enough to be doing that lmao
Consider the 55 million in BONUSES she recently gave, I think she has an idea. She had no need to tip someone for bringing her a single drink hundreds, but people who work significant hours with her are tipped generously, along with fantastic wages. Which is easily seen with how long so many on her team have been with her, even with long periods of not touring. 
I don't think anyone normal is comparing their income to that of someone selling out stadiums.
Flower Bomb as well✨💖
![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|6804)
Especially after being in films such as maid in Manhattan lol.  You'd think Jenny from the block would remember the lil people.
What a b word. Thank you for sharing. 
I still don’t. People hold stacks of money to their ear?
lol same I was trying to figure out for too long
As an American I’m still dubious to this slang.  But I’m not hip with the lingo these days, ya dig?
lol also American. Didn’t know. I never heard that before. I was trying to think. I’m like maybe a Judith Leiber bag shaped like a phone with money it lmao.
I actually think it originated in the early 2000s-2010s and 50 cent claims he and Floyd Mayweather started it. It’s from rap/hip hop culture though so it makes sense why swifties on this thread aren’t familiar. It’s not unused now though!
I know that non-Americsns, especially those from (geographically) smaller countries like in Europe, have a tendency to underestimate how vast America is and therefore the multitudes it contains. But it's weird when an American does it though I do see it. I visit family in Baltimore and NOLA and their colloquial speech can be totally different from ours here in the Bay Area even among fellow Black communities.

With endorsements her hubby probably makes around $15 mil a year. And given how companies love to give money to people who don't need it, I'm sure she either has a half mil in endorsement deals or at least gets lots of stuff for free.
In other words, if she handed out ten $100 tips every single day, it would only amount to maybe 3% of their income.
I sure wish more wealthy people were more like Taylor. 
For instance, as near as anyone can tell, Steve Jobs gave a grand total of $0.00 to charities in his lifetime.
Her husband has a 10-year, $450 million contract
But this comment started with someone saying “I feel bad spending $100 when I leave my house”

So that’s where this comment thread and my comment comes from.
Omg Santal 💖(never trust voice to text)💀
I thought it was a cell phone with a blue wallet case lol
Agreed. I'm confused AF and I live prob 20 minutes from OP 😆
I think he just meant that she had a big stack of $100 bills. So big that it can be a money phone.
Canadian here, still lost.
People carry money?
I didn't get it either.  Apparently it started as a rapper thing.

[https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.43994/title.rappers-rail-against-jay-zs-money-phone-putdown](https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.43994/title.rappers-rail-against-jay-zs-money-phone-putdown)
Think rap videos. 

Edit to add: this is as common in rap videos as gold grills and holding a Glock to the side. I’m pretty sure I have seen Lil Wayne do all of these things in one verse. 
Stereotypical rappers and dipshits do
Cool beans
That’s groovy
Oh! Hey, fellow kid!

That’s an egg that doesn’t know his onions sweetheart. It’s the bees knees to have some cush in your glad rags when you’re on a toot at a juice joint.
You know what’s up 😂😂
i see inhabitants of the same city (i’m born and raised san diego) not understanding certain colloquial speech and/or slang 😂
Like people in the north east and other areas call pizzas "Pies". The first time I ever heard someone order it that way I was like....it's not a pie though lol. Keeps things interesting!
“Taylor before she was Taylor” would make her about 16 or so years old. I’ll alert the media that a teenage girl was a little much…
That unfunny comedian that everyone had strange reactions to? That’s the only example?

Same lol. That's what I was picturing in my head lol
Too funny so did I.  I have to catch up to todays lingo.
That’s what I was picturing!
American and I am also very confused
No snark whatsoever, but that’s funny because phones are really thin these days. 
I googled money phone (because blue money phone didn’t not turn up anything) and then saw the origins. Im not well versed in hip hop, or I’m too old. Maybe both. But I get it now. Lol
why dont just say that lol
yes, exactly what OP said above
Yes, cash>digital funds
Hi! love Taylor and the Chiefs. That’s the “weak” way to do the money phone. True money phones stack the 100s horizontally because it showcases more cash; another status thing. Hugs and hearts!! Here’s an example from Young Dolph RIP

https://preview.redd.it/x6cq72pp7ffc1.jpeg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61afae475ebb0bc8eea14a14f1b79adb3aca8401
To think about them, I’d have to watch them. Nothing against them, but I don’t think I’ve ever actually seen one.
Far out.
Just a millennial who grew up on Taylor and 50 😂
Honestly I'm in my early thirties and I've already lost track. It's moving faster than I can keep up with. I just got around to using emojis 🤷🏾‍♀️
[removed]
[removed]
Because it takes two sentences to explain when you can just say “money phone.” Where I’m from it’s a common phrase so they probably just thought to save time from writing it all out.
Ohhhhhhh MONEY PHONEEE hahahaha love it. What a G
So it's literally just a stack of $100 bills? The Google's told me blue money was a rap term for $100 bills. So, that's what I'm gathering.
I thought I was literally a little purse or zippered pouch that was large enough to only home paper money and was in the shape of a phone and was blue.
Neato
Sameee 😂
She literally just sat there and drank her drink. She didn’t do anything wrong. Good grief.
You’re right. Literally everyone else in that room acted so differently towards Jo Koy’s jokes. Everyone was laughing except her, right? No. Dude bombed. Look at Ryan Gosling’s face. Same reaction. You met a teenager you didn’t like and don’t believe people have the capacity to change over the course of 20 years. That’s fine. She’s not above criticism but her face at an award show where no one else was laughing either is a weird thing to pick.
Not being able to take a joke that was targeted at you doesn't make you a horrible person lol
People shouldn’t have to put up with things that they don’t find funny just to convenience idiots like you.
You're more upset and having a hissy fit in a Reddit comment section about her than she actually had reacting to the joke.
[removed]
> two sentences

Wad of cash
Lump of cash
Stash of cash
Bunch of cash

I dont think any of those are two sentences
[removed]
Also she took it fine. She just didn’t fake laugh at it. Was she supposed to go up there and slapped the comedian?

Germany fans celebrating with a saxophone player
Saxophone player is @andreschnura on Insta
**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**
  

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Dude that saxophone sounds so fucking good, I had no idea it could elevate a good beat like that
The vibe of this Euros is absolutely fucking impeccable.
The world is not ready for Germans dancing Samba.

Be glad we can't.
It takes some set of lungs to bounce around like that and still play the sax so well.
Football is really the best game in the world. You wouldn't see Germans and Scots celebrating with a saxophone in another other sport like this. I love this game.
He even did [RADW by Hafti](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8VOdJ6I9EB/?hl=de) lmao.

Love the Scots just vibing with the Germans in the background, despite probably having no clue what's going on. Euros are simply the best
It’s staying home lads
Man, the videos I'm seeing coming out of Germany this past week are fantastic. Is this the best football tournament of the past 20 years? I think so.
This is why I love football and international tournaments specifically, this shit is incredible to see regardless of who you're wanting to win the whole thing.
1st song: Samba de Janeiro - Bellini  
2nd song: Major Tom (völlig losgelöst) - Peter Schilling
Those glasses... that rudi voller jersey.. that saxophone.. 
This is so 2024
Epischer Sax Typ
This tournament is proving that sport is absolutely nothing without the fans. There’s some things Saudi money can’t buy.
Now do the epic sax guy! The German hip thrusting would be Wunderbar!
Takes me back to Euro 2008
I guess they own Samba de Janeiro after beating Brazil that bad 🤷🏻‍♂️.
Nothing even remotely close to this came from Qatar.
The Euro 2008 vibes are immaculate
God I love football
Germany, you've been wonderful. Just wonderful.
I was born on the wrong continent
Does anyone know what the second song is?
Must be from Saxony
Germany is just nailing the vibes this tournament. *This* is how you host a major tournament
So many Germans are gonna have Scottish pals after this lmao we’re in every video
I fucking love how sport brings happiness and atmosphere to people.
Must be from Lower Saxony
Germans after winning 7-1 to Brazil in 2014.
Everybody loves a sax
It looks like Timo Werner’s slightly older brother.
Summoning the saxman

https://youtu.be/ez8m4PXksQs?si=4u-ljmBx0JVSbHMc
All those clips really show case why the big cups should take place in actual football countries that are easily accessable for a lot of fans instead of hosting a WC in Qatar...
This is why they call it the beautiful game
Some rogue Scots in there. Love to see it.
Name of the first song?
I don't want this tournament to end
Völlig losgelöst von der Erde  
Schwebt das Raumschiff völlig schwerelos
+100000000
This folks  know how to have an awesome good time.
is there a sub for EURO videos like these?
dude has some killer sound
With a Völler shirt and fast sunglasses no less, what a character. Only missing a stash and a mullet
Wie geil is des??
Was not expecting some Peter Schilling there. Fucking legend! 

But with a Völler shirt he does run a serious risk of wet hair.
It's like a madness concert, what a vibe.
Nothing says 'goal' like a saxophone serenade! Scoring on and off the field, I guess.
This song makes me feel like it’s the 2000s again
What a fun party!
Everything is better with a saxophone
Now I think we need Moldova to qualify so we can have Epic Sax Guy at the tournament next time
Man I really want to be in Germany right now to experience this atmosphere live .. 

It just gave me flashback of Euro 2016 .. where the entire crowd kept singing 'Will Greggs on Fire' it was such a catchy song that captured the entire tournament.

Feels good to have a proper tournament with the vibes .. After Russia, Qatar disasters.
If you look closely you can see Højlund with a bottle somewhere in the crowd.
I am missinc a specific german song
Euros looks like a blast!
Song takes me back to the 08 euros
I was at the 2016 Euros and some Dutch fan on gear kept playing Bakermat on his Sax haha
This is so embarrassing but what is the name of that song? It escapes me.
Football is special
Is it legal to play a saxophone without wearing sunglasses
The world cup could never
What’s the second song. I heard it in Germany during Oktoberfest and the Germans went wild
He got a lot of videos on his channel him playing and celebrating, nice watch 👌
Remove the chain- because that’s off it.
This ist what Europe really means. I mean look close. There are so many different ethnics from different teams in this video dancing and having fun together. This shows me that a united Europe is the only way to go.
Would never see this in Qatar. Fuck fifa if they have another tournament in the Middle East.
Would have been peak r/soccer if the saxophone was not on his lips and the saxophone kicked in again.
remind me of this

Hey, play that George Michael song
we are so back

That's it, we need to bring a whole SWAC Marching Band to the Copa
Fucking proud to be European
I was hoping he had played the epic sax guy solo from eurovision:(
I wish I was that cool when I played sax in high school
Thanks… I have to get a saxophone now
This really makes me want to be a soccer fan. Now if only I can figure out a way to like sports…
This is how it should be every time. Have a good time together and celebrate football.
This Championship is just amazing in all aspects. Wish I could be there. Dreaming of going to north America in 2026
It's stuff like this that makes me proud to be European. People from different cultures having a big party and a bit of banter on the side.
It’s almost like when you have a tournament in a proper football country its better?

Madness

RONALDO V FOOTBALL
Is it a German MJF?

LETS GOOOOOO

Should get van Gaal to come along he likes a good saxophone player.
Next he should unload ["The Man With The Red Face"](https://youtu.be/dA1bWj9LHmU?si=rj-6qFjNfpZYmuCP)
Oh god haven't heard Peter Schilling's Major Tom in ages - 2nd song
Samba
Heh
What was the second song?
THAT'S DUKE SILVER
Which city is this ?
Haha this is AWESOME!
What’s the equivalent of this happening in Qatar? 😄

Seriously thank fuck soccer in a real country
Class
What song is this?
u/savevideo
He looks like Flula Borg ngl
What tune is he playing?
we want more
From Saxony?
u/savevideo
Can you imagine if they win ?
Timo Werner making the best of being left out of the squad. Never seen him play better!
The king, he got laid for sure.
Man i fucking love when fans of opposite teams get along. There is still hope for this world
man that looks good. Wish I could be there. And that is a nice tune too
Hell yea, except the sport itself this is what sports should always be about
VÖLLIG LOSGELÖST ♥️
reminds me of Leo P
Almost like the tournament vibes are way better when actual fans are there \*wink\* qatar
His greatest day ever.
I lived in Bavaria for a few years.  Germans can party with the best of them!
Love it! What a great night.
They’re going to win this thing, aren’t they?
From what I can tell, everyone seems to get along except the English.
I bet that guy felt on top of the world and could take his pick of any woman/man in Germany in that moment!
u/savevideo
Man just got infinite aura in that moment
Its moments like this that give me a little for hope for humanity
[deleted]
song 1: samba de janeiro

song 2: major tom
I'm grateful he didn't play THAT song
Now play L’Amour Toujours
I played saxophone growing up so I will always love it but when I was in Madrid like a decade ago this club had this Jewish DJ/Italian sax player combo that just blew the roof off the place. Still remember the saxxed up version of Hey Brother they did. Legendary.
You should look into Griz and Big Gigantic if you haven’t been up on saxophone with some EDM
Love this [banger](https://youtu.be/M27R17pRXDQ?si=gg60k9xn6wC2HkCO)

Check out Ehrling's Music. Its super vibey EDM Sax beats. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoEhoGt4mIw for an example.
we haven't had a proper tournament on the continent for a long time, flashbacks really. How it should be
can't wait for the compilation video of all the nice vibes we've seen during this 2024 Euros:)
I live in Germany now, moved here 2 months ago, and even though I'm not German, the every day vibe around here is immense. I'm living in the NRW area, with 4 of the stadiums all within an hour on public transport, so there's an awesome mix of languages and nationalities around here... All vibing
This. The most atmosperic euros ever
What celebrating it in a country that values football does to a mf
So far - this has to be the best national tournament I've watched. From the fans to the games - everything is absolute banger!
This is what happens you host tournaments in decent, football minded countries unlike Russia and Qatar
thats what happens when you dont sell out to countries who dont care about the game. Give it to Europe or South America
I agree!
this is what happens when a nation that loves the game hosts it. 



...or sell to the highest bidder..that works too
no more fans from mumbai in different shirts
If only shit was similar in america :(
they’re going to get me to move back to germany after 20 years fucks sake
Only way the vibe would be better is if the Irish had qualified.

[German Samba de Janeiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4BdIP6bvc)
Fun fact the biggest Samba festival outside of Brazil is held in Germany.
Joke's on you: Samba de Janeiro is actually a German produced song hahahahaha
Owning the trauma
You know the song he was playing is German?
what samba?
At least you had a random Scot in there.
The funny thing is that Samba de Janeiro is actually a German song
Oh Gott! Nicht mehr 🫠
BRA71L
I hop they do this a lot in the US in 2026
A well played sax makes any atmosphere 10x better..and this guy nailed it
It helps a lot that he's mic'd up
Reminds me of Leo P in that regard. I guess if you're known for playing the sax and dancing, you're pretty damn good at doing it.
Dude could be a top ska band member with pipes like that
May I introduce to you the World of DCI, drum corps international (really just America). Basically professional marching bands without the woodwinds (so no sax guys unfortunately). But there are marching bands in the America Midwest and south with huge high school marching bands, up to 300 ppl, with a variety of different costumes and set designs. 


Anyways here’s my favorite DCI moment. 

https://youtu.be/F4_j5W8-L3g?si=ySISEORrk4FLp1dF



Edit: the championship is in early august in Indianapolis at Lucas oil stadium. However I believe SCV (the corp betrayed in the video) is out due to financial instability. But besides a big giant missing these shows never fail to hit, but be prepared for the Blue devils to pay the judges again and win another championship (dci fans know what I mean)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeUGoi34SxM
Yeah, the pause in the end was well deserved.
[Leo P sends his regards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krLYZmPRtnc)
Can't wait for these scenes at the Handball World Championship
Now I wonder how a sax and a bagpipe sound one alongside the other.
[deleted]
I fucking love this sport
you won't see croats and albanians singing death threats to serbs in any other sport either
They would do..    when they are drunk
Scots are the best fans out there. Top tier Shame they'll be eliminated so quickly lol
Perfect opportunity to take it away from you.
VFL
Definitely the best of the past 11 years at least...

...Yes, 11 years is a random cutoff, why do you ask?
World Cup 2006 in Germany was even better
I’ve been having so much FOMO… I want to be in Germany right now
austria/swiss was banger as well
2006 WC is still ahead. The hype during that summer was just something else and the games were great too. Then this Euro probably so far. Then 2014. 2008 was nice. I dont exactly remember 2004 enough and 2010 is massively overrated in hindsight. So yeah it's probably in 2nd place rn which is crazy since Euro's usually dont generate the hype of a WC. So pound for pound considering its a EURO it might actually be the best yeah
South Africa was also great!
In terms of atmosphere Brazil was the bomb.
The first one I’m really sad not to attend. Football should always be about this
In term of atmosphere, if we just talk about Euros and WC, I don't think so. 2022 WC was so special because we had all games in one metro system, therefore no need to travel far and every fans were there.

2014 was amazing because it was in Brazil.

2016 was good but not that amazing while it was in my country.

2010 was the first WC in Africa and I'll never forget the vuvuzelas.
Thank you so much 😊.
Major Tom has an English version btw! It's called Major Tom (coming home) and is also by Peter Schilling
This should be at the top! Never heard that second song before but it's an absolute banger, and arguably slaps harder on sax than the original!
And I fucking love it
His hair is dangerously close to broccoli hair. If this were one or two years ago we would have lost him for sure, and we'd be saying "Leb wohl, lieber Andreas."

Samba de Janeiro has always been [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_de_Janeiro?wprov=sfla1)
5 world cups to 4 is the only score that matters
Those drunk brits on a night out hanging out with some locals and their Lion was pretty good
It did bro i was there, moroccan/sengal/mexican/saudi arabian/japanese/argentinian fans were awesome. All u have to do is type on youtube wc 2022 fans dancing but u wont.
It did. It just wasn't from white people or based on European culture with alcohol and shit so you people will pretend it doesn't matter because only Europeans and South Americans are allowed to have footballing culture
What is this obsession with Qatar? In every single post about fans in the Euros, you find Qatar half a dozen times. Let it go, it was 2 years ago.
30'000+++ Dutch partying in Basel. What a time to be alive.

Major Tom
"Major Tom (völlig losgelöst)" by Peter Schilling


https://youtu.be/KQRaj1vcnrs?si=D-zaP442QKAeL0Bp
It’s the unofficial German football hymn for this tournament it’s our new official goal song, unfortunately uefa doesn’t allow country specific goal songs but it’s still played before and after every Germany game.
Major Tom - [völlig losgelöst](https://youtu.be/24r3LNXWi6o?si=niyw73ZcfeN1Zn4g)
What’s the first song??
Which one? There are three Saxonys in Germany
Watched the match against Switzerland in a fanzone in Cologne. All Germans were supporting Scotland.
Whether you guys are eliminated this weekend or not, could you just stick around? Been in love with Scotland and the Scottish for years now and this tournament just reinforces that. It’s an immense pleasure having you guys here :D
We love Scotland 
Made me giggle
That was brutal. I enjoyed the first couple of goals, but after that it was just cruel. Even the ppl in the stadium were speechless and some even cried. It was hard to watch even as a german
A certified classic.

Germans have a hard on for Major Tom right now. Even had a poll and made it our official goal song. Since UEFA doesn’t allow individual goal songs for countries at the Euros, we’re playing it after our games instead.
Like the second one he’s playing?
they were both german songs: first was Samba de Janeiro and second one was Major Tom
Samba do brazil
are you serious? lol

This clip makes me regret stopping playing saxophone when I was younger - immaculate vibes
Absolute vibe units, those two. PS GFY goes stupid hard
Exactly, the tournaments in the shite despot countries made us forget why tournaments were so good
Yeah the covid Euros sandwiched between World Cups in shitholes means it's 8 years since a proper tournament.

Remember Qatar's fan culture was a bunch of fake fans lmao
The last really good tournament was in France when Ronaldo lifted the trophy and 2006 Germany
Love it, really hoped for this stuff considering all the bad news machine gun of the last years. Gives me 2006 vibes
It's incredibly sad that the last Copa América in Brazil was during COVID and the current is in the US
Football's coming home - to all of us.
Recklinghausen oder Oberhausen?
here in Düsseldorf we had the day drinking Scotsmen who fell in love with my dog when I was walking him, I live in the city center and it's highly entertaining
After Russia in 18, COVID in 20/21 and Qatar in the EU Winter 22. Europe was looking forward to having a good time again and celebrate what soccer is all about, Fans being outside having a good time celebrating with each other.
Man fr, 
Qatar was such a shitshow compared to this. And this one was even a World Cup.
2014 was very special. From the Netherlands destroying Spain to Costa Rica and Uruguay beating England and Italy to [REDACTED] it was a very magical world cup, and the Brazilian crowds actually love the sport and were receptive to foreign fans
Hell yeah.
Couch, but yes
Yeah I am actually

edit: also posting that comment when you frequent r/wow and r/exnocontact is fucking hilarious
Why insult someone for no reason?
I hate how all the highlights of that match skip Lahm's tackle against Marcelo >:/
"They've come here for a Samba, and they've been totally rocked back on their heels!"

*Hach*. Immer wieder schön.
Savage
Ahh, time for my annual rewatch
why have fifa blocked this from playing as an embed?
FYI, that was in Belo Horizonte 😤
Based on the fact that this link is purple, I already know I've seen these highlights like a dozen times already.
NSFW dude, you can’t just post porn like this.
The salsa (dancing) scene is also huge in Germany I’ve come to find out recently
Fun fact, the biggest Oktoberfest outside of Germany is in Brazil.
In Coburg, right?
You mean the biggest carnival. Don’t think it’s a samba festival.
wow full circle

Moon Hooch for me.
Miss that guy
Haven't followed DCI for nearly a decade, but that's a right shame about SCV. One of the OGs too.

And now The Cadets are folding too? That's terrible. Loved them in 2011.
Not sure if sarcasm, but on a slightly smaller scale, you absolutely can see scenes like this at major Handball tournaments. In the bigger Handball nations at least.
In before its only happened in one country and not inviting others fr fr
I myself am stoked for the Tram championships. Also in Frankfurt this year.
Me too.  Scottish fans will flood the stadiums and celebrate as their national team is a handball behemoth and will dominate once again.
I thought you were jokingly referring to American Football. Googled it and turns out, Handball is a real sport.
Probably an instant Eurovision classic
Yeah, I was going to say. Dutch corner on Alpe d'Huez goes so hard.
I wouldn’t be so sure, if we beat Hungary then we’ve got a decent chance
I mean they drew Switzerland. If they beat Hungary they're pretty much through
Nah once is enough
Sorry to disappoint but we don’t have any players with mullets anymore
I still remember exactly where I was when 7-1 happened, it was a crazy day
The 2010 World Cup is goated imo.  

The waka waka + wavin flag songs put it over the top.
Pre-social media so it doesn't count 

/s
Plenty of time left mate 
I was there, wish I could stay for the whole thing it was perfect
[Except this one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKCIFXqhLzo)
Vuvuzelas killed this tournament for me.
2022 World Cup? The one in Qatar? Are you taking the piss?! The football was fine, but there was absolutely no atmosphere inside or outside the stadiums. It's a dour, sterile country, and it gave us a dour, sterile World Cup.
I know and it's equally as great as its German version! I just thought it would be more appropriate to write the original version here.
Wasn't it sung in Breaking Bad in one episode? By Walt's weird lab partner? 
Knabe
oh my god that single sentence just brought on a wave of flashbacks
Wow, TIL!
The closest we’ve come to that this year is some drunk Brit passing out during the England match and waking up alone in the stadium at like 4 am
You mean this? I wouldnt say this comes close to the video above lol

All the touch grass redditors that havent even stepped out of their hometowns doubting your experience even though you were literally there 😂
Got any awesome clips to share from the Qatar world cup?
If it was in an actual country like Egypt or Morocco no one would have these issues. Stop trying to make it racial the fact is it was held in a plastic country with no football culture that had to use slaves and bribe FIFA to host the tournament.
Well because people are really upset about it, not just because of the missing atmosphere but also the criminal ways Qatar got the votes to host the worldcup. And it’s not like it stopped with Qatar, Emirates and the Saudi’s are trying to do the same. So I think it’s good to remind people what football culture as all about and that slave labor isn’t a good substitute for that
[removed]
Seems fairly similar to today. Thought more would've changed in the last 15 years.
Absolute banger
That's mean, you'll just confuse them
Samba de Janeiro

No Pukki, No Party
The World Cup is now being hosted by countries with no football culture
Cheers🍻
Easy enough to pick it back up!
If your mouth and hands still work, you can make it work.
Fuck yeah it does!
You do know that people were celebrating in every Euro/World cup. Can we stop with this narrative??
This does seem a little racist, you can criticize Qatar and Russia without calling it a shithole (which in terms of standard of living it isn’t since it’s the richest country in the world)
Yeah, 100%. Just look at the three upcoming World Cups: USA/Canada/Mexico and then Marokko/Portugal/Spain (???) and even worse in 2034 it‘s gonna be Saudi Arabia…

World Cup is so dead. Earliest chance of a proper tournament will be 20-fucking-38
Brazil clears
Eh euro 16 was ok at best football wise. Some upsets yes but also fairly low scoring.
[deleted]
‘06 Germany was awesome. I was there for other reasons but as an American it was great to see.
Oberhausen, well *technically* Duisburg, my street is Oberhausen one side and Duisburg on the other 😅
I loved it because Lahm always get semi forgotten in "Best" fullback discussions. Lahm and Mueller owned that side of the field for the first 30 minutes and nothing mattered after that.
Seriously, that tackle was as good as any of the goals.
Do you have a link. I can't find anything on Youtube
I will never forget Lahm.
Everyone knows you've got to pay up to be in bed with them.
Oh!

Close enough I guess.
no it is literally called 'Internationales Samba Festival' and has nothing to do with Ash Wendsday.
No, Samba de Janeiro. Produced in Cologne.
The Saxophone would make the funeral 10x sadder.
Man's still around and rocking it
Just for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp5PwrOshgE
Ah dude you’ve missed all the robberies the blue coats, crown, and crusaders have suffered in the last 3-4 years. But yeah it’s sad to see corps start to disappear because of this, they need to find a way to make it more affordable. I believe this is scv 2nd year not here, idk these years past the pandemic have been a blur
Handball is so underrated outside of the nations that played it.

Saw a video about it once where some Football or Basketball US Players played handball with players that played to the World Cup. Tournament was played outdoors on grass on a smaller field than indoors and the young guys didnt even seemed to play that well while playing with/against mostly older players.

Afterwards joked about how they could probably play in the World Championships and do well and that more players of football/basketball should switch to handball and start dominating it.   
  
Clearly either didnt do the research or just didnt talked about it on purpose that the US National Team is one of the worst to feature in the World Championship and as far away from winning a World Cup as Team Germany is from winning an international American Football Tournament involving NFL players.
It was a tad tongue in cheek but I am aware of how popular handball is in Germany and I bet the world championship is a great vibe
Wait how did you not know this? :D
Well now I want joint entries by different countries to be possible in Eurovision
Absolutely, 4 points will almost definitely see them through with how things stand right now.

If Germany slap Switzerland around they could even end up 2nd in the group.
Fingers crossed, I wanna see you crazy lads around for a bit longer.
I'm afraid
Well well
Andrich has a short one!
I remember nothing. No idea what the hell you’re taking about there mate.
Same. Never forget.
Man I don't even like Football, but you can bet your ass I was sitting in my kitchen here in Germany, celebrating every goal they hit
Shame about the vuvuzelas.
Vuvuzelas....
Happy cake day.
Probably can’t take the time off nor justify the ticket price. Hopefully I’ll catch a Copa America game
The football was good, but I don't remember the atmosphere outside the stadiums having such a good vibe. I think we should just nominate Germany to host all football events from now on.
I know a lot of people hate them but when I hear vuvuzelas now it still takes me back and brings up a lot of memories of 2010.
Like the USA, the passion isn't there. But foreign fans, especially from South America, brought their usual passion during games. I'll never forget Morocco as well who almost played at home during each game.
Oh yes, but I'm sure people who don't speak German might enjoy the English version more, so I thought I'd clarify
Bube
Wait for real?
Exactly, i was even against it being held in qatar but the atmosphere was awesome during that wc ngl. These guys downvoting should just search in this sub the videos of fans from december 2022, it was a great experience.
I was at the World Cup lol. Morocco fans were absolutely insane for example.

Bribing FIFA means a country has no football culture? Hmmm, Germany would never do such a terrible thing. Definitely didn't do it in 2006. Because they are European and Europeans have TRUE FOOTBALL FANS. How could they ever bribe anyone?
I have no idea what you said, but I suddenly have the urge to invite you to a beer.
Samba de Amigo vibes
yeah spain, morocco, portugal. country without football cultures 👍
Mexico has no football culture? you can't be serious
No football culture?
Show me scenes like this from Qatar
not like this
I saw zero videos like this, or the Dutch dance or the banter amongst fans from the  Qatar world cup... that cup almost seemed "sanitized".. only good part was the finals
You see, but this time the guys are white, so it counts!
Its a shithole. Totalitarian state which adds nothing to humanity other than the fossil fuels they are sitting on
Racism would imply I have issue with people from any of those countries.

I have issues with totalitarian regimes that heavily invest in western sporting infrastructure to camouflage domestic human rights abuses
Holy smokes you are being so dramatic, the North American and Iberian WCs will be just fine. By your standards there must only be 2 or 3 countries on Earth that should be allowed to host.
Huh what's wrong with those countries?
Easily. German TV made a documentary about 2014 and the setting as well as the people who are all so passionate about football just made it amazing.

And to still bring that passion after getting massacred to the team that did it to them shows what a special tournament it will be for all history.
I think he meant in Europe!
Personally I love the Euros more than the World Cup when it comes to fans and vibes. Even Brazil 2014 had the problem of some games not evolving South American Teams being not even close to fully packed or just having a lot of Brazilians scattered around.

You dont have that problem on continental championships (same with Copa). Like every game you see both countries having their "walls" put up. Helps that in Germany the stadiums are perfect for that.
I beg to differ. 2016 was the best of them all in my completely unbiased opinion.
He’s referring to 2016 where Portugal won in France.
Knew it 

;)
I don't think he's quite forgotten. He deserves to be in the top 5 fullbacks of all time, but man it's a tough category to compete in. Thinking Brazil alone have Roberto Carlos, Carlos Alberto, Cafu and Alves, then there are Ashley Cole and Javi Zanetti... I think 5th might be where I put Lahm in all this.
> I loved it because Lahm always get semi forgotten

I think I saw Phillip Lahm not too long ago [drinking Jägermeister on some American tv show.](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdWttYmRha2R4YjR3MW1iYjMwN3B5MGM3Yjk3cG5rNDVubW1xYjk3eCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/r8I7tDl75QLfh2SkpE/giphy.gif)

Yeah but I listened to him when he was with the original band (forgot the name, but a lot of members left due to jobs etc)
Used to be a big fan of their lucky chops band, trust me when I say I’ve seen videos, especially this one, like a million times
Coz I've always used Handball as a slang for American Football. No idea that it was a thing thing.
It may not look like it but I do think it will be a close match. Scotland was just abysmal that day, and the game against Hungary was quite even, especially in the first half. And Schweiz looked quite good imo.
Fuck it, it was an amazing time visiting Germany. Shame the team let us down.
This isn't a gotcha moment. I said if they beat Hungary. Which would've been right. They didn't.
What do you mean? They gave us [this absolute masterpiece!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8JGhoVybkM)
Nah, it's important to keep it spaced apart a bit to generate the hype. If we hosted the next one in two, four or even six years, and another one a few years later, it would wear off too quickly. 

We've hosted big football tournaments in 1974 / 1988 / 2006 and now in 2024. This 14-18 year gap is perfect imo, most people will still remember the previous one but it's not exactly like it happened yesterday.
> but I don't remember the atmosphere outside the stadiums having such a good vibe

I mean probably because TikTok didn't exist and Instagram was still for arty hipsters (who still existed at the time) lol.
Nah, that's bollocks. The Americans might not quite have the same passion for the game as Europe or South America, but they'd get on board and give us a way better atmosphere than the boring sand dwellers.

Poor bloke looks hungover to fuck. 
It's nice that they're having fun, but this doesn't even come close to what is happening here every single day in multiple cities.
Yo thats awesome, thanks for the links!
The last video is full of hired plastic fans from India and Bangladesh supporting other national teams. It’s hilarious.
>Bribing FIFA means a country has no football culture?

Way to misunderstand what I said whilst also ignoring 90% of what I said.

Saxophones are indeed haram
And even then, that was marred by the gatecrashing from Saltbae and Macron.
LMAO the second part is true. But define shithole for me please, they’re wealthier than you can imagine, with one of The best standards of living out there, so from that aspect no it’s not a shithole.
Oh alright my bad then
Nah man, they should just hold it on ONE country and one only.
North America definitely won’t have these vibes, except maybe the Mexico part. Just look at the scene in this video, there’s no physical space for this to exist in America. It’s just far out stadiums and parking lots and highways.
The countries are just fine! It‘s the multi-country/continent stuff that pretty surely loses all vibes. As seen before.
We had so many good WCs and EUROs in a row, but since 2014, it has really been lacking.  
    
Just looking at the World Cups I witnessed: 2002 was already pretty good, 2006 was amazing just like this EURO, 2010 we had the whole continent of Africa going crazy, 2014 we were in one of, if not *the* most fanatical football nation.  
And since then: WC2018 was shit, EURO2020 had no vibe, WC2022 was even more shit.  
  
It's so refreshing to be back in a nation where football is a religion.
It wasn't even worth watching in my absolutely completely unbiased opinion. 

Jk I lived in Lisbon back then and it was great fun! I do remember the group phase being kind of meh though.
same brother
You're giving me "keep my windows and doors locked" vibes now 😳 lmao
I have Lahm in Third or fourth depending on if you want to rank Maldini as full back or not.

Lahm was crazy consistent on the pitch. The only thing he doesnt have going for him are his early career injuries. I think some of your players have crazier highlights for example with crazy tackles. Lahm has less of them because he was so good that he barely ever needed to have a crazy tackle.
Which is kind of mean since he was consistently worldclass over his entire career but a different player type than all of them. I think the captain of one of the stronger national teams that won a WC should be rated higher.
In no world would I put Alves ahead of Lahm. Lahm was a major factor for Bayern and Germany. Alves was obviously solid, but he was never one of the real factors in Barcelona or Brazil. Im sorry, but this Barca wasnt great because of Alves...
Cole isn’t in the same conversation as Lahm, Zanetti, Roberto Carlos, Alves, Cafu, Maldini, etc.
I loved that Boateng immediately gave him shit for trying to sell that as anything other than a perfect tackle.
Samba de Janeiro is also a German song
Too Many Zooz
World Cup 2042 it is
Americans are not huge on soccer, but they are massive fans of sports in general. It'll be a fun time for sure. The main problem is the distance between games.
that is confirmed to be fake
"Have fun like us or your fun doesn't count"


Are you guys seriously going to gatekeep fun now lol. What weird nonsense is that. Criticize Qatar all you want for the valid reasons that do exist but acting like only Europeans can truly enjoy football (which is clearly the implication here) is strange to say the least, especially when you haven't even attended the event so can't really comment on how the atmosphere actually was
I agree with you that Fifa are corrupt. I agree that the management behind the Qatar world cup was morally questionable. Neither of those things have anything to do with fan enjoyment or how passionate locals are about football. You mention Egypt and Morocco and fans from those countries were at the World Cup in Qatar and got the opportunity to enjoy it while they probably would have never been able to attend a European tournament (at least not as easily).



Qatar is a plastic country. Criticism of the administrative practices behind that World Cup is not racial. The racial aspect is this notion, on every post of a fan group celebrating in Germany, that Qatari fans or other middle eastern fans at the Qatar World Cup did not enjoy themselves or did not have that level of passion. The fan atmosphere at a tournament has nothing to do with the administration of it, and the comment I replied to is solely about that aspect, not any of the things you mentioned.
Didn't they win the last two Asian Cups?
It's especially funny knowing that most of these "international fans" were the workers from India, Pakistan, etc. paid by Qatar to act as fans. And it shows as those celebrations lack soul
Tame
You're either master troll or you don't know the difference between Tunisia and Turkey 😁
You loser
I don’t think so
“Best standard of living” when 90% of Qatars population is foreign workers, many of which are modern day slaves.
Birmingham is wealthier than the Lake District, only one of those is a shithole.
Why? Mexico, for example, would not have enough sway / strong enough influence to get to host it on its own. This way, their fans still get to enjoy the World Cup at home.
Maybe so, doesnt meant they cant be great tournaments for those lucky enough to go.
I mean 2020-21 was Covid season so that was understandable. Plans had to be altered. People were staying home.
What was wrong with 2016?  I thought it was pretty fun (even if I did not love the final so much).
2022 was saved by banger games
Don't worry, living in Leipzig 480km away. But spent my first 25 years there :)

Don't forget to join "open days" (once a year) and visit a coalmine! Then you get the vibe of the region, helps to understand people's minds.
He if even shot goals when needed.
its very subjective at that point really. I mean rankings are always subjective of course but you cant say any of the names mentioned above are that superior or inferior from one another.
Why is Alves even there?
Yep, I misread the other guy. Kinda distracted because there's a game happening. Sorry
Lucky chops actually but yeah zooz is good too
Are you in Germany right now?
Why couldn't Egyptians or Morrocons attend a European tournament? Both nations have large diasporas in Europe already. Qatar had way less actual fans of all nationalities attending simply due to how small it was which is a large reason why these events could not happen. Its the equivalent of holding a European tournament in Luxembourg.
Yeah, just compare the first linked video (genuine Argentine fans) with the Argentine fans in last video (and the “French fans”)
Oops. My mistake, to be honest their flags are very similar.
I mean I know they aren't. It's just a joke. 

That being said, we definitely didn't have this level of atmosphere in Qatar.
Excuse me but I’m not from the UK I don’t understand the reference here.
You are totally correct and having 11 nations hosting didn't help
2016 was alright, but I mainly remember it for how incredibly shit Portugal played the whole way through while still winning anyway.  
  
It's definitely the last "not shit" tournament, but it didn't really manage to keep up with the ~12 year run of tournaments before it.
I've been to that giant old metalworking place, and my mind simply couldn't comprehend the scale of the place. I was in awe of the gigantic coal bunker the size of a dry dock, then absolutely knocked off my feet when I noticed that it was one of dozens
Lucky chops last vid was a few months ago
No. The atmosphere in Germany is obviously amazing. Europeans fans are uniquely passionate and I have no doubts about how electric it must be in Germany right now. I am sure the atmosphere is better than it was in Qatar and it's better than it will be in 2026 in North America.


I just find it weird how people keep bringing up the Qatar world cup in every such thread like the atmosphere there was horrible or something. It really wasn't and fans of every country had a lot of energy and were having a lot of fun. Why is there a need to turn the valid criticism of the Qatari government for moral reasons into an attack against all Middle Eastern/Qatari fans with this implication that  only European countries can have football tournaments because only they have true fans that enjoy tournaments? Why can't we detach the fans from the governments? Do you just not see people from that region as human beings? Are they all just nameless evil beings because you dislike their governments? The middle east has plenty of people that are crazy about football and they had an amazing time in Qatar
No biggie. Just funny.
It’s cool you seem way more chill than most people here! I live in Qatar and while what’s happening with the migrants is unacceptable, I know a lot of people, especially on the non European side, enjoyed the last World Cup a lot!
In terms of football spain winning in 2010 is still the most boring team I have seen win a tournament. Not even the fun this underdog is doing it vibes of Greece. Just keep possession win 1-0, do it 6 times in a row and win.
Ah, I see you're getting the gist of it :)

Have fun there mate, just follow the "route Industriekultur"! 

Was nice, man. Time to open the curtains again ;)
For us Europeans, there was no way that most of us could afford to travel and stay in Qatar. In Germany, it’s fairly central and accessible, so thousands of everyone’s fans are joining in. I’m there right now and I’ve never seen anything like it. 

Qatar was a tournament for people with money to attend.
From a soccer perspective, it was fucking awesome. I would have loved to be there if I’m being honest ESPECIALLY with Morocco in the Semi’s 🇲🇦
What Spain was doing, was still pretty new in 2010, I liked it.
The way they managed to control the game was really impressive to watch.  
  
Of course it's not interesting to watch nowadays, because they hadn't figured out how to consistently score yet and we have been seeing Guardiola-Ball for the last 10+ years.
Europeans are not the only people in the world?? Asians fans are unable attend most tournaments and were able to attend the Qatar one because it was "central and accessible to them". Me and a lot of my friends from South Asia  never thought we'd be able to attend a World Cup match and their feelings about the Qatar World Cup were the same as your feelings about a tournament in Germany.


Qatar may have only been for Europeans with money but certainly but it's a WORLD cup and it was cheaper for other parts of the world than tournaments in Europe are
WC is always gonna be like that. Its across the ocean this time with worse time zone for most europeans. It will be a tourney for people with money to attend too except worse for those watching from EU.
I get why Kendrick has not dropped
Maybe I'm giving him too much credit and it's just a coincidence, but I have a theory. Looking back to Family Matters, it was a banger, catchy and great song overall. Crushing the van was even the cherry on top. That's why the response was dropped less than an hour later. It completely overshadowed Drake's move. 

The heart part 6 though, many things have been said about it, but as the day has gone by, people are clowning more and more on him. He says many things, but only a few hit home. "Nah Drake" trending really shows how people are feeling about this. I feel like Kendrick is letting this stew, at least is what I would do. Seems like the more time passes the more damage that gets done to his image

Edit: on second thought. This is probably over
Oh of course. I've been telling ppl since Heart Part 6 dropped, if I'm Kendrick i let that track marinate for 36 hours to a few days because it's a bad track. Then drop the track where he cuts Drakes head off.
Yeah this is a "don't interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake." The longer people have to dissect that track, the worse it looks on Drake.
I would love for Kendrick to drop a Last Real N*gga Alive style song to conclude this battle
If Drake has any sense he uses this time to back to back, and hopefully the second track hits.
What if K Dot’s next drop is the *actual* Heart Part 6? Lmfao
I think his next drop will probably be the last song in the beef and he knows that, assuming it's done right. He's gonna drop a big song with proof of claims or proof of drake lying about his. Meet the grahams was obviously premade but he can't reply again with a pre recorded track, this one can easily end it if it's done right.
According to DJ Hed, not sure how reliable is, he’s hearing from K Dots camp that they aren’t gonna drop if this is the last Drake song. They believe Kendrick won and they don’t need to drop. I personally wanna hear K Dots drop because I’m tired of hearing this Drake planted a fake mole narrative as if all the Drake fan boys weren’t saying it repeatedly for 2 whole days
K Dot predicted it on Euphoria. Said he could predict Drake’s angles then “fabricating stories on the family front because you heard Mr. Morale” and that’s exactly what Drake did
When you can manipulate your opponent into dropping a track where he just says, "I'm definitely not a pedophile" over and over, you've clearly already won.
This is the end of Training Day when Denzel gets left behind. Talking big like it does anything but he’s clearly lost.
When I first listened I was like “oh shit, did Drake play Kendrick??” But as the song went on and I thought about it, a lot of stuff doesn’t make sense. Family Matters felt planned, this felt rushed. If what Drake is saying is true, he would’ve been better prepared for this situation. Also, the fact that we all heard the theory from Twitter before we heard it from Drake is suspect. The whole thing feels like scrambling, it doesn’t seem like this was Drake’s plan all along. 

The response to the pedo allegations is weird, as people have pointed out. 

It’s pretty clear Drake didn’t understand Mother I Sober 

Even if Drake did feed info about the daughter, it kind of just proves Kendrick’s point about him being a liar and a manipulator, and it’s kind of besides the point. 

The DA allegations are unsubstantiated but if they’re proven that’s a major indictment on Kendrick 

If the DA allegations are not true, but Kendrick and Whitney have actually split up, it wouldn’t be the craziest thing. People get divorced all the time. It’s not a super uncommon thing, and it’s not really an indictment on someone’s character.
I think this beef is over tbh. Kendrick won regardless of whether or not he got baited.

He out rapped Drake and it wasn’t even close.
Never interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake
He might drop on fathers day
Kendrick seems prettu calculating andknows what he is doing. I definitly dont think he wont respond.
Yep. He’s letting this guy sit with his own thoughts and giving the world time to dissect The Heart Part 6. Before long, he’s gonna drop something next level crazy
Agreed, the Heart part 6 is so bad and now everyone gets to dissect it and point out all the terrible lyrics.  It's not even a diss track, it's a damage control denial track.
Drake basically offed his self when the one song he released primarily directed at Kendrick was 😒 well you be the judge.. “Family Matters” was directed at everyone involved with the Future X Metro albums.. Drake sounds defeated because he thought being popular translates in battle rap.. poorly calculated.. Kendrick is a MC.. Drake’s popular.. it’s like comparing Nelly to Jay Z.
This whole “you’re going probably to drop 10 more records and I won’t answer” narrative is such a bad look for Drake. Also making fun of SA victims? Damn bro are you tone deaf? The man made you look like a bad guy and all you said in response was the same shit as the last track and “I’m too famous to be a pedo”? WHAT?! Defensive Drake ain’t it. Even if Kenny’s allegations are all false, the damage is done. 

The man literally waited day after day and wanted Kendrick to drop. Now that he did and doesn’t seem to stop Drake all of a sudden feels like he don’t need to respond? Nah bro. You got yourself into this, rap yourself out!

Also, what a bozo for not even listening to “Mother I” and making fun of it. And calling your track “Heart Part 6” yet doing NOTHING with it? GG but as it stands Kendrick won.
While I agree Kendrick doesn’t need to respond to the heart part 6. He is def being silenced by UMG. 
it’s crazy to think that Kendrick might’ve won by letting Drake speak for himself
Drake already walked off with his tail between his legs on the Heart pt 6, I don’t think it even warrants a response. Kendrick won.
Kendrick got a life. I don't think this dude with kids and wife wants to keep going back and forth with a dude over an ego beef.
Don't interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake
>The heart part 6 though, many things have been said about it, but as the day has gone by, people are clowning more and more on him

yeah, thats it. I do believe they would release something, but saw how Drake was basically crying in his room after an ass whoop and didnt. 10min later the internet was already clowning Drake and the "diss" to oblivion
He’ll probably leave it alone. Everyone is already saying he won. Drake essentially tapped.
Yeah nah it’s over Kendrick won fs he’s probably done for now at least kinda kicked the shit outta him while Drake was on the floor. And drakes recent diss track was ass compared to what kendrick dropped before which ruined the fun of it when drake couldn’t keep up. I also assume kenny knows that he won and everyone else does there’s no need to continue beating a dead horse(Drake). Letting drakes last few bad diss track sit is the best decision fs
When you can manipulate your opponent into dropping a track where he just says "I'm definition not a pedophile" over and over, you've already won.
Kendrick just gathering a history breaking feature list to freestyle over BBL Drizzy and bring us back to the XXL Cypher days.
“I don’t wanna diss you anymore” mans was about to cry
IF KENDRICK did a video with , big names like ASAP , Rihanna , and maybe a couple of BIG influencers, and had a line like,, wyo drake, stay the fuck away from our kids 



Drake career over
Drake also already threw the white flag. It would be a disservice to himself if he responded to the trash thp6 was. It’s simply no longer worth the effort. Kendrick is what the culture is feeling, and rn we are feeling hella K Dot.
Never interrupt your enemy as he's making a mistake.  Drake made a massive one- let it stew.
Heart p.6 dropped and everyone kept talking about Not Like Us anyway.
Kendrick isn't dropping because he sees he doesn't have to. People are gonna completely overlook what was alleged about him because they don't care about evidence or facts. It's just hate and the narrative.

If you see that situation playing out, then why even step in? What were seeing is that a lot of people see that crown on his head as real.

I don't FW that cult like shit so I'm off.
Even though I'm more of a Drake fan I really think Kendrick should let the beef breathe a little and then let Not Like Us take off. Not Like Us has song of the summer potential IF they don't wop wop wop fuck it up.
You already know the next track is going to be “Stranger Things” or something lol
Anyone defending Drake gets downvoted even if their points are reasonable wtf?
The song was so bad Drake essentially roasted himself…
It’s simple, when your enemy is fumbling; do not interrupt.
[removed]
Kendrick doesn’t have to respond anymore. Nothing new came out. He reiterated the same thing and added that he’s not a chomo.
He did drop. It’s called Drake The Heart Part 6. Drizzy reading Kendrick’s rap like he’s at gunpoint. 

 None of the og ovo crew reposted it. Only the ovo sex offenders aka security.  

 Far ass theory BUT another big drop was the corporation documents on his company called: Silency Policy. 

The corporation got terminated so who ever signed ndas with that company, be able to talk to media
If I’m Kendrick idk if I’d respond because of what you said. That said if he does respond he needs to do a back to back imo.

The only reason is because the 1st one to tell Drake how garbage that last diss was by basically saying what social media and reactors been saying about why it’s trash. Then the 2nd one just to reiterate he got more material and can take it further if he really wanted. Not that he needs to and he already said it, but to show he wasn’t bluffing when he said he got 5 more songs on the roster. And I’d probably call him to drop “the red button” diss the fans been waiting for, which we’re pretty sure was family matters anyways (but just in case).

Again I don’t think he should respond but that’d be my move if I were Kendrick and was super petty. Oh and I’d get Rihanna and actual snoop on vocals over “lift yourself/poopity scoop”
It all seems orchestrated tbh, I wouldn’t doubt if this is just the industry pulling some fuck shit getting us all fired up.  I mean come on, theres no way it just so happened that the beef got reignited at perfect timing so that Drake could make the heart pt 6.  I don’t think that’s just a coincidence.
music video drop.. that family matter's video was lame AF
And the fact its got more dislikes than likes which is crazy 

And Kendrick still out streaming him 

Imagine Kendrick doing so well he had to say ‘I could give a fuck about your streaming data’ 

**DRAKE** the streaming king of hiphop - crazy
He’s winning (won really), so he could just wait to see if drake tried something to release anything he has left.
"Never interrupt your enemies while they're making a mistake"
He got a chance to bring it home I feel, I personally can’t just say yeah dot win yet though
Only way he could drop is if he brings the proof. Other than that it looks bad and he doesn't need too.
I feel like Kendrick has said everything there is to say, but I also love the drama so I want the final blow!!

![gif](giphy|qIdkQKwktcel0OfOkn)
He should just drop a whole album on Friday and gift it to drake's mother.
We might still get something out of Future x Metro with the whole BBL Drizzy campaign going on too. Not sure if anything will come of that but we’ll see
He doesn’t have to drop another track, but Not Like Us visuals could strengthen his position without him having to make a move. 

Also we need official Not Like Us merch. I’d buy the F* out that t-shirt.
If im not mistaken dj hed said that the war is over and that kendrick will only drop again if drake keeps going, the heart part 6 was drake waving the flag and that he lost.
I’m on the fence. 

I don’t think Kendrick drops personally. There is a consensus (whether right or wrong) Kendrick has ‘won’ in whatever context we want that to mean. Especially in the more hardcore hip-hop/rap fan world. Although, there would be a hard time Drake winning those people either way.

Realistically though, the picture he painted of Drake leaves a dent on his name regardless of truth and Drakes latest was certainly a lot less received than previous drops.

So realistically Kendrick could bow out now as a ‘winner’.

That said, despite everyone’s feeling on Drakes last, he did tell him to come with facts if he’s coming at all. So there is part of it you could look at and say ‘well shit, Kendrick didn’t come with them’. So he may want to stop again, assuming he has those facts.

I’ve tried to be specific with my wording to keep this an unbiased comment. Because there’s too much of that going around. Myself included at times.
He'll drop on Juneteenth or the day after which is his birthday I think.
They should both stop, this battle is embarrassing
Drakes only chance of coming back is he drops evidence or a banger track before Kendrick does… if anyone drops
Honestly I feel like kendrick was waiting for drake to take himself out
Kendrick doesn't even need to release another
Maybe he thinks it's too weak, to even dignify the attempt with response.
They both making money. They are geniuses. And I haven’t listen to any of the songs yet.
don't interrupt your foe when he is making a mistake
Kendrick bought tons of bots.
Seems like Kendrick isn’t dropping again. I feel like he should say something in response though because it makes it seem like he really did get tricked if he doesn’t respond.
It’s the worst track of the entire beef. Gotta let that track breath so people can smell how terrible it is. Drake couldn’t keep his story straight for 3 whole bars and just sounded tired
DJ Hed basically said they (TDE camp) consider this a victory because Drake has risen the white flag. It’s over.  By not responding, he doesn’t give Drake a chance to recover from the disappointment of Heart 6. The picking apart of Heart 6 will continue, the terrible take of trying to “diss” someone for being molested (which isn’t even true) while rambling about wanting to see facts.  The perfect move for K. Dot rn is not to make any move at all.
what is “crushing the van”
you lot are so dilusional its not even funny
I’d like to see a compilation of diss tracks from Kendrick and the album titled “Nah Drake”. Amazing tracks so far!
He shouldn't drop again. The battle is over, Drake has basically conceded. 

Always give your enemy a way out, and if they choose to take it, let them.
Why do y'all wish bad on Drake would seem like y'all want them to fall off what kind of people are you I mean what kind of person wants to see another person fail and hopes for that that's f***** up bro just do better
He doesn’t need to respond imo. Its over. He’s already shown superiority as an artist with these tracks and how he played this entire thing.
Drake doesnt need to drop again, kendricks career is already in tatters and only the biggest stans will say he won
This shit already over like the last battle Eminem vs Papa Doc. Lol
Or or…it might be because he’s already released FOUR whole records (five if we include his feature verse on Like That) all about this that have a combined running time of 25 minutes and there’s literally not a single thing left to say on the subject and there’s no further material. 

He’s dropped an album longer than Pusha T’s DAYTONA specifically just about Drake.
Drake sounded like he was done. “It was nice workin the pen” or whatever. Kendrick should drop a hype song saying “you’re trying to let this die down, nah nahh nahhh not this time. You following through”
![gif](giphy|l4FGGafcOHmrlQxG0|downsized)
Drakes a bitch. He should’ve been run out of hip hop a decade ago.
![gif](giphy|26n6Gx9moCgs1pUuk|downsized)
I have a theory that he predicted all of it. Euphoria intro is freakishly clairvoyant, right?
He’s not responding because The Heart part 6 start with “Let me see you prove it” and he even gets told by Drake to “give him the facts.” Kendrick can’t do any of that. 
Yeah…the heart part six was a hugeeeeee fail. How can something with such a 🔥 title land so squarely on its face as a just like… an equal parts pathetic and just plainly weird rebuttal to Not Like Us? 😂 not to mention metro’s bbl drizzie…yeah, it’s over at this point. No song Kendrick could put out would end Drake better than what he did to himself. #didntevenbeedmyhelp
“I have a theory”
I just assumed Kendrick was playing Hades II
“Now live in your purpose”
It would be hilarious if he made a response on the BBL Drizzy beat
I don't think Kendrick needs to drop, he won already! The people have decided
[removed]
Exactly. Kendrick should wait until Friday to drop, drop a banger for the clubs. That’ll chafe Audrey’s ass. Just let that shit stew and give people time to parse the bars. Jab for jab, Drake’s just kind of suck. He really thought calling Kendrick a molestee was a rebuttal to the pedo allegations. How fucking stupid is Drake? Kendrick’s I hate you like I’m young hits even harder. I predict WW3 will resume this weekend. I know what Kendrick doing but I’m wondering what Drake is doing right now. It seems like he hung up his boxing gloves to go on vacation. He has to know this isn’t over and he’s going to need to prepare a response.
Personally I'm just hoping for a Black Hippy song to drop and put the final nail in Drakes coffin
I read someone in his inner circle stated he ain't dropping again bc THP6 was so bad he doesn't need to respond. I hope it ain't true but it makes sense.
JCole getting his seaweed wrap and hot stone massage.
That’s a really good point, I hate it more and more every time I think if it.
If I’m Kendrick I’m done dropping, this shits a wrap. Drake had a shooting at his house last night too, no need to add insult to injury
Man you guys looooove to suck this man dry. Maybe he hasn’t responded because he’s not sure how to address the Whitney allegations?? Jesus, get off this man’s nuts. He’s proven to not be calculated as Drake does not have a daughter
People don’t listen to neither. Just on Kendrick’s side because they hate Drake
We usually only get like 2 tracks in rap battles. This one was an all out war and we got several tracks. I think he won and there is no need to respond.
Idk, I don’t think Kendrick really needs to outdo Drake’s self-diss considering how bad a response the heart pt. 6 is with how he calls himself a clown, very clearly tries to gaslight, completely misunderstands Mother i sober and MMBS as a whole, and tries to spin a victory from making fun of SA survivors. Honestly I bet Kendrick is both happy that Drake responded so bad it makes him look not only guilty, but stupid as the same time Kendrick might be a bit mad that he doesn’t have an excuse to drop more disses.
He needs to release a song that isn't vitue signaling and own the fact he's a degenerate as drakes done. He so disingenuous
Kenny’s cronies attacking drakes château
Why compete with yourself? 
I am someone that doesn’t follow rap much.  But Kendrick looses the very first time he opens his mouth. 
He gets mad that J-Cole gives him a compliment.
K.Dot should take his own advice and be Humble b*tch.
Instead he basically calls himself the biggest in rap. He probably has little man syndrome and has some self esteem issues.
Music has a metric for deciding who is the biggest and it is not up for debate. The biggest in music is the one that sells the most. This has always been the metric.


Maybe one day he will be the biggest but he isn’t right now. 
You could argue he is the best at his craft at rapping. Maybe one day he will be the best at crafting a song. 
Currently his beats are boring. Way too much jazz beats that sound like elevator music.
It was written:

“I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves.”
Yea most people following this thinks Kendrick won so I say take it ez unless drake brings it up again.
The people "supporting" kendrick just say he won off of hating Drake and being jealous that he's been the best in the industry for the past 15 years it's just like Tom Brady in the NFL. He's the best so whenever someone comes at him, everyone prays they lose 😂 did you see every superbowl Tom Brady was in? everyone except New England was rooting for him to lose. This is exactly what we're seeing except there's unfortunately no actual game to be won its just fan bases going back and forth.

This never was even a competition and Drake didn't even have to respond to win lmao.
Kendrick had to piggy back his career off of Drake in 2012 and then has the nerve to come around and attack him just for the sake of he's completely irrelevant and needs some way to get back into music cause nobody gives a fuck about him 😂. All 20 dudes that came after Drake need some way to get publicity and become somewhat relevant for a few months cause their music isn't doing it. Drake does a feature on their songs and it's only popular cause Drake is on it
Actually mostly all battle rappers and rappers in general are saying Drake won/wins lmao. Drakes songs are just flat out better, better flow, better everything. All kendrick does is reach for random accusations and just says "I hate you, you suck, you're a pedo!" Meanwhile Drakes musical artistry is just way better
Drake is dropping on mother’s day (whitneys bday)
I feel like Kendrick won’t drop again. “Not Like Us”will go down in history as one of the best rap songs of all time.  For many reasons - the context, the delivery, the word play, the quick and surgical destruction of drake and his image in every line, mustards hard ass beat, etc. anything that releases now will take away from all the things already said. people are right in the thread that The Heart Part 6 is bad, and it’s my opinion that because of that, it doesn’t warrant a response.
This is how Drake did it vs meek mill after he responded
I think if Family Matters was allowed to sit at all the general discourse would be completely different. It’s the best one of all of them and the least heard
I think it'd be fire if he announced the drop after letting it marinate
If Kendrick drops it will be a long time from now this beef is over for the most part. If you are confused about what won just pull a picture of the dislikes on the heart of part 6 video even casual fans know who won. To me, it's like beating a dead horse and Kendrick is about to tour and it's a strong belief that he’s going to roll out an album soon.
I hope I’m wrong cause I want more music but I bet Kendrick walks away from all this. Drake looks like an absolute fool now and didn’t even earn a response with Heart Part 6. I know Kendrick has more music but he’s also very good at leaving people wanting more
Yeah Drake is done whether or not Kendrick drops again
Family Matters IMO is the best track out of the beef. I’m a Drake fan, so there is a lot of objectivity going on. With that said, the heart part 6 was meh to me. The lyrics were great, but it wasn’t a banger. Kendrick’s tracks were good, but none of them are really bangers IMO. Again, subjective. Overall this beef has been amazing.
In the court of public opinion at least Kendrick won the beef handily. He doesn’t need to respond and Drake’s last response is getting roasted and it did seem like Drake was admitting he wanted it to be over. 

Do I want Kendrick to drop another song? Yeah I would take one more finishing blow. But he doesn’t have to.
I think Drake played himself with that heart part 6 so why even respond, then Drakes house getting shot up would make anything else a bad look as it’ll feed into the narrative K was behind that and even though these dudes dislike each other it ain’t the same as FBG vs OTF. This isn’t about gangbanging it’s more on the level of No Vaseline. Cube, Dre and Easy were actually kicking it during the No Vaseline / Word 2 BA  times , they just had a disagreement that they chose to settle on the mic.
What if the next drop is Kendrick and Drake on the same song preaching positivity lmao, how corny would that be
I assumed no one had dropped again due to the bodyguard getting shot, and no parties wanted to appear to be the cause or profiting off of the event.
Nah it's over. Not Like Us is becoming a classic in a hurry, and I think that'll be enough.
re: your edit: this sub is a kdot stan echo chamber it's so plain on the main page lmao.

Go see what all the hip hop reaction content creators on youtube had to say about THP6
Saying “nah drake” trending shows how people feel about it… bro feel how YOU feel about it. Thats why we have this issue of fudged numbers and controlled narratives because people are scared to belive their own opinion out of fear of being told you’re riding. So they get on Twitter and see everyone else’s reaction to gauge their own.
I hope it's over

Kendrick won. If Kendrick keeps pushing this, there's going to be blood in the streets.

Seriously.

It may already be too late.
It exposes Kendrick too much to attack. A wounded animal is more dangerous than anything. It just needs to keep Drake contained at this point and when the dust settles let Cole take his moment because all of this wasn’t about power or fame it was about knocking your opponent down no matter what.
He did and said what he sent out to do. If he wants to keep going I’m sure he can and will but I also think he’s smart enough to see what has transpired and is humble enough to sit silently
When he drops hopefully he says something new abt drake
Wasn't drake the one begging for Kendrick to drope? And now that he did he is begging for him to stop
Such a bad track. Bbl drizzy slurpers saying because he fed him a story and Kendrick took it he lost…. Yeah maybe if Kendrick’s whole angle on every song was about the daughter. He had ONE verse about it. To me that’s no worse than drake completely misunderstanding Kendrick saying his mom was molested. Like that’s even worse. It’s been over for Aubrey but that track just made him look actually lack reading comprehension
The dickeating during this rap battle has been insane. People wanted Drake to respond to the allegations, he not only does that but essentially negates Meet the Grahams by revealing that he faked Kendrick out. Kendrick called him a master manipulator and Drake manipulated him THROUGHLY. And yet, the overall internet acted like it didn’t happen. Drake should by all means be winning, but it’s become cool to hate Drake. A lot of people have wanted him to lose for a long time, and so now even ridiculously obtuse statements like “he mentioned Millie Bobby Brown, he’s telling on himself” are getting hundreds of thousands of likes on Twitter. So with Drake shutting down everything Kendrick said, there’s not really much else Kendrick can say without sounding repetitive—and yet Drake has dropped last and shown a tiredness of Kendrick’s drops. It’s a stalemate but the popular opinion is that Kendrick won.
I've already said this a million times but why is everyone in this sub a bounty hunter all of a sudden? This is rap dude not a manhunt. Kendrick dissed off of rumors which is to be expected because rap isn't a fuckin forensic crime show. Enjoy the songs and the drama, and pay attention to what happens in between each drop. I sit in both subs cause I've been listening to these dudes for fuckin years but some of you need to touch some fuckin grass. It's spring, it's fresh out there dude. 

And besides, right now everyone involved in any rumor about grooming has already come forward and cleared drake. It's bad enough these people felt the need to do this in the middle of this and put themselves out there to become subject to harassment cause some of you are fuckin out there. Foamin at the mouth headass 

And besides, we all know who is on top right now. Why are you all acting like kendrick hasn't done stuff himself. Cole out there living his best life and your lord and savior Jesus Dot isn't looking too hot either. I'm waiting for The Fall Off, y'all are too rabid in here
Anyone that knows Drake knows he likes his women BBW.  That doesn’t classify any kid in my book.  His baby momma was thick as hell
All of the girls Drake apparently groomed and molested coming to Drake’s defence has Kendrick in shambles. Kendrick being proven as a bigger capper than Drake is not something I thought I’d see. He’s been baited, trolled, and played like a puppet this entire battle. The main thing he did was make hating Drake cool. Objectively, Drake cooked him in every way possible. The feud is one sided domination from Drake. But I know I’ll get downvoted into oblivion. It is what it is. Y’all wanna lie to yourself instead of just enjoy the battle.
The beef over , drake lost , no reason for my from Kendrick, if drake turns around and drops anything else it’s gonna be like watching a dog die , just sad and pitiful
Could see him dropping a victory lap type track
Not Like Us is topping charts, getting played in clubs, etc.

Family Matters is hangin’ out with Jo Marie Payton… bested by the little nerdy guy. 🧐
The general consensus is that Kendrick won after Meet the Grahams. Heart 6, tho I thought it was good w it's problems ofc, just does not match MTG or NLU in any capacity. I do realize ppl can't have it both ways. Kendrick has been seen as picking at a carcass so to speak after NLU and the reception for Heart 6 overall is not that of approval. I don't fault Kenny for brushing this off as Drake is getting clowned rn.
I think he might be cooking up the final blow…
I think it's over. We are exhausted and Drake basically waved a white flag.
I still think he might drop a 10 track diss tape on Friday, let people do they bbl drizzy verses in the meantime lmao
He’s not going to drop on the day of the met gala.

*Not counting or looking up any Billboard Music data. Too much for the 3 of them

**The Weeknd is included because Drake called his name in the beef

Looks like on the biggest stages Drake was trying to punch up in weight class. If I put Teen Choice Awards info on this, it just wouldn't be fair with what Kendrick and Aubrey have already put out there.

***Drake won 3 > Kendrick - 2. Couldn't help it.***
Why should Kendrick respond? It’s funny because every single diss track Kendrick released was straight trash and most of the Drake releases were pretty decent. But Pt 6 is SO AWFUL and so sad sounding and so defeated sounding that if Kendrick actually tries to rap as a response, he’ll only do a disservice. He’s better off letting Drake hang himself, because Kendrick cannot musically do the damage that Drake can do to himself. 

Pt 6 is really just that bad.
Y'all know this shit is staged right? They both on the same label 😂😂😂😂. Just to take attention away from Diddy's case
This whole situation has made me lose respect for both artists. Surprised to see Kendrick stoop down to that level
The heart part 6 wasn’t even bad y’all wildin
Y'all are delusional. Drake rebuttaled everything Kendrick said and even had his supposed victims backing him.

Kendrick ain't won shit. All he did was call Drake white and repeat the same shit Pusha T did
Might wait til Thursday too. Not Like Us and Euphoria might both top the charts. Why take away listens from that
Don’t interrupt your enemy when he’s making a mistake
Yeah it’s also worth taking the time to make sure you both defend yourself and obliterate Drake for all the ways he left himself open in that last drop. There is so much actual easily proven cap Drake said that Kendrick can make him look like an amateur and solidly the predator idea (expanding on the MBB door that was opened as well as others). He can harp on the fact that Drake doesn’t realize the mere act of talking to young girls as a grown man is a problem (Drake took the predator route of “I didn’t do anything illegal” but he literally can’t say he’s not a creep and Kendrick can easily disprove his “I don’t look at teenage girls twice” comment). 

It sounded kind of like Drake is tapping out with that last drop so if I was Kendrick I would go for the body bag. Defend yourself, discount and mock all the corny shit Drake said, and do it all using facts to put his creepy ass down. 

Kendrick does need to acknowledge what Drake said about the domestic violence accusations and stuff though or he might also take a big hit. 

No matter what Drake lost this shit as Kendrick’s songs are infinitely better and more scathing (although Family Matters is a solid record) but Drake might pull him down a peg as he drowns.
How does he top Meet the Grahams? Shit was ruthless
36 hours to a few days. What an interesting timeframe!
Hear me out on this: 

Now listen to it again and imagine Drake had to read that rap Kendrick wrote, so he’d slow down & stop. 

Like how he treated all those woman making them do his sick fetishes. 
Just saw the djhead interview with Elliot Wilson he alluded to phone calls being made and it being over so probably label execs and ceos of companies saying ight this is enough can’t start messing up the paper
There is no head to cut off, Drake did that just fine on his own. 


Dude said you won't find Drake on no sex offender list and thought it was fire. 💀💀💀💀
nah it's over imo
He's already cut off Drake's head what do you mean?
If I was Kendrick, I'd come back with a really hard track, more than Not Like Us, that basically says ""Nah bitch, you don't get to decide when this is over. You just reached Level 2, run and hide motherfucker" or something along those lines.
Exactly
He already called him a pedo with no evidence, wtf could he possibly say to top that
Yup!
Drakes head is already rotting in the gutter.
He cut Drake's head off with Meet the Grahams, Not Like Us was just him dancing on the corpse.
Lol not like us was the headshot, why mutilate the body any more 
kanye should do the honours for the decapitating lol
The people "supporting" kendrick just say he won off of hating Drake and being jealous that he's been the best in the industry for the past 15 years it's just like Tom Brady in the NFL. He's the best so whenever someone comes at him, everyone prays they lose 😂 did you see every superbowl Tom Brady was in? everyone except New England was rooting for him to lose. This is exactly what we're seeing except there's unfortunately no actual game to be won its just fan bases going back and forth.

This never was even a competition and Drake didn't even have to respond to win lmao.
Kendrick had to piggy back his career off of Drake in 2012 and then has the nerve to come around and attack him just for the sake of he's completely irrelevant and needs some way to get back into music cause nobody gives a fuck about him 😂. All 20 dudes that came after Drake need some way to get publicity and become somewhat relevant for a few months cause their music isn't doing it. Drake does a feature on their songs and it's only popular cause Drake is on it
He’s filming in June so anything in May is all we will get from Kendrick. Now the other guys, like The Weeknd, metro, future, Ross……think they’re gonna keep going. 
I think the longer it takes for either side to present receipts, the more people will think this battle was all two grown man gossiping.
Actually mostly all battle rappers and rappers in general are saying Drake won/wins lmao. Drakes songs are just flat out better, better flow, better everything. All kendrick does is reach for random accusations and just says "I hate you, you suck, you're a pedo!" Meanwhile Drakes musical artistry is just way better
Roll Call pt. 2 with Ice Cube & Lil Jon
A.D.H.D. pt.2 (P.E.D.O.)
🖤🖤🖤  Last Real N*gga Alive and “Kendrick Lamar” opened my ears to what hip hop is
[removed]
The Heart Part 6ixxx - and he makes an XXXTentacion reference
Back to back only works from a place of strength or parity
That definitely doesn’t work when in the most recent track he says he’s done (by framing the narrative as “you can drop a bunch of songs fast but I’m never gonna respond again so it would be pointless”)

Kendrick should drop one more and call it a day. Victory lap/put a nice bow on it
Nah drake threw in the towel with his speech at the end
especially given what drake said at the end of The Heart Pt 6, if he dropped another one it would completely bury him
Drakes tried back to back already and it stunk, then Kenny did it to him twice so it’s a little played out tbh
The only way that works is if he has something new to say. If he releases another track with the same disses while he’s losing, it’s just going to look desperate
That’s what I was thinking. If he straight up released the heart part 6 lmao
That's gotta be it. One where he gets the last word, refutes the bullshit, and leads directly into the next album without responding to Drake ever again.
This would be a genius move, and complete checkmate. In my own eyes the second Drake loss was when he named that diss the Heart Part 6, yet couldn’t live up to the precedent KDOT has set with the Heart Part 1-5.
I'm not so convinced it was I question if kendrick really did have a mole in the ovo crew and knew about family matters. Title of kendricks response meet the grahams. Talks about his family. Even references the ozempic rick ross line. I think kendrick maybe knew about family matters before it was released
There’s no way Kendrick Lamar lets Drake get the last word. C’mon bro
Dj Hed is a reliable source. He’s been there since the beginning of TDE and him and chuck dizzle were the first people who interviewed Kendrick on Home Grown Radio which was their YouTube podcast and this was before he got well known. 

But honestly I wouldn’t mind if Kendrick didn’t drop because “The Heart Part 6” was weak. Super defensive and nothing much was said. All Drake did was shoot himself in the foot and his whole “if I was fucking young girls, I promise I’d have been arrested” , that’s the most guiltiest shit to ever say.
I heard him say the opposite
The internet found a 2015 article from Hollywood Life sharing that Drake possibly has a 2 year old daughter, with a waitress from Miami, and that he had agreed to start paying her support before paternity results were even back. Boy is either crazy psychic to start planting evidence almost a decade in advance or he is scrambling to save face imo.
I don't even need to hear a new song, I just want to see the next cover art lol

Decent summary
Kendrick already spent a whole album try to cope with all of that. Divorce / co-parenting through infidelity is just normal adult shit. Not that Drake or his fandom would understand that…
The last part he wasent calling Kendrick out for them being split up, I think it's a response to him essentially calling drake a deadbeat dad but also not being with his children
Yup! I feel the same way. However, I think KDOT needs to drop the proof as the final nail on the coffin.

Bruh it's clear as day the battle was over once the pedo stuff was said. There was no way drake could go on the offensive again without addressing that shit. The music kind of fell second to that

Which to me is a great reason for him to absolutely smoke Drake and the industry. He said fuck the industry in basically each song so if he really feels that way and doesn’t have much to lose I want to see him break the facade as much as possible.

He doesn’t have a wife tho
Finance since 2015
Ehh kinda feel like Kendrick’s hiding out while all this is going down…when was the last time anyone actually seen him?
[removed]
Naw I’m not goin lie, Not Like Us dropped way too quick. He waited for Meet the Grahams to finish uploading and hopped directly in the booth. Dude was having a sleepover in the stu
bruh his family is probably with dave free rn, that's why he's got all this extra time for tracks

Recent two disses as in family matters ? Nah, it's literally one of the best songs in the entire beef. Dwarfed in impact by MTG, but definitely a solid response. But yea heart 6 was dog shit, Not Like US shits on it and could be a huge summer hit.
Family Matters is the best track out of this entire beef followed by Push Ups...

Kendrick is literally popular because he's the underdog and is irrelevant, its like tom brady in the NFL. Everyone wants the underdog to beat Tom Brady. Drake is on everyone's minds and played every place that they walk. Kendrick is always forgotten cause his music is mid at best. Pretty embarrassing he had to start mentioning Drake to gain any kind of popularity

i like seeing shitty/evil mfs get what they deserve esp when they are public figures. 

only thing i hate more than liars are SA/pedos/rapists and drake happens to be a combination of two or more.
There’s literally proof of Drake being creepy about underage girls. Wym.

Lol bro, you good?
So how did Drake lose this popularity contest being the hip how's biggest hit maker?
Most of the world knows that track was hot ass. 


It's just you and your little corner of the internet coping with P Drizzy's ashes. 
I thought the track was weak when I first heard it. I initially thought it was just because I was just getting tired of the beef, but listened to it earlier today again, and nah. It's just not good. I've probably listened to push ups 15 times by now, but this isn't it

The tending is important though. Rap beefs are essentially decided by the audience as a collective
May as well change the name of this sub to Kendricks fan page. If Drake hadn't dropped denying the allegations then the Internet would be all over him. He can't win.

Trash opinion
I am enjoying this battle… cause Kendrick destroyed
bro what
Tryna strike a chord and it’s prolly a minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
While I definitely want this, Not Like Us is basically already that. People love it
Cope harder
Go on
Nuh-uh.
Wednesday at 11:30 just cuz you said thrusday lol
Because this ain't about topping charts
Euphoria is going to debut at #11 on the billboards hot 100 this week. [Billboard Twitter Account](https://x.com/billboardcharts/status/1787589715878703518?s=46) this is going to be another win in this battle
You think after the things he’s said about Drake and how he’s said them, he’s thinking about the charts?
-Sun Tzu?
MTG is one of the most egregiously disrespectful tracks I’ve ever heard. On every level, it’s just dripping with disrespect. The contents of the lyrics, the structure of the song itself, Kendrick’s tone throughout. The seething disdain Kendrick feels for him just ripples off it. 

It almost transcends hatred, it feels like Kendrick is disgusted by the mere fact of Drake’s existence. 

Sitting his son down and telling him his father is a piece of shit, telling his parents they’re failures for raising him, straight up telling him he should die three times. Jesus Christ. 

It’s pure destruction. And then he caps it with Not Like Us which is a bop. Just brutal.
Hit up Tupac’s estate for the Hit Em Up beat, get The Weeknd to do the hook, and let Ross get a verse in.
He does the Not Like Us [West Coast Remix]
tbh that track wasn’t even that good in hindsight. euphoria and Not Like Us are far better
I feel like it would be Drake being a pedo in the first place thsts fuckin the money up not him getting called out for it but hey, thats just me i guess.
I mean, he's right...they'd use Aubrey Graham.
It hurts kendrick long term if its over rn idk why people think he shouldn’t respond
“I’m lyrical, your rhymes are spherical, like a butt, I’m a miracle” I think we should get in contact with Kendrick ASAP 
“I am rubber you are glue. Whatever you say to me bounces off me and sticks to you!”
>no evidence

Bruh
There is no way The Weeknd wants his skeletons dragged out of the closet like the other guys involved in this beef
What is he filming?
I have seen Drake publicly engage in innapropriate behavior with minors on several occasions in my life he does not need to present receipts.

I would like him to acknowledge the daughter tho
[No recieipts are needed](https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/s/o7lKUJcpfC) , it's a rap beef
When have you ever seen people bring receipts in diss tracks or battle rap. This isn't court.

I understand that people want them but this is rap not Jerry Springer
Those certified pedofile accusations stuck because of Drakes well known behavior. It’s not a stretch to see Drake as one in private if he is fine with being a creep in public.
Let’s be real, this beef IS 2 grown men gossiping.

I do think Drake is winning because I believe his claims (Free is the father, domestic violence) more than Kendrick’s (pedophilia, 11 year old daughter) at this point. And family matters is by far the hardest track of the whole beef
That's certainly an opinion. The general public doesn't share it, though.
Lyrically Cube has no reason to input in this. Other then a west coast connection, he's better then both of them, HELL MOST OF THEM when it comes to lyrics. Do the research. Cube wrote most of the lyrics for NWA. No Vaseline was not an emotional track. It was truth on wax. Shut down NWA after he left. But I would love to see Kendrick use the beat from No Vaseline as a opening to a final diss track. Sample Cube saying " GOT DAMN IM GLAD YOU SET IT OFF" lol
Uh uhh fuck that

I mean he didn’t really have the lead when he dropped back to back. No one was really feeling charged up. Back to back just had shock value
You attack with them. Defending twice would be suicide.
Sheesh ok Kendrick golly
I agree but also feel he leaves it open. He essentially says “come back when you’ve got the facts/proof”. If Kendrick has anything more that he can verify he should absolutely come this week and bury him.
Well Kendrick called him a pedo, that's punching below the belt. Why fight after that
>I think kendrick maybe knew about family matters before it was released

He 100% knew about it, MTG is a direct response to it, and was clearly written/produced days before. Either Kendrick can literally see the future or it was leaked to him.
Absolutely. 

This is the main part for me,

In MtG, Kendrick says "you brought Whitney up first," which first happened in Drake's Family Matters like 20 mins prior.

If Drake was leaking shit on purpose, then Family Matters was also leaked to Kendrick. The lyrics of MtG are way too specific to be coincidental. And if thats the case, then Drake must have purposely shot himself in the foot?
Drake didn't say anything that would help him though. People are not feeling the track outside of his die hard fans. The most memorable part of it is Drake saying he's too famous to be a predator. His so called last word hurt him more than it helped
Drake ain’t said shit though it was just damage control
People didn’t even listen to that Drake song they were too busy still dancing to Not Like Us
If I’m  Kendrick, I’m dropping any proof I have, not even in song format. Just pictures or so and end Drake.
Getting the last word isn’t everything. Drakes shitty track being the bookend to everything is perfect. He will NEVER live it down and now he has no chance to do a better redo.
I mean, Drake dissed himself and made himself look foolish on Heart. Why not let that be his legacy from this battle? Not a highlight finish at all.
Drake’s last word was basically him falling on his own sword. There’s no need to respond, this is the perfect ending.
He is a gemini
I can see something quick like 60 seconds to just end it but knowing him it will be clever and biting
I'd be so mad if Kenny doesn't respond. If he wants to kill this sick motherfucker he can't let up on him now.
Especially if he is lying and Kendrick has receipts. He will bury him.
Idk, Drake's whole track was regurgitating shit about Whitney and then going on defense against a decade of rumours for like 4 straight minutes, during which he makes fun of sexual assault survivors. 

Then he makes a joke about how Kendrick is gonna drop 5 mins after Heart P6 comes out cause he knows his angle, whoch Kendrick didn't, letting this one stew instead.

Then Drake stops the beat and talks like "yeah, I'm done with this shit, you aren't speaking "facts" so I don't wanna fight anymore" hes literally throwing a white flag

Kendrick absolutely does not *need* to drop a track, Drake misstepped big enough that no one will take him as a serious rapper ever again, and this will be a stain on his career he'll never be rid of. That by itself is probably punishment enough for thinking he could take Kdot.

Kendrick is probably just waiting to see if a week from now Drake posts a meme or some shit to revive this.
K Dot is an old school Gemini. We don’t walk away, we are petty af and love shit talkin
It's not the last word though it's "I didn't diddle kids"
Yea I don’t either that’s why I said idk how reliable it is. I feel like KDOT def getting the last word. I think Drake was gonna go on his vacay after family matters. MTG he posted his little insta story about where the daughter at but not enough for him to release again. Then not like us and it blowing up changed that.
Agreed, that track only made him seem even more like a pedophile. The narcissist thinks he can’t be caught.
Good read
Its not enough if nothing changes for Drake’s career especially if he’s guilty of what Kendrick says. Idk why people think he shouldn’t respond when not responding hurts him
He made Like That with all of this in mind.

"Okay, let's get it up, it's time for him to prove that he's a problem"
Okay Dj Akademiks
Hard coping
Dawg Drake is 6 feet under already
Facts, Kendrick needs to get the last word in lol
Proof of what?
We all know you don't really believe that and that you're just trolling.  Either you're trolling or you didn't listen to the lyrics and you lack critical thinking skills.
No mainstream artist is against the industry my guy 🤣🤣
He’s main stream bruh
lolllll
At the dodgers game last night or two nights ago?
Hiding out? He dropped two days ago…
Drake invests in battle rap. They're not going to go against their meal ticket. Also who gives a fuck what they think? Look at the analytics. There's a clear winner.
Considering Drakes history of lying, everything he said is probably not true. 
I meant the heart I didn’t mean to say two. But yeah not like us is a banger not the best diss track but banger song!
…nah see that’s reaching I can admit that family matters is up there but not the best track to come out of this same with push ups Kendrick’s worst diss track was better than push ups at the very least lol not to be that guy but push ups was just catchy the disses in that were very base level nothing too good especially compared to everything else it’s up there in the list but not too far up.
All true , but doesn’t change who DRAKE is as a human being
Nah I think you misunderstand what this is about. The “Career” you talk about is the industry Kendrick despises. Kendrick is a master lyricist. This beef been brewing in a pot and it’s just now heating up… this is Kendrick vs something disgusting. This is a man who values integrity and actual talent. Nothing about Drake is the right kind of talent. Sales? Who cares. Charts? Who the fuck cares? I’ll tell you one thing. Kendrick isn’t in this game to exploit the industry like Drake is. Kendrick is a poet he is here to make art. He is a real artist making real music. I bet you never listen to Kendrick songs do you? I bet you hear em but have you ever LISTENED to them and dissected them? Drakes last song just shows the difference in caliber here. Drake ain’t on Kendrick’s level. We are talking about a nationally acclaimed icon. Kendrick’s music is culture. Kendrick’s music heals families. His music is visionary and prophetic in such a profound way it goes over so many people’s heads. Drake wishes he was half the man Kendrick was. Go listen to Mr Morale and digest it… you’ll understand how different Drake is from Kendrick. Like I said earlier, clout means nothing to Kendrick. This is about morals, it’s about Kendrick standing for what he believes in. I’m sorry but I used to bump Drake way more than Kendrick before this beef but after all of this, I understood.
Ok. Eminem vouches Kendrick. Obama vouches Kendrick. Denzel vouches Kendrick. If this is how you think, then you have 0 analytical and critical thinking skills, I’m sorry. You need to understand culture and understand art to understand Kendrick is on a level unlike anyone else. Like I said, I used to love Drake to death, my friends will tell you how much I glazed him but as Kendrick put these things together it kinda exposed him for who he is. When meet the grahams dropped I was disgusted to even be affiliated, then when Drake did THP6 I lost all respect I had for him. This is what X was talking about. As a musical artist Drake is good, he is great, he has hits for a reason, but as a man, he isn’t shit and he cannot be respected. And to go beyond that while he is great in the music sense, he still doesn’t come close to Kendrick in terms of meaning and actual depth/art. Drake understands how to make hits, Kendrick understands how to make art. Music is art, music is supposed to have meanings music is supposed to be emotional, music is exactly what Kendrick makes. It’s supposed to be moving and impactful, it’s meant to convey a real message. Drakes music doesn’t do that. They’re hits yes but I’ve never been moved by a Drake song the way a Kendrick song moves me. I’m not the kind to care for lyrics in songs, I just vibe, but when Kendrick is on I listen, I pay attention because he is saying something meaningful

It’s the musical equivalent to crip walking on your opp’s grave of metaphorical humiliation.
Yeah if you believe this then hip hop isn’t for you.  

Just keep listening to Drake and ignore the world man srsly- that was some bullshit you just said

I’m not even a Kendrick fan really - haven’t heard any of his albums as they bore me 

But that was just stupid.

Drake taking too many Ls lately. And honestly I’m loving it he had a sweet ride since. When euphoria dropped, Drake hopped on the first flight to his kid and posted him on his story…that’s the second time a rapper has forced him to be a father. Just don’t speak on the family, crodie
I’m good. Whats you question?
Then Macklemore releases a track that actually has meaning and purpose and reminds me the both Kendrick and Drake greedy childish egomaniac b*tches!
ironic!
You are your own part of the audience. Beefs were decided by groups of friends and fans who talk about there own opinions. Enjoy the art how you want to but letting twitter bots, likes or downvotes tell you how to feel ain’t it for me.
Yeah, Drake dropped an IG story right after MTG saying something along the lines of “if anybody can find proof I have a daughter I’ll quit rap or something” and. There were posts getting 100K likes saying shit like  “DRAKE ARE TOU GOING TO ADDRESS THE PDF STUFF THOUGH?” He very much had to do that, and he did.

Trash response

u/Oh_Sweet_Juices

Be objective. Take Kendrick’s dick out of your mouth long enough to see the truth. He got played like a damn puppet.
Kendrick got smoked
These are the facts. Dispute it. Don’t just say “bro what”
Definitely agree and it 100% works as such. I guess I just also want another one lol
What is this price is right?
He’s got 3 minutes
Killing Drake on the charts would really kill him. If anything, Kendrick’s next move should be shooting a video for Not Like Us.
Nah that would be the *Best* thing for a *next* move Kendrick could make. Think about it, Fakes whole thing is “numbers, numbers, top the charts, I’m in every club, everybody loves me” if Not like us is bangin’ in “every” night club, and people are keepin’ it on repeat. That alone would keep Fake up through the nights, knowing he now has to somehow make a diss harder than not like us while it simultaneously pulls NLU off the charts. If NLU charts and Fake can’t knock it off that’s a huge Dubya in Kendrick’s court
Bless you!
Nah, that's from Son Seuss.
Nah facts i find myself spitting the words, "i think n*ggas like him should die" with such vitriol you'd think it one of my sisters drake been creepin on
I could not handle hit em up being used. Leave Ross off it though
Don’t need to go to Tupac’s estate. Tupac just sampled “don’t look any further” by Dennis Edwards, same as Junior Mafia’s “gettin money”. That’s one of the many reasons Hit em up was so ruthless. 
What I’m tryin to say is that Kendrick could just go to whoever owns “don’t look any further” and reconstruct it. They sell that sample often.
Minus rose, this shit would slap

And I fuck with rose ftr
He doesn’t need to bring anyone else in. Drake has already run out of things to say and bringing in another person would give him more ammo.
Pusha
You crazy that song will burn souls for decades
Record labels and shit happy to help cover this shit up so their cash cows remain cash cows. If Drake is pedophile they don't care, if he's a pedophile and the public knows it fucks their bag up and they're upset
no, it doesn't. Everything that happened over the weekend won't be invalidated if he doesn't drop another diss. Drake pretty much waved a white flag with that last song, that's why people, including me, are saying it's over.
I think it highly depends on how you pronounce your username 🤣
Funny he’s the one who’s literally at war with OVO right now, maybe he’s not beefing on a track but he’s supposedly sending shooters lol.
Right, Drake has been a known creep for years now
The receipts are out there on Drake for all the public to see. And this is how he acts in *public*. I don't care about the whole "former child actor mentoring for current child actor." If an adult man was texting my 14 Y/O "I miss you" red flags would clouding my vision. And that's just one example of plenty of others that are publicly available.
To me at least it sounded like there was more than the public stuff we all knew and that you mentioned. 

Is the raid of Drake’s home gonna happen? Are there any victims of his alleged crimes that will speak up? Will there be a criminal investigation? Does the daughter exist?
Meek Mill with the reference tracks.
Pusha with Adonis.
Jay-Z at the Summer Jam with photos of Prodigy.
50 with Officer Ricky.
Just to name a few examples.

Anyone can make a track claiming something, you have to back it up.
I don‘t see myself listening to any of these songs again to be honest. Got a bit too personal for me at some point, I‘m not vibing to domestic violence and pedo claims. Muscially it‘s also not all that from my point of view.

I think Kendrick was just exaggerating what we already knew about Millie Bobbie Brown, this model he dated when she was 18 and the fan he took on stage. That‘s all there is to it I suppose. So based on that Drake is a creepy horndog but not quite the Weinstein sexual abuse ring crime lord Kendrick makes him look like.

With Kendrick regarding the domestic violence, there is zero evidence from what I‘ve seen.
However regarding the Dave Free thing / Kendrick being a cuckold, there are funny coincidences around that so I think there is some truth to it.
He ain’t better than Kendrick but of course respect is due
Drizzy kissin minors …uh fuck that
"Back To Back" was basically Drake's do-over. A lot of people don't even remember what "Back to Back" was going back-to-back with. Lol 

It was a different situation though. Meek hadn't dropped yet so Drake wasn't competing with anything but his own song.
Charged up even has a bad title
I didn't fuck kids part 2
“Come back when you’ve got facts/proof”. Love that Drake said that while providing zero proof for his claims. Meanwhile there’s a bunch of evidence of Drake being a creep towards underage girls.
Dude Drake mentioned Kendrick's family and wife first. Kendrick warned him repeatedly to not make it personal and he did it anyway. Have you been paying attention? Drake has been punching below the belt
Nah, he mentioned Whitney on Push Ups
Drake IS Cheddar Bob
Lmao which is the lamest excuse. We all can cook up names of people that were famous and caught. I have this friend who is a die hard Drake fan who I said bro how can his excuse be he’s too famous to do tht. His response, “ because he is!”
I don't think Kendrick has anything all that meaningful he needs to add exactly because Drake didn't really say anything. There's not a whole lot worse than calling someone a pedo and them having nothing to say for it. Unless Kendrick happens to know that Drake's secret daughter is also handicap and has never received child support, he can't really go for the jugular much more than he already has, and he certainly doesn't need to defend himself at this point.
I know this is a few hours old but yeah even media outlets like Rolling Stones etc are saying it’s over and Kendrick won.
Plus I mean the beef has to end at some point, Kendrick isn’t gonna just keep dropping tracks because Drake keeps releasing “nuh-uh”s over and over and over again
facts
Because Drake’s fanbase will give him the W and not much changes career wise if Kendrick stops now and doesn’t finish the job
This is not the perfect ending, it gives Drake’s fanbase plausible denominator of the L with the fake mole narrative and they’ll always believe kendrick commited domestic abuse and got cheated on
It's enough, trust me. 

The heart part 6 was a mess, it's more disliked than liked on YouTube, 

Drake started off the battle by saying Kendrick can't do numbers and then ended it with saying he doesn't care about numbers after he lost there.

When drake dropped back to back, people were saying kendrick was scared and drake was on instagram trolling. And then kendrick hit him over the head twice.

Said Kendrick needed to make catchy diss songs. And Like That and Not Like us are hits

The internet people are mocking drake in forums and memes. 

Random people from around the world are freestyling a diss about him and flooding the internet with it.

This is enough. 

As far as the pedo stuff goes. That's for the feds to deal with.
Is there a "Leave Drake Alone!?" video yet?
The dirts still soft, someone’s gotta pack it down and plant some flowers
Let's go another 6.
The thing is I don’t think that’s enough for Kendrick, in MTG he very clearly showed he wants Drakes career to be finished after this beef, I don’t think he’s achieved that yet. Proof of some of his claims in MTG would do that imo and I think that’s what’s next
Not who you were replying to but anything really. His debts/gambling issues, the second child if it’s a thing, predatory behaviour, UMG/Lucian being gross industry slime. There is enough things if he has more in the chamber.
I’m not talking about dropping, talking about being out in public. 

I’m not criticizing him at all, I don’t want him to get Epsteined/Boeinged
Yeah from his hideout
By who? The 0-6 God? 🤔 
![gif](giphy|lKUMKYzO35XxDEVYsB)
Dear god if Kendrick can gather up the big West Coast names and do some public video shots with some of these tiktoks of people in Cali c-walking to Not Like Us, Drake is gonna be in hell
A video could be sick. Could also expose some stuff in a video instead of just crushing a car
Nah. Remix AND a video. Get Rick Ross, ASAP Rocky, Future, J. Cole, hell, get Rhianna and Metro Boomin to make cameos. THAT would be gg.
Yep, commercial success is one of the only things drake has over kdot.
And the fact that Kendrick just did the ultimate 5D chess move and removed the copyright claims on all the reaction channels which is him giving up millions back to the hip hop community knowing that it would look super bad on drake if he then wanted to make money off these dudes. I do agree that the last song was a huge L for drake the more people analyze it for all of the mistakes made with him rushing out a response.

I honestly am starting to feel like Kendrick really did bait out drake and Cole and had a 10 min song and then knew exactly what each would do. He literally dropped a response to drake and had it uploaded within a hour which is crazy that he listened to the diss and put a actual song together and then mixed it down and uploaded it to YouTube all within a hour which makes me feel like Kendrick already knew what drake would say in response. Rumors of Kendrick having the song made over a month before this if true would be an accomplishment in it self.
It's such a vicious track that it almost makes me uncomfortable to listen to, like it's so personal it's not meant for me to even hear lol. Feel like I'm overhearing a kid's parents yell at him at a sleepover.
it's more about getting the ok from the estate though, he'd need their blessing to make it really hit right, legality aside
Yeah that one was close to ether levels of murder in them bars.
[removed]
That's why jcole changed his name lmaooo
I never understood why there are so many comments waiting for the raid to happen. At least to me it always seemed that Kendrick didn’t mean to imply any sort of inside knowledge on a criminal case against Drake and OVO (why would you let the man know there would be a raid soon?). When he said it’s only a matter of time, he just means this ring will get exposed eventually (like Diddy, R Kelly, Epstein etc).
Only reason pushas proved to be true was cause drake owned up to it, he could of just said "nah you lying".

I'm not familiar with the other ones.
I am actually laughing on this. Nice.
Please god, LET DRAKE TITLE HIS NEXT TRACK THIS
Cackling.
Me and Millie ain't even that close (feat. that 17 year old on stage I felt up)
Get a sample of Danny Devito in there *I don’t diddle kids*
Ft. Frank Reynolds
He literally mentions R Kelly a minute later. R Kelly had video evidence out for decades and was walking free
Which is stupid af cause Drake’s career is far from over
But God that'd be the world I wanna live in.

Nuh-uh part 10: "Kendrick smells like poop, he hates my soup, I'm a pretty cool guy, blackface was literally just that one time I swear"
The Drake fans will never stop. 

Like Ether didn’t end Jay, Hit ‘Em Up didn’t end Big (he even joked about it on Brooklyn’s Finest). Meek did well after Back to Back, even.
Lol, people that think like that aren’t worth thinking about. Drake will always win to them. This was a solid W from Kendrick and Drake finished himself off. You gotta love it.
Aubrey's gambling issues are on public display, what do you mean? He is always putting down crazy bets on fights and sports events and he partnered with Kick, the streaming platform made by online gamblers for online gamblers to hook people into online gambling after it was banned from Twitch.

People keep saying Kendrick needs to come with receipts, but people seem to miss the fact that Kendrick came with things that are already there for you to see if you go make a quick search. He doesn't have to provide receipts of his predatory behavior, because that shit is public, too. He doesn't have to bust a sex trafficking ring, he just had to remind everyone who Aubrey is and put it front and center in a place that couldn't be completely ignored by the money, the power, the fame, etc, to give Aubrey the noose to hang himself...and bruh hung himself.
Predatory behavior? Dude, there’s evidence all over the internet. There’s evidence in the lyrics of his songs. There’s a fucking video of him kissing an underage girl on stage lol.
Best game show ever, pre Drew Carey of course!
Get each of those atl rappers he mentions in there too.
As soon as I heard it I imagined Snoop all over that video lol
Ik Eminem isn't from the West Coast but imagine if Kendrick somehow manages to get him in the video, although it's practically impossible
That would be the best thing to happen to rap in a long time. One of those moments you'll never forget.
Been wanting this since I first heard that mustard beat.  This song practically demands a video and if it gets one I demand WC c-walking and stacking while not like us plays

But why does he think there is some ring? 
That‘s what people want to know.
Push had receipts, he gave us the baby mother and talked about the Adidas deal. He also had the blackface cover.
This is actually how Drake should have responded, sampled that scene from always sunny in the beat and just not address the issue any further.
R Kelly, Epstein, MJ
Now you have the girl who he kissed on stage saying it’s all good because she was 17 but consented. Now Drake fans saying if she didn’t have a problem with it why should you.
He put Epstein and R. Kelly in the same song he says he is both too respected and famous to be a sex trafficker as his defense.

Either his writers sabotaged him and dude too pilled out to notice, or he wrote it himself and his ego made him think it sounded good. Just like his whole angle for this was just repeating things he heard on Mr. Morale and making up something about Dave Free and Whitney.
No but the beef is and Drake definitively lost. At least this battle is over.
May not be over, but no one is looking at him the same way again. Not after the dumb shit he said on Heart 6 to make himself look even worse.
What are the actual downsides of finishing him off
What is it been like? Or was like? Is it still going? (Haven’t had “real T.V” in a long time, ‘n I don’t keep up with tv anyways and honestly know nobody that watches the price is right anymore [the ones that I do know, when Bob, left they left]) but I have always wondered
Let Future just hang out in the back with Lil Baby just vibing lmfao
Nah can’t have Snoop without his natural background music lmao

Dadadada…
Nah Snoop reposted The AI 2Pac thing on his IG like 2 weeks ago, so Idk what feelings they have there
The only cherry on top of this whole fucked sundae would be Eminem getting involved, meaning drake is up against the two people you never want to go up against in terms of rap beef lmao

Edit: Yo shoutout to Reddit for saying “try again later” but actually posting the comment every time I tried.
I thought about this for a while, if Kendrick wanted to do a Compton video, have the intro (before the beat drops) be Kendrick walking into a convenient store with Eminem as the attendant behind the country and Kendrick buys a “drake pack” and when he walks out of the store that’s when the beat drops
I can’t say enough good things about this Mustard beat. It was straight nostalgia in my veins hearing “Mustard on the beat, hoe” when I honestly expected chapter 2 of meet the grahams.
The Diddy-Birdman connection most likely, he thinks homelands raid and digging will lead to feds finding something there. Birdmans inappropriate relationship with Wayne (weird videos there Wayne meets him at age 10, Wayne shoots himself around the time it’s said he meets Birdman) and young money records bringing Nikki Minaj (current husband allegations, plane searched by Canadian feds) and Drake (inappropriate relationships with younger artists) into the fold of Young Money in the 2000s. In Pusha Ts infrared and Exodus 23:1, Push takes shots at Drake being a sock puppet or industry plant unlike Cole or Kendrick (Wayne discovers Drake around 2008 a rapper not about the gangster life; around the time Kanye starts doing numbers and industry trends in hip hop start changing and becoming more commercial). Mona Lisa by Wayne ft Kendrick is eerily similar to how Pusha got his dirt on Drake, Kendrick quotes the money splits Pusha calls out in exodus (splitting with birdman) on euphoria, Mother I Sober is about generational trauma/sexual abuse and also how the industry capitalizes on it, and finally Not Like Us starts naming not only OVOs current crew (The moment Baka gets out of jail from sex trafficking Drake gives him a job) but also Young Money people. (Drake sleeping with Waynes girl, “What is the owl bird n* and bird bitches”) Im skipping over details like Waynes and Birdmans falling out over contract stuff and Kendrick not wanting Wayne to retire and such but this is the general gist of it.
😂😂😂😂 can someone make this a meme
Depending on the state it doesn't matter what she said. Did her parents sign the permission slip?
“The child I sexually assaulted said it’s okay” actually wild take from drake fans lol
Exactly. Just because homegirl claims it was nothing doesn’t mean it was, especially to him
Drake is losing but his supporters will forever believe his “fake mole” bs if Kendrick never puts it to bed. He will also have people claiming he’s a domestic abuser if he never clears it up, and Drake will face barely any career damage if he’s allowed to walk away so easily. I’m really confused why people want it to be over without Kendrick finishing what he started.
Drake already did the job for him… Kendrick won. There’s no point, he said what he needed to say that made Drake get super defensive about being a pedophile which made him look even more like a pedophile. There’s no point in taking anymore risk, Kendrick is on top.
It gives Drake a chance for a better reply. If it stops now it ends on Drake getting clowned for Heart pt 6, if he drops again Drake gets a chance at a better response to end on.
I saw they were doing a show near me and tickets were like 15 bucks. Besides for this post it’s probably the only time I’ve seen them in the past 5 or so years
The prosecuter, judge and thugger getting sturdy.
I could hear the plucking
Snoop Dogg is weirdly a fan of Drake, went as far as saying he won the Pusha T beef overall because “In My Feelings” was so popular.
This rap beef didn’t really stand a chance at the “elimination of Drake” but it certainly tarnished his legacy. Every time Drake gets into a beef he never stands to lose much but it still follows him around.

After Meek, which he still won, people still accuse him of using ghostwriters.

After Pusha T, people still openly mock him as a father and say if it wasn’t for Push, he wouldn’t have so many photo ops with Adonis. Not to mention the bigger questions about his blackness that have grown more prominent since.

And even now after Kendrick, the pedo thing is front and center. Bonus point for every time you hear Drake say the N word from now on you’re going to think of Euphoria.

The Heart Part 6 is such an embarrassing track if I’m Kendrick and I already won I would let everyone sit on it and understand just how bad it actually is before I even think about dropping again. I mean look at the dislike ratio on YouTube and discussion in here and twitter. Kendrick also has 4 tracks in top 10s on DSPs. I wouldn’t be concerned with what some of his fans are thinking, they are not spinning the narrative that Drake won on anyone with common sense. No one is going to buy the domestic abuse angle either. Kendrick did the job better than anyone could’ve as far as rap is concerned.

As far as Drake having a career. Look at all that was known about Diddy and R. Kelly. There was video evidence of what R. Kelly did, a lot worse than what we have of Drake, and he was still allowed to walk. The justice system is unreliable and people have incredibly short attention spans. Losing to another rapper doesn’t always change the trajectory of your career, no matter what they say. The only reason people like Meek fall off is because of their own mistakes.
No offense but I don’t think you’ve had enough time to remember how quickly people forget about things.
I used to watch a lot of price is right with my grandparents, that and antiques roadshow were my favourites haha. I did find a price is right shirt at a thrift store about a year or two ago (that yes definitely came home with me). I wouldn’t be able to say if it’s “official” or not. But people do tend to enjoy it when I sport it
Snoop has to be paid to say that. It doesn’t make sense
I mean I totally disagree with him but his argument was “Kiki, do you love me” on repeat for 3 months to Kanye was a massive W. I don’t really see the point when youve just been told youre hiding a child, said it wasnt yours and then had to own up and be a dad. Although Drake did bounce back hugely as an overall artist tbf.
Kendrick Lamar Wins
I've been a fan of hip hop for over two decades and I aint seen nothing like this. 

You have to be an absolute drake glazer to disagree, this beef is over, at least on wax. The winner is indisputably Kendrick Lamar.

We will definitely see fall out from all this, but this phase is over. I dont wanna hear no more debates. 

Edit: Peep game since I see this comment floating around a lot (and rightfully so). 

I am not saying Kendrick is telling the truth, and Drake is lying. I am saying I believe Kendrick over Drake any day. There is a reason why Kendrick's narrative is overtaking Drake's. Pusha said it best "We talkin' character".

Kendrick has proven throughout his career what kind of man he is. Overall, he is trustworthy and has been spotless of scandals. Drake, on the other hand, has been caught lying multiple times. Has actual links to possible pedophilia, his persona is all about sex and using women (I mean, look at his CLB cover), and many more things as to why people are more likely to believe Kendrick and doubt Drake. 

Yes, if someone comes with proof, then the tides can turn, but that probably isn't going to happen. Drake is reaping and sowing. What is making him lose in this beef now is his character. This is why Kendrick wins. 

Edit 2: This man went and dropped a Dj Mustard produced club banger now. It really is over. Drake needs Jesus at this point. 

Edit 3: Drake just dropped. It is officially over. The dude needed to come with a guillotine and came with a paper cut. The Heart part 6 is a white flag. Kendrick the indisputable GOAT of the generation. 
Aight I was hating but now I can’t say shit. Wtf is this shit gonna look like a week from now? I’m hooked.
J. Cole is up bright and early this morning, ordering an iced caramel macchiato from Star Bucks right now and about to finish reading an Agatha Christie novel.
Whoever is telling the truth is winning. If they’re both telling the truth then damn… that’d kinda suck
Its super funny that Drake says Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy, then kendrick show drake using ozempic himself😂😂
Yall dudes just need to make a megathread for this shit
“Fuck a rap battle this is a lifelong battle with yourself” absolute masterclass from Kendrick
They both taking L’s if all of this is true
Cole is the only winner until the receipts are pulled.
Who’s telling the truth wins so we probably won’t know who wins 
Drake getting deported
If Kendrick is proven to have hit his wife, even if he wins against Drake, he loses as a public figure. His star will be diminished. If Drake is lying and Kendrick is not, then everything Kendrick said about him being a liar and manipulator is amplified. If Kendrick is lying and Drake is not, then this just makes Kendrick look horrible. He's a wife beater dragging folks' kids into the beef, spreading false garbage and retreading other folks' highs (he's a pale Pusha T clone at worst). 

  
There's a lot riding on this. Two of this generation's best are actively trying to get the other *arrested*, this is serious shit.
Do we have to keep doing this every song for karma?
I don’t care what’s true or not this is the rap sub not tmz ..both them tracks are 🔥I came for the music and they both delivered . I’m extremely satisfied with my hip Hop fix for the day keep that shit coming
Unironically, I think their tied until we get evidence on who’s telling the truth about who. If it’s all true, then Kendrick wins.
The hip hop community taking everything Kendrick says as a fact, and everything Drake says as a lie is wild to me. This battle is more even than y’all want to believe. If anyone is exposed for lying they automatically lose. I’m going to need proof about this 11 year old daughter Drake has, and Kendrick’s potentially illegitimate son.
Talks glazing. Proceeds to glaze.
It’s true if you think this is close you should work at Krispy Kreme in drakes house and glaze all day
What did you expect? Kendrick is the greatest lyricist in our generation.
kendrick winning, only if dave free isn’t BM’s secret BD 🤷🏽‍♂️
Aye man I get why Cole said fuck this. I completely get it now. Cause these two are absolutely wildin and I’m loving every minute of it
Kendrick > Drake was known already 10 years ago
Drake sucks at rap.
Kendrick called him Weinstein Diddy Epstein the 3rd who's hiding another child, while talking directly to Drake's mother and children, and begged Lebron and Curry to keep their kids away from anything near Drake and Drake only responded to the hidden child part.  This reveals too much about Drake and his fans.
Meet the Grahams was the nail in the coffin💀
Drake fans are kids, chicks, or the dumbest dudes you could know. Boring cringy actor with no substance.
I love how J Cole took a vacation and was chillin on a beach instead of getting in the middle of it. Been in hip hop for a very long time. Kendrick proved he’s the voice of this generation.
ummm the dave free thing though? if that's true, it's a headshot
Drake is a Degrassi actor. Rap is not his main thing hes a joke amongst real rapper
Lmao theres no competition kendrick destroyed him
Drake just should go away
Beef notwithstanding, Kendrick is objectively a better rapper than Drake, full stop.
Kendrick dropping a diss album soon. I can smell it in the air.
Kendrick is just the better rapper. It doesn't matter what Drake responds with, Kendrick is better with words than Drake (and all his writers)
I need receipts from both parties. Till then nobody has won. Anyone caught lying auto loss.
I know I’m gonna get lots of downvotes for this but honestly, wtf is this?! This is not a rap beef but just two people who genuinely hate each other and trying to tarnish each other’s reputation. 

Talking about each other’s family and kids who don’t even understand what’s going on. 

 I said it before, I’m so glad Cole dropped out. This is embarrassing for them, the black community and the rap culture in general.
the way people are treating this beef is so annoying, each side declaring “it’s over!! (their favorite) won!” after each track because their goat said something equivalent to a meme that makes you exhale out your nose a lil

like it feels like no one wants to let the beef progress and play out, why does everyone keep deciding on behalf of one of them, they can’t come back after what the other said, only for them to come back and the tide changes yet again 💀

like it doesn’t even feel like people are tryna see who’s the better lyricist anymore, it’s a competition on who’s the worse person
Idk bro, on wax I think family matters goes 10x harder than the Kendrick joint, but as far as disses go, seems like both are just pulling bullshit out of their asses atm
It's actually wild Kendrick has Drake's pills that say 'Ozempic' after that 'Ozempic' jealousy line so he has fuckin moles so we know Kendrick is being honest... And ya'll still need receipts??
It really does blow my mind that there are people out there thinking Drake is even close..I was BORED listening to Family Matters
REAL
interesting post history
I would say kendrick is winning right now too but you are glazing a Lil bit.
People already found receipts of the 11 year daughter from 2015. Aint looking too good Drake. I mean, we all know you like young girls. Plus with the Diddy stuff going on, that sex trafficking allegation looking real plausible. This wasnt a diss...this was a well thought out massacre.
Yes! Kendrick’s music contains real soul. Drakes is trendy but empty.
“Just men writing poetry to one another”- some other redditor
Travis Scott and Kanye are the real winners.
It's over and done. K dot literally and utterly obliterated Drake and the resultant fallout on Drake's end is going to be inevitable and irreversible, not only streaming and money wise but character and image wise; It't forever tarnished and so engraved in his image to a much greater degree than it had ever been in that now average joes are all in the know about Drake's character, not just hip hop heads. The way I see it, the beef was already over when it went nearly international as various hip hop outlets around the world and even general media outlets from every corner started reporting on this beef. Given the very nature and narratives of it all, It was always a slippery slope to begin with and by scooping so low and provoking Kendrick by namedropping his fiance and whatnot, Drake made yet another mistake, the same mistake he made when he was beefing with Pusha T. He never learns. It's done for Drake; from now on, you are going to be forever remembered by the masses that you are a certified pedophile.
What did Drake think he was doing going against someone who one an award not only for his music but an award that great **writers** get, Drake had no chance 😭
J. Cole > kendrick > drake
I some what agree that it may be over but the problem for me is that while Kenny's story is more compelling and the delivery more vicious etc etc and it is the better diss, I can't help thinking that Kenny did to some degree recycle what Pusha said and framed it from exactly the same angle of 'i'm morally superior i'm going to son you by framing it as me giving advice to your kids and family of your moral degeneracy' and exposing your character as evil etc....unlike mine'

The problem with this narrative as we know is that kennys moral superiority in itself is questionable. Yes hes not as hollwyood/pop star like as drake is, he's more private etc but it doesn't really sound like his hands are remotely clean especially RE: treatment of females.

Even on a basic level of the song itself. Kendrick claims moral superiority but also wishes direct death on drake, calls him a paedophile sympathizer and trafficker of females and writes a fake narrative to the guys kid/kids, for them to listen to in future about their dad being an evil monster who should be locked up with Weinstein etc. All with next to no real evidence.

Like you say in the court of public opinion, truth doesn't really figure as the winner is the one with the most compelling narrative and most vicious angles which in this case is Kendrick but I just cant help thinking that people are always swayed by the most shocking lines and supposedly 'clever' narratives no matter where the truth lies or whether the bars themselves are stronger or not. It's like whoever has the most salacious gossip and presents it the best wins.
You’re a glazer if you disagree with this post glazing Kendrick.

Face facts. Drakes diss actually went hard. Kendricks was ruthless. Both are saying shit we already knew and both are saying some shit that may or may not be true. 

The truth will find a way so stop glazing on both sides, enjoy the music, hope it doesn’t get physical and see what happens.
“You have to be an absolute drake glazer to disagree, this beef is over, at least on wax.”

This is, ironically, one of the most glazing statements I’ve seen in a long time😂😂
What a lame post lmao, feeling compelled to post on here announcing some winner in your opinion. Just enjoy the music you cornball

Dudes got me anticipating what might come tomorrow , shit is popping off so damn fast

Yall need to sit down with calling winners and losers kid shit. THIS IS STILL GOING ON AND WE DONT CARE WHO WINS LMAO. MORE!!!
Both artists are gonna drop an album soon with all the buzz this is generating

This the rap version of John Cena Vs Randy Orton

What’s your thoughts on J. Cole?
I mean if this beef is about character and not music then I can probably beat both of these guys.
Who cares, damn. 
[removed]
Whether accusations being thrown by either side is true is besides the point to me. In terms of strategy and execution, Kendrick won hands down. I ain’t NEVER seen anything like this lol. What a master class
You’re not saying one is telling the truth and one is lying, but you’re picking one anyway😂😂😂
What is going on
He didn't win if the main thing he exposed is not true. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but you can't call it at this point. Drake's response was actually solid as fuck. We need receipts from someone to settle this.
It’s funny Mal Kept saying he wish other people didn’t diss Drake l so it could be about him and Kendrick, but Drake can’t diss Kendrick because he doesn’t have anything lol “red button “ foh
I really don’t see how it’s so one sided, I think they’re tied at this point
Grown men reciting poetry to each other. They should just make out already.
I watched in horror as Jimmy took the bullet and ended up in the wheelchair.

Now I'm watching in horror as Drake is being accused of being Puff Driddy.

It's like a rap Haley's Comet!
##KENDRICK VIOLATED HIPAA AND DRAKE AT THE SAME DAMN TIME
I’ve been a Kendrick fan for a decade and a half. I think his diss records are trash. Just talking in weird voices over the most trash beats imaginable, idk what the fuck y’all are hearing. Haven’t listened to Drake’s because I don’t listen to Drake.
Trying to catch up on this. What are the songs Drake dropped/responded to and what are the songs Kendrick dropped/responded to?
“I don’t wanna hear no more debates” 

So you want to hear more debates?
Dude thinks he’s the judge in all of this lmao
Everybody so caught up on the bullshit but don’t realize that this man just told the world to keep their kids away from Drake. Theres some shit brewing
Cole backing out makes so much more sense now. This shit is going way deeper than it needs to. Me and my Dad were just saying he should have stayed because it’s just rap, but they have gone beyond personal atp. I’d expect fists to start flying quick if they were talking face to face like this.
They're 40 and corny
Kendrick said “you raised a master manipulator.” Isn’t something a master manipulator would do is spread fake info for his own benefit. If he doesn’t have a daughter and got Kendrick to write a song about her, Kendrick does not “win”
“Fuck a rap battle. This a whole life battle with yourself. “
I have bad news for you if you are buying what Kendrick has been selling. Research the child model and the “mole” behind the suit case.
I mean yeah yall chose a winner before the beef based on who you like more. It’s all good. Kendrick hasn’t proved to have any sort of character to be defended more than any other man lol.
never forget andrew noz 2010 review of thank me later [https://www.npr.org/2010/06/15/127834096/drake-thank-me-later-no-thanks](https://www.npr.org/2010/06/15/127834096/drake-thank-me-later-no-thanks)
The Drake persona is just a character created and portrayed by Aubrey Graham circa 2007 once loved for his catchy melodies and rhyming skills the character became tired and started appropriating the lives and cultures of those around him aluding to Mobties and sleeping with/persuing numerous women in the industry involved with other rappers early in his career.After a few seasons of playing Drake Aubrey lost his way and despite numerous writing credits he allowed other writers on board to take the character in a new direction far away from his Canadian child actor roots and Phonte light witty sing rap style to a new trap sound where melodies not lyrics could carry him. While production never reached previous highs in quality with the exception of a spin off throwaway project .The Drake character continued to enjoy chart success in an area of streams and tiktok dance bullshit he was king but the boy was never the same and would rely heavily on features from artists such as Future and 21 savage to carry him whilst forgetting who the artist Aubrey was.Many have questioned the characters relevance to the culture with the likes of Pusha T exposing the lover boy women friendly person but the powers that be have kept the show on air as s money making machine the Drake character is too lucrative
Kendrick Lamar is currently directing the Drake character  in his first and last horror series latest addition called Meet the Graham's opened to rave reviews jury's out on whether it will be a career ending project for Aubrey as he's shyed away from any serious role and taken a more kid friendly approach during his career. Rumour has it the film would be classified pg13 and could feature Aubrey in a role with younger female costars to his delight however this has not been confirmed.Due to creative disputes with Lemar and outburst on Instagram and twitter it seems the two are still locked in a battle of creative differences when Kendrick suggested the character take on the role of a Loving Father rather than Loverboy to Aubreys dismay as his bad bitch mobtie  character Arc had been doing so well up until now.
I just hope they both stop before it gets deeper.
Kendrik beats his wife and one of his kids ain't his
Agreed
Lol as if you’re dealing with an unbiased group on Reddit, or all places. This subreddit has hated Drake for years now. You’re not unique
Not even a question.  Drake has been caught in very questionable situations with minors but it’s always been brushed under the rug.
Kendrick’s Pride, Loyalty, & Respect > Drake’s Fame, Fortune, & Fakes
And if that wasn’t enough, Drakes story post following this definitely solidifies it.
Don’t matter who won. The beef is good. Most Drake fans are Kendrick fans. Stop playin lol
Kendrick fans knew front the outset who was taking the W. It wasn't fair from the start.
It absolutely does matter if one of them is lying
I don’t think there’s a clear cut winner & this post is glazing lol..  i got a tie but not mad if u say either.  Just nobody “clearly” won.
Why do y'all care so much lmao.  Both have made good songs.
i don’t understand the rap beef can someone please explain it to me
Inarguably
I don’t know if anybody else feelin this, but for me one reason this feels so euphoric is because it’s an example of righteous anger unleashed. Too many times we see the provocateurs and antagonists make the most noise, and selfish values promoted more than moral ones. Too often good people don’t get nasty cuz they’re good people. Look at the whole political world for an example. It’s about time a good guy gets MEAN and speaks on morals as fiercely as the selfish speak on their own interests.
As someone who doesn't really listen to rap anymore, Reddit sure likes putting this on my feed and i'm forced to take a look. First and foremost I've always thought Drake was super lame and much prefer Kendrick. But what's all this about Drake trafficking children? It would seem this has become a possible legal battle now lol.
You’ve been a fan of hip hop since 2003 😂😂😂😂 my guy, sit down
[deleted]
Beefs in rap are fake ya goons. Its like kayfabe for wrestlers. These guys are putting on a show for attention. What a bunch of goobers.
To be fair, how many celebrities did people think they “knew” before the dark came out? It’s crazy how you automatically side with Kendrick cause you think some random stranger is “trustworthy”. You don’t even know the man for goodness sakes. He is no different than the crackhead stealing items from their family for the drug habit.
Kendrick def has changed the way rap beefs are dealt with.
I don't think this is a fair fight. Drake is fighting everyone but Kendrick can focus all his bars on Drake. There is literally no support for him. 

Regardless, I think Kendrick would have still won but, the playing field isn't level.
Who cares, they're both shit in a genre that is an embarrassing shadow of what it used to be. Do one for shady
“Can’t understand me right now? Just play this when you 18” has gotta be one of the coldest lines, we all know Kendrick’s shit always comes back to bite someone in the ass .
That’s fine. I still enjoy both of their music and will continue to listen to both of there many great songs… idgaf about the beef, it just brings more good music and fire from the artists
Glazing? To say Kendrick definitely won is glazing. Nobody has definitely won. In my opinion, Drake has won. Absolutely. But I’m willing to say it’s a draw because I have enough self-awareness to understand that it’s impossible to judge a battle between artists and their art without being influenced by my own biases and preferences. But having watched and heard almost every rap beef over the years, Drakes diss tracks overpower Kendrick’s on almost every level. FACTS.
Bro drake did not lose he literally said bring receipts for all of this in family matters.  Drake admitted him not having a daughter on instagram yesterday. Kendrick called drake a pedophile which drake knew he was gonna say that because he addressed it in taylor made freestyle diss. I think drake has one more massive diss in him. Kendrick repeating the same lines other people have said about drake already. Regardless this has been absolutely amazing and both sides are killing it.
How did he win? His whole song is based on a fake daughter drake doesn't have. Kdot beat his girl.

It's not an ether quality song by drake or kdot.

I don't like either btw 😂
Y'all K Dot stans are ridiculous. Keep on supporting the wife beater. Drizzy burnt him. The dude is charred
I find it weird Kendrick fans are cool with him saying he knows drake is a child molester but only brought this out because drake dissed his family. If you really think drake is a child predator that kids are not safe around .. wtf are you rapping about it, this should be met with proof and charges not some streams
I’m not a big rap fan and I’m not involved in the rap community, but I’ve kept up with all the disses. As soon as the kids were brought up that’s when I was thinking “Damn this could get nasty”
Nope. Kendrick lost this round. Badly.
![gif](giphy|l36kU80xPf0ojG0Erg|downsized)
No he did not. At least drakes shit sounds good. Kendrick puts you to sleep for real. Worst flow. No rhymes and dead beats. That little midget is awful don’t care what you nerds say. He raps for nerds. Like oooooooh that’s so clever. But no flow no rhyme just words
>I am saying I believe Kendrick over Drake any day.

Glaze is crazy
Drake is not a emcee really. I don’t think anyone thought he was a great rapper right? Like I get that people like his music, but not because he was an incredible emcee. So I would think Kendrick destroying Drake is expected by most people.
💯
Being a hip hop fan for two decades means absolutely nothing lol 😂
Anyone gassing up kendricks diss can’t be trusted. Only like that was fire. Everything else was trash
I mean how can a pdf who doesn't even write his own lyrics beat Kendrick. Bro is literally cyraxx.
Just listened to both tracks, and this is a massive W for Kendrick. However, he did take a few hits IF Drake is telling the truth. (Incoming Drake Glazers™ saying that a man who HID HIS CHILD could never lie.) Kendrick deep dives into what lies behind the facade that is Drake. How he womanizes, lies, and manipulates others which culminates in a reveal that Drake either has a daughter or has been grooming a minor. Drizzy fans stay taking L's.
Saying “you have to be an absolute drake glazer to disagree” doesn’t solidify your argument at all lol what a petty thing to say. Maybe some hip hop/rap fans just love seeing actual competition. This is the problem with the internet, everyone thinks their opinion equates to truth and that if anyone has a different opinion, we have to question that person’s character. Your opinion is your opinion, but it ain’t over until THEY (the artists) display that it is. All these karma farming posts are cringe af and repetitive
Idk I felt like Kendrick’s track was too overproduced for a dis track. I was hoping he’d go straight for the jugular old-school style.
Y’all jumping the gun too soon folks…

I’m not a fan of neither and I mean that. So I’m checking both sides and seeing what’s coming out; Intel and all.

Kendrick may have fallen for the okie-dokie by posting a photo of that stuff. The MMG glove and the Shortee shirt. People putting out info that Drake DOESN’T have a daughter (More and more plausible that he doesn’t and Kendrick didn’t research the facts).

If Drake comes out with another diss confirming that he planted that stuff in the photo and confirms that he doesn’t have a daughter? Kendrick may take a L on this one. Y’all also too quick to dismiss Drake verse; He got it in on the first and second part of the song. Didn’t like part 3.
His shit is so boring - he sounds like a cartoon character
kendrick is moving like he’s beefing for the first time imo 

meet the grahams feels a desperate attempt to put drake down especially with the dancing with the devil vibe
Need Drake to Reply so Dot can reply 

Drizzy's fans need to splash his face with water, tell him to write back
Can't name a single song from either of these two artists, gosh it feels good to be old.
> you have to be an absolute drake glazer to disagree 

Proceeds to glaze Kendrick for 5 more paragraphs
It’s not even close
Meet the Grahams is shit though 




He shudda sat it out and made a better diss
“I’m not saying Kendrick is telling the truth and Drake is lying… ‘We talkin’ character.’” 

If Kendrick isn’t telling the truth then he’s a liar… that completely undercuts your entire narrative. This isn’t over yet and a winner has yet to be decided. Kendrick pressed his red button, (assuming he doesn’t have others, I’m almost certain he does.) so now it’s up to drake to either press his red button with salacious information OR play an alternative angle that makes the impact of Meet the Grahams less noticeable. This isn’t over yet, you’re a Kendrick glazer for saying it is.
It’s not even close too. Drake sounds childish and unserious in comparison, I can’t believe some people think he’s winning this
The winner is whoever is telling the truth, they’ve both got major allegations against each other
Hmm na they’re both losing. They’re both shit people. Idk how you can celebrate kdot when he’s beating his wife and cheating on her with white girls (after showing so much distaste for white people).

Drake kissed a 17 year old while 23, and texted MBB boy advice; not anything nasty I don’t think. While it’s bad, I still think Kendrick’s is worse. 

Let’s wait and see who has more dirt and receipts.
Every one of yall in this thread who's ever talked shit about people following the Kardashians and that kinda bullshit need to take a hard look in the mirror today. lmao some straight daytime soap opera shit
Cool, but you’re wrong
Kendrick used psychological warfare. And its beautiful
Kendrick said before he had OVO people working for him and dropped almost immediately after Drake did so yea I believe him. Drake definitely lost especially if he got a mole in his camp
can someone eli5?
I’ve been with black and white and everything that’s in between 

You a black messiah wifing up a mixed queen 

And hit vanilla cream to help out with your self esteem 



Kendrick Stans are loyal lol. What the hell is he gonna do now? Cannot go back to the prophet thing. Wild turn of events
We all know Kendrick ain’t lying. Jimmy didn’t get out that wheel chair because of HIS rapping skills.

![gif](giphy|M7BfQuvGf79DO)
Glaze much OP?
A battle with with daggers doesn't count in a war of pride. There are no winners when the prize is rotten.
Scandal free? What about the time where he goaded the white chick into rapping his lyrics that had a derogatory word in the verse? Girl was getting death threats, etc.
Calling a cheater trustworthy is stomach deep glazing.
Facts.
Never seen anything like this.
This was next level.
I also am ready to call it for KDot.
Thanks for being a fan of the movement.
Only if his claims are true. If the daughter thing is made up it's not over. At all.
I fw both artists . Both great in their own right . I just appreicate the music and move on , it’s hilarious seeing the glazers d riding mad hard on either one of them . I just hope it doesn’t get violent at all cause they literally talkin real real hate towards one another . Craxy
As a fan of both its hard to disagree with this, it's no landslide, neither side has pulled an Ether (yet) but Kendrick almost the whole way through has had better tracks.

Like that > FPS 
Euphoria > Push Ups 
6:16 < Taylor Made Freestyle 
Meet The Grahams or Family Matters is too difficult to judge until we actually get some proof of any of the shit being said on either.  Also whilst one is the clearly more devastating diss the other is probably a better song to listen to, how people will judge them is up to them, but Meet The Graham's crossed over into a hip hop moment that was actually hard to enjoy.

All up though if this is all the music we get I'd give Kendrick the W also
People need to actually listen to Kendrick’s writing before they comment.  I’m not talking about the diss tracks, I’m talking about his discography.  The dude legitimately tells you everything you need to know about him, how he misused his fame, how he’s tormented by his thoughts and actions, and how he chose to be a leader despite the fact that he doesn’t see himself worthy of it.  Yall need to listen to mortal man - when shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?  Even talks about how when he takes the course he decided, the industry would try and cut him off.  The man is constantly talking about all of his transgressions, he lets his audience read his diary.  You think his diss tracks or his writing is disingenuous, then you haven’t been listening.
All I see are stans glazing their mans
Kd Daughter bar was bait from Drake's team so that throws all of his other lines out the winsow
This post is blatantly biased.
"Meet the Grahams" isn't a diss track.   
  
It's a systematic deconstruction of Drake's character in front of his own family.
Anybody whoever thought, for one single solitary millisecond that Drake ever had even the slightest, most remote isolated chance of ever coming out as “victorious” in this situation is a complete, utter Floridiot.  
This shit ain’t over but Kendrick is currently winning. Idk if Drake can win because most people have the same biases you have.
Who cares about either of them whiney little runts
Neutral but finding myself rooting for Drake

  
I've been a big fan of Kendrick but now things aren't sitting right. He made 2 classic, classic albums with TPAB being best rap album ever, then his quality dipped with DAMN and MMATBS. Yet because he is appointed as the critical darling, he gets his automatic 8.5+ ratings, his Grammys, his Fantano slurping, a Pulitzer (lol), and other dumb stuff. Some of Mr. Morale is meandering nonsense (some is really good), and he is leaning into using all these dumb inflections and voices that make him sound like Cartman. In addition, he's putting on his cousin Baby Keem whose album was like 60% unlistenable (except the opener and the song "16.") And also pandering to woke stuff while still dabbling in Keem's misogyny, Future collabs, etc.

MMATBS is not a good enough album to justify the 5 year wait. Be more prolific. And stop with the dumb voices and inflections. Finally, his next prominent move in the public eye is to jump on an adversarial thing and be all machismo with Like That? After MMATBS was about therapy, finding peace with yourself, coming to terms that you're a toxic/terrible person, your family's cycle of sexual abuse and a trans cousin? You jump from that to "ay yo f\*\*\*\* J Cole and Drake they suck I'm king?" It's just odd and maybe speaks to him backing down from the notion that he and PGLang were post-rap, doing modern art and filmmaking and all this shit. Honestly it feels like he's figured out that he isn't actually good with the new direction of being an artistic curator or whatever the f\*\*\* it was supposed to be.

Drake is not a good person now. But he has a few great albums in Take Care, IYRTITL, NWTS. His quality dropped right when Kendrick's did. Yes, DAMN is better than what Drake has put forward since. The gap is closer on actual merit than the music world cares to admit. But Drake, or Team Drake, has at least remained prolific and still makes hits. Drake hasn't resorted to idiotic voices like Kendrick or late career Eminem.

Drake has significant issues. He's a bit of a delusional rockstar. He's a 38 year old whose taste in women is 20ish years younger. His songs have become formulaic since Views really. He still has acting inclinations, flipping between tough and sensitive, Black/White/Patois, the mob boss and the desperate kid. He is using a ton of ghostwriters.

But despite all of Drake's flaws, he has landed significant shots on Kendrick (tbh, so did J Cole before he backed down) and has changed the way I felt about Kendrick artistically post-TPAB. I have not changed how I felt about Drake.
Put it to you like this: Even if Drake’s diss was better, would I have any inclination to listen to him over KENDRICK? Fuck no. Drakes just a pop star
People hate on Drake because he’s popular and makes music that most people like.  You can say he has a ghost writer all you want, he still makes hits. It’s a natural inclination to not like the person on top. 

Kendrick is not perfect and he has lyrics about sex and drugs also. If Drake didn’t use his fame to help people, most people wouldn’t know who KL was.  At this point, everyone will root for the person they like instead of judging by the songs. 

You can declare the winner in your mind but you can’t stop debates because it is debatable.
Nah bruh. The thought that Kendrick might be a wife beater hurts my soul. I need a week of bereavement. If I find out it's true, I'm going on life support
Honestly I'm not that big of a fan of rap or music in general, but I know when I'm watching something generational and I'm hooked getting updates of what happens next.
Then he’ll eat a modest lunch consisting of a glass of water and a slice of rye bread
Agatha christie is heinous💀
J Cole is too cheap for Starbucks lol
Cole: See, I only read about murders.
I appreciate that there are other rap fans who know who TF the GAWD Agatha Christie is. Thank you.
Need a lie detector test. But it strange how Kendrick had the bait planned out with the zoomed in photo of 6:16. 

This is the 90s LA vs Toronto edition
I don't know, see Kendrick having a crisis management team, sounds more like some shit drake would do
They might beg Dr. Dre to announce Detox to divert attention.
Drake had one verse for Kendrick on family matters. wtf is he doing talking to the weekend 😂. 

Kendrick is murdering him.
Bro he has Drake's prescription pills and you think Dot's lying. You dumb?
One of those prisoners dilemmas
easiest Jermaine dub
Drake had a paternity test for one alleged daughter who is 11 right now.  Wonder if he will post it.

If not...
it'd be the first double L career destroying rap beef. Diddler vs beater sucks if it's true
I mean we know for sure drake isn't telling the truth based on the amount of obvious lies on his last 2 disses. So far drake is clearly the less credible one.
And since we probably never know, whoever made the better disstracks win and that is Kendrick
It's all gonna come down to receipts and so far Kendrick has a confirmed mole in OVO.
if they’re both telling the truth then cole wins lol
Drake has been exposed as a liar time after time.He's a good pop artist but battling isn't really his bag,he so badly needs to be the popular guy however he can't see that he's had a beautiful career and doesn't really need to mix it up with true lyricists like K.Dot or Pusha T.
Wait where did Kendrick show drake using it?
F a megathread. We need a wikipedia page this is history
I'm not a huge rap fan, I don't mind it but it's not something I follow and could probably only name about 15-20 rappers and most of them would be from two decades ago. 


I'm enjoying this shit, didn't even know about the hole beef until today when I thought I'd have a nosey about what all the fuss was for. I then spend an hour on YouTube catching up on the beef between the two even though I've never listened to either of their songs willingly until I checked out the track today.
Or move this shit over to the r/pop subreddit instead since it involves Drake
The last minute was fucking insanity. Damn Kendrick man you really can't fuck with him.
J. Cole smiling on his bike in Fayetteville rn
Drake is the biggest liar ever in rap. Fuck this piece of shit.
Cole probably feels bad. I think he legitimately cares about drake and kendrick, and doesnt like any of it.
Most based take in this thread
Could definitely see Cole coming out with something to try put this beef to an end, maybe with a sample of What’s Goin On by Marvin Gaye.
Drake is a well documented liar. He doesn’t have credibility 
Honestly, this is the only outcome I actually can get behind. The Millie Bobby Brown shit was weird and gross even if nothing inappropriate occurred. Let Canada have wheelchair boy back.
PLS
I agree. I feel like people are kinda bypassing what drake said (understandably, Kendrick barely let family matters breath for an hour). But someone like Kendrick possibly beating his wife does kinda fuck his whole image. It’s not like Kendrick has 0 skeletons in his closet

But again, it’s about whoever pulls up proof first
Drakes is much tougher to prove honestly. Kendrick and his spouse have admitted to having  a rocky relationship, and kendrick spoke on how he feels about domestic violence in 2015. 

The only thing with that is it’s been proven time and time again that just because someone says one thing doesn’t mean they live their truth, so there’s always the chance that kendrick is a fake and doesn’t live the life of peace he claims he does. 


What makes me think this may not be the case is that drake has claimed other things in this beef that are easily proven false. Kendrick has a track record of activism, and giving back to the la community. The mayor of the area spoke of the hundreds of thousands that Kendrick has donated to the area to improve different aspects of the community, and you can check his fucking twitter and see he’s hosted events for families in la. Sounds like he’s planting money trees to me. 

Drakes also been called out for lying multiple times, and has changed his spots more times than I can count on my fingers, it’s why I personally haven’t really liked a mf. Dude just isn’t true to himself now, or wasn’t true to himself before and either one calls character into question. I’m not saying him being a liar means he’s actually a beard but he’s lied about his son, he’s talked to 14 year old girls, he’s lied on Kendrick blatantly ( yall can’t really believe his son is frees’ son, right? Dude has kdots eyes, ears and his chin for crying out loud. He looks more like his mom sure, but Jfc that’s a dumb one) 

Time will tell. I’m calling it equal till one of them proves it. But somebody has a lot less proof put out already than the other.
Fuck all that, Drake is against the ropes. He can’t take any more shots otherwise it’s a 10 count on his career 
Drake wins
Kendrick wins
Drake wins
Kendrick wins
"Then she look at me, she got adhd"
Drake wins
happy cake day, and personally i like seeing people's viewpoints and revelations. It's exciting to see how people dissect their work.
If its all True they both lose. Kendrick cant claim the cultures voice as a woman beater, he cannot talk about people feeling black enough and have a white woman fetish.
Sex trafficking awful. 

Wife beater and adulterer lecturing others on how to be a dad? 

Talk about lesser of two evils
Who wins if none of it’s true?
The only take that matters right now.
Lol if it's all true NOBODY wins and they're both pieces of garbage.
if it's all true, nobody wins, but people already hate drake, and kendrick will likely take a bigger fall in image, though he likely does not give a fuck about that.
I mean at this point I think it’s pretty obvious there’s a mole that’s part of OVO feeding Kendrick information. There’s no way he wrote, recorded, and produced Meet the Grahams in just one hour right after Drake dropped Family Matters. He had to have listened to it before it dropped and someone from Drake’s camp sent it to him. There’s also the cover photo for Meet the Grahams. Not saying or assuming Drake is lying but they’re both throwing some heavy accusations and Kendrick’s seem to hold more weight just on the fact that someone is leaking shit out to him.
Drake lies tho. 

In this verse he is now saying his wife hooked up with Dave free. Previously suggested it was a security guard. 

Lied about cease and desist on this record 

Lied about ozempic use 

Lied about sleeping well 

Lied about surgery 

Etc 

Why should anyone believe him?
i think raising a son that isn’t yours is completely negligible compared to hitting your wife. we definitely need some receipts for this. i’m hoping someone is lying because it would really suck if both are telling the truth because i enjoy both artists.
Cause Kendrick has Drake's prescription bottle. There is actually moles. Drake's shit can be disproven by Kendricks wife and it wouldn't fuckin matter. Drake is a fuckin pedo and has pedos in his camp??
Uhm how about you ask about Drake showing receipts that Kendrick beat his wife - pretty easy to look that up if something was filed. Or show receipt that the boy isn’t Kendrick’s?! Drake said the boy was the bodyguards son but now it’s his manager’s son? One has been known to lie and hasn’t given any proof. The other has provided some receipts.
I agree with you but i feel like that plays into the whole culture thing Kendrick was talking about on euphoria. 

We have to ask why we are so ready to believe Kendrick and discredit Drake.
I mean, it's pretty much the definition of reputation. We can see how they have carried themselves through the years. There is a reason Dots verses are being taken more seriously than Drakes.
You guys didn’t even give a chance to begin with
Usually I shit on grandiose statements, but I'm right there with you, if not Kendrick then who else? Mans the best in his era and maybe ever.
Weird wannabe drake incels who have the same predatory attitude he has too. Don’t forget those guys
Kendrick is a mastermind
The lies.
That's what rap beef is tho
No.
Kendrick is trying to get rid of one of the worst influences in rap right now. 

This is policing the culture, kicking the perverts and weirdos out.
I’ll never understand how a grown ass man calling another grown ass man’s parents by name and saying “I wish your son would just die” is groundbreaking lyricism. Like how isn’t that corny to folks. Sounds like some shit you’d hear in a call of duty lobby.
Finally a matured take, I don’t know why nobody else is speaking on how embarrassing this is, it doesn’t make both of them look any cooler or tougher. I had so much hopes for this but I am no longer invested, it’s become a tmz battle

I was gonna mute this sub due to how toxic and biased it’s been lately but seeing people like you makes me want to stay. Both fanbases need to really question if it is about winning the feud or questioning your favourite artist as a person
Yeah it's stupid. It's not even about who's the better rapper now. It's just nonsense. Both of them have no receipts and they're just calling each other short, a wife beater, light skin and a deadbeat dad. There is real sanctioned rap battles on the street and then there's this. They should just meet up and see who can freestyle better
Bro, meet the graham's made me do way more then just push some air out of my nose. I was audibly saying damn out loud the whole time.
Kendrick literally has Drake's prescription and you think he's lying to you. Can't help glazers man.
These are very huge allegations that are being thrown out. Most of us like Kenny, but we want to make sure we know it's absolutely true before saying anything
Nah  they don’t want receipts they’ll just move the goal posts. Reality is he’s always been a. Sketchy bastard and his fans will forgive anything and keep moving the goal posts.  Man’s a creep and honestly the stuff said about him is believable
bored listening to family matters is wild, what is there to be bored about? the beat switches? the verses? kendrick potentially being a wife beater and not the father of his child?
Bro he was mimicking kendrick’s old style, which is crazy. It shows kendrick’s flows only work for kendrick cuz that shit is genuinely wack if attempted by anyone else, but cartoons n cereal is a certified banger.
You smoked that Iran contra 95% pure crack before you made this take. Sad.
horrendous take
Dude mustve been told the potential this beef could escalate too. He realized this wasnt no friendly rap comp, so he bowed out. We all made fun of him for it, and he stayed silent knowing the possible outcome, now he looks like a sage. He probably feels bad too about all this. He probably hates where this has gotten to.
1000%, no doubt on my mind, I would whoop both these dudes in mario kart 64. No doubts.
Cat is out the bag

But, he also said Baby Keem ghost wrote for Kendrick. I like Melodic Blue, but the same guy that wrote that didn’t write Mr Morale. I think Drake is just throwing out shots hoping one sticks.

Edit: I edited this to change it from “hat” -> “cat”

Give me some credit, it was like 4 AM ET.
It has no basis tho. This has been said before and disproven before. No major parties have ever said anything, Whitney has spoken out about their flawed relationship but still never mentioned physical abuse, and the only sites reporting on this are untrustworthy ones that have lied before. It is basically as factual as a random ass tweet from a drake stan. While it very much can be true, innocent before proven guilty.
Those allegations were addressed live like 10 years ago by kenny and were just some rumors running on a random blog that haven't surfaced since. Drizzy didn't learn anything from the push situation, ego too large for that.
Grow up
Hope it ain’t true! But I did see a vid pop up today back in 2015 addressing this shit and saying it’s all bs
he addressed it almost a decade ago... its not new info
He wrote a whole album about how shitty he is and the struggles with his wife.  Drake saying that stuff isnt even new info to anyone who listens to Kendrick.
mcdonald's caramel frappe. that shit slaps
Thanks for getting the reference!
Makes you wonder how Kendrick got the picture. Makes his line from Euphoria about OVO working for him make more sense.
[removed]
Polygraphs are not accurate.
What’s the significance of the picture? Isn’t it OJ’s glove?
Canadians banned from the west coast permanently.
Dre dumped what he had left on Compton. Detox ain’t ever happening.
You could clearly hear the new verse Drake recorded after Euphoria came out targeting Kendrick. Everything else was pre-Euphoria.
Drake did same thing for Pusha most of his actual disses were at Kanye.
Thats probably bcz drake has more for him.

No way this isnt going to round 3.
Yo Weeknd is gonna cook this dude. 

We all forgot about Abel’s bars. He being shoot one offs here and there, now we getting the FULL course.

Drake sent an actual street warning to XO on this. In the video Drake is by a shed in a backyard with a hells angel, that’s where cash’s security guard or whoever got shot a couple days ago.

Shit is getting deeeeeep.
It was 3 songs in 1 and 2 of those were solely for Kendrick.
Oh no? Not the prescriptions? Lmfao who tf cares bout prescriptions.
The cover of meet the grahams is a pic of Drake's dad's suitcase, laid out with some of his clothes, Drake's driving gloves from the recent video and a colection of multiple of Drake's perscriptions including ozempic, under Drake's goverment name (Aubrey Graham).

Drake also replied and said that its a lie that he has a daughter but didnt say anything about any of the other allegations.
Zoom in on the meet the graham’s album cover

Government name on his drugs and all. Probably leaked from someone in drakes inner circle
We’ve read about all kinds of shit, like Roe v. Wade, Brown v. Board of Education… now we’ve got Duckworth v. Graham
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake%E2%80%93Kendrick_Lamar_feud
Right… drake and Kendrick are some of the biggest rappers in the past 15 years
[deleted]
For real, the Pharrell beef is getting glossed over in this too.
The end of the drake era could be upon us, had a good run like Wayne did but sit yo ass down ya diiig
Speaking of Wikipedia I love how someone already updated Drakes to say “Children: 2” lol
He really got out at the right time. I wonder if they have any dirt on Cole. 🤔
Right, let's not pretend that their credibility is even remotely similar
💯
For sure, he called it a mile away.
“Why believe you? You never gave us nothing to believe in”
We don't know any of these people personally lol they can both be lying or telling the truth. People need to stop acting like they know the skeletons these celebrities have in their closets lol no one in the general public knows shit, we just fans lol
idc about your credibility lmao, even abe lincoln would need to come with receipts after accusing someone of running a sex trafficking ring
The free thing wasn’t said with any conviction 
He said “I heard a rumor ____ that makes sense to me”
And then people pointed out that his fiancée follows free but not Kendrick
Honestly anybody who can’t see this has either A) not been listening B) hasn’t got a clue C) is a liar
Lol I can promise you Drake's career is not ending because of this. Heaps of rappers who aren't as big as him done way worse than what Drake is even being accused of doing and survived.
Lmaoooo that’s a fuckin banger nonsequitur lmaooo
Not saying either is a good person for this but if that’s the case then Dre wasn’t either??
[removed]
Maybe the winners are really the friends we made along the way
J Cole
As of right now, Kendrick easy. And us for getting some bangers regardless. 
The culture!!!!
Wasn’t there someone that said that Euphoria was 17 minutes long originally? Might have chopped it up and reworked it a bit to make it three.
His camp has been saying this is a 20 min diss that’s been recorded and released in pieces. Kendrick doesn’t address anything Drake said on this song
Ya’ll already decided who was going to win before it even happened. Kendrick can do no wrong to you.
Dude did you even watch the video for Family Matters? Drake is hinting that Dot’s supposed “mole” was a double agent and he got fed false info. And this isn’t cope, Drake even liked a comment suggesting this
Also said that Keem was a ghostwriter for Kendrick, which instantly struck me as just...an odd thing to say without laughing.
Drake is Taylor swift. Messy hoes that lie and stand for nothing. All the money in the world and you’re still lame.
Lies even in the way he sings, switching accents every day
Negligible?  It's honourable 
I find it funny when people try to roast Kendrick for raising the child if it isn’t actually his. That’s literally what a real man would/should do. Obviously, the part where your girl/wife had a child with another man is massive ammunition against you, but to roast him for actually raising the child is weirdo behavior. It’s like how people got mad at Russell Wilson for being a real man when Future is a low down piece of trash. The glazing of Future in that scenario is so stupid just because your kid likes his step dad more than you. Do better.
Kendrick has Drakes prescription bottle, drake has what appears to be a wedding ring, He also explicitly says Kendrick has dirt but no proof. which shows he knows something. 

Kendrick also contradicts himself saying he doesn't have time to go get dirt, yet comes back with dirt?

You really have to be biased to be taking him at his word. 

If you knew something this level was going on for 12 years and never told any authorities but instead used it for a rap beef, you aint a good person. 

If he thinks sex offenders should die why work with Kodak, or fight for R kellys music to stay up.

If he hates deadbeats why start this on a future album. 

Kendrick has 0 credibility rn. 

We gotta see if anyone comes with evidence
Okay, he has the prescription bottle. Where’s the proof for everything else? Hop of Dot’s nuts and be objective. If Kendrick wants to throw accusations the burden of proof is on him. That birth certificate for the 11 year old better be the cover art for the next track.
I literally said in reply after reply in this thread that both of them have to prove it. Try to hide your bias more next time.
The Drake hate is next level. A lot of people are ready to take everything Kendrick is saying as gospel without the proof. If it’s proven then sure, but until then we can’t just assume.
lol this is such a stupid take. he ain't a messiah.
Eat some veggies after having all that meat in your mouth
This QAnon shit Kendrick Stan's say is weird as hell 
Yeah right… meanwhile Kendrick put Kodak on his album and boosted his status big time lol
I thought, as soon as Drake did Push Ups, we knew this was personal. I think Cole bowing out was real foreshadowing that, like... It's not about the music. Drake took Kendrick's verse on Like That hella personal and this has been something else since Push Ups.

I just feel like, you're watching your boys spar for fun... And then one of them hits too hard... And everyone saw them hit too hard, but it's too late.

It's not about looking cool or tough. It's about hurting someone who hurt you.

That's not really mature and it doesn't put them in their best light, but it's entertaining like blood sport in ancient Rome
Real sanctioned rap battle in the street? The fuck are you from bro?
Literally this. Yet people who swear by kendrick want the soap opera and take out drake once n for all type shit that shit is corny.
Tbf we all know Kendrick would win a freestyle battle. Just compare their freestyles from the past, Drake was straight up reading lyrics in his lol. The current situation is the only way Drake stands a chance.
I don’t listen to either but ya’ll Kendrick mf’s will hear someone say anything remotely good about Drake and start calling glazer. Then proceed to glaze Kendrick over anything.
I'm not glazing either, I like em both equal, I do absolutely fucking hate Kendrick reddit fans tho, so I'm hoping for a Drake win just to see them get sit down, and the prescription suspiciously hides any notable info like which dr prescribed it or anything that could verify it's actually real
I mean you want a video of drake kissing a 17 yo on stage? Just type it in on youtube. Idk why se gotta pretend like he isn’t a pedo. I’m tired of it.
i agree, family matters might not be as disrespectful and exposing as meet the grahams, but to say it’s boring is insane to me. i’m pretty biased towards kendrick in this beef and even i gotta admit, family matters had me hooked from the jump
Calling family matters boring but not that jazz poem Kendrick put out is crazy
Euphoria still the best song out of all of them.
Pretty sure Kendrick addressed this back in like 2014-2015, saying it was false. Whitney and DOT definitely have had issues, but that’s what Mr Morale was about. They’ve both openly talked about going to therapy and fixing their shit.
Didn't reference tracks leak that showed Kendrick writing some of Baby Keem's material? They're probably somewhere online still. Also some other reference tracks came out with Kendrick making other people's songs with that same leak 

I can't remember it well, but it was a year or more back. Maybe it just happened to be reference tracks for something else
Nah hykeezy a prodigy, he wrote section80 when he was like 10 🤯🤯
I didnt take it like that. Maybe Im wrong, but I think he's saying the only songs that bang and the streets love that kendrick releases have keem on them. Like in mr morale, the songs that had keem were more hype. I don't agree with drake but that's how I took it
That part was such a terrible lie. Its not even believable
While I doubt keem ever really "ghost wrote" for dot, I wouldn't be surprised if they were both in studio and keep gave him ideas on a bar or two and Drake took that and stretched it to ghost writing
Why the hell would she mention physical abuse while they’re trying to hide it lol
He said that OVO working for him on 6:16 in La not on Euphoria. But I completely understand you mixing them up because shit been chaotic lol
Drake is alluding to letting his guys spread fake
News To Kendrick but we’re just ignoring that
But when he was hooked up to a lie detector it said he wasn't lying which went against his claim
No we found out it’s Drake’s belongings laid out on the bed with his medicine, the jewelry receipts. We found out the “wedding ring Drake has was a fake” 

whats funny was Drake released a music video, someone who leaked it was probably a music video producer. 

Which Drake film in New Ho King. Kendrick mentioned New Ho King.
I'm still trying to believe this *easy to believe* I don't even know what Compton is but I remember seeing it in a cd store maybe 8 years ago
Yeah family matters was def recorded same time as push ups and doesn’t have anything addressing anything new
And you think Kendrick is done?
It’s a photo he got from someone extremely close to drake. Makes it seem like the rest of his allegations might also be coming from an extremely credible source
Drake apparently. since he was talking about Rick Ross using Ozempic. Now we see he uses it as well, now it's "who tf cares"
and Ambien was the other prescription 😭 so Kendrick was right that drake can't sleep lol
Holy shit
It’s weird that people are treating Drake’s story post like the Gospel. It’s like they didn’t even listen to the end of Kendrick’s track.
![gif](giphy|c51u3TvA5PfOM)

*Duckworth v Graham*
They're THE biggest. Whether you're a fan or not you can't deny either of theirs' success.
Drake is a fuckin joke
What do you mean? Most r/hiphopheads users look like this

![gif](giphy|llKJGxQ1ESmac)
You know how sick of a person you have to be to diss Pharrell Williams. The man made the song called “Happy”

The man is a 2000s mogul
Somebody warned him what was about to go down. Smart move for him to listen.
“Both sides bad” headass wtf are these people talking about 💀
I think he had the heads up from somebody and bowed out when he figured out it was a real beef happening, and not just a numbers boost like a lot of rappers do these days.
That’s true, you’re right. But we do have a limited amount of information about them based on what they have said on the public record. One of them has a distinct history of lying.

That alone doesn’t prove anything. But it’s useful  information for observers that are inevitably making judgments in real time. 
Some people know about the Dre stuff, but he managed to avoid getting situations like this that put his dirty laundry on blast. I'm sure he took shots about it, but not in a public back and forth of this scale.
Bruh are we really debating these 2

Edit: blood didn’t get my comment lol
Kendrick never said Drake was a pedo, he said someone in OVO.
youre right but youre still a fucking piece of garbage if youre a wife beater?
He didn’t claim drake was a pedo though did he? Just said he was paying people in OVO who are (which I am assuming he is talking about Baka but who knows)
J Cole burner account
i’m gonna bumping like 3 out of the 7 tracks for the rest of this year, it’s perfect. Like that, push ups, euphoria
Daylyt the pathological liar
I think Kendrick knew the angles coming, but didn't listen to the whole track. 

Family Matters is entirely focused on destroying Kendrick's family and he did say Drake was trying to destroy families because he never had one. 

It may not be a bar for bar rebuttal, but it is addressed imo. And let's be honest, both Kendrick's and Drake's accusations can't be rebuked in a song, that shit needs a press release with the receipts. 

What I do see if there are other tracks is them flipping the bars at each other.
He addresses everything? Did you listen to the song. And he directly talks about Drake bringing his family into it and that Drake is lying? Or do you want him to say ‘I don’t beat my wife, baby keem don’t write for me and Dave free didn’t f* my wife’

Like he says you lied on good people, he said you lied on the rapper that could have helped you(Kendrick being that rapper), also about drakes family in rebuttal to him talking about his. So I’m not sure what you want?
This is Nas vs Jay all over again.
Drake, lying to control the narrative? Really? That’s hard to believe.. well, not that hard.
Nah, trust a 12 year old baby keem wrote sing about me I'm dying of Thirst in between madden 13 games.
Kendrick made a whole verse based on a 11 year old daughter who’s been hidden lmao
Need a verse for the swiftiessss
the entire rap community just auto sides with kdot which is fine but they’re both airing out dirty laundry lol at the end of the day they may both be jaded after this shit. i’ve always seen the “cole stepped out for a reason” memes as a joke but honestly it’s starting to make sense
One has a reputation for stealing from other cultures and lying, and the other doesn’t. What do you expect?

For me, the nail in the coffin was Drake defending Tory and insinuating that Meg lied. You need help if you believe Tory over Meg.
Also its not like he has photo of drake taking the meds, rather a bottle of meds with drakes name on it. Its all alleging that this is from drakes camp and someone there took these photos, when really it wouldnt be too hard to just fake it and then push the agenda. Either way its fn smart and elaborate which is why I like it, even IF thats a fn lie in itself lmao... drake uses tupac voicechanger, might as well deepfake drake taking ozempic or whatever else. Nothings off limits. Its just weird people think this one rich privileged celebrity is good guy the messiah and other rich privileged celebrity is manifesration of the devil himself lol.. so invested and taking sides based on whatever weird preconceived biases. Most likely both these dudes have plenty skeletons in their closets and just another rich asshole, we dont live in the same world with either of them, theyre not your friends.
They’re Fantano fans, they don’t like drake.
People act like Kendrick is trying to save rap on some corny shit
The pedo angle is even weirder, since Kendricks label was threatening to pull their music if Spotify took down r Kelly songs

Agree with everything you said brother, I just don’t find it entertaining anymore though, could be just me. I’ll still tune in regardless lol because there’s no escaping this wherever you go

Finally... Can't believe ppl are ranking Euphoria in their top 3 of this whole thing. It rly was a jazz poem.
> They’ve both openly talked about going to therapy and fixing their shit.

It's not like Drake to understand a healthy relationship lol
This is exactly why the Drake attacks don’t land with me. Kendrick KNOWS he’s done some terrible things and has talked about them at length, but unlike Drake he had the self-awareness to realize he had a problem and seek help and get his life straight.
Keem woulda been 10 when project 80 came out and 11 when GKMC came out and 12 when TPAB came out lol...  how?
that’s exactly it and drake doesn’t understand 

as someone who left a DV situation, most abusers are unable to take that deep look at themselves and realize what they are perpetuating. then, there ARE people who can look inward and understand why their past and traumas influence their anger and behavior towards people they love, do the work, and heal from it, which is what it sounds like kenny and whitney did through mr morale
[removed]
This was how I took it as well, he was just saying he’s been surpassed and his only relevance at this point is when he is on a track with baby keem.
You're spot on.
Crazy how Baby Keem wrote GKMC when he was 12 🫨
I mean cousins interested in the same field usually like to share ideas. Who wouldn’t want that?
I'm saying why would they hide that specifically but then reveal everything else about the relationship, some of which is UGLY.
I need a full timeline of the songs
then doesnt that mean drakes big gotcha was an IG story post saying he doesnt have a daughter.. i just dont see drake playing 4D chess while having no response ready to meet the grahams

kendrick had correct information about when drake was going to drop and what the drop was going to have on it, why give kendrick this huge advantage even if the kid stuff isnt true - the kid stuff could not be true and it could still be leaked to kendrick without drakes actual disses and release times being leaked to kendrick too
yeah drake for sure told his moles to tell kendrick hes a pedophile. yup sounds about right
This implies Drake is 1 step ahead... doesn't add up.

If he is, he fumbled the bag last night because it's looking real bad rn
Well, this is reddit you see. The people of Reddit find stans of Drake and take it out on Reddit while being Kendrick stans themselves. It’s possible Drake has a daughter and someone in OVO gave Kendrick info about her. And it’s possible Drake gave him fake info so he would use it, then it get debunked and Drake tears him up from there. If Drake fires back by saying, definitively, that he doesn’t have a daughter, then Drake went “all in”. We’ll find out.
Pretty sure Drake doesn't use the Ambien for himself though
What's wild is Drake already revealed on a song with J Cole, Evil Ways, that he can't sleep without drugs:

Zopiclone baby, I can't rest without the sleeping aids
OVO might have a mole working for Kendrick
The true successor
still one of the biggest rappers of the past 15 years
The fuck you posting my picture for
It's either this or kids on TikTok that spams W or L in rap edits, these days they're the majority lol
That’s not even close. I’m way more obese than that.
You're just mad because I talk to hot chicks on the Internet all day
This the two decade hip hop fan glazing his keyboard 😂😂😂
All this cause Birdman didn’t pay him for a beat…
Yeah I feel like Cole was down for "a friendly fade" as Kendrick said, learned it wasn't so friendly, and said fuck that noise
He didn't need a heads up, he said exactly what was going on the world wanted blood. There is no such thing as a friendly rap beef, to win you gotta go low and he didn't want to go low
Some of these Reddit weirdos will… you’d be surprised
He literally points out him being with and around underage girls bruh
drakes been known as a pedo for years outside of this
He didn’t explicitly say it but befriending 14 year olds and fucking them the instant they turn 18 is pedophilia with extra steps
Kendrick said Drake a  nymph ( gooogle nymph) we know about Drake recording his Johnson.  Kendrick said what goes on in the industry and Drake is all for it. Flying women and girls for sex at the age of 37 with a kid. 

And then says they are running a sex ring.
I think there’s a difference between a liar and a troll. Daylyt seem like he says things to just make people mad or just jokes. Akademiks is more like a liar. Claiming he’s got inside info and half of the stuff he says never comes out being true
He says that before Drake even responded. The same thing Drake did on Taylor made lmfao y’all bias is crazy. 

Vaguely accusing people of lying ain’t denying anything
Yeah, let the beef go all the way through.  Kenny fans on here are hero-worshipping.  No death blows yet, they can both say whatever they want but until proof drops, somebody gets humiliated to the point where they shut up, or somebody dies.  

People on here are still convinced that Jay won the battle with Nas.  Not everyone’s worth listening to.
Way bigger. This is Tupac and Biggie times 8

Lmaooo
Kendrick has built his persona as someone who publicly deals with his personal issues and is extremely vulnerable in his music. I think he already addressed mostly everything Drake rapped about in his disses. Kendrick is not going to lose any fans over this, but Drake, who has built his image off of style and vibrato, likely will, especially if any of the serious allegations against him are true. Kendrick started with the high ground.
I love Kendrick but you fans are hypocritical.

Kendrick talked about drake snitching but then says he gets all his information from a snitch inside drake camp. 

Also if you believe Kendrick for his word, he said he was going to run a friendly fade with drake if drake didn't bring up his family .. you mean to tell me you knew someone is a child predator and you are saving that shit for a diss record. That's lame as hell, no self respecting man can rock with that
Kendrick put Kodak on his album. It's not that black and white
This is 100% on point. People aggressively swallowing and defending the narrative of Kendricks inherent moral superiority and Drake suddenly being the worst judas who has ever walked is baffling to me. Especially like you say when literally no one commenting is living in their f'd up world.
Love you too brodie.
Dude if Drake tomorrow shows there's actual proof of Dots label doing damage control for DV you really going to stand by this monster?  


Drake treats women like shit, gambles and is a drunk we know all this for fact.  It's front of everyone constantly.


The real red buttons are proof of DV and legitimate proof Drake fucks girls that aren't legal. 


Treating Kendrick like some industry super hero is just weird right now imo
Are texting Millie Bobby Brown when she was 14. I mean most of what Kendrick is verifiable. There have been women that messed with Drake that said he was abusive, threaten them, and forced them to get abortions.
*with an adult
He wouldn’t know nun bout dat
I think “We Cry Together” gave us the update, but maybe everyone took it as just art?
>healthy relationship

You expect my boi Drake to simp \s
I have so much more respect for Kendrick than Drake because he has always been his authentic self, or at least appears that way. Drake puts on a persona in his music, social media, etc. and I just don’t like it. Either he’s putting on a persona or he’s just a douche but either way
J Cole the only one with decent self awareness and maturity.  This is two dudes going at it for ego and millions of dollars. Nothing more nothing less.
bro is a 🔮prodigy🔮
He obviously has Benjamin button disease with his rap skills and was a 10x better lyricist when he was 10.
I was in a 5 year relationship and it was abusive going both ways, our toxicness bounced off of each other and we treated and spoke to each other like shit. When the relationship finally ended for good, I kept my chin up thinking that she was the problem, after therapy I realized we were mutually responsible for that relationship. I messaged her a couple years ago apologizing for how I was, she never responded, but I felt a weight off my shoulders after that.
Very apparent to anyone that actually works with that population, something like 50% of DV is considered co-battering to put things in perspective.

Not many are actually pragmatic and parrot all kinds of tough guy crap about what they want to do about domestic abuse because the only image of it they can conjure up is a black and white victim and male perpetrator who physically beats their partner regularly. It also makes things harder when they start defending abuse that doesn't fit that narrow definition.

Honestly most of the couples I encounter just need a couple's therapist and rehab, and then their relationships would be just a normal amount of fucky, like the rest of us!
He denied the abuse allegations, which was mentioned in the post you responded to(not saying so maliciously just context).  So doubt that would be on the album.
Maybe cuz it didn’t happen, who knows
[removed]
He's an old soul
You ever seen "Boss Baby"?
Yeah, why leak fake info about hiding a kid when you’ve been proven to hide a kid. Why leak the fact you’re on weight loss drugs when you talked about Ross using weight loss drugs. 

Even if Drake doesn’t have a hidden daughter, 90% of the people who listened to Meet the Grahams, aren’t gonna keep up with the drama after the beef settles.

Unless Drake shows proof he baited Kendrick, then no Instagram caption is gonna deflect what DOT said. And if Drake did bait Kendrick, he’s a fucking idiot for giving him info that destroys his character
Drake, the “master manipulator” said by Kendrick, could be playing 4-D chess. If he is that master manipulator (plus the people around him), he could give Kendrick info on when his track was gonna drop, let Kendrick talk about something not actually real while it being Kendrick’s “kill shot” and it not even be true. After debunked, Drake come out with his own track about being a manipulator.

To clarify, I actually like them both and not a Stan of either. Just want to be witness to something awesome that we’re getting for the first time in my generation. Two of the biggest artists going at each other.
Lmao but who cares about the daughter.. even if that’s made up there were about 10 accusations that were infinitely worse.
Yeah Kendrick was saying something without saying something showing that Ambien on the cover art of a track where he calls Aubrey a pedo and sex trafficker and compared him to Weinstein and Cosby.  Its pretty obvious.

"I don't take them shits but you do, so I get em for you"
He should try some of those nature sounds, headphones n listening to the sound of rain from inside a car does me wonders.

Less people revealing my horrible crimes and using it as cover art too.
Can we call him a mediocre singer instead?
nah..2 biggest L's in history and he isn't even a rapper
😃😃😃
I mean drake said kenny told cole what was up himself so
THIS 👆🏽n we know how that ended. JS
Ouch
nope kendricks wants himself and what stands for to be recognized as relatively supreme- its a truth instinct, not ego or money.
You gonna post the proof of all the stuff Kendrick said then?
Also when there are articles from 2015 about him paying child support for a daughter who he was taking a paternity test for.

If it was bait wouldn't you just post the paternity test?
Right? How is everyone just casually tossing away the fact he got called a pedo, compared to Harvey Weinstein and then kdot predicted a diddy style raid.

Would you really be that surprised to find out these dudes do some fucked up shit with underage girls? It’s been going on too, look up the videos of Nelly talking to that little girl on stage or drake texting 14 y/os with dating advice , creepy af
Probably the same shit Kendrick has been implying in his last 4 songs lol
Zolpidem is a known date rape drug, Kendrick made many references calling out Aubrey’s grooming and sexual predation habits.
100%
I think he struck a chord..

A minorrrrrrrŕrrrrrrrrr
If it was bait I wouldn’t wait for a track to reveal its bait. Guilty until proven innocent in society today, I’d be posting that test immediately
not even implied straight up said it.
Donald Trump Falsely Claims Taylor Swift Has Endorsed Him by Posting AI Images: ‘I Accept’
“Donald Trump has posted a series of AI-generated images on his Truth Social account falsely claiming that Taylor Swift has endorsed him for president.”
This isn't going to end well for him. I'm interested to see if Taylor responds. 
This is really just forcing Taylor’s hand to formally endorse Kamala. Just another stupid move on Trump’s part.

need this energy from her with a response
Regardless of politics, using AI to create a false endorsement ... how did he / his team think that would go over well with Taylor Swift and the Swifties of all people?
What's worrisome is people truly do believe this was Taylor endorsing him. I got a text from a MAGA family member asking if I'd seen the Taylor Trump endorsement, and telling me this is proof Taylor is also MAGA and will swing the election back to Trump.

I really, really hope Tree and/or Taylor say something. This is a bad look and more people than you think are believing it's real.
Donald Trump is about to meet Tree Paine
Taylor literally endorsed Biden when he was running against trump before, why would she just flip and endorse trump all the sudden?
She should come out tonight and dedicate ‘The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived’ to Trump
Remember when he was accusing Harris camp of using AI for crowd size??? AI projection much???
Get his ass, Tree
Is he TRYING to screw his campaign up?
https://preview.redd.it/fj8as1zcunjd1.jpeg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e8691e9b46fdabdec8fca64570130b4c5f058a3

Taylor has spoken out AGAINST Trump numerous times, yet all it takes is one AI image from a *satirical* article for the orange man to believe she supports him? 🫠

I have a feeling this may lead to some sort of litigation against using likenesses in AI images – an already ethical gray area, at best.
I’m curious how Taylor will respond.
I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ORANGE MENACE
If this forces her to speak now and endorse Harris/Walz I hope she does so with her cats by her side. It’d be the perfect clapback at Vance’s “childless cat ladies” dig.
taylor needs to sue him so fast
GET A JOB

STAY AWAY FROM HER
So gross!!! I hope she goes full out for the Kamala endorsement. Would be amazing if it’s at the DNC
I feel like Taylor is 100% going to sue him
There is 0 potential upside to this, this dude is just a raving lunatic.  If you’re a die hard enough Swiftie that her opinion will influence your vote, you also know her stance well enough to know that this is BS.  

I think is genuinely crazy and desperate enough for attention that he wants to believe this.
Non-swiftie political junkie here: most likely Trump is trying to force Swift to endorse Harris now. He likely believes the endorsement is inevitable and wants it done now to avoid Harris getting staggered boosts between now and November. Republican strategy at the moment is based on the assumption that Harris is in a honeymoon phase that will crash down on her before the election. In order to make that more likely they'll do what they can to let Harris get her hype bumps all at once now to, in theory, make the honeymoon hangover disasterous for her.
God, I so want her to sue him!
I loved Eric Swalwell's quote in the [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/us/politics/trump-taylor-swift-ai-images.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EE4.WjIr.krRegWfaGudF&smid=url-share) about this (gift link): 

Representative Eric Swalwell of California, appearing on CNN on Monday, said that the move would backfire on Mr. Trump.

**“This genius, over the weekend, decided to poke the eyes of Swifties and suggest that Taylor Swift is endorsing him,”** Mr. Swalwell said. **“They are going to have a marvelous time ruining everything for Donald Trump over the next 78 days.”**
I hope she sues the f*ck out of him. It’s rumored she may make an appearance at the DNC this week and he’s trying to get in front of that because he knows her influence. Now he’s just pissed off a bunch of Swifties. He’s done.
I fully expect something to happen after Tuesday. Whether it’s legal fillings or something else relating to her telling him to fuck off. Like once she’s on her tour break, I expect the legal knives to come out
I want her to go after him for this and then endorse Kamala so badly
Friendly reminder that Swifites4kamala is a wonderful little corner of instagram and also has a newsletter and a discord
They seem to have forgotten Taylor is a 30 something childless cat lady with  a career profile higher than any man who has the privilege of dating her. 

Like you can't make this up.
#get everyone you know to vote, and check your voter registration regularly (Republicans have been purging voter roles)
It's pretty sad that people who actually believe something like this can vote.
I just want to say that even if Taylor does not endorse anyone in this cycle (I think she will absolutely endorse Kamala Harris), as Swifities, we should absolutely organise against this racist, patriarchal, pathological, rapist. He does not stand for our values and no way does he stand for Taylor's values either. We will never stand for someone like Donald Trump and it's insulting that he is lying on our behalf. If you're a real Swiftie, you wouldn't vote for a rapist. Period. He's just a sick, weird and pathetic man.
It's so funny because one of the screenshots he posted literally has a "satire" tag on it
So...she's gonna say something, right? I keep seeing a lot of 'this won't end well for him' sort of posts, but this happened a day ago, and she still hasn't said anything about this. Lots of MAGA believe this is real...
I fully expect her to endorse Kamala and tbh I really hope the rumors are true about her doing the DNC with Beyonce.
Dear community let’s defeat this liar.
brainless twitter users are about to have a field day with this article… hopefully someone on Taylor’s team can make a statement about this. 

Also what’s crazy is that there will be actual people who will believe the AI post…
Well, this should do it… he’s at the FAFO stage.  

If I were Taylor, I would be livid, based on what we know of her prior endorsements.
Please nail him in court omg
I'm going to wager that someone used Grok 2 to generate the pics (because there are FA word filters in the chat-bot). 

If there was any justice, TAS would sue both the campaign \*and\* Musk.
He is unhinged. I mean seriously if he is going to these lengths to lie... just imagine. He's totally deranged.
This isn't going to end well for him. I imagine she's already got her lawyers working on a Cease and Desist statement. And most likely she'll endorse Kamala once the tour is on break.
Only a deluded septuagenarian shitgibbon would think for a moment that Taylor Swift would endorse him for anything. At some point in the election Taylor will endorse Kamala Harris. In the meantime she will encourage her fans to vote in the sure knowledge that Swifties already know her views.

To be honest given the fact that most Swifties will probably vote Democrat anyway there is one person who's should worry Trump more if he endorses Harris. Travis Kelce.
It’s sad that I can actually 113% believe his supporters falling for it🥴
She literally hates tr*mp with a passion and he knows it. I hope her team fucking sues him. And I’m excited to see her official endorsement of Kamala. Childless cat ladies for Kamala 2024!!!
Last week Trump was saying that Kamala was using AI to doctor images of crowd size and she should be disqualified for cheating because of it. Now this. File under you cannot make this  BS up.
ah, yes. 

because the biggest musical artist on the planet is totally going to risk permanently damaging her reputation by endorsing a twice-impeached convicted criminal, bigot, and overall serial loser. makes total sense, folks.
Delusional to think Taylor Swift, a smart driven strategic woman in her mid-thirties would vote for MAGA. I wonder if and if yes at what time she’ll endorse the democratic ticket. I think the most strategic decision would be to wait till 1 week before the election to be able to get that last push out in case Harris/Walz stop flying as high as they are now. Right now they really don’t need Taylor’s endorsement but we don’t know what will happen in the next 80+ days. A new GOP VP pick might be in the future and if it’s a woman there will be a different dynamic than right now. I secretly hope the endorsement if needed comes with a new single but that’s probably a long shot.
I hope Taylor sues his fat, juggly, diapered ass.
He was leading in polls, then Biden dropped out and Kamala got nominated and now he is behind in most polls beyond the margin of error including in most swing states, makes sense why he's freaking out and doing things like this, after all what do you expect from a wannabe dictator?
“I think she’s beautiful — very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she’s liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump. I hear she’s very talented,” he said. “I think she’s very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!”

WHAT THE FUCK DUDE this man is so fucking weird! Why are women only beautiful or ugly to this guy? It's like thats all he knows, are they hot or not? No idea about personality or the person, just are they hot or what ?

WEIRD
i'm thinking they're trying to push Taylor into endorsing Harris now rather than closer to the election when it will have a greater impact.
I remember seeing the articles about this “endorsement” and thinking there’s no way that’s real. The fact that he himself is creating these lies is scary. I hope Taylor sues him for that
I hope she sues, or at least VERY publicly denounces this every way possible.
I think Trump knows he's going to lose so he's just trying cause as much chaos as possible.
back to say can we please get footage of Taylor and Tree and her team finding out he did this bc I want to see the seething rage I'm pretty sure Taylor would have spewed fire.
So now "childless cat ladies" are suddenly cool with the Trump team? And proudly sharing that a "childless cat lady" endorsed him? This is honestly just too stupid, even for Trump. If anyone actually believes this is true, they have issues. 


 Let's go Taylor, time to activate and put him back in his place 💪🏻 I'd be sick if it was me and he was using my image for his pathetic campaign.


🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
I hope she sues him. And gets AI laws put in place.

And I hope she speaks out supporting Kamala. And we'd love it in Tennessee if she supported Gloria Johnson so we could be rid of Marsha Blackburn.
I believe this was done on purpose. Taylor swift is the biggest star in the US currently. Kamala has enough momentum at the moment, but it will die a little bit with time. Taylor swift holding her endorsement until closer to election day, to re-energize the base was probably Kamala’s goal. Now they are forcing Taylor Swift to come out now. And then Trump will drown the media with another big scandal and all the momentum that Kamala could have gained by the endorsement is wasted now instead on election day
Will she deny it?
I would be incredibly shocked if Taylor’s lawyers weren’t already all over this.
May every pre-purchase of Rep TV (I’m clowning hard ladies) include a donation to the Harris campaign 🙌🏻
Taylor has “Fuck You” money in a Trump can no longer compete against. She’s gonna wreck him.
I rather fuck with the CIA than TaylorSwift legal team.
Tree probably: hold my beer
Any idiot who believes this already wasn't voting for Harris.
Corey Lewandowski just rejoined the Trump campaign.  This has the "Corey Lewandowski" feel to it,  he's an absolute creep that had an affair with puppy killer Kristi Noem.
She needs to speak and set the record straight
Who's Donald Trump anyway? Ew.
Imma need Miss Americana to log on to her socials asap
https://preview.redd.it/lgra8b5ksojd1.jpeg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42376d830b344f71e5b3db002d6582c5b796b179

he wants to pretend this never happened ig
i truly do hope she speaks out about this
I've always defended Taylor when she decided to remain silent, but Tree has to be planning something real quick. Some people are too gullible and this is the sort of fake news that spreads quickly and affects her own image directly. Even if she decides to do the Kamala endorsement later.
She should sue his broke ass.
Is this illegal right?
She needs to come out swinging on this one and shut it down. That’s the only way it will stop
He’s stirring a stick in the bees nest. He better be prepared for a swarm.
Not a good idea to piss off Taylor’s fans
She really needs to address how obsessed he is with her. It’s creepy.
Ohh, this is very bad, I fear some people might actually believe this.
he's an unbridled POS and i hope she buries him.
it is illegal in Tennessee to use AI-generated likenesses of celebrities for false things like this. He is literally breaking the law in her home state by doing this. Taylor NEEDS to put a stop to this.
It’ll be a cold day in hell before Taylor supports trump 🤦🏼‍♀️
Wooow. Taylor Swift really lives rent-free in Trump’s head. 🤣 I’m not surprised people believe the endorsement is real, but really if you know anything about Taylor you know there is absolutely zero chance she would endorse Trump.
Oh man. Came here to see the Swiftie backlash and you all did not disappoint. 

Bros poking the bear lol
Hope she takes his ass to court for this
she should just tweet one word .... "ew."
This truly is the darkest timeline. Can someone stop this fever dream?
He's so weird
Change finally as a surprise song as an Easter egg she’ll make it to the DNC on Thursday?????? 🤡
Change was one of the secret songs tonight. If that’s not a message idk what is!
Whoever made that meme is probably rock hard
I feel like this must be so stressful like she was literally just the target of a terror attack and I didn’t expect her to make any political statements until the tour was over….. I hope she just drops “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.”
“After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’???” Swift wrote. “We will vote you out in November.”


Yes we will
Not all Swifties endorse trump, only the ones with six fingers on each hand and fused limbs.
A lot of you aren’t realizing that he broke several laws doing this, and she might not immediately respond because her lawyers are gearing up for something. 

Mother is intelligent, she will do what’s best 💅
"KEEP MY ~~WIFE~~  MOTHER NAME OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MOUTH"
Donald Trump likes my music 25% less now.
FUCK THE PATRIARCHY
AI. Funniest thing ever. Trump is such a fool, and this makes him and his campaign look like morons.
What a hilarious way to force her to come out and clarify that she does not support him.

This man does not think. I swear he runs on pure dumb luck. Sad that it’s worked for as long as it has.
don't mess with a childless cat lady, dude. JD tried it, now you're about to learn the hard way, too.
a presidential candidate of one of the most powerful countries in the world is using AI images for his campaign. pathetic
This makes me think of that show she did and that actor fella said something and Taylor was like “ohhhhhhh we don’t wanna do that”. Plz tell me someone knows what I mean!!!! I can’t remember any names of the other ppl
He's just asking to be sued (again). Not that she'd get any money out of him, but it'd be kind of hilarious watching her lawyers dog walk him all over a court room.
I’m shocked Taylor Nation hasn’t issued anything. Not saying she had to publicly endorse Harris, but she needs to shut this down fast.
I think he knows the Harris campaign is saving her endorsement to counter whatever the Trump campaign’s “October” surprise is and trying to get them to play their hand earlier
Big mistake
Trump is using AI now, to blame AI later for a "rigged" election.
2024
photoshop = AI
What % of Swifties are also Conservatives that will fall for this lie?
She’s definitely going to do something. If not I don’t want to hear shit in the future about anyone using as for her voice and what not to make money. 
What a desperate weirdo
Is he stupid enough to think that’s a real picture? I bet so.
What a weirdo.
Get'em Girl!
At  least they’re not starting the holy war or whatever 🙄🫠
For one image they snipped a satirical article and used it.  Know how i know?  Because it has a big red box on it that says SATIRE.
I’m actually wondering if he’s trying to force her hand. Not knowing for sure which way Travis leans politically, plus knowing swift endorsed Biden but hasn’t spoke up on Kamala maybe he is trying to stir something up with this.
Weird how they accuse the left of being the liars and cheats.
This is how you make Taylor Swift endorse a candidate. 

And I don’t think Diaper Don is going to be happy with her choice.
I'm just curious WHERE people want her to say something?  If the problem is that your MAGA family members believe this, then they are on truth social, trump's own platform, because that is where he posted this.  If she says something someplace else, they won't see it.  They watch Newsmax and are on Truth Social.  Where are they going to see her pushback?  Do you want her to join Trump's platform?  Because if she did MILLIONS would follow, and that is all money for him.  Taylor joining truth social even to make ONE post, would be putting money directly into Trump's coffers.

I'm sorry your family members are in a cult, but there is no way to break through to them now.  It's too late.  I believe Taylor was ALWAYS going to endorse Kamala, but that is all strategic in conjunction with the Harris campaign.  they do not want to step all over the convention messages this week.   She will, at a time and place of her, and of Kamala Harris' choosing.  In the meantime, the lunatic has once again forced something upon a woman without her consent.  That is where your outrage should be, not yelling Taylor needs to speak now, I demand it.  That's how I see it.
I don't think she will personally resond. She will just hire a expensive lawyer that will issue a cease and desist.

We all know the Taylor who is political died some years ago.
Taylor Swift needs to address this situation directly and publicly. Donald Trump is not just any C-list celebrity; he was the President of the United States, and unfortunately, his words hold weight for many, regardless of their truthfulness. 

My 10-year-old brother, who idolizes Taylor and comes from a Trump-supporting family, is highly vulnerable to this type of false propaganda. When he sees these misleading claims, it becomes a battle of my word against that of a former president. Taylor allowing her publicists to address this quietly in a magazine article simply isn’t enough. 

She has a massive platform and the power to set the record straight in a way that her fans—especially young ones—will understand and believe. Staying silent or taking a low-profile approach only gives credibility to the lies and allows them to spread unchecked. 

Taylor needs to stand up and speak out, making it unmistakably clear that these claims are false. The truth matters, and so does her voice in defending it.
Just another day of a man trying to ride a woman’s wave of success.
She's absolutely gonna come out and endorse Harris now
Mother NEEDS to speak up now 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ewwwww!
I think Travis should step up and defend his lady - forcefully.

Or, maybe Taylor can sue him for 1B$ - she is worth a lot and it can be argued that being connected to the asshole will make her have a whiff of shit, therefore he should compensate her.

The man is sooooo FUCKING STUPID!
Wow.  The Orange Potato is getting desperate.
Somebody make me a “Swifties for Trump for prison” t shirt
So do we think she's going to say something? I get that there are safety concerns when it comes to publicly making statements but I think a lot of people will swiftly lose respect for her if she stays silent on this, especially after her ardent support for Biden in 2020.
lol and watch Taylor sue the hell out of trump. Unlike the New York court Taylor actually will eat Trump alive literally and demand major compensation
Okay but why can’t I find the images
Didn’t Taylor diss Trump? I am pretty sure I saw her talking about not liking Trump. I know it was from her documentary Americana
She should sue
I hope she says something to clear the air. Would be the responsible thing to do. The earlier you nip this kinda shit in the bud the better. Ancient orange is trying to muddy the waters.
https://preview.redd.it/nntp6sxy4ojd1.jpeg?width=1142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10001f6afe248e43f407fc457d347aae77702776

GAG! This will not play out well for him.
Such an insecure little snowflake.
I hope Taylor says something. Some people will actually think it's real.
I don't really care if Taylor endorses Kamala or not, but if she comes out against Trump after this stunt, it will be even more detrimental to Trump.
I hope Taylor’s team is typing down a cease and desist to bring that post down.
I think the majority of people will know better. Taylor was very outspoken on Trump, and I doubt his supporters care. He's reaching atp. But if she endorses Kamala soon, it'll help a lot.
Sue him
I really hope this means Taylor will endorse Kamala now
No way!!
For those looking for the original truth social post: https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112984762512136574

Edit: didn't want to editorialize.
Just to verify this, where was this originally posted? Just curious because I want to know how bad this is going to go for him if it's true.
Donald Trump is weird. Taylor and is swifties would never…
And you know, I hope Taylor’s team goes after him with the fire of a thousand suns and sues the pants off of him and gets him tied up in so much litigation his head spins. On top of what he’s already facing. I hate AI being used in the media and I hate him. I’m not sorry. This is outrageous. After he had the nerve to make the comments he did last election because she didn’t support him. No way. This is ridiculous.
No damn way ‼️‼️😡😡
Make him pay Swifties in the voting booth.
He's gonna force her to call him out lol he does himself no favors lol
Bahaha I guarantee she hates his guts. I hope she shoots this down quick. Everything this man says is a lie.
I bet she met up with lawyers already.
![img](emote|t5_2rlwe|1070)
lol it’s obvious someone showed AI to trump two weeks ago
“I think this is a great idea!” 💀
This is probably him trying to get back at her because she allowed Kamala to use her music at a rally the other day. But it is not going to end well for him as you say lol
Still, sitting at the corner…
She had her lawyers on the phone before the first article about this dropped
He openly made fun of a disabled journalist and was still elected back in 2016. He feels untouchable because he is untouchable.
She may let her lawyers respond for her.
Vogue has already released an article saying “no, she doesn’t.” So I’m wondering if they are watching to see how strong the public reacts. If I was in her shoes, I would want to see how this plays out. Not because of being yes/no towards Trump, but simply because of it being AI and how the public reacts in these moments. 

https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-political-history
Yup. But also to poison the well so that when/if Taylor's endorsement does come, people will doubt the validity of it. Gross, arsehole behaviour. 

Also, I hope she sues him. Not that he has any money left after all the lawsuits.
since taylor was expected to endorse kamala anyways, it's probably a move to force the endorsement earlier and overshadow the DNC. endorsements should be spread out to built hype towards election day
Based on Taylor’s past endorcements, Taylor was likely going to endorce Kamala at some point- she usually waits until closer to election day. However, I would not shocked if she spoke up earlier because of this.

Edit: spelling
I think they’re trying to force her hand in doing it early, so they may run a smear campaign the next two months. 

They’re deathly afraid of her endorsing Kamala in October.
Could also be a way to force her to endorse Kamala before the date it is actually planned to endorse her.
My first thought as well. She may have never weighed in, which is her right, but now she will have to and it will dominate the news cycle for days. Geez, he’s so dumb.
Or not. Maybe it's an excellent way to endorse Kamala without endorsing Kamala. By suing Trump or sending C&D, Taylor could create huge amount of publicity in Kamala's favor. And then endorse her in October
Or she was already planning on endorsing and Trump’s team found out and this is a really dumb way for them to co-opt the narrative
The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now tho :(
They clearly have a very low opinion of the vast majority of voters and think as long as they can dupe just enough of them, it could swing things their way.
>Regardless of politics

it IS politics, just very very dirty tactics

Some people have pointed out in this thread what this can accomplish for him/his campaign. It convinces some dumb voters that its a real endorsement (especially if they just read about it and dont see the pic)

It keeps his name at the front of the news cycle while DNC and Kamala's bus rally is starting

Forcing Taylor to say something but even if she endorses Kamala, Maga can muddy the waters saying its not true

Distract from Project 2025 agenda being compared to Kamala's policies. Damage control



And to your point, it doesn't matter to him what Swifties think. His whole game since 2016 has been rage bait
AI should not be allowed to be used in election campaign materials.
It reeks of pure desperation at this point. There was no thought process. They severely underestimated the fallout and push back this is going to cause, not only from Taylor’s team but the fans. Big delulu energy.
Well he is already accusing her of using AI photographs when the events are freaking live-streamed. He’s grasping at his smaller turnouts and Kamala has been good at not taking his bait.
It’s only going to get worse In The future.  I’m genuinely worried because soon we won’t be able to tell AI from real images
It's like that kid in school who clearly didn't read the book and decided to use spark notes verbatim to write the report not thinking the teacher would notice. Come on man, are you that unaware?
I think it’s kind of  two fold. They think her fans are still fifteen years old but that hasn’t really been the case since about 2010. Her fans are college educated women in their 20s and 30s which is not a group the GOP does well with to put it lightly.

There’s also a misconception among a lot of conservatives that people get more conservative as they age. That’s not true. Your birth year is one of the biggest indicators of party affiliation and party affiliation stays with most people their whole lives. They may change some around the edges but most people don’t go from being liberal to conservative or vice versa.


Millennials are democrats because they came of age in the late Clinton years when the economy was on fire and the Bush years. As recently as 2000, Democrats best group was people over the age of 60 because those people grew up under Roosevelt . Younger Boomers have been republicans their whole lives because they grew up in the 60s which were very tumultuous and the 70s when the economy sucked.
Some of it's not even AI.  They snipped a satirical article and used it.  Know how i know?  because it has a big red box on it that says SATIRE.
I'm sure there are Republican/conservative Swifties that will fall for this.
He already has 34 charges, I doubt they even thought of the consequences
trump thinks all his supporters are so dumb and gullible they will believe anything he says, he doesnt care if he literally generates fake ai content because his base will believe him without doubt. they treat him like a god, its insane
Thinking?

Team must comply orders, there is only one person thinking 

Not the brightest
it's so troubling to me that a presidential candidate can post AI images and it's just... fine? I don't think it should be allowed. Maybe get some campaign laws going or something but it's so so so scary imo
I agree. I saw this posted somewhere else and I wanted to make sure it got to this sub so maybe people will know it’s nonsense before people start asking about it.
Bad actors have been testing AI-assisted disinformation as a political tactic in several elections around the globe the past few years and I get the sense that the 2024 US election is the big test. 

They don't actually care if Trump wins or loses this election - they're using his campaign as an experiment to see how effective AI-assisted disinformation is, what works and what doesn't, and how different segments of the population respond to different types of disinformation.
Taylor *has* to release a statement imo. Her endorsement of Biden in 2020 did not happen until
October of that year, but this is getting out of control, so I think releasing a statement sooner rather than later would be prudent.

But certainly she is not obligated to do so, but this AI fakery demands a response.
Those people believe ANYTHING it’s unreal.
People will believe this 100% especially if she doesn’t say anything in response.
Is your family member visually impaired? That was clearly an AI image of Taylor lol
have you seen all the articles (like this one!) talking about this, and how awful it is... That is tree saying something.
To be honest MAGAts are beyond saving. They are determined and will never not vote for the demented nut job. They aren't swing votes so they hardly matter in that sense.
They are leaving a whole lot of space for people to run with shit. Her silence isn’t exactly silent at this point.
These people are stupid enough to believe anything - not sure what Taylor can do about that. Even if she denies it and endorses Kamala they won't believe it.
Yes, she now needs to say something. It’s forcing her hand (and honestly, good).
But have you heard anything like that from people who _arent_ MAGA? 

MAGA were always going to fall for this, unwittingly or otherwise. The good news is that they’re a minority electorate and don’t matter much in the end. It’s the people who haven’t decided how they feel yet that we need to worry about with stunts like this.
They need to not only put out a statement but threaten to sue Trump as well. Lawsuits are the only thing he understands.
I saw the post and there is no Taylor endorsement. It’s all AI photos of women wearing “Swifties for Trump”. There was also an Uncle Sam type photo made with AI that has Taylor pointing and the caption around it says something about voting for Trump.
Taylor may not have endorsed trump but her tax address is in TN isn’t it? That should tell you something 🤷‍♀️
I hope she comes out and endorses asap too. I recently heard some very impressive poll numbers on the influence she has with Democrat, independent, AND Republican likely voters- saying that they’ll vote for whoever she endorses. I wish I could find the poll, but if those numbers are accurate, she literally has the power to sway the election. That just blows my mind!
Taylor is definitely going to say something by election day, no need to worry
They really do just believe everything they see right? But when there’s proof right in front of their face for something they don’t agree with it’s “fake news”.
Well this might force Taylor’s hand to endorse Kamala! I wasn’t sure if she would while on tour.
That fat piece of shit has been allowed to invent his own reality for 7 decades.
The top left image on the official post he made even has the word "Satire" highlighted 😭 the delusion
She has to come out and rectify this
I wouldn’t worry. The only ones believing it are the MAGA crowd. And she did endorse Biden in the last election, she just did it closer to the election.
How do we know that she won't?
Yes especially since trump supporters already is quite stupied so ofc they would blindly believe it 😛
God how are people so DUMB? It’s mind boggling. Insane that this is our electorate.
The MAGA people will believe it but less likely anyone else with deductive reasoning abilities will. Highly doubt it’s persuading Swift fans.
I'm of two minds on this one. This is what Trump does. He flings shit around and people get covered in shit and they fling shit back and reporters cover the shit-slinging, all the while Trump, who doesnt care about being bathed in shit, gets talked about, which is what he wants.
There’s a reason Trump loves the “poorly educated”.
I hope taylor’s lawyers or someone on her team sees this! This is anecdotal evidence that they can actually use in court.

Maybe you should email her PR person or somebody

Like seriously, this sub is the first time i am seeing people talk about family members believing trump’s tweet, all the other subs is just hoping that Taylor will sue, but not actually showing impactful damage from the tweet. They can use this.
and if Taylor does say something, do you think your MAGA family member is going to see that? That's the problem.
The repubs MO right now is to just spam it until it "becomes" true. They have their channels for propaganda, with no quality control. It's their way of brainwashing.
I hope they sue his ass. That's ridiculous
I wonder if she envisioned one day she'll have to craft a response to the former president
I'm here from /r/all, why does everyone keep talking about a tree

is that a taylor swift alter ego or smth
She wouldn’t but there are still a large amount of Republicans who want to claim her as their own because she started in Country.
I mean I ask myself the same thing about J. D. Vance and all his previous opinions about Trump
They're claiming it's because of the attempted ISIS attack. Which makes no sense if you think about it for a second (what does a terrorist attack in Austria have to do with the US president???) but that's what they're running with.
MAGAs aren’t too smart and don’t think too critically about things like this. That’s why this is gaining so much traction with them right now.
I guess back then she also spoke on progressive topics fairly often. Given she no longer does that, the public could likely easily believe she has changed her  views
People really are that stupid to believe that
He honestly makes Ratty look like a reasonably decent person.
Omg - this would be amazing!
It's intentional. 

By polluting the social media and media landscape with disinformation, they can craft the narrative that *all* political information is disinformation. They're priming people to expect to be lied to and to therefore choose who they prefer to be lied to by.
He’s trying to dominate the news cycle again and distract from Harris’ momentum and his upcoming sentencing. He doesn’t care how he does it.
I mean, if she doesn’t come out against it, this can’t hurt him. Plenty of conservatives and people with low media literacy skills are already falling for it. This election is much closer than most folks on Reddit seem to realize. Even a small percentage of votes matter.
He has been doing that anyway by using personal attacks against Kamala Harris. He is already behind in most polls well beyond the margin of error
He doesn’t care if he wins cuz he’s gunna pretend it was “stolen” regardless 🫠
I hope so because if she sues then the likelihood of something being done about it goes up
The best is that the post he made SAYS SATIRE
I miss her having this energy. I hope it comes back. Her influence is so incredibly powerful.
Lawsuit, hopefully
A lawsuit would just be to make a point (which is fine, we know Taylor loves a symbolic lawsuit). But I think it would be much less time consuming for her just to endorse Kamala. But who knows, this might piss her off enough to do something truly hilarious
Great idea.
[deleted]
She is not going to make an appearance at the DNC, especially after the terror threats and the state of our union. She is likely going to stay as far away from the DNC as possible
Swifties about to use those Rep TV detective skills to drum up some insane oppo; within 24 hours we'll probably find out his name's not even Donald.
I just wanna watch Taylor v. Trump, please let this happen. Imagine if there was an "OJ glove" moment. 🍿🍿
I agree I think once the European leg is over there are moves to be made.
I’d like to also add that I find it odd that this story not only wasn’t at the tippy top of this sub, but that this post is new, while this story was circulated widely yesterday. Very sus IMO.
Yeah I’m not super confident she will and it’s really disappointing to be honest. I know for a fact members of my family will believe her silence is an admission she just doesn’t want to say it out loud but they believe she is a huge Trump fan.
I mean they can believe whatever they want. It's not like people on truth social were going to vote for Harris previously
Dude stuff takes time. She’s not simply going to refute it. She will demolish him.
Nothing will happen. Taylor is not political anymore, there will be a cease and desist and a deletion that's it.
I fucking hope so!!!
Yes, I suspect that this kind of stuff is why Grok was released without much by way of guardrails…
Please don’t call Trump a shitgibbon.  Gibbons are an endangered species who have done nothing to deserve such a demeaning comment.
You forgot civilly-liable sexual assaulter.
I think more than 1 week would be necessary. States require you be registered a certain amount of time in advance, and if her endorsement convinces unregistered people to vote, she knows they’ll need more than 1 week! We never know what her timeline for anything is. Cough Reputation cough 😂
Like @iloveebunmies said there is registration deadlines in some states.  But another factor is most states have a way to vote early or by my mail that allows campaigns to bank votes and reduce congestion at the polls.  I expect an endorsement between 8/21 and her first show back.  At very least, we’ll get a post by mid September telling people to register to vote. 
Trump : They are using AI generated images (they weren't) and should be disqualified for election interference!

Also Trump : I'm going to use AI generated images in attempts of election interference, for which I am still waiting to be sentenced.

How he continues for get away with so many things should be one of the mysteries of the world.
Exactly! So staying quiet and going for cease and desist is the absolute right strategy here!
Last time she tried that Marsha Blackburn won. Republicans pounced on Taylor being an out of touch rich celebrity.
Loveeee this!! Wish it could be real.
I don’t think she will.
It’s definetly in a legal grey area. I suppose she could go for unauthorized use of likeness. But I believe his team didn’t create the AI, and he was reposting something someone else made. I think a lawsuit could certainly set some sort of legal precedent for AI.
And also very dangerous.
Travis was a spokesperson for the Covid vaccine. I think it’s safe to assume which way he leans politically…

reminds me of that funny quote

"And Putin said, 'No way!'

And I said, 'Way.'"
What song was approved?
using AI images of celebrities for political gain like this is actually illegal in Tennessee. She may genuinely have grounds to take him to court in her home state for this.
she should have a right to do a controlled demolition of his hotel building
Sue him anyways out of principle. It's not like Taylor needs his filthy money anyways.
But now she’ll be ruthless about it. And she’ll serve the endorsement in the form of *Karmala*
Right she should be taking that JD Vance shit personally lol
I can understand why Taylor hasn't been super outspoken about politics in the past, and I also get why she might still feel hesitate after Southport right into Vienna. 


But... holy shit, this has got to be the last straw, right? I would love if she just came out SWINGING with it. I would be furious in her shoes. Even as a businessperson (which Taylor puts above the personal stuff a lot of the time), this is approaching defamation vis-a-vis her personal brand.
I think she will wait a while due to the tour. Or that was originally the plan. She might now because he did this.
Which is why she’s going to wait to speak out publicly (her lawyers on the other hand…)
Yeah if she was going to endorse her, it would be a few weeks out from voting date. It would be all over the world, it would be wall to wall news. 

Even if she endorses Kamala now as a response to this, the titles will be "Swift endorses Kamala after Trump AI fake". You're still seeing Trump mentioned, it feels inauthentic, and it's going to lose its power with voting day still being months away. 

Hate the guy, but this is a ridiculously good political play.
Well the Trump base clearly aren’t the brightest voters…
True, this is easy to refute but scary to think if it was a more convincing deepfake
100% did not mean to downplay the dangerous intentions of using fake images ... I just wonder if Taylor sets the record straight what % of her fanbase especially as young women may have leaned one way and could actually be shifted if she does speak on it
I think it also points to how poorly educated his followers are and low they think of women. They think we just flock wherever Taylor goes and that’s not true.
True, maybe they were trying to have a Brat moment and did not think it through?
He was ranting that Kamala should be disqualified for that (even though she didn't use AI)... it's wild how consistent he is with projection. He *always* accuses other people of shit he's either already done or plans to do soon
He’s gotten away with worse crimes than this why wouldn’t he break more laws?
Oh this is 100% illegal.
Yep; that's why she basically needs to address this....probably force her hand on some statement about recent events actually too since the magas are tying her "endorsement" to the southport and vienna plot. (Source: I live in AL and it was already non ironically on my instagram feed this morning). This isn't the time to say nothing and assume it will go away.
They are voting for Trump for the third time they are clearly not the brightest!
Some people, esp older people with no digital literacy, are either stupid or uneducated enough to believe that Ai pictures are real 

Hell Danny Gonzalez made an entire video about [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C6L07VdZO4o)
[deleted]
The average Facebook user might not be able to tell though
They believe because they want to believe. It's also what allows them to ignore every offensive comment or action by Trump. Believing and ignoring any logical opposition is easier than rethinking their entire belief system. And most don't even realize it's happening.
I'm visually impaired and could tell it was AI! Also, love that you said visually impaired instead of blind!❤️
Seemingly, no one over the age of fifty can recognize AI produced images.
Publications write articles. Taylor is a massive celebrity and Tree is not behind the curtains of everything written about her. Even in major magazines.

Plus, Tree knows this is a big deal and I don’t think her attempt at setting the record straight would be with Variety magazine. This is a presidential candidate with an extremely loyal fanbase doctoring photos. I hope in such a serious situation for her client, this wouldn’t be a PR person’s idea of “saying something.”
I think this is Variety arguing it's not a real endorsement, but I don't think this is Tree saying anything (yet). They said they reached out to her team but didn't hear anything. And the MAGA in my family, and I'm sure many others, will just call this Fake News and will believe the endorsement is real until a correction comes directly from Taylor or her publicist.
If Tree were saying something, she would… just say it. Not everything has to be a clue or a hidden message.
That is kind of you to assume MAGA supporters read articles.
She needs to sue for defamation
Nope, that’s not enough. It needs to be an official statement from Team Taylor, not vague hints from sources.
Taylor needs to cut the shit and come out with a proper, verified statement saying it’s not true.
don't crucify me, who/ what is tree?
IMO that's just the media doing their usual fan service for everything The Donald does.
Yeah I think people underestimate how many undecided voters are still out there. And how many stupid Americans there are
“Taylor Swift wants you to vote for trump” was an attempt to make it look like she had endorsed him. And of course it is very obvious that it is AI, but some people believe anything.
By election day it will be too late. In this day and age if the lie is repeated enough it gets set in people's minds as truth so that when the truth comes out people gloss over it because they've already moved on. 

We're currently in the "repeating lie" phase where it can still be killed. But thw window will be closing.
Yeah, I don’t understand the panic. No one is going to switch their vote to Trump because they think Taylor’s going to vote for him. Anyone who cares so deeply that they’re *willing* to switch votes based on their favorite celeb already knows everything about said celeb, including how Taylor feels about him, as she made perfectly clear in 2020 when she went after him on Twitter and in Miss Americana, while publicly endorsed Biden/Harris with the cookie picture and in the V Magazine interview, where she said:

“The change we need most is to elect a president who recognizes that people of color deserve to feel safe and represented, that women deserve the right to choose what happens to their bodies, and that the LGBTQIA+ community deserves to be acknowledged and included. Everyone deserves a government that takes global health risks seriously and puts the lives of its people first. The only way we can begin to make things better is to choose leaders who are willing to face these issues and find ways to work through them.

“I will proudly vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in this year’s presidential election. Under their leadership, I believe America has a chance to start the healing process it so desperately needs.”

We need to calm down 😅. Don’t discredit the intelligence of her fan base. No one gives AF what MAGA thinks, the deep core of that base is walking around with cups of what they claim to be JD Vance’s sperm.

well they had discussions about trump in miss Americana, so I think she might have envisioned it... but she might have not envisioned it happening in 2024.
tree is taylor’s publicists
I know many die hard republicans and Taylor swift fans who genuinely wanted Taylor swift to run for president.  Makes me wonder if they just missed or misunderstood a few major songs of hers.
And because she is white, blonde and “aryan.”
https://preview.redd.it/pxw1gi4s8ojd1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8331817a426cba7add444364b74999fd044064e

Using an article clearly labeled satire 😅

Like there’s literally no way to reach some people
This is my first time hearing that, but the idea is probably that after experiencing a terrorist threat she realized that some problems can only be solved by men with guns and so she flipped to the white-men-having-guns party because democrats lack the will to do what is necessary when it’s staring them in the face, opting to find a feel-good solution to everything.

None of that is true, of course, but it plays nicely into the stereotypes of right-wing propaganda.
I agree, especially with the NFL of it all. Like her boyfriend's employer (the Hunt family) are big Trump supporters, and Taylor has been hanging around some MAGAs lately, like Miranda & Summit Hogue. Plus people have always suspected the Mahomes are too although idk if they've come out and said it. 

Personally I don't doubt that she's still a Democrat, but I can see why some people might be wondering if her political leanings have shifted at all over the last year or so
One of the very few people who can
That's exactly how russian disinformation works as well. The main idea is to make people believe that reality either doesn't exist or cannot be known. Flooding the informational space with contradictory shit nonstop is a big part of it and whether or not a single lie is believable or not doesn't really matter. They just keep lying until any kind of rational public discourse isn't possible anymore.
Yep, anyone who would be offended by this wasn't voting for him anyway. It's how he gets away with all this stuff, not having to appeal to decent people.
Which might be enough for him to claim it as such.
One one image out of 4 and the word just happens to be the smallest word on the entire image lol.
Assuming that Taylor does indeed support Harris, i agree that right now she should disavow this fake endorsement and clarify that she is not endorsing Trump. Then she should avoid the matter until mid-late October and release a surprise endorsement of Harris which would giver her exactly the kind of staggered boost that Trump is dreading
I don’t know I’ve heard rumblings that she and Beyoncé will have some sort of presence. It could be via video.
Terror threats?!

Edit: Holy shit https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/08/08/politics/democratic-convention-target-extremists
I can’t even tell you how delighted I would be if Swifties caused the ultimate demise of that vile piece of trash.
I agree. I’m not joined in this sub, but I searched “trump” in the subreddit search bar after seeing this elsewhere, and when nothing popped up here I was VERY surprised. I thought this would have blown up here instantly
I was surprised it wasn't already up too.
This is it right here, sadly she's been forced into a position of silence being consent...and we all know Trump has a history of confusing those two things and it hurting women.
And if she doesn’t it will also set SUCH a dangerous precedent. He’s going to be keep doing this, with Taylor, with other artists, with fake new articles, and politicians, etc…AI is like a Trump wet dream.
It’s not like what he posts there just stays there. Proof in point: this post.
Fingers crossed! Would def make me happy to see her set the record straight and call out Trump for being the unsupportable weirdo that he is.
If Taylor is the sort of person a lot of her fans think she is, then I think something needs to happen. If she'd rather hold onto a few deplorable fans than use her influence to make the world a better place, she isn't the person a lot of her fans think she is.
What evidence do you possibly have that she’s no longer political
Oh, absolutely. The register to vote will come and it will come in time. If there’s an endorsement for a ticket I predict it’ll come later though because it’s more valuable closer to election than it is now.
[deleted]
I think it is, because he is using her unauthorized image for personal and political gain. But I’m not a lawyer
lol it’s all based around the ONE real girl who showed up to a DT rally in that shirt.
Thanks.

Edit: I wanted to add this after looking at it...Don't those photos of Swifties for Trump look like AI as well? Or am I wrong?
Lies ‼️‼️
I definitely heard Style during the preshow at footage of one rally. I hope that means she approved it.
Idk about the rally, but the DNC is using Ready For It? on their social media sites to promote the convention 🤷‍♀️
I’ve heard Ready For It a lot. Warms my black little Rep heart 🖤
I heard cruel summer on a TikTok of Tim Walz at a rally last night 
Don't take my word for it, but what I've read, I interpreted that all of them.
I also heard a clip of the intro music right at the beginning of the eras tour show, specifically “it’s been a long time coming” and background music.
Yes, I believe it's informally named after Elvis Presley and was heavily endorsed by Priscilla Presley , the first state in the US to have a law like this if I'm correct. As far as I know it prohibits use of AI pics/vocal fakes of celebs for any type of financial gain.
It's illegal a bunch of places. TN just very specifically handles AI voice under the Elvis law. Also, her home state is likely Rhode Island or New York now. But she can still sue him.
I feel like getting sued for AI photos is the least of Trump's concerns tbh
Ew, it probably smells like stale McDonald’s, and BO.
She can turn Trump Tower into Taylor Tower! The T’s already there.
I really want that extremely unlikely rumor about Tay and Bey co-headlining an all female fundraising concert to be true.
This comment *and* your username?

Bravo.
Trumphobia is the feeling of disgust and revulsion a woman feels when a known rapist calls her beautiful 5 times in 20 seconds
JD is about to like Taylor’s music 25% less, lol
I feel like this incident is less about politics from Swift’s perspective and more about brand control and the growing dangers of deepfakes.

Trump literally tried to make use of Swift’s celebrity reach without her permission. At this point its less Swift endorsing Kamala and more enforcing control of her own brand and statements.
I figured she would wait until the European leg was finished to say anything. Security and protests might be a concern at October/november if she makes a statement, but I also think security measures will be high anyway
She can still do it in two parts. 

Disavow Trump now in some kind of witty informal tweet making it clear she wants nothing to do with him. 

And then release a formal statement endorsing Kamala in October.

EDIT - Someone said she should just tweet "I would never endorse a narcissist...but they love me" 

PLEASE 😭
Hopefully Taylor's team is in cahoots with VP to figure out the right play here
Not really. It will piss people off that he tried this.

Those people will have more motivation to vote against him. I don’t see any benefit to it. It’s simply stupid.

And he is a simple and stupid person so it fits.
I think she would actually lose a lot of fans. I don’t think I could listen to her music anymore if she publicly flip flopped like that and endorsed trump
Vance has done the exact same thing when put in front of cameras. They'd be dangerous if they weren't so damn weird

ETA: calling these freaks weird is much better messaging than calling them dangerous. They don't care that they're dangerous, and neither do their supporters. Calling them weird attacks their ego.
Yeah, at this point it doesn't matter to him bc he's running for president in order to stay out of jail. So he's essentially running for his life, and that means he'll do whatever's necessary to win, regardless of the law

Even if he was prosecuted for the AI photos, that's small potatoes compared to everything else he's done and it wouldn't see a courtroom before the election
LOL, I don't think the legalities of American electoral law even matter at this stage.  Trump has done so much illegal shit that he should have been precluded from even standing the first time around, sadly however America seems to be in its post-decency era, and so here we are.
If I had done even a tiny fraction of the fucked up, heinous, hateful, illegal, criminal shit that Donald Trump has done in the thirty five or so years I've been aware of him, I'd probably be serving life in prison, at the bare minimum. But he does it, and gets to waddle around a free man, lying and worming his way into the minds and hearts of tons of naive and gullible Americans who actually believe a failed celebrity businessman who sucks up to and employs all the people he claims to want to rid Washington of.
Taylor should sue for defamation or something. Dont know what this falls under. It's not like he has the money to keep it up and it would look terrible for him and good for her
Fair enough.
Exactly my mom is full blown Qanon who believes trump has been put here by god to control this country. “This might be AI but it’s actually true and Taylor really believes this so she’s just letting trump say it himself.” Is exactly what her argument will be. Especially if Taylor doesn’t say anything to address this.
But they literally do not LOOK real. Especially the poster of Taylor. Hence my visually impaired question lol
Yeah, not that my parents would text me about Trump OR Taylor (lol), but they are in their 70s and I doubt they know anything about AI images. And if you’re just scrolling and see something and don’t pay that much attention, I doubt you would even notice. (Again; my much older parents, not much younger swifties lol).
💯
Even then they will still believe the endorsement is real and claim that the correction from Taylor is AI.

All information is AI unless it directly supports my worldview, obviously.
PR reps often work off record... she sends an email to a variety of newspapers saying... hey... look at this shitty thing trump did... and they write up an article. (or alternatively, she sends an email saying, hey look isn't it cool that taylor caused earthquakes with her concert...eg...)
MAGA nuts are going to believe what Trump says no matter what. They scream fake news at anyone who points out his bullshit. Swifties know it’s fake. And when I say MAGA nuts I’m including some of my own family as well so definitely know how you feel. Please don’t let them bother you.
Yeah. I think she does work with publications like PR people do, to get Taylor additional good press on day-to-day matters of the Eras tour for example, but I don’t think she’s doing that when it’s time to make a statement. Taylor and tree have addressed things on their own accounts when they want it known.
Kind of them to assume MAGA can read period.
😂
Literally
A cease and desist order to the trump campaign is needed and a demand for an apology or they should sue.
Tree Paine is her publicist!

dang y'all know the publicist name too

why would republicans fuck with people with this level of dedication

edit since thread lock: I've been through your sub today and have heard the rumors but never realized the whole thing with y'all is caring about the details. Trump and Heritage are terrified of people who care about the details.  Help your friends register to vote and bring a car full in November.
[removed]
Exactly. He can only lose supporters at this point not gain them, so he’s doing his usual tricks that worked for him before with his base. But those usual tricks are starting to backfire. The desperation is clearly visible, and this stunt is going to majorly backfire.
Beyonce would make more sense because her song has become the theme song for the Harris campaign. I bet Taylor gets more involved once she's back stateside from the tour (and once she's officially confirmed as nominee).
Beyoncé is not on tour right now, but Taylor will be leading up to the election, and I’m sure her fans’ safety is a big concern.  The way some of the MAGAs speak about Taylor (and women in general) in their dark corners of the internet is horrible.  I will not blame her one bit if she does nothing but make a post encouraging others to vote.  Especially after the recent terrorist threats.
I meant the ones in Vienna but yeah knew that was gonna happen
ngl i immediately came here yesterday to see some swifty justice and searched the comments for the word “trump.” there were zero results all of yesterday and even days prior.
With the justification and discussions of Vienna reaction ( or rather missing reaction) told me that I think there is a disparity of what fans think she is. I think she is nice and a philanthropist but she is nowhere close to the saint a lot want to see in her. It's show business and still a business, and it seems she rather is silent when there could be some public statement of her that could be misinterpreted. I fully understand that.
She could easily and elegantly endorse Kamala right now that would have so much positive impact with little effort. Why she hasn’t yet I don’t know.
That's all he needs to claim there is a movement in his favor. He doesn't even need that, if it doesn't exist he will create it.
They are AI. The picture of the lone girl was real and she went to a trump rally with that shirt. The other ones are composites of AI people with similar shirts.
I heard AYRFI too but I’m now wondering if they’re overlaid on top of a video. However DNC Chair Jamie Harrison posted a video with Ready For It as the background song yesterday
She's trying to use my love of politics to get me clowning again. She really is a Mastermind
What if she speaks at it? I remember seeing Billie Eilish and other pop culture people at the DNC in 2020
Yep I heard that too!
Just goes to show how epically stupid he is. It's like he thinks he's running for class president and he only has to abide by high school hallway rules. The negative press from this is going to eat up at least another week between now and early mail-in voting. 

Something, something about... when your enemy is destroying himself, don't interfere? I'm gonna make a quick run to the store here in a bit to stock up on popcorn.
If she got Trump's name down from the building in downtown Chicago she'd be a hero
Dear god I don't ask for much

OK maybe I do

But this one

Please
🤗 thanks!

I really like your username. Is it that the peg leg is the wooden stick of a popsicle? Or just insinuating all popsicles are peg-legged?
I would throw all my albums. I wouldn’t want anyone or anything associated with that kind of hate in my home.
Putin does the same thing too 🥴

They are def weird but they're also dangerous. Or at least their puppet masters are

Edit to respond to your edit: I agree the "weird" messaging is good for getting under Trump's skin, but it's still important for voters to know that he is in fact dangerous and that our democracy is at stake. 

Most MAGAs aren't hanging out in a Taylor Swift forum so the ego tactic isn't really necessary, but undecided voters might be here, so IMO it's an appropriate place to be honest about how dangerous Trump actually is.
They are definitely dangerous
I mean the good news is that Taylor Swift has excellent lawyers who she pays well, while Trump has terrible lawyers that he likely doesn’t pay at all, like almost every other person who provides services to him. So even if he doesn’t end up in prison, he will likely end up having to pay her a boatload of money.
What God? Cthulhu?
>full blown Qanon who believes trump has been put here by god to control this country

What state r u from?????????
I get all sorts of nonsense AI generated images on my FB feed and there are often lots of comments beneath implying that people believe them. They are often really outlandish and even less realistic than this Trump one!
It IS real!  Just like that documentary I watched about those heroes, The Incredibles.
Trump explains taylors look!

“I think she’s beautiful — very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she’s liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump. I hear she’s very talented,” he said. “I think she’s very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!”

The ai is just part of her "unusual" beauty 

/s
Trump supporters exclusively believe fake images and claims though
You’re overestimating the general American public here lol
I know it's hard to comprehend, but my mom is 66 and her brain doesn't always register that AI stuff is fake. She might sort of get the idea that something is weird or not quite right, MAYBE.  But in general it's been shocking to see how older people don't have the experience or cognition to recognize obvious AI. She is not visually impaired and does not have a memory related issue. She's just getting old and doesn't get it.
Adding to this, I have a friend that posts AI or highly edited images of herself on FB all the time. She’s in her 50s. She has a ton of old men followers and I constantly see them commenting on how beautiful the photos are, as if they think they are real. I roll my eyes all the time. lol
Dangerously true. I wish I could give you an award for this.
I don't think this person is disagreeing with you about how PR typically works. 

They're saying that the people falling for this shit aren't going to believe it's fake until they see/hear it straight from the horses mouth "no, I do not endorse Donald Trump. I never endorsed Donald Trump." 

...and even then, many will be too far gone to accept it and will make up all kinds of conspiracies about Taylor being forced to take back her endorsement.
Coming from someone in PR, this is not true. If her reps responded the article would not say “Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.”

That’s…not how PR works. If this was Tree saying something the article would cite something from Taylor’s camp or a source close to Taylor
no…
That’s a good question- I don’t know who told him that fucking with the swifties is a good idea. We’re not exactly a chill bunch.
She's well known because she's so good. Outside of Taylor herself, Tree Paine is probably THE reason Taylor is so popular now. She helped Taylor navigate the Kanye stuff. Helped her establish the unique relationship with fans via Christmas gifts and surprise appearances. And lots of other stuff. Taylor is her only client, but other celebs would kill to have her.
Tree is kinda a meme in this community cause of how good of a publicist she is.

Though I’m pretty sure Nils Sjöberg wouldn’t mind fighting with Trump either
They know everything. They know like her cats names and birthdays. I recently became a fan and joined the sun and it’s absolutely mindblowing the level of knowledge the fan base casually has.
Wait… I thought the machine  we were raging against was just a generic evil robot.  Are you telling me it was our own political and economic system the whole time?
I hope so. I do think he's just not as interesting as he was in 2016, when he was like a shock to the political system. Now his usual tricks feel tired and wrought. Plus, hard to motivate people to get out and vote for you when you've been claiming the election system is rigged for 4 years.
See, that will cost her money too, maybe a lot more than standing up to a convicted felon and adjudicated rapist who's putting words in her mouth would.
I try really hard not to pretend I know who my “heros” really are. But there are a lot of reasons for her not to stir the pot, and her fans safety is at the top of that list. Her US shows are days away from the election. I know it’s disappointing and we wish she would be more outspoken and “fearless” but it’s not just her life she has to think about. Level headed and undecided voters will see through this and this will hurt Trump without her having to do anything. Anyone that knows or cares what Taylor thinks knows who she is voting for and the % of her fans that are MAGA is extraordinarily low.
It all looks creepy and I don't like it. This all gets dumber and dumber. Thanks for sharing, btw.
did you just acronym …Ready For It? into AYRFI?
Lol I like where your brain is at!

The missing leg that would be a wooden peg, is a popsicle.
And the bad news is that Trump has the majority of the Supreme Court, who already ruled once that he couldn’t be held legally accountable 
I hope she sues for enough to get mar-al-ago. It’s about ‘Reputation’ and Taylor’s worldwide reputation is worth a lot!
Cthulhu has already rejected that clown.
Don’t know I’ve asked her why the Christian god would approve someone like Trump and usually just get yelled at for questioning her Christian values while saying we should kill all poor people so ……..
Oh gosh, I’m not the original commenter, and I can’t speak on the Qanon part, but I think the “chosen by god” bit is sprinkled literally everywhere at this point. It’s completely insane. A good portion of my family are all in on that train of thought. Can’t even discuss it with them.
This kind of rhetoric is all across the country. There’s cuckoo evangelicals *everywhere*, that’s why he’s still in the game
This is a very common belief amongst Qanon which is now basically a Trump cult. People all over the world believe this crap. It’s like a virus. Check out r/Qanoncasualties for info.
Washington.
My mother is the same and we are in/from Michigan.
Do keep in mind that a lot of the comments you see on public posts on Facebook are actually just bots. 

There are of course real people who fall for and engage with this content as well, but the volume of such people is artificially inflated by a large amount of bot activity.
What do you mean a kid with seven fingers and no toes didn’t build a statue of Jesus out of watermelons, in a country that doesn’t support the growth of the crop? Fake news 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
Imagine being orange and calling someone else “unusual”. Weird tbh
and her name is tree pain? that's hard

Accurate. It’s very scary right now.
Only applies to things he does as president which he currently isn't.  If this broke laws and even if he wins, the second he was out of office he would be fair game again since this wasn't done as an official act as president
To use trumpspeak, it’s about her “brand”. He is documented saying, i think this came out it in one of his real estate court cases, that most of his financial value in his “brand”.

So he should know better and I hope they use his words against him!!
I just don't want another Jan 6th, it will be DEVASTATING for the US.
He fits the description of the anti-Christ to a T
Not the state l expected.......
Just came across a poll and it shows Kamala is at 51% in Michigan while Trump is at 44%.
God, the dead internet theory is so real. Bots making propaganda for bots to comment on, and then bots write news articles about it.
Just the way he talks in 3rd person and yeah i think he meant it as a walkback on complimenting her directly to imply shes weird, real cartoon villain energy.
If you trust this Supreme Court to not push for his immunity to anything he does, I’ve got a seafront property in Arizona to sell you 
Not as devastating as a Trump presidency.
States are pretty big they all have all kinds of people.
Let’s hope this continues as is!
Yeah I guess my perception is pretty much limited to the Seattle metro area
She needs to win Pennsylvania as well (she's leading there)
well I mean there are probably people in the Seattle metro area who are also Qanon. Just because its not the majority doesn't mean it doesn't exists there.
Analyzing the Matty/Joe of it all
Now that the dust has settled a bit on everyone’s shock at how much Matty Healy is present on TTPD, I thought I’d do an analysis on how both of these muses play into the greater narrative at play here.

Firstly, in the prologue, let’s go through what she has to say about them:

*You see, the pendulum swings*

*Oh, the chaos it brings*

*Leads the caged beast to do the most curious things*

*Lovers spend years denying*

*Resentment rotting away galaxies we created*

*Stars placed and glued meticulously by hand next to the ceiling fan*

*Tried wishing on comets*

*Tried dimming the shine*

*Tried to orbit his planet.*

*Some stars never align.*

*And in one conversation, I tore down the whole sky.*

*Spring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues*

*Then a crash from the skylight bursting through*

*Something old, someone hallowed,*

*Who told me he could be brand new*

*And so I was out of the oven and into the microwave*

*Out of the slammer and into a tidal wave.*

Joe is the oven – dying slowly, over time. The loneliness, the resentment, the caged feeling…she knows this has to end:

*Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter*

*He was with her in dreams*

*Gray and blue and fights and tunnels*

*Handcuffed to the spell I was under*

*For just one hour of sunshine*

*Years of labor, locks, and ceilings*

*In the shade of how he was feeling*

She knows that what they want no longer aligns – it’s clear that they both wanted marriage and children at first (see: Lover) but then he got cold feet – and doesn’t know how much longer she can give, especially since she feels like she’s running out of time to have that future (the beat pattern in So Long, London – it’s like she’s racing faster and faster). She feels extreme guilt, but knows that this is unhealthy; even her friends are commenting on how unhealthy the resentment, stagnation, and fear of infidelity is:

*And my friends said it isn't right to be scared*

*Every day of a love affair*

*Every breath feels like rarest air*

*When you're not sure if he wants to be there*

and

*My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it*

*Watch me daily disappearing*

*For just one glimpse of his smile*

I think people aren’t talking about these lines enough. She feels afraid every day that he will betray their relationship (also in Fresh Out the Slammer: “*he was with her in dreams*”) – She knows that they’re careening towards an ending – but who will end it first?

Enter, Matty. The true villain of TTPD, from the language she uses, and the “microwave” from the prologue. We know that they reconnected in 2021, and that they originally dated in 2014. He worked on Midnights, on a track that ended up scrapped. I think this time is alluded to in Guilty As Sin? – she’s dreaming of leaving, and he’s doing things like sending her Downtown Lights (look up the lyrics). She wonders if maybe this is the way to go out, with a crash instead of a whimper. All along, he’s promising the things she wants so desperately from Joe – a public commitment, a promise of children (look at Matty’s interviews during this time).

Essentially, he’s promising her a “get-love-quick scheme”: leave the relationship you’re dying slowly in, and take a chance on me, a reformed man who can give you what you need. She also is convincing herself, a girl who’s entire belief system is built on fate and soulmates, that maybe this was the story all along – she so badly wants to believe that she didn’t blow her whole life up for this (even though it was dying anyways), and he’s telling her that it was irresistible, fated, meant-to-be:

*Did you really beam me up*

*In a cloud of sparkling dust*

*Just to do experiments on?*

*Tell me I was the chosen one*

He’s saying all the right things and publicly making promises:

*At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger*

*And put it on the one people put wedding rings on*

*And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding*

She wonders if she can slot him right into the place where Joe was – she can get what she wanted, and the future will stay the same, so does the person really matter now? (*“Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here”*).

But when she finally does give in, fully, despite the way her loved ones warn her away from him (But Daddy I Love Him) she finds that he actually is everything he’s said to be. We see this narrative shift in “I Can Fix Him”:

*The jokes that he told across the bar*

*Were revolting and far too loud*

and she ends the songs wondering if maybe she can’t fix him, after all. This all comes crashing down in loml – the heat is too much for him, and he leaves her abruptly, leading her to feel immense shame and guilt. How could she think that he had reformed? How could she look past how bad he is (the jokes he tells, his general personality) for even a second? And even more than that, how could he have convinced her to leave her past relationship in such a fashion, even though she needed to leave?

*A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme*

*I've felt a hole like this never before and ever since*

This song brings back her split with Joe as the true sadness under it all:

*You shit-talked me under the table*

*Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles*

*I wish I could unrecall*

*How we almost had it all*

*Dancing phantoms on the terrace*

*Are they second-hand embarrassed*

*That I can't get out of bed*

*'Cause something counterfeit's dead?*

Both Joe and Matty promised her the future, but only one was a real love. The dancing phantoms are her and Joe; the ghosts of them are all over her apartment. Are they embarrassed that she is so terrorized by guilt and shame that she can’t get out of bed? Are they embarrassed that the split with Matty is making her realize that it’s impossible to slide in one protagonist for another, and try to have the same ending to the story?

It’s why the most vitriol is reserved for Matty, and for herself. She’s deeply angry at Matty: for being a terrible person, for convincing her he had changed, for luring her in by promising exactly what she wanted. She had convinced herself she could change him, and convinced herself that dying for his sins would be worth it, if she could finally have the future she craved:

*I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside*

*And you deserve prison, but you won't get time*

*You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars*

*You crashed my party and your rental car*

*You said normal girls were boring*

*But you were gone by the morning*

*You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing*

But for him, he simply wanted the chase. He had no interest in ever delivering on his promises. It’s why the tone towards him is so sinister. With Joe, she has more grace towards him – she understands why he’s stagnant, understands what’s holding him back. There’s love for him, still, in how she writes. But for Matty, there’s no love – his only goal was to play with her. And she’s embarrassed that it worked. She can’t get out of bed. She can barely hold herself together enough to do her job, the self-loathing and resentment is so intense (see: “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart”).

I think the summary of it all comes down to this. She knows she has to leave Joe, and she takes “miracle move on drug” (Matty) to do so. She doesn’t think she can leave Joe unmedicated, and the alternative path is leaving Joe with nothing in her hands, and nothing to show for the six years she spent. Instead, she thinks it’s better to leave him for someone who can offer her the same ending – only to discover that the drug was a placebo, with side effects similar to poison. And now she has to cope with the heartbreak and depression of leaving her almost-marriage, of the shame of falling for a con-man, and of the utter self-loathing of being so foolish to think that fate was real.
Woah I literally just saw this post on tumblr, with the same conclusion you made:

https://preview.redd.it/i1y3gae06rvc1.jpeg?width=941&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11f8d67c65d2c851535c04a2d159ddc5dfac8ee8
Matty gets a lot of this album because Taylor checked out of her relationship with Joe over time and jumped quickly into her relationship with Matty.  There wasn't any time to truly feel the pain from the final end of her relationship with Joe and heal because she papered it over with Matty and the Eras tour.  When Matty ended too, the pain of both Joe and Matty hit her even harder at same time.   She has been singing about her feelings about the problems with her relationship with Joe since folklore subconsciously or by fictionalizing/obscuring.  There just wasn't that much material left unsaid about Joe.  Matty, like you said, was all new unheard material with juicy details.

And its clear to me that Taylor has gotten sick of fans and the press judging her endlessly. So I wouldn't be surprised if she decided to throw a couple more Matty songs onto TTPD just to thumb her nose at those who judge her.
I love your summary! Especially the last part about how Matty was a pill to replace what she was losing - an excellent comparison to sum it all up. Her infatuation with Matty started as a symptom of her despair over her six year relationship, and then he showed up and it materialized into something extremely unhealthy, which is what made this entire affair all the more devastating.
This is amazing. I made a playlist with all the songs that relate to this story in (what I believe to be) chronological order and it’s super interesting to listen to the music in this way. Such a compelling, tragic love story. Thank you for your insights!!!
Yes! I think the one thing I see differently is that I see loml as Taylor singing to Joe as things didn’t work out with Matty, and reflecting on how Matty sold her a con, but what was she supposed to do, she was in hell with joe. The ink bleeds once she can’t hold it together anymore
I think it’s similar to what she’s telling us in “but daddy I love him” and “I can do it with a broken heart”. The satirical aspect is that she’s trying to say I don’t care (or at least I don’t want to care) what the public thinks, and it’s no one’s business, and here’s an album about a three month fling- bc no one deserves to know why a six year relationship ended. 

Not saying she wasn’t heartbroken by Matty. I’m sure many of us have gone through the ringer with a quick flame.  I definitely have. But once you are out of that situationship, it doesn’t haunt you as much.  There aren’t many inside jokes, routines, they dont necessarily leave a lasting imprint, you probably don’t have memories of holidays, etc.

It also made me think she and Joe ended their relationship mutually, or she at least has some respect/love for him and didn’t want to blast their relationship history for the world to hear
This was the best review of the album I’ve seen so far on here. It gave me a fresh perspective. 

I still don’t entirely understand why she thought it was necessary to release so many songs about MH when she probably could have covered this in a couple songs. But that’s none of my business.
This is so wonderfully written. And I agree with it all. I think so many of the songs could easily be about either relationship and/or both relationships. With the way I think it all played out, in the end, I think she was essentially grieving both relationships at once. And even taking the Matty breakup harder in ways, as a result of having not fully processed and grieved the fallout of her relationship with Joe.
I think my favorite diss to matty in all of this is calling him a microwave
Thank you so much for spelling this out because I am so clueless when it comes to analyzing lyrics.
Reading this makes me cry but damn travis really came in w a friendship bracelet and a dream 🥺
10/10 no notes!!

I would totally especially emphasize that Taylor's music and idea of love is really all about soulmates and fate, and the idea of the right man coming around 10 years after he promised to grow up (like she says in Peter and Cardigan about Matty) has to be such a drug. It's so romantic to think this is the story all along. So it wasn't just the dying Joe relationship, it was their own lore that she got caught up in imo.

It's also interesting how there's Taylor the artist and Taylor the person. Taylor the artist was all about the drama and laying on the floor in a puddle in her music but Taylor the person continued eras, continued recording and working and taking over the music industry without skipping a beat. She even found time to become a football fan towards the end of the summer...She's not really that type of "tortured poet" and I think a lot of this is now tongue in cheek looking back at her going crazy kind of almost laughing at the hysterics re her behavior.
And I would also like to add, I think the reason she had to put so many matty songs on there is because it became this concept of the psych ward.  
She wrote all of them in the moment and then after the fact she realized the state she was in.  
  
The crazy rampant state you get when the relationship you’ve been rotting away in is ending, while still clinging on to the dreams of it.  This kind of stuff drives you insane for a bit.  
  
And she could’ve just hid it somewhere and make us forget about this phase. Many swifties would’ve gladly done that! That’s why there’s such surprise about the amount of songs about him. Many didn’t really want a reminder of her time with matty.  
  
But I think she chose to be vulnerable and do the brave thing and give us something we might not want to see. Say things we might not like her to say about that person. Show us an insight into a time where even she thinks she might’ve been crazy.  
   
Kind of like you bring to light the things you instinctively don’t want the world to see and you have a chance to heal from it.  
  
That’s the way that I can relate to it. Things that 20y old me would’ve found so embarrassing (or scared that others think it is) are the things I would’ve pushed under the rug without thinking twice about it.  
But 32y old me knows that I can only heal when I show it to someone and allow it to be there.
I wish actual professional reviewers would write reviews like you instead of quick dismissive witty lines that they know will go viral on Twitter. Like that one who said "Taylor Swift released a new album ? Well I'm not listening"..... Yawn. 


Anyway, thank you for this great interpretation of this album. And I'm not sure if I'm getting ahead of myself, but I feel like this album will be a Red 2.0 like when Red was first originally released it was panned by so many people and critics who said the album isn't cohesive or that she needs better editing. But a decade later Red TV became her most critically acclaimed album. And the original Red now shows up on so many lists of best albums that have been released. TTPD is definitely a misunderstood record that may get better reception with time. 
I agree with most of this except that it implies Matty wasn't sincere. I think they were in love, but he was scared off when they first met, promised he had changed, but hadn't actually changed. 

The missing context is in Peter imo.

When they connected the first time 10-ish years ago, Matty said he was scared off by Taylor's fame because the 1975 had just dropped their first album and he wanted to be known for his own music and not just "Taylor Swift's boyfriend". That was the context to the "emasculating" comment. 

This was from part of [comments](https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a34931/matt-healy-on-taylor-swift-q-magazine/) he made in 2016:

> Matty: "I was for a very short time immersed in a celebrity world that I found confusing and scary. At that time, I had fears of being 'somebody's boyfriend' (remember this is all speculation as we never dated!) before even being recognized for my music or presence as a person in my own right."

He would've been 25 at that time. It sounds like he told her the timing wasn't right because he wanted to focus on his band, so she lost him "to the "Lost Boys" chapter of your life". But he "said you were gonna grow up/Then you were gonna come find me". That's the reform she references; he obviously didn't get less controversial, but he makes a name for himself. 

They were separated for about a decade ("As the decade would play us for fools" from "Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus") and then they did reconnect, like you talked about in your post. This time he says he's ready. But the public backlash scared him off again and he ghosted her ("They just ghosted you/Now you know what it feels like").

And that's why Taylor is so angry in songs like "But Daddy I Love Him". He was the one who got away and when she got him he was scared off again.
This is great! You’ve got most of it covered. Another small addition I always like to keep in mind is her saying that she was having a period of “temporary insanity”. And that the chapter is now closed, “boarded up” and there are no score to settle now.

Implying her recognition of how crazy it was to date someone like Matty, this is not a defence of him but her own feelings and faults on display. Also telling us repeatedly that that part of her life is over and she has moved on with someone new!
This gave me such a better view on the album. I really couldn’t resonate with the first half of the album and it was hard for me to feel bad for Taylor tbh when I expected her to have learned her lessons from all the terrible men of previous. Although her going for Matty seems like such an obvious self destruction, reading this gave me a way better understanding of where she was mentally when leaving Joe and why Matty was almost the perfect trap.
amazingly written- helps clear a lot up and helps me in my own analyzing process
I love your analysis of the album.

To add my thoughts as well - 

Right after she writes that her relationship with Matty was a manic phase in the prologue, the next line is this -

" A smile creeps onto this poet's face. Because it's the worst men that I write best." 

The placement of the line leads me to assume that she is talking about Matty and telling us why there are so many songs about him. It plays to her creative inspiration and self affirmed strengths as a writer. With Joe - She talks about the heart break and how their stars didn't align. The words don't lead me to believe that she would group him in with the "worst".
Your analysis is spot on and I enjoyed reading it. 

So… if you had to put the Alchemy somewhere on this timeline, would you label it as a Travis song given the blatant football references, or would you categorize it as a Matty song. Initially, I thought it was the former. But, these lyrics are making me reconsider:

*I haven’t come around in so long, but I’m coming back so strong*

*Cause the sign on your heart said it’s still reserved for me.* —How could this be Travis? “Still”? If they had met in the past, it wasn’t enough to kindle longing feelings. 

*That child’s play back in school is forgiven under my rule* —His past behavior. I read he had been a heroin addict somewhere? 

*He jokes that it’s heroin, but this time with an “E”* —The NFL has pretty strict rules on drug use, and we know MH did do heroin. Maybe Taylor confided in Travis, and we know his humor is sometimes silly, but I just don’t know how the context would come about.


Honestly, I was excited to hear this song once I heard it uses football metaphors, and like everyone else, thought it was a TK song. Now I don’t want it to be. I’d rather it be a MH song that she wrote and then tweaked a bit after she started going to the games. What’s your analysis?
Wow this is the best summary I could get. Most song are I think are mixed of Joe and Matty. The heartbreak of Joe was postponed because she jumped into Matty quickly so when that also ended, the heartbreak is both Joe and Matty.
This is a wonderful analysis of the album, well done!
Your description is a wonderfully detailed encapsulation of different thoughts I’ve walked away with too. I think the experiences with these two are so humanizing for me in a way or at least the way they are shared and depicted through this album. Thank you for sharing and putting all this together.
You've done an excellent review here and I completely agree with all the points you've made. For me, after listening to the whole album paying attention to the lyrics, I'm so captivated by the difference in how she sings about matty and Joe. She still seems to have a lot of respect for Joe and hasn't really done any bashing and that makes sense he was the "love of his life" and they both genuinely loved each other. With matty, it's like we can hear the anger and regret in the songs about him. I really love these little differences in the songs they add such a different kind of personal touch
This is a breath of fresh air after having to see all the incredibly inaccurate takes on IG and people that are making Joe edits with songs that are not even about that.
So succinctly summarised! 
I feel the biggest reason for the Joe breakup seems to be when Taylor wasn't ready to be married but so in love (the lover era, songs like paper rings show she's in love but still a little scared of commitment) he maybe did want to get married and when she was finally ready he had cold feet (maybe too bothered by her public image as he was always seen avoiding paps and media while with her). Maybe he wasn't completely comfortable with living in the public eye (which was what Taylor wanted too in the reputation era but not anymore). Still, he was a good partner to her. Theres mention of him in miss Americana too. Maybe he just wasn't the person who would cheer her on from the front row and kiss her in front of a thousand people, but the one who waited for her at the backstage hugging her as she finished the show. Doesn't mean he didn't support her. They even wrote music together. Just breaks my heart they didn't work out. Not sure if it's about Joe but for me 'he stayed the same, all of me changed like midnight rain' best summarises their relationship.
Love it. And I think it’s a pretty futile exercise for folks to be like “well this whole song is Joe, and this one is Matty” because what she’s saying is it’s the whole goddamn thing. It’s both of them, wound up in this crazy manic time that she lived, and I think the lines are purposely blurred in certain songs because it was blurred the way she lived it too.
This is the best explanation of this triangle and it makes the most sense. 

I never understood the appeal of MH but knowing they had a history that meant a lot more to her than she ever let on, I get it more now. 

She knew it could and probably would end in a consuming blaze but the oblivion from the pain she was feeling bc of Joe made it worth it. 

Listening I’m like, Taylor you have to believe people when they tell you who they are!  Like how are you shocked a shitty person did a shitty thing?  But the way you dissected it, it all comes together.
Thanks for this breakdown. I had many of the same thoughts, but this is perfectly phrased to share with my fellow Swiftie friends 

My kneejerk repulsion on the first listen realizing who this was about, and then it dawning on me why he's such a focus. Wow, what an album. It will be polarizing to quite a bit of fans, but tbh this was clearly for her
If anything at all, this album really shows her humanity. It shows that she makes the same mistakes a lot of us do and that she is struggling with her mental health as well. She’s tired of people infantilizing and treating her like she’s public property.
What a wonderful explanation and deep analysis.

And how can people not love this album?

It's so tortured. 

She warned us. 😆
I’ve been trying to find a way to say so much of this - you said it so, so eloquently. Thank you! brb, sending to everyone I know.
Oh my god! I cried at this review! 
It is as if the album is retelling of my story back in 2018. I had an on-and-off-and-on again relationship for almost 7 years. When we finally called it quits in 2017. I quickly fell hard to a good for nothing guy (yeah, he also has a substance abuse and I thought I could save him and he'll be a better man because of me). He promised me eveything I ever wanted from the previous guy but then suddenly left me hanging. Oh my god, the trauma, the self-loathing, the depression I went through. 

Thank you Taylor for this album! I am all better now and happily married to the love of my life and this album made me appreciate everything that I have now because if I can get through what I went through in 2018, I can surely get through anything that comes my way.
Great analysis of the record. I do think loml and ICDIWABH are Joe-coded moreso than Matty, or perhaps a little of both. Overall the song feels much more serious and long term, sad moreso than angry like the rest of the Matty themed ones. Although the line 

*Mr steal your girl, then make her cry* 

could also apply to Matty “stealing” her from Joe and then ghosting her, I initially attributed that to the fact that she has previously hinted to pining after Joe the summer she was with Tom (*cat and mouse for a month or two or three*; *I’ve loved you three summers now, honey, but I want ‘em all*). We know she met them both around the same time. She also broke it off with Tom in early September 2016 and got with Joe a few weeks later, which isn’t such a huge gap that it’s not a pretty safe bet she was already talking to Joe, even if only as friends.
Thank you for this - I think it's really well thought out and accurate. The album is both of them.
Wow excellent thank you so much for this ! 🤍🖤
If Taylor is the poet, you’re the patient English teacher explaining her work to us so we feel ready for our exams and I love you for it
Ooh, this is a great write up. I also think that even though there are so gs that reference Matty, the whole heartache/majority of the album is about Joe. The end of their relationship was why she went "crazy" and entered into something more toxic. Her snapping out of it was a realization that it wasn't really love with Matty and her acceptance that it really was over with Joe. Once she was able to finally let go and was "cured" so she could leave the hospital, she was able to open herself up to better things.
This is very well written , and a thoughtful piece . It’s very “humanizing” for someone of her celebrity status ; in which people have been angry at her for having the audacity to associate or “love” (it could be said that it wasn’t genuine 
 love , but rather a counterfeit illusion of infatuation) for MH . 

People absolutely were understandably upset about her choosing him, because he’s an absolute train wreck of a human being. And she felt violated by fans having that opinion at the beginning. 

Which is also understandable, because she is just a person who wants to live her own life. However , through the album , it becomes clear that the *realization* of why people despised MH became very real to her , once the cloud of his illusions lifted , and he began mistreating and disrespecting her , and manipulating her (eg the supposed suicide threat he gave her if she left him ) . 

That could also be seen as outwardly selfish , to only see his miserable existence once something affected her personally and not from how he was documented treating others for years and in recent times . But as she outlines in the album, it was the insanity she felt for him during her immense grief of her long term relationship ending that distorted her reality of MH. 

Many women have experienced their own version of a MH in their lives : a  piece of shit of a human being who mistreated them (or worse abused them ) . Who they tried to justify fighting for out of “love” (likely would be due to traumatic experiences), and then eventually realizing who they actually were with . 

Her realization was just public . That makes a big difference. And that feels horribly shameful . 

The album is an anthology of the two layers of grief she went through : the deep grief of a long term relationship ending , and the piercing grief of how one behaved in the aftermath . 

The album is not about the two men . It’s a post morteum of herself . It’s raw as fuck. The anti hero example in long form .
I wonder if Matty showing up made Taylor view things through an even more negative lens than needed. Like extra annoyed just cuz she basically wanna to be banging this guy she was having sex dreams about. The chase. She missed the chase of guys. 
This write-up is absolute perfection!
Best review I’ve read. Every example- every breakdown. Amazing job 👏👏
This is exactly how I interpreted all of this
I don’t have anything to add, except to say that this analysis is so incredibly well thought out and really gives me a better understanding of the album as a whole. Thank you for this!!
Nailed it, no notes
YESSSS I left a long winded comment in a post elsewhere basically saying this same thing, but you really did the deep dive. I agree 100% and you laid it out so well.
Holy fuck, amazing work. Thank you for taking the time to write this all out.
Love this perspective. I think you nailed it.
bingo
Thank you for this explanation! It’s one of the best I’ve read.
This is the perfect nuanced explanation of the album I’ve read anywhere. You’ve put into words exactly what was dancing around in my own head.  
  
Someone needs to bring this to TikTok to enter into the discussion there. It’s way too focused on “oh he’s the bad guy we hate you now” instead of everything underneath. And the stuff that’s underneath the obvious is what actually broke her heart.
Goddamn OP. 

Whether you are right or wrong that was an amazing analysis.
The prologe goes CRAZY I wish it was a song. I think it's the perfect representation of everything in the album.
I see a lot of people confused about why MH was brought up so many times in this album, so this is my interpretation:

MH was a rebound, so their relationship was an extension of her breakup with Joe. If it wasn't for that, she wouldn't have been as susceptible to his lovebombing, wouldn't have so easily believed he was a changed man, and wouldn't have been so desperate for it to work out. To that extent, the only song that is truly 100% directed at MH is "The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived". Every other song at least touches on how she was in a more vulnerable state, which was a result of her breakup with Joe.

Take "The Tortured Poets Department" for example. The entire song she is trying to convince herself that they are a good pair, because who else is going to be able to match and counteract him like she does? This eventually turns to "Who's gonna know me?" in the bridge. Though this song is very much about her relationship with MH, the desperation to find a perfect partner and the rose-tinted glasses she puts on to convince herself she can accept his flaws is directly a result of the ending of a long-term relationship and the loneliness that follows.

Anyways, all of this to say, a lot of people thought this album would cover the breakup with Joe so were taken aback when MH kept being brought up. However, in my opinion, the whole situtation with MH *was* the aftermath of the breakup with Joe, so the album does cover the breakup in that sense. The prologue covers this as well, the Joe breakup made her insane, and that's why she went with MH.
this was perfect
👏🏼
This is the best review I've read on TTPD! I think you're absolutely spot-on.
OP I’m reading this main analysis and all your additional comments and they’re all so thoughtful and intelligent: it’s great. Really enjoying your take. ETA I love this album! Maybe my favourite of hers.
[deleted]
Yes, you nailed it! Thank you for sharing!🫶🏻
Awesome analysis! U sure ur not the poet? ;)
Anyone familiar with the Bridget Jones Diary movies (*especially #2*) will appreciate how this mirrors Bridget’s relationships with Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver. 

Only after rebounding with a Daniel, can you acknowledge that Mark definitely wasn’t as bad as you had convinced yourself he was.
Matty just wanted to boost his own ego by chasing  the biggest star on the planet and getting her. He literally said “I win” on stage when it happened. Taylor was right about him - the smallest man who ever lived.
Well done!
Kinda amazed when it took you just 3 days to analyze these. Very well written!
I am curious to hear more of your thoughts. Do you post on other socials?

Also, specifically, your thought on why How Did It End and So High-school were not on the standard TTPD?
BRAVO!!!!!!!!!! Thank you for writing what I didn't have the energy to articulate on here.
Thankyou heaps for this, this really helped me understand
Oh I get the Matty Healy thing. When I got divorced after a decade with my spouse, I started online dating. I met someone and had a 6 month situationship with him. I was - in a way - in love with this man. It was intoxicating. We continued to "be friends" for a year during which time he would give me attention and I would hold onto hope that he would realize we're in love. I eventually went no contact with him as he was clearly just not interested in anything more but emotionally I was hooked on this dude for like, 2 years. Hoping he would reach out. He never did. I eventually moved on but tell me how that dude effed me up more than my actual marriage/person I had kids with?! So I get it, Tay. (Ps. Folklore was my "breakup album" and my entrypoint into the fandom lol)
This is amazing and this is the only interpretation of this album I'll accept. It makes so much sense. Andit puts into perspective which songs are for who. I'm getting annoyed by how many people are still villainizing Joe or attributing the worst songs/lines to him when they are clearly about Matty.
I think a lot of your analysis is spot on. Two things that are worth considering, though. 

Could part of Joe’s reticence to get married and his lack of passion for her be because she carried a torch for Matty the whole time..? 

And while I do think Matty is a narcissist and love bombed the hell out of her, I also suspect that the backlash she got (and he got) over them dating was a big part of the reason he ghosted her. He wasn’t strong enough to handle it; he finally realized what it meant to be Taylor Swift’s partner and he wasn’t up to the task.

I realize I am romanticizing the relationship, but I don’t think it was a bit of fluff. I think it’s been an important relationship for the last decade of her life.
This write-up makes me really feel for her and makes me want to give her a big hug. I hope she’s getting therapy for her own well-being. We all have our traumas and harmful behavior patterns that we resort to especially when deeply struggling. I could see the self-harm and the falling back into old behaviors when she got caught up in the whole Matty whirlwind from a hundred miles away. There’s something especially heartbreaking about making the same old mistakes when you’re in your 30s, hoping by now you’d have gotten your shit together, and can no longer blame it on your youth. I think that’s what a lot of people in their 30s struggle with—a resentment that we haven’t gotten our shit together yet, even if we feel like we tried really hard to do so. I couldn’t imagine my mistakes played out in real time on a worldwide stage. None of us will ever understand the toll it must take on her.
You deserve a standing ovation!

I think a lot more songs than people realize are actually reference to both Joe and Matty in different pieces or in ways their treatment of her overlapped because of what you said about both of them promising her forever.
I love this, everything was said is true, specially the parts that were about joe, i read a comment that says maybe this isn’t the break up album and that she’s probably still processing her break up with joe, and after this i really believe that that is the case, i think i can finally start listening to the album and review it without being confused all the time, thanks for the simple yet powerful explanation.
I think this album is far more Taylor’s true thoughts and desires out of her life at this point too.

It explains what really happened? And also lays waste to all the people who think they know her. 

She wants a family, and a partner in life more than her career. That’s huge to say out loud. She also is tired of being managed by people who have “her best interest” at heart but do nothing but stifle her.

The album also opines on her autonomy away from her “image” as a celebrity. 

There is a lot of the album where she is angry that she won’t ever have the love of her life because of her fame and career.
Thank you for this thorough analysis. I didn’t care for the album and was also disappointed in how much Matty is in it. I will relisten to it today and finish the second half after reading this though
This is a great analysis. Also gives more insights into my analysis that loml like a few other songs , mentions both muses - basically layers them.


 I think you crashed " my party" is the eras tour one or probably even as back as "Bejewelled" . 


 Some of her wounds as she says are also self-inflicted like" the fear of an everyday love affair" that you pointed out. This suspicion  seems second nature to Taylor going by even Lover / Afterglow or even the albums in her twenties.  But a ring or a marriage wouldn't absolutely fix this nor any amount of reassurance by a partner..But I think this is where some self - healing helps. 


 Taylor does throw herself under the bus in this album to bare open her messiness and her flaws though on the outside it looked like she was on top of the world, but inside she was falling apart.


  I feel the album on the whole could have pared down a bit, but all that said there are some beautiful haunting as well as messy songs here and it is truly a brave attempt to put this out publicly.
As someone getting out of a 10 year on/off relationship/situationship with an addict, all of the MH songs hit SO hard. Some of the lyrics are verbatim quotes of things he said to me, or exact descriptions of things he did. It’s wild. I’ve been listening to Taylor over half of my life and didn’t think I could be more grateful - until TTPD dropped.😭🫶🏻
GIVE THIS PERSON A FRONT PAGE SECTION
You hit the nail on the head here. Completely agree with all of this. Taylor just doesn’t know how to end a relationship without a getaway car.
While I really love this analysis I think we also need to remember that at the same time she’s still being artistic and telling a story in a lot of ways. This isn’t me trying to invalidate her feelings or saying that she didn’t actually go through any of what she’s written about but a lot of artists tend to exaggerate their experiences in their writing and Taylor herself has even said she’s overdramatic. It’s also important for us to remember that the person Taylor portrays herself as to the media is probably slightly different than who she is behind closed doors and to her friends and family. Again this isn’t me calling her fake or saying she isn’t a nice person but I think it’s similar to how we probably act a bit differently at work and when we meet people we don’t know then how we act around our friends and family. I think in part she probably dies this to protect herself from being burned the way she was in 2016. Yeah she does share more of her private life than she has with us in recent years but not nearly as much as she did before 2016.
I think her biology clock is ticking and it’s coming to an end soon. She is destined to have the unimaginable fame, but having the dream of a family that she insists on some of her new songs shows that her struggling is real. Being a people pleaser and having the desire to finally make a family can lead to accidents like dating Matty. She obviously imagined herself with Joe as the only one, I think this is why she kept her relationship private. 

When I broke up with my ex after 5 years I went in a few weeks to the biggest shitbag of my whole 21 years. The relationship lasted for like a month and I realized that I used the guy to forget my past relationship. 

I think this case could apply to Matty too. She found Travis but I think she believes this love only because she knows that if she needs to find a new trustworthy partner it could take years and even if somebody for her is available then the family and marriage question is still there, so she will settle next to Travis as their vision could meet their desire. He is the safe choice for her.

Joe maybe was in the right people, wrong time category. Travis got her when the timing was right. Such a sad concept of modern relationships.
Devastating but very poignant analysis. For what it's worth, I just hope Travis truly gives what Taylor wants and needs and is the one because at this point, she's maimed enough to at least finally get what she deserves. The one she desperately pleads for in 'The Prophecy'.
Holy crap. Are you Taylor?
It's not fair to necessarily call Matty a villain. I don't think anyone would have stuck around after the amount of hate he was getting. The fans were vicious, and he probably wasn't expecting, wasn't anywhere ready or strong enough emotionally to deal with such a brutal attack. I mean, when she faced a similar onslaught of internet hate, she stepped back from the spotlight for over a year and is *still* writing songs about it. I cannot imagine what that kind of loud hatred does to someone's mental health. So I don't blame him for not being able to take it. He's a dick for ghosting her and not having a mature conversation about it tho.

Also, for those wondering why Matty inspired so many more songs than Joe, it's because that heartbreak was fresh. Her and Joe's relationship was already dead. She had already fallen out of love and moved on emotionally when she wrote those songs, and that makes a huge difference. Taylor and Matty may have only had a physical relationship for 2 weeks (if she is a reliable narrator), but they had an emotional affair for months prior. That and I get the sense that he was "the one that got away" from 10 years prior. After listening to this album, it's very clear to me that Question...? is about Matty. And while she was deeply in love with Joe, wanted to marry him and have his babies, Matty was that meteor strike that she had never felt before or since.
This is so spot on. It actually is everything I took from the album too. And the fact that no matter even if she wanted to go back to Joe she's ruined it forever with the Matty thing. The grief. 
What I don't get is how she can move on so quick with Travis though. I feel like the Joe grief has to still be so real. 
Ive re listened to all the albums from 1989 vault tracks to now, and realised Matty was there the whole time. She wasn't over him.the whole time. That's why he featured so heavily. Taylor said on twitter that she was giving us all the story now. This is the whole story that explains songs on other albums that have left us thinking it's made up narrative or who is it about? The answers were folklore and evermore are not made up. The only made up characters are Betty, James and August , but even then it's a metaphor story for how Matty "chased two girls and lost the one" in cardigan. Matty is the one in this is me trying. There's tonnes and tonnes of lyrics leading to matty being a constant in her life. And in ttpd if you look into "peter" she's always been the Wendy growing up and he was always the lost boy who promised he'd come back. He did come back. And she held out from way before Joe. Which is why she was so quick to love him after Joe , so quickly to go public and so heartbroken it ended.

What prologue?
Excellent analysis!
This is such a great analysis.
Beautifully written! I loved reading your analysis; it’s thoughtful and was enjoyable to read. 

I saved this for later so I can read it again later. 🙂 I agree with so much you wrote…..the despair and heartbreak is so clear in this album. I haven’t loved a Taylor album so much since Folklore/Evermore, Lover and Rep.
I agree with all of this
YES. THANK YOU.
Also wasn't there some sort of "scandal" that almost broke. Ans there was rumor about this wedding supposedly Taylor had. (Not my business at all but is my memory tricking me?) It would track with bo you can't come to the wedding. And working on this for 2 years. And yeah, Taylor sharing so much of her personal life through her music and in such a raw way. And this album spent driving home that she's human and subject to the same cycles of pain, heartache, destruction, fear, and the trauma of fame that doesn't get talked about, and working through all those phases of growing up. I'm just so thankful to live at the same time as her)
I’m not following closely re her relationship. So she broke up with Joe because he doesn’t commit? It seems healthy when she was with him. Kept life a bit private, now she’s on the news constantly. That can’t be good. But well we all have our opinion and preference don’t we!? 

I listened to the whole album once and haven’t got too deep with the lyrics yet. Felt like it all sounds very similar. Will give it a few more go tho! 

A lot of songs are about MH?
All of this!! Best breakdown I’ve seen by far! Bravo. I absolutely love this breakdown.
I agree with every single word of this. Beautifully and compellingly written, OP.
This is exactly how the main story arranged itself in my head. Thank you so much for doing such an incredible job writing it!
I love this insight. I think we can affirm that both Joe and Taylor had checked out of the relationship, but neither wanted to be the first to initiate the break up. It now seems likely that Joe found out about MH and then broke it off. 

I think their relationship is complex. One is hurting from the stagnation of their relationship, the other is hurt from the inability to be the right partner.
Wow I’m gonna need you to do every album now please and thank you
I had someone tell me once that I was lucky my Matty and I never worked out because, and I quote: You would’ve been the best thing to ever happen to him, but he would’ve been the worst thing to ever happen to you had it continued. 

I cannot get that out of my head while listening to this album.
Strongly agree with your analysis! It made sense to me this way from the beginning, because almost all my friends‘ long term relationships ended the same way - with an escape from the relationship with an exciting and intense rebound, that then ended badly because it was essentially love-bombing or delusion. And then my friends would be much more upset about the second short-term relationship ending than the first long-term one. I would be confused, until I realized that you then grieve both relationships at once, but project them onto the last one. I think it’s very common, and Taylor managed to (as always) depict it so beautifully and raw and honest on TTPD.
Then who is The Black Dog about?
Loml has the same pain in it that All Too Well does. It feels gut-wrenching. That alone tells me how deep her and Matty go.
Yes, I agree with most of what you wrote! I just want to add that she definitely places a lot of blame on Matty but also on herself. To me it seems like his biggest crime was not living up to the expectations Taylor had of him, which is obviously not really his fault. Taylor's feelings are valid, of course, but she can only blame herself for deciding to believe a guy like Matty is the love of her life. So I think it's very fitting that in loml she calls herself a fool and Matty a conman, placing blame on both of them.
I hate that this could be correct. And actually, the line in Down Bad makes more sense in this context. 'Fuck it if I can't have him/us. Everything comes out, teenage petulance.' She seemed more wearied about the slow ending of her relationship with Joe. This line carries more energy, anger, frustration. 

She did have Joe. For 6 years. She didn't get to have Matty, not really.
I think Joe gets a bit of grace because she still respects him. That kind of relationship, the love grows slow and fades slow, but no grand betrayal to reveal he’s evil just a flawed human being flawed. I feel like she never got to the point of hating him, just deep despair and sadness.

Matty is the classic shithead villain and it’s much easier to point the torrent of grief, anger and sadness at a villain than at a human who made human mistakes.
Excellent summary. I think there's also a fascinating parallel between Taylor's relationships and the public's perception of celebrities – always looking for the new, real, true thing – as she describes in "Clara Bow." Thus, for Taylor, Matty replaces Joe (Matty's "impressionist paintings" – ostensibly true depictions of reality – that turn out to be "fakes") – and thus the public will want to replace Taylor with a new, younger singer that has an "edge" (messiness, rawness, realness, authenticity) that Taylor "never did."

\* edited for typos
This is an amazing analysis!!
This is the best take ive seen
Such a brilliant analyzation - thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us! 🌹 Tortured Poets is an album where Taylor had to unravel, acknowledge and expunge her emotions during a turbulent, yet simultaneously cosmic period of her life. Some of these songs are quite confrontational and painful for me to listen to, though I ultimately appreciate it. It makes me think of times I've assessed a relationship wrong, longed for the rush of a feeling, only to be confronted with the reality of it all, and having to re-establish healthy ground with myself.

I truly understand the sentiment Taylor echoed [here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3qEpIbLh7i/) when discussing her process creating *Tortured Poets.* I'm so grateful she had the safety net of her trusted collaborative creative team to create this album. Glad she feels confident to close and board up the chapter, as she mentioned on her IG caption.
Wow. You put into words what I was feeling about the album 🙏
this is exactly how i saw it
Go off queen! This was a perfect review.
This is just my personal opinion, YMMV, but....

I think the vast majority of songs, it's intentionally unclear if she's talking about Matty or Joe. Now, there are some exceptions (I think loml is clearly Joe and I think TSMITW is clearly Matty) but overall there are mixed clues scattered throughout in a way that it feels like TS is covering her tracks intentionally.

I combine that with the message in HDIE and it seems to me like TS drawing a line between the voyeurs and the fans who genuinely care about her. She equates the latter half to that friend you call over after a breakup because you know she's going to care more about how you're feeling than hearing all the details. She's there for support, not for gossip. We all know that kind of friend, and she's saying "Which one are you??"

That's how I interpret the whole album, at least.
Isn’t it possible she just made up the lyrics? Why does every word she writes have to be about a specific person? Other songwriters write about fantasy and cliche but everything Taylor writes has to be 100% based on fact?
Please analyse the anthology too! 
I adore the original album but have no idea what any of the anthology means.
I totally agree with this and I want to add that she seems to still respect Joe and acknowledged that two people can just fall out of step or not make it work in the long run essentially. I wonder if she made the focus on Matty out of respect for Joe since he values his privacy
Wow. This is fantastic. You should be proud of yourself. This is by far the best breakdown of the album I have read. 

Your last paragraph is what I have been trying to say for the past couple of days. Thank you for being able to articulate in an eloquent, easily digestible way what I have been trying to get across to people with mixed results.  Hope you are having a great day.
This is the best interpretation by far. The only thing I read differently was the “shadows on the terrace / are they secondhand embarrassed” refers to the fans being so cruel about her being with Matty despite her really being hurt. If you’re on a stage at a concert with the lights shining on you, then everyone in the crowd looks like dancing shadows on a terrace.
All of this evaluating makes me think back to the early days of her with Travis and looking back on how HAPPY & Excited Scott Swift seemed in a lot of the photos revolving around Travis’ visits to see her at concerts.  Like she’d been through hell and back with these guys and now in walks Travis and her Dad, who was probably so concerned for his daughter, is so happy with this potential.  Obviously, still too early, but damn, she deserves this happiness and Travis maybe being the ‘one’.
I have been saying, since its release, this album is far more about Joe than Matty. Yes. Matty is clearly present, but underneath it all is Joe. I think she combines both of them in some songs, as both of them made promises to her they did not keep. I find it beautiful the songs attributed to Joe bear very little anger. I think more songs on this album are about him but Taylor is more than happy to let the public think everything is Matty. I think she will always protect Joe.
I agree with a lot of this. But I also think people want to downplay her feelings for Matty. I think she was checked out of her relationship with Joe a long time ago, hence why there aren’t as many songs about him. But she didn’t have the courage to end it with Joe until Matty came into the picture and promised her things. The overall theme in Cardigan and Peter (which we know is about Matty) is two young people who loved each other but needed to grow up and sow their wild oats. I think Matty was in the back of Taylor’s mind for years, the “what if”, and once he grew up they’d get back together. Once it didn’t work out, she was devastated because it was years of build up in her mind. I think she’s mad and embarrassed about it.
I think this is all about Matty. 

Matty has been her Muse since 2014, they’ve ran into the same circles, he said he wouldn’t be with somebody like Taylor and it would be Demascalating, shortly after there were rumours of them being together. Years went  by and she carried the musical flame, collaborating and him being her muse knowing he wouldn’t be with her, they collaborated on the midnights album, but it was vaulted and never released, I think something happened, a conversation, a moment and the hookup from all those years ago came running back and as a result she left Joe, she was unhappy anyways and Matty promised her a future, she fought with everyone telling them they were supposed to be despite his reputation etc.. they got together, he hated the publicity, like he always said. It ended and it broke her. She had never grieved leaving Joe and as a result it was all a lot worse than she imagined.
Whoa
"This is the heartbreak time could never mend" (Cornelia street)
Yes I think the undercurrent of this album is Taylor trying to tell us that fame and celebrity doesn't excuse her from human decision-making. She's not defending any of her decisions here. She's laying them all out, with each track merely depicting her thought process at the time. The only thing she's pleading for, from us and from herself, is grace. Grace to forgive herself from torturing herself by her poor decision-making, by her self-harm, by her mania. Grace to move forward, and move on.
The problem with a rebound is you get whiplash on top of the concussion 🤕 from the first blow.  Each injury compounds the other and all you’re left with is confusion and pain that sometimes throbs, but often times is an unyielding dull ache that drives you crazy
She didn’t have time to process the first breakup so she had to process both at the same time 😭 spot on about the take about the difference beftween joe and Matt. It sounded like the worst Joe did was probably sink into himself from his own mental health stuff going on but Matt was maybe not nice to her 
I would argue that some of the problems in her relationship with Joe show up all the way back in Lover. That album is fraught with uncertainty, but she was still optimistic about him. That optimism disappeared and manifested in dark ways on the folklore and evermore albums. It’s clear that Midnights needs to be revisited in light of TTPD. I think a lot of those songs are also about Matty (Maroon and Question are currently ones that I believe are actually about him).
You’re Losing Me was all that needed to be said about what happened with Joe
"Come one, come all, it's happening again." That bitterness was directed at the fans. Mommy made your favorite so open wide little birds, come eat me alive.
> And its clear to me that Taylor has gotten sick of fans and the press judging her endlessly. So I wouldn't be surprised if she decided to throw a couple more Matty songs onto TTPD just to thumb her nose at those who judge her.

During my end-of-year reddit summary, it told me the 2023 thread with my most activity was one of the big Matty/Taylor threads here. I wasn't overly emotional, so it wasn't *quite* at "Leave Taylor Alone" levels, but it was close. It's like, dude, she just got out of a six-year relationship, she's rebounding while being on the biggest tour of her life, and now y'all are holding her responsible for some douchey things he said on some podcast and expecting her to breakup and/or issue some kind of official distancing statement within the span of a single trending cycle.
she says this explicitly in Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus: "Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules / all to outrun my desertion of you"
I totally agree. I don’t think she was pining for him for ten years as I’ve seen people say. I don’t think she started viewing him as a “what if” until around 2022 when he reentered her life, which kickstarted the infatuation. she felt stuck and bored with joe and matty was there. She kind of latched onto him in a way. Like she said, it was a manic phase, not a love affair
Thank you so much for your kind words! I will likely make a part 2 with the anthology songs, I just want to give myself more time to analyze it :)

Oh yes I agree with this! I think she felt powerless, and overwhelmed by her guilt for believing the con. That’s why the phantoms of their relationship are so embarrassed - she knows how much she’s let the both of them down by exiting like this, and by believing in the scam in the first place.
Yes I love this reading! I think she’s haunted by Joe, and this theme is embedded throughout the album. I don’t think she’s that heartbroken over Matty, I think she’s heartbroken that she fell for the con. That she let him lure her in with exactly the right promises to make her ignore her judgement and reason.
I had this take too.  There was something more sacred about what she had with Joe, even if it ended with a layer of resentment over the life they didn’t build together.  She didn’t air that out at the same level of her past lesser relationships, showing how different it was.  Matty was just another picture to burn, so to speak.  He gets the villain treatment.
I feel like we know enough about Joe with midnights, like you're losing me explicitly tells everything. I doubt there's much more to say, he didn't do anything and it's done. Now, she's writing about the aftermath of it all, how she reached insanity, this chaos, and while the songs are about Matty, it only hurts this much about Matty cuz of the underlying Joe stuff. She's definitely mad at herself.
I’ve been in a situation where I ended a long term relationship then directly into a burning, passionate situationship before, it’s torture, the person is giving you so much of themselves, but nothing at the same time, it’s confusing and healing. You feel wanted but rejected, it’s a twisted mindfuck. This album hit me in all the feels.
Don’t forget-she put it in the prologue that she writes the worst men the best 🙃
I think we're forgetting that she's eulogised Joe many, many times between Evermore to Midnights. 

There's fresh pain with Matty, plus it's a much more complex situation. There's not much to say except sadness that her and Joe didn't work out, but she really feels like Matty screwed her over intentionally, promising her the world and then leaving her high and dry. 

There's so much more to process there. 

The fascinating thing for me in the wash-up of this album release is the reckoning Swifties have to come to terms with: Matty meant far more to her than I think many of us realised at the time.
This is fair, and I think the reason is because the entanglement with Matty
 
a) accurately depicts the mania she felt. she genuinely felt like she was careening off a cliff, and he was in the passenger seat. then he jumps out…but the car still crashes! and now the only person she can reckon with is herself. why was she in the car in the first place?

b) joe and matty might be more alike than we realize, in terms of their treatment towards her. again, she describes one as an oven, and one as a microwave - both leave her in the same state. both leave her broken, for different reasons. by working through her anger towards one, she’s able to work through her anger towards another. the only difference is, she thinks one person’s actions were genuinely malicious, and the other’s wasn’t.
My interpretation of the MH songs have been more Taylor looking at herself. He’s part of her anger, but a lot of the lyrics are also critical of herself - positively and negatively. Almost like she’s constantly fighting with herself during the relationship for however long it went.

At least the Anthology has the Joe songs — and she treats him with such love and grace. Those songs made me feel better about having to hear so much gushing over MH.

It's just so sad that her and Joe fizzled out like that — not with a bang, but a whimper. It just died, and something about that is deeply depressing to me.
I was gonna come here and comment that this is the best and most accurate review/reading that I’ve seen too!
Because those of us who had our own experience that was scarily similar to her, we need all those songs to help us on our journey out. She didn't just make this music for her, she made it for us.
[deleted]
It was a case of "you tried to kill me but it killed you just the same". 

She wanted this album to be so huge and epic, even if not generally liked, that there was no doubt in fans' minds who they should be attacking after the release.


P.S. Turns out it's her. 😆
But I think she was aiming at Matty.
However, if she hates herself enough then she may feel she deserves all this blowback too...
Makes me sad.
I think the miracle drug was her slotting Matty into the dreams she built for years with Joe. She new relationship energied him into being her new Joe, she invested hook line and sinker into him being her forever, romanticizing the missed connection. She probably wouldn't have felt that way about him if it was just an organic relationship.

I also think that's why so many songs kind of sound like they're about Joe, then you suddenly get hit with something that makes them a Matty song. Matty was her grieving process in retrospect.
as much as i dislike MH, the songs about him are really the best ones “write the worst men best” as she says
I think the MH songs weren’t just about the recent entanglement. I think he was an old flame that she may have thought about through the years…that “what if” “what could have been” relationship that she pined after. She reconnected with a hope for a different outcome. So it hit deeper and harder than a regular rebound would have. This was a different kind of pain because it was a grief for what happened then, what happened this time round, on top of the end with Joe. It was rage, sorrow, and anger for more than just the rebound.
Pride as an artist? 

Now that she controls her creative dominion, she doesn’t have anyone limiting her to thirteen songs on an album. She created this music from her emotional upheaval and wants to share it all. 

Or maybe it is more business and knowing that people will be talking about a 31 song album.
On top of what others have already written, my theory is she (and her team) are shifting the discourse onto MH on purpose, either out of respect for Joe's privacy or maybe even contracts. A lot of Swifties on Twitter have been actively looking for any reason to hate him and even desperately try to frame the fact that he's sharing the album with MH as a diss to him, when it could easily be a favour to him.
Without what happened with Matty you don’t get this album.  In a weird way he was her muse and the reason she put pen to paper to heal from not only him but ultimately her relationship from Joe as well.  As someone who blew up their own life in a very short amount of time I can understand why after the storm or during it that it’s all consuming.  Once it’s all said and done you have to look at the wreckage you caused, pick up the pieces and fix things.  It seems like for her that’s through writing.
I think the songs are about her
I sincerely think it's because she and Matty have had an emotional entanglement for the past 10 years. It sounds like he's the one who she would consistently run to when things weren't going well in her relationships, not just Joe. I wouldn't be surprised if MANY of her older songs are actually about Matty, when we think they're about someone else. She's said she purposely leads the fans to believe songs are about incorrect people. I think she and Matty have at least been "talking" (as the kids say) for YEARS and the opportunity to get together finally happened this past summer and, well, the rest is history.
I agree, I’d have liked it better if she put it in a couple of songs and refined them a little more instrumentally as well as lyrically.
To be honest. I don't understand why it needed so many songs to expose he's a twat. I'm not been funny. I could have told her this in a sentence
It was so shocked by the sheer amount of Matty material until I really thought about her perspective.  Matty wasn’t just someone she met, he was the frontman of her favorite band when they met.  That is a hugely important dynamic, fantasizing about your musician crush for 10 years and then getting out of a long and complex relationship, and finally getting the thing you dreamed about for a decade.  And it sounds like he came on very intensely which would make it all so much worse when he inexplicably left.  You can tell it left her questioning her sanity.  It is truly impressive but very sad that she managed to keep it all together enough that her very scrutinizing fans didn’t even pick up on how devastated she was.
As she said, it's the worst men she writes best.
I think she just knows we’ll all listen to every single one of them so if they’re half decent she might as well release them, there’s money in those plays.
Because ‘she writes the worst men the best’.
i think it’s a fair assumption that most of the songs aren’t about one person
You are so kind! And I agree. She was grieving both at once, which was paralyzing. And trying to get past the shame and embarrassment of putting herself in the position of having to grieve both at once.
How dare you. 😭
Let me just say, this album in general made me emotional but one point that really hit me in the feels was the transition from How Did It End? to So High School. 
One track is about processing the grief and loss of her breakup with Joe. It’s heartbreaking and already made me emotional…but to go from that to the happiness and light I felt in So High School really really got me. 
After everything she went through as outlined in this album, getting this sliver of light just hit so different. She just sounds so happy now. 🥹
Im convinced Alchemy is about him and it’s about how love has never been the real thing (fools gold) but how can she fight it and pairing it with So High School it paints a sweet picture of recovering from the heart break. I do also think that the back half of But Daddy I love him is about Travis due to it ending with her happy and her parents approving despite what everyone else says. People did hate on Travis just not nearly as bad as MH (for obvious reasons)
Alright nah
And THAT’S why I am 100% convinced that Taylor and Travis will end up with the happily ever after. She went through hell as her relationship with Joe started to crumble and then the poison that was Matty. I can’t see her with someone for (almost) a year unless it was the real thing. 

And Travis is the opposite of Joe and Matty. 

I’ll die on this hill. They are the American equivalent of Will and Kate.
_So High School_ is so cuuuute
it isn't clear to me that she is not exactly that type of tortured poet. her new relationship came at the right time for her to move forward. one thing is clear to me: taylor carries her traumas forward in her psyche the way most sensitive people do. she had yet to fully heal from her earliest traumas as she keeps telling us in song after song. she ruminates. that can be a good thing or a bad thing if take too far. hopefully, she can start healing now by really examining what she is doing internally. all the very best wishes for this to happen.
Absolutely this. I love it because I feel like there’s such a true dichotomy in every woman’s life where like her personal life is in shambles and she just screamed but I love you down the hallway but 10 minutes later she’s in a meeting because Her job isn’t gonna job itself. It’s like the true stories of our lives not the the pretty ones we tell people or the final happy love story it’s the mess in between while we still continue our lives
I think it's vice versa - Taylor the artist was performing (putting on a show) and Taylor the person was dying and crying inside. Taylor the person is the real one (who feels). Taylor the artist is a fake persona, a performer, an actor (who acts like she feels). 

Still a fascinating human being. And I do believe she is a tortured poet within her artistic Taylor. It's like an outlet for her emotions. In any case she is definitely a talented poet.
Thank you! I also see a LOT of parallels to the OG Red release. Red TV was a triumph for Taylor, and I think it makes people forget what the original response to the album was. People had the exact same criticism as they do for TTPD, and public sentiment around her was not exactly encouraging either. But with time, it's now regarded as one of her pivotal works, and as an excellent depiction of one's first heartbreak.
I agree with this, I think people are too quick to paint him as insincere based on their already negative opinion of him. I think people are underestimating how hard that public backlash must've been, the man has literally started going grey over the past year. I can see a reality where he left because he genuinely believed that was best for her, even though he did love her. Yes, she is angry at him in some songs (for good reason), but overall it just seems incredibly tragic and sad.
Excellent comment. I also just wanted to point out that the Lost Boys is an early 1975 song and that Matty has described himself as "a Peter Pan of sorts" numerous times.
I personally don’t think ‘he was the one that got away’. Or at least I don’t think Taylor is representing him that way. He was an old flame that when she was at her lowest emotionally in her relationship, he showed up and tried to lure her with passion and promises of love. She was at a bad place in her relationship with Joe and they were stagnant, so she left Joe and got with Matty. Then MH turned out to be the asshole that everyone knows he is, and she is grieving losing the love with Joe and feeling ashamed and guilty around thinking she could really deal with the pain of the loss of her love with Joe by just trying to stick another guy in that slot. 

That’s my two cents
I think 'Question...?' in midnights was inspired by Matty because according to a rumor they kissed in front of a room of people (also, 'politics and gender roles and you're not sure...'). 

That being said, we're seeing him and his actions through Taylor's filters in TTPD, and it's not one thing- it's a spectrum, as is expected. In Down Bad, she thinks leaving her 'safe and stranded' was a romantic sacrfice he made, in 'Smallest Man...' she thinks he just ghosted her and it was shitty, in Peter, she's coming to terms with the idea that the truth is somewhere in between ('promises ocean deep, but never to keep'... but 'we both did the best we could').
Exactly! Had to add this in another comment as well. It’s so obvious looking at how she chose the psych ward as the place for this albums
So kind, thank you so much!
it is true that there are few perplexing lines. it seems to me that taylor often writes about more than one person in the same song as she may see the similarities are sometimes more important than the differences or the heart mixes up the feelings. the sign on your heart might refer to things lasting past the first phase of their relationship. and perhaps travis's past immature choices and behaviors are forgiven and erased from importance now. travis definitely made some not so good and embarrassing choices in the past.
I know I’m not op and I’ve commented it elsewhere but I think it is about falling in love with Travis and alchemy is referencing how she has been looking for true love (real gold) but it’s only ever been fools gold but who is she to not try again.
> Maybe Taylor confided in Travis, and we know his humor is sometimes silly

No, this is exactly it. Travis making a joke about MH's drug use in a silly way.
I fully believe The Alchemy is about Travis and the song placement makes sense in the arc of the album. She’s done with MH in Smallest Man and the next song is hopeful about her new love. I think it’s her who is coming back to her self - no longer sad and now “coming back so strong.” I’ve read different thoughts on “still” - there was a gap between the concert in KC when he was turned away and when she was ready and/or willing to speak with him, which seems to be early August. So his heart was still open to her when she was open to the idea of him. 
I have a new thought on the heroine line based on someone on X. She switches to “he” here when she has been singing to “you.” I suspect this is a third party - maybe Jack - joking that this new relationship is heroin again in that it’s addictive but this time with an ‘e’ because TK worships her so much and sees her as a heroine. Plus I can’t see TK making jokes about her exes addiction - it doesn’t seem to be who he is. So much of the song is blatantly TK down to him running to her rather than the trophy (she is his trophy) that bringing MH into it doesn’t make any sense to me.
I saw something about the heroin line. Heroin is the drug, but heroine (with an e) is the female hero in a story. He sees her as a hero 🥹🥹🥹
I find it funny that the school line can reference either of them. There's an episode of Travis' podcast from the end of last summer telling the story of how he and his brother got kicked out of preschool. He also, notoriously, got kicked off his college team for a year over a doping violation for weed and it's obviously still a painful topic for him. I remember once reading that MH got kicked out of school too so that aspect can be both of them! 
i think she's using the metaphors from Endgame because when she was in it with Matty she thought he was endgame. She would love the second chance romance trope of it all. She bought into her own fatalism. We just see SPORTS and immediate Travis. I, unfortunately, think it's a Matty song about the fate of a rekindled romance (how could we fight the alchemy?)
I found my people in this comment section 😍🎉
I noticed this as well! In so long London and how did it end ( both obviously songs about her long term breakup with Joe) both seemed to have an overall sad feeling and undertone to them rather than mad or resentful. Which you clearly get in tracks like the smallest man who ever lived about matty. I actually thought after I listened to this album that there felt like there was no outright bashing of Joe or their relationship but more honest reflections and thoughts she had of their relationship. And that it seemed she still carried respect for him.
Neither Joe nor Taylor nor anyone of us could foresee the Midnights and Eras  level of fame and stardom - especially pre Reputation when they got together. 


She says he was a hothouse flower and she was an outdoorsman: for two such different personalities to work out in the spotlight sadly is almost impossible. Especially if one person shrinks from it and the other blooms in it.
So so kind. Thank you!!!
Thank you! A wonderful addition to the original post. I see it just the same.
I think she missed the passion. The passion in her relationship with Joe was over. They had grown distant, and there was growing resentment and a lack of communication. (think of when YLM was written).... So, I think she was just seeking passion and excitement. She tried to reignite that passion with Joe but it just wasn't there anymore so when something/someone new came along and showed that passion towards her, she wanted to feel that again, to feel wanted and seen which was no longer happening with Joe. Despite being with Joe, she was actually lonely, but willing to go down with the ship with him if he would have wanted her to. So she went for the quick fix with Matty and all the things he promised her that she wanted with Joe, and it backfired and made her feel worse.
As she sings in the 1 the greatest films are the ones that are never made. We build up the what-if short-lived relationships so much because it has never been lived out..


Taylor being a romantic can understand how this held a decade long appeal especially when things got hard in her long term relationship.


Probably this album is a release in a way 
You know about matty acting out..I’d say it doesn’t matter who did the leaving if you actually wanted to have that person for you. He might’ve just been bitter that someone else gets to have her. Humans are complicated and messy and often we don’t act according to our past intentions.  
He might’ve left her on read for whatever reason but despite that he still might be kinda pissed that she’s happy with someone else and not him
your painting matty as villain because you don’t like him but the truth is this situation is very complex. taylor and matty have been friends for a long time and they reconnected and both emotionally cheated on their partners at the time with each other when working on stuff for midnights and bfiafl. they also briefly dated or hooked up in 2014 but didn’t have serious relationship because that’s when matty was on drugs and his band had just started to take off so it was basically wrong timing. I don’t doubt that he love bombed taylor because he’s also been vocal about wanting kids and marriage so I think they both did it to each other but ultimately the backlash and death threats pushed matty to leave taylor so she’s better off without all of his mess. taylor even alludes to this in some of the songs saying “leaving me safe and stranded.” matty also had to leave nyc because he had to go back on tour so it’s not like he just ghosted her out of nowhere. whatever happened after that idk maybe he did stop responding and that was fucked up but you also have to give him some grace, he also had a very rough year and he showed that on stage. also the “i win” was said when he was dedicating songs to her at his concert because he was genuinely very happy. he really did want to pursue things with taylor but a lot of shit got in the way after they went public. i feel bad for both parties.
Thank you! I run a tumblr, where I do post thoughts, but unfortunately it's private. I would recommend the platform in general though, as there's an excellent swiftie community there that I find significantly less toxic than most social media circles.

I said it in a different comment, but I'll post a writeup for the anthology separately! To answer your question though, right now, I think the anthology is not just a deluxe edition, it's a double album. I think that album treats the situations outlined here differently, and the way it connects to fame and her overall career is deeper than it is on this set of songs. How Did It End feels like a response to the voyeurism of the public, first and foremost, and moreover, it feels like a response to herself. I don't think she knows why it ended, or can distill it easily into words. And I think the deeper message of that song is giving a lesson on the harm of public interest, hence its position on the second album.

So High School feels like an epilogue of sorts. Notice how she describes alcohol and drugs on this album - she's spiraling through them, or because of them, typically because of the muses around her. In So High School, her love interest is enough to make her feel high and drunk. It's a very different way to describe substances that are a part of her undoing in the first album, and a much happier song in general.
Yes! I really wish i could buy other people nuanced brains sometimes 👀
Agreeeed. I think it’s clear in this album that matty and honestly herself  is who most of the anger is directed at. Obviously she’s fustrated at matty for seemingly love bombing her/ making her all these promises he can’t keep to her and allegedly ghosting her/ ending things quickly. But she’s also upset at herself for believing in matty/ buying into what he had to say and some of the choices she made with him.  But The references and songs clearly about Joe and their breakup like so long London and how did it end, express more sadness than anger. But stans convinced for some reason that Joe is this horrible evil person just because he and Taylor broke up  will obviously think any negative song is about him.
I don’t believe she carried a torch for Matty the whole time, she seemed pretty smitten with Joe for rep and lover but the anxiousness and themes of mistrust and mental health struggles were in the background, Taylor seemed to believe back then they could overcome these issues but subsequent albums show they began to outweigh the good parts of their relationship. 

Matty seemingly swooped in and gave her the attention she felt lacking from Joe and made promises of commitments Joe had avoided, that can be very intoxicating when you’ve felt under appreciated for so long, that coupled with the fact she’d had a situationship with him before and her being a hopeless romantic it probably helped soften the pain of ending a 6 year relationship to think you were leaving it for the guy you had always been destined for. 

I think Matty has probably mythicised Taylor so much throughout the years that she was never going to match up to the idea of her he had created, I don’t know that much about the 1975 behind their music but I’ve seen a lot of their fans say he seemed pretty upset in the immediate aftermath of the break up and the lyrics “don’t you dare think it’s romantic leaving me safe and stranded” makes me think he probably did ghost more over the public reaction rather than just not wanting to be with her and he probably sold it to mutual friends as him protecting her and saving her reputation but Taylor doesn’t seem to buy that tale and more so thinks he’s just a coward who checked out once the thrill of the chase was over. 

It also appears Joe/Taylor may have took some breaks during their relationship but once Taylor stepped out with Matty she was closing the door completely on the chance to ever rekindle and throwing her reputation right back in the viper pit of public scrutiny, all for nothing but false promises. 

This was an essay sorry but as a Taylor fan and a gossip lover this album and the situation it’s covering is entertaining.
Woah you just gave me the thought- what if the "love of her life" is actually "children". I need to go back and listen to loml again.
Question & Maroon are about him going by the TTPD references.


I remember being shocked at Question when Midnights came out. 


I guess in a long term relationship something like the promise of what Matty was especially as it was building in bits over a decade can at th right time feel like a meteor strike.


Only they also crash and burn .
When I saw that in the Epilogue (whole sky) I thought about BTTWS as well, the lyrics totally make sense now

*every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness*

*you were more than just a short time*
Ooh I have a different reading of Bigger Than The Whole Sky. So firstly, one of her close friends confirmed with an Instagram caption after midnights came out that they had a stillbirth, and tagged it as bigger than the whole sky. So I’m pretty sure the direct inspiration is that, and I’ll leave it at that to not invite speculation about it.

But the more interesting thing to me is why did it strike her so much that she felt compelled to write? And to me, it feels like she’s also grieving the loss of a child - almost as if she’s grieving what she feels like she won’t have. In Lavender Haze, we see her do a 180 on marriage. It was jarring at the time, but I think a lot of people chalked it up to her mindset on marriage shifting. But now, given the context of TTPD and You’re Losing Me, it’s clear that marriage and children are what she wants. So why did the situation of BTTS affect her so deeply? Is she grieving what she feels she has to give up to make her relationship work?
So technically I misspoke, it’s an epilogue poem. It’s at the back of the physical edition! (Photo from someone else in this reddit, I don’t remember who unfortunately)

Yeah, I get the undercurrent in her public statements and songs starting in 2019 that she still loves her fans but she will do whatever she wants regardless of what they or the press think.  I highly doubt pre-2016 Taylor would attend events like the UNO party at a cannabis restaurant or casually being in the vicinity of Ice Spice at Coachella or Travis' friends at the Super Bowl party smoking pot,   I think that's why she's been so productive because she no longer allows herself to be paralyzed by a need for public approval.
I would be willing to bet the broke up and got back together at least once before they broke up for good. Things always seemed so uncertain and she probably wanted to feel secure in the relationship because she like him so much but it seems like he had some stuff he was trying to work through. If anyone has seen insecure, I kind of picture Issa and Lawrence in the beginning 
Yeah she’s been writing about the downfall with Joe for several albums
Even "[I Can See You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_See_You_(song))"... The video itself has pretty much The 1975 box... like she's been locked in this Joe vault and needs to be broken out 
This is a really great point that you make. While I immediately understood the undertones of “fans/critics: leave me the fuck alone and let me live my life” (which, btw, so many dynamite lines related to this… “God save the most judgmental creeps who say they want what’s best for me, sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I’ll never see…” for one) in ttpd, I had a really hard time believing the entire album was Matty-related. Reading your comment really helped me make the connection. Because a theme of this album, running parallel to the main narratives, is that she’s gonna do her from now on (love all the “fucks” in the album too…it’s about time!) so it TOTALLY makes sense that she’d kinda say “fuck it, I have a bunch of songs about Matty and I need to excise this from my system so I’m releasing them all even knowing what they’ll say about it.” So thanks for that!
Agree that Midnights needs to be revisited, and I’ve tried a couple times, but mostly I just don’t connect with that album, sadly. It’s one of my least favorites.
You’re Losing Me + So Long, London say it all so completely. We already know there’s been highs and lows, we know marriage was an issue, likely the straw that broke the camel’s back, and we undoubtedly know how much she loved him. What’s left to say? 

I think we’ll get songs about him here and there, in the sense that she might write something wishing him well, or what she learned from that relationship, or what it’s like seeing them both move on, but no scathing breakup song is coming. She loved him so much and isn’t going to air his dirty laundry over what was a mutual breakup and a long time coming. So Long, London says what she needed to say, it’s a goodbye.
I don’t think it was. You’re Losing Me was clearly written in an extremely emotional period and lays all blame on Joe ‘giving up’. TTPD feels to me like after a period of reflection they both did. She may have already been checked out herself, considering the MH factor. Not to say she cheated but when you are no longer getting the validation from your partner, someone else giving you even an iota I’d attention can be intoxicating. The end of the relationship with Joe was far more complex than You’re Losing Me suggests.
Her own fans can be her worst enemies sometimes.  It’s annoying the stupid shit she gets attacked for sometimes by fans and haters like. She tries to be a good person who just wants to find love and entertain people and every minor thing gets magnified. 

She didn’t run a full background check on Matty to dig up a stupid joke he played along with on a podcast before she started dating him and she was treated like she said the stupid joke herself.  

They tried it with Travis by digging up 13-15 year old immature tweets from college but ultimately his tweet about feeding a piece of bread to a squirle(squirrel) won the day. They’ll keep trying to nail him but he seems like he just wants to play football and be a good person too. 
Preach
I agree! I think he was an old friend who was there when she left Joe and needed a distraction/replacement and he said the right things only for her to realize it wasn’t real and it was just covering up the grief which is why I read the black dog, the albatros and how did it end as being about Joe and her finally dealing with the grief of their relationship ending after having things end with MH
Exactly! He was an escape mechanism, a way for her to keep her belief in fate and love, to make the bitter pill of losing Joe easier to swallow.
A false safe escape hatch. Someone she thought she knew well for years, but turned out. She didn’t know anything at all about. 

Funny thing is like I said I think all these songs these two men are different sides of the same coin and stuff like this really shows it because how did her relationship with Joe start ? by jumping ship from Calvin. It really is the oven and the microwave.
EXACTLY. Like truly I don’t think she carried or harbored some deep real feelings for Matty for almost a decade haha. But then he re entered her life in 2022 and she started to fantasize about him a bit when  her relationship wasn’t in a good place at times/ ending. And like you said she’s clearly done a lot of reflecting and realized it wasn’t real but more a manic phase brought by the end of her relationship/ breakup with Joe and matty being in the right place at the right time.
Alexa, play getaway car
OP — I’ll read anything you write. This, and your responses, are beautiful and thoughtfully well-analyzed. Wow. 🙌🏼
I would appreciate that. I haven’t been able to get into the anthology as much as the original tracks and would love your insight into them!
I would add imgonnagetyouback to that list. It could apply to Joe, but it feels like it would be more about MH.
Love the bit about the ghosts! Yes! I also haven’t been able to stop thinking about Peter as her singing to joe, feeling guilty for leaving, but getting tired of waiting for him to be ready or for it to be the right time. She finally accepts that he will never be ready and she turns off the light.

Edit: I mean the right time to get married. She was hoping he would eventually mature enough to marry her and give her the certainty she desires, but she died on the altar waiting for proof :(
I love this and your whole original post, it’s so good. It also makes the matty songs easier to stomach😬 by looking at the as an extension of the aftermath of Joe
I just want to say that your writing style is incredibly readable and your thoughts are so clear and well formed. You are so good at expounding upon complex ideas. 

Basically, you should write a book.
Yes I agree with all of this!
Yes exactly!! Like she realized it  wasn’t “true love” with Matty, hence the “momentarily insanity” comment. But she did truly love Joe, even if she no longer is in love with him, and that’s why there aren’t as many heartbreaking songs about him
I'm two years out of my situationship and still dealing with the aftermath. But the divorce that preceded it I was over in months. Hoping this album is the background soundtrack to me finally moving the fuck on lol.
Also in this club. I think in a relationship there’s also a lot more control over the situation, you already know the person deeply and processed the breakup, often over a long period of time, and know it’s for the best. Whereas a traumatic situationship can end so abruptly, you’ve had no time to process anything. After being intimate and vulnerable, the other person is basically like eh I’ve seen enough and I want nothing more to do with you, and that hits such a core wound that a relationship — where somebody chooses you — often does not.
Ugh also been in this situation. This album is making me reprocess how it all went down too
Yes!!
Ditto.
This is also the perfect description to Florida!!!
Oh so that's why we didn't get much about Tom H and Taylor L? They are the cuties of the bunch. 😆
Exactly. She writes worst men best, but!!!! I just want to add that I 100% believe the worst pain was losing those important years of youth no question.
I also wonder if she has a whole album worth of songs about the break up with Joe just sitting in a studio somewhere because it’s just too personal to release and she knows how much he values that privacy and still refuses to violate that.
Ya I mean she summed it up in the epilogue with: 

*In summation It wasn’t a love affair*

*It was a mutual manic phase* 

*It was self harm*

So idk I think the idea of a soulmate meant a lot to her, but this makes it sound like he didn’t truly mean a lot to her, his promises did.

So I don’t think it’s just us ‘Swifties not coming to terms with it’, she actually said that it wasn’t love in her closing statements on the album
THIS. She got out of a relationship that went stale and gave her nothing. Being a person that wants marriage and babies it’s hard to be in your mid 30s and single when everybody around you isn’t. MH swoops in and starts talking marriage and babies so it gives this sense of relief and reassurance that she is on the right track. She’s fully bought in so when he bails she has to deal with the double loss and realizing she really is not where she wants to be.
I don’t think MH meant more, I think that he left more questions and to some extent also there is a “transference “ of pain. Think of this; in a long relationship that ends you know the person you know how you are not compatible how you can struggle and come back together and ultimately you know when it’s over. With a 2 week love affair which made you “feel” again all you see is good (at first) and all of the sudden you think as a romantic this is it and then he ghosts. All you have are questions. Did you do the right thing by leaving your relationship? Will you find someone else? Why did this new person also leave? Why ghost in the first place? You don’t know how things would have turned out if he would have stayed. You don’t know how you’re not compatible. So yes, there are many things to work through there because there are more questions.
I still have no idea who he is, and I completely forgot she dated him.  That said, Taylor goes hard for love, and it doesn't surprise me that something we barely registered actually meant a whole lot to her.  Especially if he was promising her everything she wanted and she'd just ended a relationship where she never got what she wanted.  When you wear your heart on your sleeve, it's far too easy for people to take advantage of that.  Especially predatory douche bags.
Yeah I have to be honest (and I know it’s parasocial/stupid) I can barely get past feelings of  “ick”/confusion listening to these songs being about Matty and her being sooo into him (in love!!). I’m sure he has redeeming qualities  but blegh could you imagine if he never broke it off? How long would she be this in deep with him? Anyway glad we will never know. And I’ll get over him being the subject matter in time lol
As someone recently out of an LTR (too bad YLM wasn't on streaming until November, it definitely would've cracked my 2023 Spotify top 5) I was really looking forward to a Joe album for my own selfish main character reasons, but I also fully understand why it's *not* a Joe album.

Nothing big or dramatic happened, she was just bored and tired. I think she'd also already said nearly everything she'd needed to say about him.
Ovens take a long time to burn something. Microwaves can burn it in seconds. She got burned twice. The first one took years. The second one happened in a few months. To use a different metaphor, she jumped out of the frying pan and directly into the fire.
Adding on to the getaway car comparison and the similarities between Matty/Joe narratives, "conman sells a fool get love quick schemes" seems to reference one of the reputation magazine poems about being wary of "get love quick schemes". fool me twice?
I agree with this take. It also fits the yin/yang imagery — they (and the relationships) might be opposites, but they’re the same pieces, really. That’s why so many songs could be about both of them (the “2” of it all!!).
I think you're so spot on with all of this, but also we don't know Joe. I keep thinking that as I relisten. We have a parasocial relationship with him through the lens she wished to show him to us... which isn't the true real version of him and therefore if you boil down some of the lyrics (I'd argue even some of the drug related lyrics), we don't know if those are about Joe or Matty.

I've always believed her lyrics are so strong because you could apply them to the person we assume they are about, someone else, the person you (the listener) dated, etc. Through the years I've believed some of her lyrics that we think are about one person could be about more than one, or an amalgamation.
I agree with this entire take. Well done.
“Why was she in the car in the first place?” I love this. At the end of the day we can point fingers at those who hurt us but it’s also healthy to ask ourselves why we put them in our life/kept them around.
My big take away from the album (about Joe ) is that he likely struggles with depression. I think your point about Taylor understanding whats holding Joe back touched on this. But, it's also why I think Taylor holds love for him, despite it not working out between them.
Agree, I also think there may be the fact that Matty's an easier target than Joe who (even if if ended badly) she may have wanted to protect a little more.
The drug of getting with someone you’ve held a candle for for years is also very, very powerful. Then if they leave quickly it feels like withdrawal. I unfortunately know this from experience.
It’s more of that “it’s me, hi. I’m the problem; it’s me.”
Perfectly said. I don’t think any of us are privy to the exact details of their relationship. They’ve known each other for ten years. I suspect that it was a “one that got away, what could be?”, see each other on breaks from their other relationships, sort of thing.  

I don’t agree with Matty’s comments and general controversies, but man, it has to be traumatizing as fuck to have millions of people that don’t personally know you (or your boyfriend) harassing you to the point your relationship ends.
I think that’s why she put in the prologue:

‘“In summation, it was not a love affair!” I screamed while bringing my fists to my coffee ringed desk’

Because we were all brushing it off and acting like it didn’t happen when it really really meant something to her.
Exactly, it’s a blip. We don’t know what happened behind closed doors or how deep things got. But I’ve been in a similar situation and when your going through a traumatic event In your life, you don’t think clearly and will grab ahold of anything to help
You feel some type of joy.
I think this is correct.
I really don't think Peter is about Matty. It might be about more than one ex. I will keep my further thoughts to myself right now. I cried to Peter.
I don’t think Peter is that literal
Totally agree, How Did It End is such a haunting song too 😔 we all thought it was gonna be this big scandal, and it really just died so sadly
True. I just can't wrap my head around how her perfect boyfriend, the one she wrote some (or rather all except a few for Harry) of her most romantic songs, the one who grounded her and got her out of the worst public phase of her life during the reputation era, could not end up at the aisle with her. I'm not sure if it was about him but for me 'he stayed the same, all of me changed like midnight rain' summarises their relationship best. Joe is a private person. He loved Taylor and wanted to give her everything. She wanted him but the fame too, which she works tirelessly to achieve. I feel that's why there was a tonal shift. Folklore and evermore were sombre. Even she knew they weren't going to be that big. But midnights was an all out pop banger. She realised she just can't put away the public star in her. They both had love, but sometimes love isn't enough, their lives needed to align too.
What songs do you think are the Joe songs from the entire album?
That’s true!
And he is somehow *fucking flattered* at being portrayed as such. Clearly this man is a toxic narcissist who gets off on being the centre of attention and doesn’t care who he hurts once he gets what he wants. Like. Anyone who wasn’t a sociopath would feel fucking terrible hearing this album and knowing they were the cause.
he doesn't care about this inevitable reveal. she wrote the songs because she needed to. she released them because they are good.
I wish I had this ability when my ex ghosted me after a three month relationship. So all the more power to her to call this behavior out as cowardly as it is.
Falling hard for someone just to be ghosted is such a soul crushing feeling
Maybe her closing this chapter is her saying she’s not going to do this self-sabotage anymore.
Yes exactly my thoughts too!!! Nailed it
Ya I think I’m finally now picking up on the deeper meanings, it took me awhile 😅
Hmm she could have pared it down, but I think what matters most to her right now is being as honest as possible, even to the point of opening herself up for public criticism. I think this is a realization she's come to after releasing vault tracks for each re-record. Previously, we were getting the sanitized version of each album. For example, in Speak Now, the song we get about the VMA incident is Innocent, a song that took her 9 months to write. But the song she wrote immediately post the incident was Castles Crumbling. The song that makes it to the album is her forgiving the perpetrator, and there's almost no reference to her own thoughts on the incident. But the song she leaves off is heartbreaking, and discusses the crushing fear she has that this house-of-cards of fame will collapse at any moment. The songs she leaves off of Red are the ones really showing the depth of her despair of the Jake breakup, and her fear of aging in the industry.

I think her lesson from the re-records is to stop editorializing and sanitizing her own diary. She wants to release the messiness. She wants to release the most raw version of her story possible. She doesn't want to feel like she's holding anything back, and I wonder if she feels like she works through things quicker when she releases her complete version of events. She alludes to this in the Manuscript - she discusses how the way we transformed All Too Well for her has made that experience less painful, and made her look at it with open, less biased eyes:

*She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years*

*Everything had been above board*

*She wasn't sure*

But she describes how the passage of time, and writing about it, has made her realize her own purpose of doing it - to heal:

*And the years passed*

*Like scenes of a show*

*The professor said to write what you know*

*Lookin' backwards*

*Might be the only way to move forward*

*//*

*And at last*

*She knew what the agony had been for*
Fans have been talking about and begging for a double album and more music for YEARS. So I think that largely impacted her decision. She obviously writes a lot of songs for each album, as we've seen from the re-records (and we know she isn't even releasing all of the songs she wrote for those albums either) and the public's response to those has been overwhelming. So I think she's just running with what she wants now that she can.
I'm joking but she probably realized she ran out of surprise songs on the Eras tour and had to add 31 more.
Ya I see that now
Ya I’m finally now realizing that aspect of this album!
I mean she writes in the epilogue:

*it wasn’t a love affair* 

*it was a mutual manic phase* 

*it was self harm* 

And in Fortnight which is somewhat a prologue to the story of the whole album:

*I took the miracle move on drug/ the effects were temporary* 

I don’t think she would write those things when recounting the relationship if MH meant more to her than basically a rebound. 

In my personal opinion, it feels like the takeaway from the MH situation was really just this manic rebound that she was using to hide from her pain around her long term relationship dying. 

It seems like the album is split into songs about her POV during MH, which appear manic, obsessed, lustful, infatuated and then songs after MH where her POV is reflective, ashamed, regretful. So when she sings about being so in love, it seems like that was just her POV in her manic state of mind, not real true love, in her words. 

The OP explained it well in another comment that the idea of fate and soulmates is very important to Taylor. So when the ‘fate’ and ‘soulmate’ aspect with Joe was dying, she in her heartbroken state clung to the man that was weaseling his way into her relationship, and he made her those promises of ‘soulmate’ ’marriage’ ’family’ so she decided it must be ‘fate’ all along in order to basically dull the pain of being in a 6 year relationship and having it not lead to marriage and children. Then when she retrospectively looks back, she realizes it wasn’t love at all as she writes in the epilogue and that it was ‘temporary insanity’. 

That’s just my two cents.
Same! I really appreciate the dichotomy from How Did It End to So High School. I was crying for a hot minute listening to HDIE on repeat and then listened to So High School and was like alright it’s gonna be okay 🥹
[deleted]
But Daddy I love him is her just being fed up with people coming at her for whoever she dates. There was a lot of talk about her and Matty and even more about her and Travis. Everyone feels entitled to have their opinion on who she does or doesn’t date
Nah, they’re the American posh and becks
> They are the American equivalent of Will and Kate.

ew no, can we not?
I wish it was true but I have a bad feeling about it. She never had a break between men. She never got proper therapy. So, maybe Travis is a good match but did they have a good stable base to build upon? Time will show. 

A year is a lot but not really if people like fooling themselves or don't spend as much time together as desired. So, technically they may have been together together not that much. They were super busy most of last year.
>  the American equivalent of Will and Kate.

So, who's Rose?
I think Taylor has needed a guy as passionate as she is and willing to fight for her as much as she was willing to fight for her. I’m sure the other guys have fine qualities, but they didnt seem to have that kind of fire about her that he does
No no they’re the American version of posh and becks! 
That's what y'all said for Joe. Can we not predict someone's future relationships just in general? You never know what happens, ever.
The songs about him are so bland and surface level. I don’t think she has the same depth of feeling for Travis
I’m with you.
Do we ever get over our childhood traumas or do we just learn to live with them? Because I feel like it’s completely normal not to let go your life story. Moving on isn’t truly about forgetting anything in my opinion. And the moment you stop analyzing your whole life is the moment you stop growing
Such a good point. I think the narrative about this album down the line will be how badly she wanted marriage and motherhood (emphasis on the later).
Thank you for saying this. I completely understand Taylor’s anger but I hope that with distance she can see her part in that relationship’s demise. She literally stood by and let her fans actively rip him to shreds and had her team put out PR pieces stating they were just hanging out. That had to hurt.
It's probable it wasn't so much love as infatuation, given that they were barely ever really together. But, imo, with lyrics like "Down bad (Like I lost my twin)" and "You're the loss of my life" she was really hammering down on how important Matty was to her and presents him that way.

But mostly I only disagree with OP on whether Matty "had no interest in ever delivering on his promises". I think he was sincere and just got scared off again. The New Yorker interview and Taylor in TTPD the song point to that too.
THIS. I think Taylor portrayed matty as the guy who fucked her over / love bombed her.  Made her all these promises and declarations of love only to ghost her/ leave suddenly and be full of shit. Because honestly it probably was not real for matty. And Taylor clearly knows now that  he came along at a low point for her  and kinda took advantage of the situation and the end of her relationship with Joe.
yes thank you for saying this! I think a lot of people are focusing on smallest man only and their negative associations with matty to paint him as the villain when in reality taylor doesn’t even do that herself either. she includes so many other songs about how good their relationship was but ultimately got ruined by all the backlash and the fact that they were both on tour. I think people forget that matty and taylor were really good friends first so it makes sense that she still cares about him since they connected on an artistic level as well. people also keep saying that he ghosted her so he didn’t actually care about her and just manipulated her but like he had to leave for tour out of  the country and wasn’t going to be able to whether out the storm of backlash together. that coupled with the death threats his band mates and family was receiving at the time it makes sense why he would decide to end the relationship even if he did really love her, she says it too “leave me better off.” this situation is very nuanced and I do feel for taylor but I also feel for matty a lot since it’s true he’s been having a terrible year and he’s been honest about that. it’ll be good to see what music he puts out that can help us also see his pov
My husband noticed the same thing in tortured poets dept. I think it’s very clear the song is about Matty but he pointed out the ate seven bars of chocolate is a strange line give Travis’ number is 87 (ate-seven). I was floored he made this connection right away and it had totally gone over my head. And to be honest the golden retriever line also feels more reminiscent of Travis than Matty. Eating seven bars of chocolate is sooo specific she had to have picked that number on purpose for a reason. As to why it would be in a Matty song though is very puzzling.
Well said
I look forward to your review on The Anthology!
love your mind. thank you
I think she calls the relationship the loss of her life because this whole debacle is hands down her biggest and most traumatic breakup to date. 

But yes. She was promised marriage and children by both of these men and she believed them and was willing to ruin herself for them.
Thank you! My packages are somewhere in Kansas so I hadn’t seen this yet 🫶🏻
To be fair, cannabis became legal in a lot of states/more widely accepted in this timeframe too
It’s been such an interesting experience. I’ve been listening to the album on repeat and making so many new connections. For example, in the song “Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus” there’s the lyric about him seeing her bones out with someone who would’ve bullied him in school. People are interpreting it as Travis, but I think it’s about Calvin Harris because the song is reflecting over the decade of their friendship. I believe the use of bones is a commentary on how thin she was due to her eating disorder. There’s also a line that I feel connects to the “Karma” music video. She says, “I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools…” which fits the imagery of her as the golden goddess statue (1989), demon in hades as the villain (reputation), and the fool Dorothy waving to the reapers (Lover). Anyway, just a few thoughts I’ve had more recently. 😁
I completely agree and said so in a comment. Taylor will never go scorched earth on Joe. The songs attributed to him are sad and wistful. Not angry and petty.
Totally. It's not even about being a true "fan" or not. It's about realizing she's a fellow human fucking being and treating her as such.
It's just occurred to me maybe that's what she means in "The Alchemy" about Travis' 15 year old Tweets.  


Hey, you, what if I told you we're cool?  
That child's play back in school  
Is forgiven under my rule
Plus I’m sure Travis’ online presence has been scrubbed clean since he’s been in the NFL tbh
Re: Travis’s tweets

What if I told you we’re cool / that child’s play back in school / is forgiven under my rule
100% I’ve seen some fans try to make it into a 10 year on and off relationship which is just…….insane. there wasn’t even a relationship in 2014 imo, which i think she confirmed with “i keep recalling things we never did, messy top lip kiss” he was likely just someone she was flirty at a concert and maybe hung out with a couple times. not her big “what if?”. him reentering her life in 2022 and the slow dissolution of her and joe probably had her fantasizing about matty a ton and viewing him in a different light. A lot of this album is about joe and how her diving into the matty relationship made her grief 100x more painful. I saw someone say that joe cooked her in an oven for 6 years and matty microwaved her. Matty did all the damage joe did at lightning speed.
And as we all know… nothing good starts in a getaway car
Oh my goodness that is so kind. Thank you so so much :))
Yeah I'd put it after Down Bad. Still has that manic edge whereas I Can Do It is a little more acceptance (although still says, so obsessed with him lol)
I agree with this the most especially since she often referred to Joe and her as a ghost/phantom.
Yes, I think Peter is about Joe too. Just the way at the end that she said she tried

I feel that this album has a lot of sadness towards Joe, anger towards Matty/herself and happiness towards Trav. 

It’s not entirely accurate but that’s how I feel when I listen to the songs
I don't know, the "said you were gonna grow up and you were gonna come find me" really seems to me as Matty telling her over the years that he knows that he's not ready to settle down, but when he is, he hopes she'll be single so he can "come find her" and then they can settle down. And that's what she (and probably he on some self-deluded level) thought he was doing, but turns out he hadn't grown up and he wasn't ready after all.

Peter Pan is also someone who appears and disappears in and out of Wendy's life. That matches who Matty was to her way more than Joe. I never got "super immature" vibes from him, just maybe someone who didn't feel ready for marriage or didn't really believe in it (always got that vibe from "Lavender Haze" and that Taylor was trying to convince herself that maybe he's right).

Also things like timing being beguiling (oh hey you're showing up right as I'm ready to be single), the questions in verse 2 about what he's "still like" (because she hasn't seen him in awhile), "life was always easier on you" (he's rolled with the punches of being in the spotlight much better than she has), her saying "goodbye for now" (she knew it wasn't the right match at the time), "I won't confess that I waited but I let the lamp burn" (she always thought about him as a "what if" and had some feelings for him), "Lost Boys" being a 1975 song... This song just screams Matty.
agreed. thinking about the TTPD songs as being about matty honestly made them not feel as powerful to me? but this post helped me process it in a way that still includes joe
I think it's more about the tone. The Joe songs lack the extreme anger aspect. They are just sad with some frustration that he didn't try to save the relationship and she felt like she was doing all the heavy lifting.
[deleted]
At least we got Back to December and Getaway Car!
Haha where’s the lie?!
I for sure think there’s a bunch of songs out there about Joe that are just too personal!
This! Even tho I think there are quite many songs with are complety and partly about Joe where she tried to cover it up with certain references to Matty, I immediately though it's telling she isn't the "poster boy" of this album. Normally she would make a whole album about such a break up considering how many songs she writes for her "flings". But she doesn't (publically) cause he wasn't just a fling, she truly loved this guy for 6 years and their relationship was obv. the most meaningful to her. So she probably not only feels that putting our a lot more songs about him would be to personal for her, but also she respects and loves him enough to accepts his wish for privacy. She cares enough to not come for him.
I wonder I she will release some songs about him (she has written now) in the future after some time has passed tho
> he didn’t truly mean a lot to her, his promises did

This is the best read of it I've seen thus far. She just wants a happy ending.
She’s probably doing the same with Travis, if you think about it this way. Hopefully he can actually deliver and they’re fully compatible outside of the grieving phase of her old relationships.
Exactly. Talk is cheap. Actions speak louder. He knew if he said what she wanted to hear, she'd fall into his lap with the hope of it all, but never deliver because as she said he was gone by morning.
This EXACTLY. Everyone is so surprised she “loved” Matty so much. No, she loved his promises, and when they ended up fake, she had to process the loss of both relationships, the loss of time, and the fear she made the wrong choice in leaving what she had. 

There’s so many songs about Matty because she’s feeling the loss of him and Joe at the same time. She gets with Matty fast (we’re all shocked when it happens,) too fast for her to process the loss of a five year relationship with someone she thought was a life partner, and that loss doesn’t hit her until after both relationships have fallen apart.
I think it’s VERY easy for people to be addicted to this type of love affair. It’s so intoxicating and it makes sense that you could write a whole album about how you’re feeling even if it seems unhinged or crazy (cause it is and that’s ok)
his band 1975 is apprently very popular in alt Rock circles but he has a lot of controversies
Yeah and microwaves cook you from the inside out, ovens outside in. The oven she could see happening, the microwave was a surprise.
Also - you typically burn something in the oven when you’ve forgotten it was there…
Came here to say this. Both torturous for long times, impossible to leave unscathed.
There are a few things I wish I could tell this girl:
- she didn't miss out not going to high school in a traditional sense
- love yourself girl. Her codependency issues really come out here. A man doesn't make or break us. 


I kind of feel bad for her. 
Reminds me of Fire and Ice by Robert Frost.  Both will kill you but ice will do it slowly.
Thank you! I knew I had seen her use that phrase before.
Yes! “Why She Disappeared”
It is the one she staged during the Reputation tour….the video transition into Getaway Car
🤯
100%. To be candid, I think a lot of people, because they don’t know Joe, are assigning him the best of every song, and Matty the worst. And I’m not a Matty defender, by any means, but speaking strictly about how they treated her, her personal, lived experience with the both of them…we really have no idea what that was like, aside from her writing.
I think that’s because people have genuinely put Joe in the hero box and Matty in the villain one.  But ultimately like you said she leaves enough open to interpretation that you can’t always be 150% sure we know what line is about who.  People (like down below) still fight over what songs are about who in albums that are a decade old.  

I don’t mind the analyzing a conjecture but I think everyone needs an occasionally reality slap that to all of us *Taylor Swift is a stranger*. We get her songs but we don’t know the real meaning behind any of it.
I really think that loml is about Joe. Maybe I’m wrong, but I see this song as if she had just realized that she was lured by Matty and is finally feeling the grief she tried to avoid. She mentions Matty as the conman who sold her a get-love-quick scheme. She tried to fill with him, the hole that she knew the end of her long relationship would left. But it was fake, it was a fraud and now what’s left is the hole Joe left. 
I don’t know if anyone already mentioned it, but I also think that “you lowdown boy” is a reference to “London boy”.
OMG, is "the One" about Matty? Possible?
[deleted]
She immediately follows that up saying ‘it was a mutual manic phase’. She is literally telling us she wasn’t actually in love, she was just in a manic episode.
I think it may be her giving up on the childhood/younger self dream of relationships/love that she had and coming to terms with the fact that it’s never coming or that it looks different.
I agree
How Did It End is already one of my faves, and already so so underrated. 🎹🩶

I'm so glad the vipers didn't get to hear about the 'scandal' they were looking for because it appears that there wasn't one. It clearly fizzled out over time even though they fought for it which is sadder and harder to understand than any one big thing, and also probably the reality for most people whose long term relationships end.
There was so much love there at one point, and he helped her during such a dark period of her life. I think she recognizes that and, thus, will never drag him through the mud. She still feels fiercely protective of what they had; you see it all throughout The Albatross. 

It was a mutual end, a broken vessel that could never be repaired. Sometimes, people just grow apart — and there's nothing evil about it. Just very bittersweet.
I’m glad you said this. It made me go listen to it again. I’ve only heard it once so far, and I guess I was preoccupied. Wow. What a sad song.
Off the top of my head:

The Black Dog

The Albatross

So Long, London

How Did It End?
He totally is all that and more but also this is a game. He can't show any emotion or she wins. He knows what she did and he won't give in by saying what she wants to hear. 

So, he is gonna act like she did him a favor so that she starts doubting whether her vigilante shit worked.

But inside he is very very angry, I bet.

I just hope Taylor doesn't fall for it to continue this game. You can't outsmart a professional manipulator. He had years of practice. 🤦🏻‍♀️

His first big move was when he ghosted her. Now she made a big move by releasing this album. Now he will act like he loves it and wants more. So, it's her turn...
This sounds right to me. 

I used to frequent some “children of narcissists/immature parents” forums, and common advice there is not to send a letter explaining how you feel/why you are upset and expect them to understand, feel guilty, and apologize. You can’t compel someone to feel or react the way you want them to. If sending the letter is important to your healing, do it, but you can’t do it because you expect it to change their treatment of you.

I agree that she needed to get these feelings out for her own good, to exorcise the demons. The part of the prologue reminding people that these are snapshots of events/emotions at a point in time supports that IMO—she said what she needed to say and now she’s moving onto the next, good thing.
Mine just ghosted me after a 1.5 year relationship and engagement, this album hit me in all the feels. He's also a Brit and I'm American so yeah 😵‍💫ETA I should add this dropped at like...just the right moment and its been such a therapeutic experience to listen to I was a fair weather fan tbh but I stan for life now 😭
That’s her! She creates so much depth…it’s takes a long time to plumb it all.
Wow I really didn’t think about the comparison to the vault tracks, that an interesting take. Like an edited distilled version of this album would have like 3 of the prominent MH songs, and a hypothetical ‘vault’ would have all the rest. Makes more sense to me now. I personally prefer her more distilled albums of the past, but I understand she didn’t want to do that. It’s definitely her choice and there’s obviously fans that love this album just the way it is.
The lyric video for the Manuscript is VERY telling; it's written as a movie script. Basically, the song is her realizing the fully reality, magnitude, power, pain etc. of the Jake situation came to her while writing and making the ATW short film.
OP I love your main analysis and I agree with this too
Holy crap. I need you to analyze every song of hers.
Also the in summation she says: 
  
*I stand before my fellow members
  
of the Tortured Poets
  
Department 
  
With a summary of my findings
  
A debrief, a detailed rewinding
  
For the purpose of warning
  
For the sake of reminding*
  
She is giving the listener all the raw, unfiltered feelings so she/we don’t repeat the same mistake or fall into it again.
OP it really feels like you're a Taylor whisperer or something. Having said that, I thought the song about the VMA incident on Speak Now is Innocent, and Long Live was an ode to her fans or her band or something?
Totally! Hey she’s won the AOTY Grammy a record 4 times now - she knows how to make a cohesive album! I feel like this is catharsis and fan service and I thank her ❤️
Yeah they feature Matty and Joe and Trav but in the end they’re about her. The self-inflicted wounds. The choices she made. All of it.
I see your points. I, like you, am trying to rationalize a DOUBLE album mostly devoted to a "fling" - I agree that it seems like a lot for a rebound. 

I think the lines you quoted in the epilogue and prologue simply speak to going ahead and giving Matty a real chance and how it ended up being a giant, manic mistake. But that doesn't mean there wasn't a ton of buried history. 

I'm sold that loml is about Matty - if it were about Joe, it would be track 5. the loml lyrics (if about Matty) speak to rekindling a flame, a love laying dormant in a cemetery, never quite dead, waiting to burst back to life. 

Then there's Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus - "if you wanna tear my world apart, say you've always wondered" - this to me, points that they both always wondered (since whatever happened with them in 2014) what could be between them. 

Then there's [this whole business ](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a43818052/taylor-swift-mattt-healy-mouthing-each-other-secret-messages-during-concerts/)between the two last year, where she says Cardigan is about Matty. Granted, she could have just repurposed Cardigan in the moment...or, the thought of Matty Healy has been a plague on our girl for a LONG time. 

Who knows? Only Taylor does - but damn, it's fun to analyze!
My theory is that in BDILH, it starts out talking about Matty but it ends with Travis because of the reference to her dad loving him. I think this album mixes multiple people and situations in the same song more than she's ever done before. She definitely started that in folklore and continued through midnights but this album feels like the majority of the songs have multiple situations and people.
I agree. She might have written BDILH before it was over with Matty or just decided it was a better story that way.
Exactly! There are references in there but they are vague and could apply at any point in her career
A way better comparison!
i had to read their comment twice to make sure i wasn't hallucinating. i am so embarrassed. 

mr. VIVVAAAA LAAAASSS VVVAAAAYYYYYGGGAAASSSSSS is the american equivalent of prince william???? lmaooooooooo
Okay.. we can say the are Becks and Posh, then.  Same level of fame individually and same insane circus environment wherever they go.
She may be in therapy. I doubt she’d share that information with the world though, you know?
She probably could benefit from some helpful guidance about men. This is coming from someone thinking it’s time for the same for herself haha 
Honestly, this. Alot of her more recent lyrics show how she's a people pleaser and slightly low self esteem/worth etc and also with alot of stuff that's happened as a child I'm betting she has rejection issues. So I really would love her to go into therapy. I had to or I would have kept bouncing from guy to guy looking for love and validation and peace that ultimately I could only give myself. I wish the same for her. 


Otherwise when life settles a bit for her she's gonna look for a way to sabotage it because she feels bored or 'unloved'. That's just my experience but I see similar behaviour in her
Most importantly, Taylor needs a man that can handle her fame and everything that comes with it (the Albatross). Neither Joe nor Matty could handle it, which destroyed the relationships. Travis seems built for this. He's used to receiving hate and criticism from the NFL fandom. He's also a big personality, who can stand on his own and not feel intimated by her success. He celebrates her and doesn't try to minimize her. I have a hard time thinking who else could provide this for her.
I disagree. I don’t think we’re ever going to get the dramatic songs about Travis, because I don’t think she feels the drama and anxiety with him she’s felt with others. 

Real love, the love that lasts is not dramatic or anxious. It’s calm and peaceful and can be mistaken for bland. That’s what I think she has with Travis.
Idk man. I had a Joe in my life. Like exactly.  I finally had the courage to end it.  I wound up with a man where I don't feel those crazy passionate feelings but he's the absolute best match for my soul and I'm so so so so so happy.  The love though is just different. It's a quieter live and I love to believe that's what Taylor has with Travis
To be fair they were probably written right in the beggining of their relationship
She submitted the album in October near the beginning of their relationship
I think you are right...for now. It could be deeper now vs when the songs had to be ready to release
I believe that’s the thing with love. After a point, it has to be comforting and quiet. Not the burning, all-consuming passion that most people chase in their teens and early 20s even.
Perhaps that is for the better, though…
I'm sure she does- she's the monster on the hill, the albatross, and she will never bring him peace. Her celebrity and PR and fans will impact every single relationship she has. In both 2014 and 2023, fame seemed to be the factor that ruined them.
The smallest man that ever lived kinda points to the opposite of that no? She calls him out pretty bad as basically manipulating her. She also says in the epilogue that *it wasn’t a love affair, it was a mutual manic phase, it was self harm* 🤷‍♀️ I see her earlier songs in the album about him as being from the POV of where she was at that point in time, being entranced by him and the promise of being a soulmate. And then when she comes to her senses, she’s like ‘oh you just suck’

That’s just my take on it
I think like I lost my twin is about Joe and not Matty since they’re usually referred to like twins and he once referred as trusting him like a brother and the ships allusion which she also alludes in So Long, London and evermore. I think down bad is a mix of Matty and Joe and her dealing with both of the heartbreak after. She also mentions building a fort which 

Also for Peter, Joe was also 25 when they first dated when she wanted to break-up (DWOHT) and he said he can deal all of this Taylor Swift thing so they shouldn’t break-up. The lyrics “the goddess of time once found us beguiling” matches the lyrics in invisible string “time, mystical time” and “crossing your jetstream” and the she thought and they just said it was “goodbye for now” matches their on-off relationship as alluded in Hit Different and articles when they broke up and how their friends thought it was not a final break-up between them initially.
Travis isn't carrying around a typewriter though. Could you imagine!? 🤣
It's amazing how her setting the mood with the song can trigger certain associations that wouldn't normally be automatic. The seven bars line immediately put me in mind of the sugar cravings recovering drug addicts get when I first listened to this. And then the following lines about coming undone/cyclone kind of confirm it for me
And sometimes it’s so small. 

Like when she maybe didn’t thank Celine Dion. She was trying to make sure everyone was on stage so was looking over her shoulder when she grabbed the Grammy then went to podium. Additional angles seem like Taylor must have said thank you as she turned back to podium because Celine says you’re welcome.  Then after she was done with her speech she started to talk to Celine and Jack interrupted them in excitement.  Then they took a picture backstage together. 

The amount of pressure she’s under is enormous. She can’t even be overcome by a winning an award without criticism they she didn’t do everything perfect. It’s no wonder so many artists crack or disappear. 
You got to it quicker than I did but I think you're right!
It also sounds like there was no real and lasting joy in her and MH’s relationship whereas with Joe part of what was so painful is that it really almost was forever.
Yes like I know many swifties are 1975 fans but damn so many on here are Maylors. I view them the same way I view gaylors and haylros who are adamant that Taylor was pinning to this girl/guy the whole time she dated Joe.
I think Taylor should give her own songs a good re-listen 😆
!!!
With Cardigan now having Matty references or atleast she sang it to him during the eras tour , I would say Peter is about Matty but also Joe. 


 Cos what Taylor does in this album is weave in both muses even in songs which seem blatantly about one person because processing of both heartbreaks came together. 


 Joe came up with the boy in Betty ( a song they wrote together) who Taylor named James ( who is also the Peter to Betty's Wendy as we see in Cardigan). So there's a story there about waiting for something and finally turning off the light.
I think the matty healy story doesn’t make sense, mainly because she’s the one turning off the light and asking for forgiveness . She very clearly wasn’t the one to leave matty.
Yes this is exactly it. I see a lot of people in the sub trying to find out which songs are about which muse. I think tone is the key difference. It is hard, since Joe is all over the Matty songs, and vice versa. But the way she talks about them is different, and the way she talks about herself in relation to them is different. With Joe she is hopeless, desperate, begging. With Matty she's dubious, overwhelmed, and lashing out.
Yes agreed.  They were probably at the end sadly so it’s not as like “heart wrenching”.  I do think Matty (per her new song lyrics) gaslit her and told her what she needed to hear about marriage and babies, when she needed this from Joe the whole time.  Hence, the angry Matty songs
I think she was never angry with him and was simply devastated that she slowly watched their relationship die. The only song where there is any anger that could be about him is tolerate it and even that has a desperate edge to it.
Another one here & am enjoying the album through that lens so much
And Midnight Rain! I love that song 😍
Exactly. And that happy ending is more important now than ever, because there's a genuine feeling throughout the album that she's running out of time:

"*And I’m pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free*" - from So Long, London

*Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here*

*At the park where we used to sit on children's swings*

*Wearing imaginary rings*

*But it's gonna be alright, I did my time*

- from Fresh Out The Slammer
😭😭😭 I hope Travis is good to her and truly loves her. And her him. 😭😭😭
The way she wrote about Healy it was more lust than love. But when you are manic, you aren't thinking clearly and your feelings are dulled so you'll take anyone that's around. That's the rebound effect.
Omg this has so many layers!!!
I don’t know why I feel the need to correct this, but this is a commonly quoted myth. There’s a reason your frozen burrito is still frozen in the middle. Like other cooking methods, microwaves cook from the outside in.
I'm obsessed with how deep this metaphor goes lol that's amazing
Yes! Exactly. 🤍
Microwaves make things so steamy and they're very convenient but they're smaller and not real cooking. 
Wow that’s heartbreaking
This just made me stop hating that line in the prologue. Thank you!
Agreed. It makes me so sad.
Awesome comparison.
I really think she has been obsessed with Matty for ten years and Maroon, cardigan, dancing with our hands tied and illicit affairs are about him. Joe ran its course.
Do you have an analysis of fortnight specifically?
On the other hand, a lot of people made him out to be a cheater before the album was even released (sometimes using her choice of surprise songs on specific tour dates as "proof" which is completely mental). And i've seen more than enough people on twitter, still using every lyric they can get their hands on to paint him as the main villain, including the ring line, which you have assigned to Matty. But i generally agree with your take.
Joe had the image carefully Crafted by Taylor team. Everyone think he is clean,a introvert. But he is ?
They scrubbed a lot of images from Internet. He looked like a fun guy and not really a introvert. 

There still a lot we don't know about him
She's giving us what she wants us to know, veiled in metaphor. We've gotten her view, clouded in feelings and ego (which you can't separate from any artists art). I say this respectfully as a fan - we don't know anyone she's dated because we don't know them and we don't know her. We know what she's wanted us to know about her and about everyone else around her.
Agreed. loml is the kind of deeply sad song you write about a person you spent six years with and hoped to build a life with, not one you write about someone you fantasized about for years and then realized was a shit.
Agreeed. I’m happy the people online all excited about how she was going to rip Joe to shreds or expose something on this album clearly didn’t get what they wanted. Because it sounds like their relationship truly just died. And the breakup was mutual and there’s no insane animosity. And Taylor is mostly genuinely sad about it.
Argh I love this take! And I agree with it so much. So many people online ESPECIALLY were excited to hear this album because they thought it’d be a let’s rip Joe to shreds album about the end of their relationship and maybe he cheated on her and all these crazy made up rumors and it was in fact the total opposite of that. She had nothing bad to say about him honestly. And in part I think it’s because of how much he helped her though one of the worst times in her life, which she’ll always be appreciative of. And that it was indeed probably a very hard but mutual end between them.
I wouldn’t bet on anger. He and Taylor were dancing around in their complex relationship for a decade. She called him her twin, said she would kill herself if he ever left, he’s the loss of her life. Hearing all of those things and knowing he only left because he was scared/hurt by public opinion must create the most open and raw wound. If I put myself in his shoes I’d be feeling devastated and heartbroken that I let fear destroy the relationship that I should’ve gone to the grave with.
Oh no, this is her revenge. He may not feel anything or apologize and she knows he won't but he will be attacked by her fans nevertheless and she knows it. At this point fans are a weapon. 

She didn't want to get revenge at Joe. She is not that angry with him, not anymore at least. Otherwise she would have included more songs about him, and less of Matty.

Just look at "The Smallest Man..." and how he is supposed to get the "message". It's funny how not cryptic she is this time around but very much straightforward.

It's when you tell your dog: "Bite!"
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry! That is horrible. Hold on and please ask for for help, if you need it. It's important.
You are so so beautiful!
I feel too like maybe she really wants to close this chapter, and if she left tracks on the cutting room floor, there may be a reason to re-vist later. So she's essentially saying here's everything. Now it's over.
I did notice her vault songs seemed to tell the full story instead of the sanitized versions that came out originally. I thought maybe it was just to protect the other person’s privacy in a way before, and it was too fresh and raw way back when. I figured now since she had moved on past that stuff, it was easier for her to release the truer story. But maybe it’s like the OP said.
Oh my gosh you’re so right haha. Edited! And thank you for your kind words!!
I’m glad she’s happy but let’s be real, intellectually speaking she is stratospheres above him.
🤣🤣 fr
Absolutely agree! I just have way too many personal stories of friends and just people I know who keep making this same mistake over and over. 

It's an illusion that we need someone to make us whole. But as I see lots of people mention Taylor is all about soulmates and fate it explains why she gets so attached because she keeps trying to find The One but ends up with "fool's gold."

I think her main issue is FOMO. She is scared to reject a man or his advances out of fear she will miss out on her destined prince in shining armor. But believeing this is so dangerous and we see what happened with Matty (she really thought she can redeem him).

In psychology it's now popular to analyze Disney stories to find toxic patterns. I just loved Belle. This is a story about me. When you are so delusional that you believe that any monster can become a prince if only you love him enough.

And I agree with you about rejection issues, also fear of being alone and facing her own demons without trying to reflect it off a man. Been there, done that 🤦🏻‍♀️

Same shows up with her fans. She reveals as much in Anti-hero about her struggles. She just can't imagine a life where she is a normal human being without every second someone saying: "Taylor, we love you!"

I don't blame her, I just think she is coming to an age where maturity is inevitable if she wants to stay "out of psych wards." (Fortnight MV is so telling)

Not sure if she knows that real love is supposed to be drama free, even "boring" for someone coming off the toxic relationships high. And this idea of soulmates feels like a cheap marketing gimmic to me now because it's a commonly used tactic by professional narcs and manipulators in general.

But again, this is all learned in therapy and support groups. 😊
I don‘t know, I feel like this is too much assuming about two people we don’t know. I mean, there were several articles about how they were just trying to have fun.
Golden vs burning red.
This is what I’m picking up too. Seems like Travis is more of the *he is sensible and so incredible/he’s charming and endearing and I’m comfortable* vs the *screaming and crying and it’s 2am and I’m cursing your name* guy and therefore in the end, Travis will be better for her. Just my two cents
Compare to the songs about Joe early on… I dunno to me the feelings seem surface level but each to their own interpretation
i agree. it's still early in their relationship 
I can see that except that if Smallest Man is her postmortem on the relationship, she still says "I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside". 

I took it as her being angry at him for ghosting her once she made the relationship public and the backlash ensued. She was willing to stick by him but he couldn't take it.

But ofc we'll never know for sure and your POV makes sense too!
I see what you're saying! I think Down Bad is about Matty due to the experience being only "for a moment" and the reference to "indecent exposures" (Matty is notoriously sexual on stage). This doesn't really fit Joe. I think the ship is the spaceship metaphor she uses throughout the song, and building a fort on a different planet "where they can all understand it" refers to protecting Matty from backlash. That sentiment mirrors "I would've died for your sins" in Smallest Man. 

But you're right that she has also used similar imagery to reference other people, and because she was on and off with Joe everything could be mixed up.
I think what they’re getting at is Taylor weaved multiple muses in single songs in this album. She’s done it before but it seemed to be prominent on this album. It’s probably reflective of the whole time period being so chaotic. 

So the ate-seven is a shoutout to a Travis, while most of the song is about MH.
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me  
[You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me](https://genius.com/31477747/Taylor-swift-whos-afraid-of-little-old-me/You-wouldnt-last-an-hour-in-the-asylum-where-they-raised-me)
I totally agree! She weaves her muses through most of the songs on this album
I think overall theres a theme in her discography where joe would say something along the lines of i will marry you, just not yet, and she waited until she couldn’t anymore
I think that's probably pretty close to being what happened. Losing someone you've been with for almost 7 years and all the memories you've made along the way and all the memories and plans you have made in your head for the future is devastating. She took the 'quick fix' pill of trying to replace that person with someone else and it made everything worse.
God I haven't been able to listen to loml without commenting "what a fucking piece of shit" at least once.
She was mad she wasted her youth for him. This is actually a pretty common thing to feel after being with someone for so many years and not being with them 'forever' or getting what she really wants, or what she thinks she wants, which appears to be marriage and kids. She was also mad that she felt stuck in their relationship.
Tolerate it isn’t about him. She specifically says the guy is so much older than her. So, she was reflecting on a past relationship not Joe.
and The Prophecy where she has a fear that she's destined to find fame/success but never true love.
yeah, that running metaphor/narrative hits a little too hard for me at the moment — so i'm trying to ignore that part
The way her voice shook on “gave you all that youth for free” sent absolute shivers down my spine. I agree with every single aspect of the take here. She set this up from “I took the magic get over you drug/the effect was temporary.” I love how she’s laid all this out for art and music. It’s so incredibly brave. And people who seem to think badly about her for being so wound up in MH for so long make me wish there was a mandatory form of flair on their accounts identifying the worst choice in man they’d ever made. Like literally there should be some kind of “I was once obsessed with a bad person musician” flag on the play whenever they’re talking shit. 

Also I notice how none of the people saying she’s immature for these stories have shit to say about people like Harry Styles not acting “mature” enough.
Literal promises to grow up and then gonna come find her in Peter
Hahaha fair enough, Im thinking of it as a metaphor in that it cooks something from heating up the water molecules inside the item, not from an external radiant heat. But always good to know more science things 😊
Y’all really cooked here, A+.
Also the 1 and Question.


Almost-relationships can become obsessive due to their unrealised potential cos you have a perfect dream in your head instead of the mundane plus ups and downs that you have to counter in a real long relationship.


The what if is something that seems to have haunted Taylor whenever there were issues between her and Joe. You can see it in folklore and midnights. Only we didn't know who the muse was.


The Gaylors were always insisting there was another muse from the 1989 period. But the actual one turned out to be Matty !!!
Why do people think DWOHT is a track about MH?
Agree. Maroon, cardigan, Paris, Glitch, Snow on the beach, labyrinth. It fit with the narrative that now TTPD brings into the table.
Wait really? What did she see in him I'm really puzzled
Do you think Peter is about him as well?
Right? Everything could be a lie.  I find it fun trying to figure it all out but some people just take it so far.  Like it’s ok to not have a deep meaning into each lyric.  I find it refreshing that a lot she keeps vague enough and universal enough you can apply it to your own life.  If I wanted her memoir I’d hold out for her to write a book.  

For example Anti-Hero the first time I heard it hit me right in the chest because who HASNT felt that way?  To her it’s the media and the fans to me it’s my friends and family.  I don’t want 1000 Dear John type songs.
Then you probably don't know that kind of men. Lucky you.
He is not just some normal guy from a neighborhood who got scared of public opinion.

He is a cold calculating narcissist who found a toy to play with. They love beautiful, smart and kind women the most. It's like a trope. Seriously. They enjoy breaking them so much more.

Their relationship wasn't complex as much as toxic (common misconception). And it shows in her songs. People are shocked, like Taylor, are you out of your mind? To kill yourself for a guy?

But these songs are just representation of her feelings and emotional states in those moments of "temporary insanity". There was nothing healthy or loving or good about that "complex" relationship. 

And she knows it now but not then. As we see in But Daddy I love him. When you fall for a narc/addict the world feels different. They have a way to make you believe in unicorns. I'm not kidding. It's almost like a hypnotic state.

And lastly, he could have left like a decent human being but instead he ghosted her. Do you think she'd released a whole angry album about him if he wasn't a complete piece of garbage? No. Because, look at Joe. He didn't get so much hate because he didn't treat her like shit.

And funny, this is the first time in a long time (since Dear John) there is not a single doubt who the bashing is about. If she wanted to be more subtle she would make her songs more cryptic so that we would scratch our heads trying to figure it out.

But no, pretty clear and straightforward. So yes, he is angry with her, I'm sure. But he will never show it.

You are right, maybe he would be devastated and heartbroken if he was capable of feeling anything. But he is not, he is dead inside. She just couldn't see it right away because she was not well hereself.
He has no soul. No heart. But man did he fake both to get her to fall for him into lust only to leave her stranded with, as she put it, naked and safe.
fans are responsible for what they do. she is not that angry at joe because he didn't run a con on her.

is she not supposed to tell her story because fans will read the tea and make a plan?

is she supposed to make art by repressing her feelings and story? 

when we play around with this sort of global fandom a lot of people get hurt, not the least the person at the top.

and mayer got himself cancelled when he added to his comments about taylor an nauseating list of racist and sexist crap. but even so, he seems to be making.comeback of sorts.

matty will be just fine.
You're so sweet and thank you for caring ❤️ I promise I am taking good care of myself! This happened in February (so that endless February line in fortnight really gets me...) and while it was heartbreaking, it was also the catalyst to me getting sober and getting the mental health treatment I've been needing for YEARS, and I am doing so good now! Literally even with a broken heart I'm the most happy and content I have ever been in my life, I made a huge move because of what happened and I have no doubt I ended up exactly where I needed to be. I love Taylors lyrics more than anything, she is just so raw and evocative and connecting with her music like this today was a really cool experience. It's truly an inspiration how she transforms her very unique story into something so universal, and her deepest pain and fear into the most beautiful art. She makes me want to write a double album of my own and do all of the things  (even with a broken heart...🤩)
Yes! "Now the story is yours"! She almost wants us to confirm: "Yes Taylor, it's over for you. Let us take that burden off your shoulders."
I think it's both! Imho IION is one of the best songs on that album, but the way she drags Harry in it would have been pettier than usual for her if it had been on the original album. When she released it later, people talked about it, but it was so long ago that there wasn't really much to say. But it's a great song, so glad she released it.
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Who cares? He clearly has a high level of emotional intelligence. No one needs matching IQs for a relationship to work
Opposite attract as they say
We’re all assuming here, but I do think this is end game for her. Of course we can all be wrong, but I’m Taylor’s age and had a lot of the same experiences and anxiety in relationships. 

Once I met my husband and experienced true love, I was shocked at how undramatic it really is. If Taylor has found the same, I just don’t think we should read into Travis not getting dramatic songs.
100%
Um she literally wrote Gorgeous about Joe? A song where she literally just repeats how hot he is?
Except she never went fully fully public with him. And by that, I mean the PR her team was putting out was that it’s not serious, they’re just hanging out.

I also think the smallest man who ever lived is about multiple guys. I don’t think it’s entirely about a romance. I think it’s about a mixture of Matty, Joe, scooter Braun, Kanye, etc. it’s about men who are the smallest.
I think Taylor deliberately mixes up muses in these songs as these situations and emotions were also entwined. That's why in some songs it's hard to tell where one starts and the other ends.


Down bad almost the whole song looks like it's about Matty cos of the whole alien space thing.


But the outros where she sings waving at the ship are probably the alien ship as well as the ship in So Long London and that's how the twin line fits in.
part of her shame over this 'two week' interlude is that it didn't give the 6 year breakup the dignity it deserved. like the corpse wasn't cold before it was in the grave. she clearly wants to give both Joe and herself and the relationship itself respect. Joe was not intentionally hurtful. perhaps he didn't see what he was doing because he wasn't aware enough. you're losing me makes that point. there was nothing deliberate about the hurt in that relationship. she clung on longer than she should have and that is now hitting her.
That’s true she does mention that in the beginning. I think in the begining of the album there is anger but by the end (when she is cured from the insanity and reflecting) she is left with only grief and regret for how things ended.
There’s a whole field of quadratic equations that can calculate exactly how long to bake a potato. But I am on the potato side of the equation when it comes to intelligence.
I could see how DWOHT would be MH because it was this entanglement throughout the years that weaved through their relationships and they never did anything about it. I still don’t think it was written for him though because she was basically obsessed with Joe at this time and the high from the chase he gave her. She was with TH but wanting Joe and couldn’t do anything about it. Also at her listening session for Rep she told her fans that all of the songs were about her perfect boyfriend.
Yeah idk, reading the lyrics again I do think this one is about Joe.

(Please, please be about Joe, it's become a recent favorite of mine. 😭)
Because it’s about someone she loved in secret, who was 25 years old (ten years ago Matty was 25 and he’s the only guy who she dated while they were 25 that we know of). I don’t think it’s about Joe because she’s talking about how she always had a bad feeling about it, they danced as the world fell down around them and how IF she could dance with them again etc. it’s like maroon, it’s about a lost love.
He’s a tortured artist. The bad boy who is secretly sensitive. Writes songs about still loving her for ten years. After a cold slow ending relationship with someone who maybe wouldn’t commit fully? A lot of us have had a Matty. (Usually we regret it)
Absolutely. All of the Peter Pan related themes. He had a song called lost boys.
Thank you for your description of this. A relationship with a narc doesn't feel good (like Taylor with Travis), it doesnt even feel sad (like Taylor with Joe). It literally feels manic. I cried so much when Taylor said wanting to die because she wasn't with him anymore. When the narc discarded me, I told my mom this and she said "a healthy relationship doesnt make you feel like you want to die." I cant forgive MH for what he did to her. I feel her pain too personally.
Oh, he is a pro. That's why I'm so bummed she fell for John Meyer double basically. Means she didn't work through that first relationship properly.

People like this don't have empathy which makes it easy for them to mimic (fake) such behavior. They are good at mirroring others and they observe a lot what gives them "access" to you and they know exactly what you want, need, fear, etc.

Lack of emotions is what makes them so good. It's blood-stopping and cold but true. This is how so many psychopaths and sociopaths live among us unnoticed because they know how to blend in and look average.

And also, why it's hard to catch serial killers. They usually have families, kids and normal lives. Can you imagine?
No, I agree with you.
I was just describing my takeaway of the album and the whole situation about her relationships.

Yes, Joe didn't con her in that way but I could feel she is still uneasy about him because of how she sings in So Long, London about her youth being given away for free. 

I personally don't care what happens to Matty and I'm definitely not one of those people who will go at him. I'm just an observer and I appreciate the raw quality of Taylor's music genuis.
Yay so happy you are taking good care of yourself. Sending you a virtual hug ❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️ that
I honestly love that line, bc I think that in the healthiest relationships people have common values & goals but should otherwise balance each other out
Exactly. He's emotionally intelligent and he's clearly got a good strategic mind to be that good at football. Plus being intelligent and being educated aren't the same thing. He's spent his life on a different pursuit but it doesn't mean he couldn't have learned something else. He seems like he knows how to have fun and he's kind, why are people so judgy?
For real. This. I’m sure Travis couldn’t write these lyrics and create music like Taylor can. 

And I’m sure Taylor can’t play NFL-level football like Travis can.
She herself was public, saying I love you to him at concerts and getting papped with him. Just before the breakup there was a piece saying he was moving in with her.

The hard part for PR is that even though she and Matty had obviously developed a relationship for a while, publicly she was still with Joe. The PR narrative needed time to catch up and Matty left before it could.
[deleted]
She didn’t have it in her to go with Grace 😢
Her PR basically walked back the one public display. It was only 1. Her PR could have stated that Joe and Taylor broke up on whatever date and she and Matty had been hanging out and getting more serious since then. Her PR literally acted as if he wasn’t important to her. Her PR contradicted her 1 public statement (or mouthing.)

Taylor herself disappeared after getting hatred and threats spewed at her during the whole Kanye fiasco. Matty ghosted her for the same reason but still had a tour to go on and still had to remain in the public eye. I understand her hurt, but you would think she would understand why someone wouldn’t want to constantly shit on and receiving death threats.
I think she can recover from Joe, but Matty targeted her when she was vulnerable. Sometimes a relationship doesn't work out and you are crushed, but that is not the same thing as anger. She has recovered from Matty she tells us plainly. But that kind of manipulation cuts deep and when she realized she was stupid to let it happen, she feels a generalized rage. Isn't this normal?
This fits You’re Losing Me so well. At the time it felt like quite a scathing attack on him whereas TTPD feels more reflective and fair on the end of the relationship. Neither of them came out unscathed or smelling like roses.
"I'm too famous to be a P. I would've been caught by now if I was" is not the type of excuse an innocent man would even come up with.
Idk If these allegations of Drake are true, but I for sure KNOW, with all the weird stuff he has done in the past, and with this weird defense, most people will assume guilt.

Drake lied and said Kendrick talked about how he was touched on "Mother I Sober" but Literally in the song Kendrick talks about how he WASN'T touched but his mother didn't believe him because she had been SAd herself.

Being accused of being a P and then using a misinterpretation of a song to say "this guy just doesn't like Ps because he was affected by one so his opinion on me doesn’t matter." is a CRAZY way to go about it.

Also, Drake said the ones feeding Kendrick the info are clowns but then says they planned on feeding him the info... that he has a daughter, that he is a deadbeat and that he is a P??? Ooo you got him there Drake. I just don't believe Drake set it up. It doesn't make sense to bait someone into ruining your reputation and act like you did it on purpose. I call cap. 

Drake's response is musically and lyrically very good ngl but I gotta be real, I have experience with being gaslit and Drake's responses are really setting off some alarms for me.

Why believe Drake at this point? He is lying about things we can just look up right away. You think he's not lying about stuff we have no way of proving rn?

It doesn't look good for Drake and anyone defending him at this point may wanna save their breath.
I wouldn't look twice at a teenager, Multiple pictures of him kissing sixteen year olds and multiple lyrics about high schools
Yeah Drake really does think we are slow. If you intentionally fed Kendrick fake information as bait where are the receipts?

Or is he trying to say “we thought well enough in advance to bait him, but we didn’t think to keep the evidence that we baited him”
Drake is either an incredibly stupid mfer or he thinks we are incredibly stupid
Meek is better at denying his gayness lol
LOL so was Jimmy Savile
It's the rich and famous people that get away with that kind of shit the longest. We have plenty of examples Epstein, Weinstein, Jimmy Savile, and now Diddy. The people that have the money to make people shut up are the ones that are hard to catch. 

I don't believe shit outta Drake's mouth. He's always been one of the most inauthentic rappers imo.
‘I have experience with being gaslit and Drake’s responses are really setting off some alarms for me.’

As someone who used to be the gaslighter, Drake’s response is the exact play I would’ve made while spiraling to cover up a lie. Along with the clumsy self contradictions and the halfway researched source material lmao. 

This guy is a pathological liar, and even if Kendrick is not 100% correct, Drake definitely is hiding something relating to kids.
He talks about pushing P. Let me see him push a T.
Poutine Puffy, time to take an ayahuasca retreat
Kendrick said in Euphoria "fabricating lies on the family front / because you heard mr. morale" and pretty much seems like the depth of Drake's dissing is as superficial as his hearing that record and not understanding any of it. 

This beef is asymmetric. Drake thinks it's about getting bars off while Kendrick is stating the whole concept of Drake is invalid and has no place in hip hop. Kendrick has picked apart Drake's character, that he is an actor and Drake is just a persona. Specifically a persona designed to exploit and take from the culture for personal gain. The core assertion is that Drake is a fame whore who is attracted to status and motivated by image. From there it's a shorter step to associate his other moral failings and addictions. Within this, he uses his fame to get women, exploiting a power dynamic and taking advantage of them. Whether this actually slips into full on illegality or pedophilia is more of an insinuation based on the company he keeps and the inherent abuse of a grown man using celebrity to round up young women to exploit. 

All of this speaks to his character at a deeper level and yeah, maybe it's not true, maybe Drake is just weird but doesn't *actually* cross lines. We might not ever know outside of actual legal intervention. But Drake still seems clueless what the beef is actually about.
Kendrick: "Drake's a pedophile."  
 
Drake: "You don't have any proof of that!"   
  
Yeah... that's not the response to go with if you want people to think you're innocent.
Any dude who PUBLICLY CARESSES AND MAKES SUGGESTIVE COMMENTS TO A 17 year old girl on stage in front of thousands is sus af to me! Imagine what they would be comfortable doing behind closed doors smh
Calling out Millie Bobby Brown was one of the dumbest moves he could’ve made. Sure, the internets been making that theory, but no one involved in this beef ever mentioned it.

If Drake feels like he needs to respond to random Reddit/Twitter theories, he’s gonna have a long ass week.

Name dropping her and then also making references to Epstein (Kendrick name dropped Weinstein, a completely different set of allegations) is a huge unforced error.
As someone who also has been gaslit, I know exactly what you mean about these alarms. If you noticed, Kendrick called him a master manipulator multiple times over these tracks and his ace was setting kendrick up with false info.

Another thing that gets me is the bars about bobby and whitney. Whitney said she was too rich to do crack and … well. Also being too rich? Nah to me when you break it down that way just sounds like “I’m too rich to be *caught*.” Which is exactly what I’m sure Epstein and Diddy were thinking.
HAubrey is the Goated Gaslighter
Oj Simpson wrote a book called "if I did it" just saying
Drakes on the ropes. Desperate. His fans are coping.

He’s essentially preparing to wave the white flag…”I don’t want to diss you anymore”

This was fun while it lasted but the heart part 6 was the work of a man scraping the bottom of the barrel, scratching to bring a rabbit out of a hat that just isn’t there.
My theory is some artists stop emotionally maturing at the age they get famous.
That mother I'm sober thing is so terrible 

If Kendrick was that traumatized and livid about sex pests in the industry, why the duck would he work with Kodak on a record where he brings up molestation.
He has a stunted growth for sure.
What could Drake say if he’s never tried to fuck an underage girl that would make you believe he never tried to fuck an underage girl?
>I have experience with being gaslit

Whoa, rare ground.
I guess Puff Daddy wasn't famous enough
The song is basically cap, and him calling himself a clown 🤡
That whole mess of a song - no, it was a confessional - it was definitely the moment that Drake pulled the alarm on himself. Others have been waving a red flag over this dude for years, but now Drake the type of guy to be like, "Thanks buddy!" and start waving it himself.
There’s literally nothing you can say that would make people who have their minds made up in this situation change their mind. A lot of public opinion in this battle is ppl wanting to see Drakes fall more than they even fw Kendrick
The funniest thing is him claiming he fed him false information through a fake mole when in reality that would be the easiest accusation throughout this whole beef that could be proven right. A screenshot, a recorded phone call, any form of proof that's what happened. He would've used that as the cover art for The Heart Part 6 but instead he used what his "proof" of Kendrick being a wife beater and Dave Free being the father of his son is. Lol mans brought middle schooler tier "evidence" (a comment on a pic) to support his "Red Button" release. Spiraling.
If someone accused me of that shit I would be scorched earth angry. “How fucking dare you say that fucked up shit about me?!” Not “nuh uh, you got molested”
Drake just heard the fan theory about him feeding into and ran with it, the dude has never been smart enough for that haha
Please post this on r/drizzy, let them know that their artist is just trash and don't understand what he is saying
Why does the OP refer to pedophile as P?  I am so confused why he is censoring that word?
Equivalent to meek saying he loves vagina to refute gay claims lmao
it doesnt look good, but nobody learned anything new in the last week.  It’s odd that everyone cares now all of a sudden.
For real I always thought he was weird my younger sister likes him even my husband didnt mind some of his stuff but I always thought he gave weird vibes. And for real what kind of a response is that ive seen so many police investigations and aint ever seen im to famous to be a pedo.....they usually say no im not a p*do a few times. Also always though him talking to a millie brown about boys is straight weirdo behavior!!!!
I would be furious as hell if someone accuses me and ppl believed that. Drake came out looking for peace almost WTF
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO WRITE A SONG ABOUT HOW WE DO NOT DIDDLE KIDS
You right and people having the ghal (is that how you spell it? Only said it till now)  to say something in defense is weird. You don't even know the person. For all you know this could all be a weird, tailored show. If anything just don't say anything. Shits weird.
he brought up mbb unprompted, not a good look
Drake was saying that his life is so under the microscope of the media that if he was a Pedo, he would’ve been caught. How is that so hard to comprehend.
This is such a dumb post. You have no authority to claim what an innocent person would or wouldn't say. This is pure bs. No matter what he did, denies, doens't say anything at all, your response would be the same. 

Talk about lying? Where is Kendrick's proof of this alleged daughter? Its a immediete lie. These stans are too much.
My only thought is it's so stupid it almost makes him seem innocent. No one actually trying to hide something would be THAT stupid about how he hid it lol ..... right?🤣
[removed]
Yea he got it backwards.
100 percent that fool didn’t  deny till the end
Dude has a thing for attending school girl basketball games why fam ?
Better than not saying anything at all about beating your fiancé but ok

A private investigator?! Who would've thought he was leading a double life all this time
I mean it was a terrible excuse, and verifiably not true. Drake is an idiot, but that doesn't make him an actual pedophile, especially when there's no actual accusations, just rumors.

You can't really definitively say what any innocent person would say. You can say what you would say, but you can't just speak for every single person.
I see this all the time “I would never lie to you” “why would I steal that gum” “I’m not that type of person” these reference statements all indicate pathological liars. Or just really bad truth tellers. Either one ya know.
So is every single celebrity and guess what...
Plus it’s taken this long for him to even address it…🫣
He should go with they at least they’re not little boys angle now
In all seriousness and I missed where he said he fed him the pedo thing.. I mean I hear where we said he fed info on the 11 yr old daughter… but I missed where he said he fed him the info on being a pedo… I did hear where he said he saw the pedo thing coming but not where he said he fed that to him… please help
It's giving OJ- If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer 
No kidding...
There's a difference between over 18 and "of legal age of consent" and Drake seems like the type of guy to make sure everything was "legally consensual"....btw isn't legal age 15 in Sweden or something? 
Crazy how much some of these bars be flying over all yalls heads
6GOD
R.Kelly...P.Diddy..             
boy was he making horrible mistake
he can’t just be like “ew no wtf”? like why give a reason like that
Drake track isn’t great but I’m not with the misinterpretation. If yall were acting in any sort of good faith here you would realize that when Drake said the people feeding him stories are clowns he’s talking about the people that told kdot he ratted, not about him allegedly feeding him false info(he didnt) like come on guys you just intentionally misrepresenting what he said
Drake loss when he made the xxx only time I shoot below the neck verse after x was murdered like F his family and kids
Doesn't matter if you're innocent or not, if someone starts calling you a pedo.

You're not fighting your way out of it and even if you did your reputation is already damaged so it really doesn't matter what you have to say once those accusations start getting thrown around.

The dude is guilty until proven innocent.
The longer The Heart part 6 stands alone, the worse it's getting for Drizzle. 

Kenny's got'm on the ropes, and needs to fucking bury him here...

Do it for the culture Kenny!
Bro you *have* been caught.
You can't prove that something doesn't exist. Drake literally cannot prove he isn't one to the public. You can't prove a negative. That's why the court system places the burden of proof on the prosecution and not the defendant

You can easily do an experiment to prove the point. If I accuse you of having said the word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" yesterday, how would you prove you didn't?

The misinterpretation thing is a fair point until you realise that all the "evidence" for Drake being a P is based on misinterpretations
These posts in these threads are starting to look like Fox News talking points. Kendrick glazers are just saying the same thing over and over and over again LOL. Sad
I agree with the sentiment but Drake wasn’t saying “this guy just doesn’t like Ps because he was affected by one” it kind of feels like people are misinterpreting this on purpose. 

He was saying that the reason kendrick is going so hard at  this angle is because kendrick was molested and is basically projecting his trauma onto Drake. 

Now obviously that’s not the case since we know Drake misunderstood the song somehow. But we don’t need to misrepresent drakes lyrics to take him down
then where's Kendricks proof?
Because he’s good looking, rich and powerful, and has swagger. That’s why. It’s disgusting but this is what it is.
“High school pics, you was even bad then” ☠️
Drake about to drop another diss called "actually ☝️🤓it's ephebophilia"
He said he wouldn’t look twice, he didn’t say he wouldn’t kiss and text them.
“Sierra Canyon parking lot lookin’ like Magic City parking lot”

Sierra Canyon is a private high school 😶‍🌫️
"If amazing was a young bitch, I'd be going to jail.... Because I'm fucking amazing"

Drake. When someone tells you who they actually are, listen.
Might look 3+ times though
He wouldn't look twice, he'd look 3,4,5 times and more
He would look once though. 


💀💀💀💀💀💀


There ain't no way you can convince me Drake didn't write his own whack ass shit and exposed himself multiple times. 
Don't forget the concert where he tells the 17yo he likes how her breasts feel on his chest
at least be honest bruh. one video, why say multiple when you know that’s not true. 17, not 16. you purposely put it lower to make it look worse like why lol
He has too many yesmen around. It's the musk rat thing again.
“Hey Drake they’re not slow”
"Alright guys, the plan is to say that I'm a deadbeat father of yet another secret child to my rival who is famed for his lyricism and ability to rap, And we don't keep any of the actual proof that the story is fake, I'll just say it is"
Only argument to that is that he's waiting to release them after Kendrick replies so he can maximize the effectiveness. However, drake kinda deflated the whole situation because after claiming he fed the info to Kendrick, we ar kinda left golding the bag, asking ourselves, "that's the kind of statement that needs receipts to land" . The longer he waits to prove the accusations, the less impact it will have even if Kendrick did get fed the information.

Also, are we just going to ignore that Drake said he was gonna out a razor to kendrick neck/shoot him? 


I feel that the contents of the lyrics were all over the place that nobody has even reckoned with this part x.x
His fan base celebrating this like it’s new years is wild!
For real the fact that his fans are accepting without reciepts is wild like take a photo of your boys text exchange then drake!
The problem is he’s used to dealing with his own fans, who really are that slow. They will believe everything he says. Hell they even defend the 17 year old girl thing.
Him and the mother of his son threw him two birthday parties separately. Where was the girl?

“Get Upppppppp”
I was gonna say. You could fill a phone book with famous pedos, terrible line.
Don’t forget bill Cosby too. People were sounding the alarm for YEARS about him but not one batted an eye because of his public reputation.
It took 40 years to put gary glitter in jail.

This shit is just getting started and wont go anywhere until a victim comes forward unfortunately, 
Do you think Michael Jackson was guilty ?
“As a professional gaslighter this dude is gaslighting you” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Drake could have absolutely have both a bastard (or many bastards since honestly dude seems like a damn moron when it comes to condoms) and be a pedo.

It’s not uncommon for rich guys and entertainers  to pay off women for kids they don’t want.  The stories go as far back as the days of The Beatles where Paul and John had a manager and a big chunk of his job was dealing with the fallout of the guys being “naughty boys.”  Seriously, they call their manager and said “hey mate, I’ve been a naughty boy again” and the manager takes down the girls name and pays her off and Drake probably has a baby mamma fixer on his team for just those moments. 

The pedo thing, yeah no, entertainers, or most of them anyway, are disgusting people in private.  He’s probably knowingly been with countless underage girls. 

Let’s not get fooled.  Drake has one amazing PR team on his payroll.  They can spin stuff as well as any world leaders PR team, just look how they classed up his baby mamma and damn near scrubbed her porn videos from the internet. Drake has all bases covered for whatever could happen even if it’s pedo stuff.
😭😭😭 bro is a gaslighter
Good on you for keeping it 100%. I can relate. Like Kat said 2024 is the year for the truth and exposing liars. “It was Gods plan to show y’all the liar.”
Good on you for keeping it real and turning shit around.
Fire
Poutine  Pufffyyy 😩 

Poutine Papi is another fave of mine lol
Scrape the ego from the bottom 
Kendrick - "How I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator, an habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie 'bout me and I won't tell truths 'bout you" 
Drake - "DROP A 50 BAG, 29 FOR THE THOTTTTT AYEEEE"
This needs to be higher in the thread 
This is a very very good analysis of this beef.
Nice digestion
He heard, but didn't listen.
this take shows how people are just selectively listening to this whole beef in ways that fit their confirmation bias. “kendrick = deep, real rap. drake = fake, superficial, pop.”

yes, kendrick is deconstructing the core of drake’s artist persona like you said above. drake is also deconstructing kendrick’s artist persona. 


whether it’s true or not is a different thing, but drake has a thesis here: he’s claiming that kendrick portrays himself as a pro-black, profound, emotionally mature good father with artistic integrity and that these are lies being told just for career reasons. drake’s saying that if he was those things, he wouldn’t be with a light-skinned woman, cheat on her with white women, use colorism as part of his attacks when his own wife and son are also mixed, beat his wife, not see his son for the past 6 months, never do songs with taylor swift and maroon 5, etc. 

he’s saying kendrick is corporate and manufactured, but marketed as art. there’s no question that kendrick is an artist but i gotta say, his collabs with people like taylor swift, imagine dragons, maroon 5 had me realize he’s not completely pure: how do you get to call yourself the one with artistic integrity and do such cash grab songs? would the other rappers we respect for their integrity do that? would they get a pass if they did?

imo fuck drake, but it’s low effort parroting to see everyone claim he’s saying nothing just because they’ve pre-decided that. he is making an actual argument.
Yeah he should’ve been disgusted like any normal person accused of fucking and trafficking kids. His response was just “no I don’t plus you were raped” like wtf lmao. I understand a no off limits approach but using that (wrong) information to justify being called a pedo is just weird af and shows Drakes thought process
What would be the correct response lol? This is just bias.
y’all some goal post movers lol
Ngl from these comments it sounds like yall don’t care what he would say. Denying it looks bad. Saying prove it looks bad. 

Sounds like none of it matter to anyone fr. Idc either way but from an outside looking in I’d say this is just a kdot circle jerk at this point. He say anything and yall on board.
Did he know this girl was 17?
I hadn’t considered the difference in the Epstein and Weinstein cases. Kendrick’s assertion that women had to sleep with Drake to get further in his network is believable but Drake mentioning Epstein validates the further accusation of a greater ring.

Other hand: claiming that someone is a pedophile, when untrue, is actionable in a court of law. Drake’s teams should be more than aware of that option and I’d assume that’d be the first step in clearing his name.

I haven’t gotten this involved in any kind of Internet drama since I was a kid :,) feels nice sometimes, man
Fuck I might need to listen to these songs again. I didnt even catch the Epstein thing being the wrong person. If you're right... It seems like he got caught in a lie for sure.
Yall reaching with the Epstein stuff, just because kdot didnt say the name doesn’t mean he didnt accuse Drake of it. He literally accused of policing a sex trafficking ring on meet the grahams

Y’all wanna act like it’s a Freudian slip when kdot literally accused him of it
Bro when he came with the title “the heart part 6” I thought he was really about to do something🔥 cuz I figured even he respected how great the heart songs are. Was a good concept, but the rap quality simply was not there. It wasn’t cool at all.
Yeah I agree

This beef went too far imo
[deleted]
I don't think he's waging war against sex pests in the industry. I think he just hates Drake.
Kendrick also took up for R Kelly
Be sure to bow down and thank the censorship establishment.

But, to their credit, a lot of people have unresolved drama, trauma and strife and putting stuff about sex crimes into title topics that *everyone* can see is not only inconsiderate, it is a lot like skipping through a minefield. Too taboo and too sensitive.

And Reddit still has minors on here that they have to be legally responsible for.
I had to. My post got removed for saying it.
That part. he acknowledged it and moved on. It's others who's going to cry for his blood till they get it. Meanwhile album should be in October.
Your post/comment was removed for violating Rule 2: No Derogatory Remarks That Are Prejudice, Bigoted, Racist, Or Discriminatory In Any Way

Please review all sub rules for the full details of each rule.
It’s a rap beef.  It’s 90% character assassination and calling them something that sticks and people enjoy laughing at them for.

Calling someone a pedo generally doesn’t stick.  Musk called that one rescue diver a pedo.  Nobody took it seriously and if anything musk was the weird one for throwing it out there.  It’s sticking on drake cuz there’s numerous documented instances of him being an absolute creep to children.
You think it's cool for a 30 year old man to be texting a 14 year old about how much they miss them?

The evidence is all there. You just don't want to look at it
And this is why Kendrick is winning. It’s chess and he’s out manoeuvred Drake. Now Drake is quite literally playing himself.
If Drake wasnt such a fuckin creep nobody would take the accusations seriously. These arent new rumors and Drake has displayed very questionable behavior in the past. Not a chance Id be interacting with girls that age like him, thats creepy shit.

Im not even saying hes guilty, Im saying if he doesnt want people thinking hes bangin kids than maybe he should be leavin kids alone.
We will be right here when your decide to put your glasses back on
Keep gobbling Aubrey's cock, I'm sure he appreciates it.
We didn't misinterpret them bro. It's just a wack thing to bring up when being accused of being a P. Drake also mentioned his dick in family matters. The man cannot read a room for his life. 
He's trying to invalidate Kendricks trauma as if it makes Drake innocent. Drake is doing some Narcissistic ass tactics man. 
Drake would like to hire you as a ghost writer for his next track. The contradiction in your own argument was flawless
There’s literal video of him kissing an underage girl on stage coupled with text messages from Millie Bobby Brown of him at 28 texting her at 14 saying “I miss you so much”. 

It is all found with a google search friend.
Read the room bro. Kendrick can take all the time he needs with proof because people have a decade and a half worth of prior Drake scandals to comb through. Cope harder crodie
You can literally see a video of drake hugging, kissing and then commenting on her body all after he found out she was 17. Then theres incident with the 16 yr old.
If you don't believe it, that's fine. There's no proof because it's a diss track. People say all kinds of wild shit in them. 

Where was the proof Tupac fucked Faith Evans? Biggie references it later, but she always denies it. The rest of the record is just calling them weak in various ways. It's still one of the hottest of all time. 

In Ether Nas takes shots at Jay-Z for mad shit that there's no proof of one way or another. Again, that's fine. He's just airing out all the stuff people say about him. 

That's why no one cares about whether or not Whitney backs Kendrick or he's got paternity tests. Either you believe it or you don't. That's not Drake's problem how you decide to take it. Same thing with the daughter and pedo allegations. People been saying they bet Drake got more kids since the first kid. It's all been rumors swirling and talk. They just amplified the what was already out there. There was never going to be any proof. 

BUT that's where Drake falls apart in The Heart Part 6. Everything he's amplifying is based off of reddit/Twitter posts from the last 2 days. It sounds like he just took the top comments from r/Drizzy and read them off to a beat. It's weak. You can't just regurgitate the cope from your fans and expect us to act like you did something there. If it's a set up, if it's all been a plan, show us the plan. Show us how everyone spending the weekend shouting "A MINOOOOOOOORRRRRRR" in the clubs was going to win you the war. 

See, for the other shit, proof was all but impossible. If TMZ ain't found the kid, Kendrick ain't. If there's no police report from Whitney, Drake can't help that. But Drake is claiming he's a mastermind of an elaborate bait operation. THAT proof he could have had on deck. SHOULD have had on deck. That's why it sounds like a lie.
It's in the same box Drake keeping the DV report and the Dave Free paternity test.

Why you excusing your own boy's unsubstantiated claims? This has been a receiptless beef
[deleted]
Bro will tell you, rap about and leak videos about how big his dick is but is so insecure he had surgery for a six pack. 


"Swagger." ROFL
I can't understand how tf this line would get through ever step of making the song. Especially him actually saying it. Wouldn't you be like, "actually, wtf" and not say it?
This is just a reach with the lyric… you never had a high school crush?
bad [back] then cmon yall r smarter than this
Or that he never looks away after the first time looking at them
Or take a really looooong look, but only once! Not twice!

https://x.com/mzicyobe/status/1782393593837019440?s=46 DRAKE EPSTEIN EVIDENCE
There. Right there.
Twisting things out of context works great for destroying people for no reason
Y’all mad he showed himself self love
I wouldnt look twice at a teenager, cause if I look twice im gonna look thrice
Yeah, that's absolutely weird. Even if it wasn't an underage girl. Who says that to someone they only just met? The entitlement and deviant behaviour are sad.
Drake the type of dude that will get caught texting another chick and be like “nah I was only texting her cause I knew you’d go thru my phone!” And he really be like “I’m such a genius”
That whole talk he gave at the end was just weird, Kendrick wasn’t lying bro is really spiralling 😭
Well... r/drizzy is, but the rest of us aren't.
That's my exact problem with drake ,so if drake did feed kdot false info about a fake daughter why has this been a rumor for the last year or 2 and even it this really was false info the longer he waits the more people are gonna go no way you lyin. In regards to pedo allegations he go nope not I'd be fucking pissed if someone called that .I think the damage is done he certainly won't loose all his fans but I think a sizable number will walk away from him .
What kind of receipts would he need to produce to get the general public to believe him?
Well he ain’t pitchin
I’d argue he’s a glorified pop star. He can’t really sing or rap.
Yeah, I left a ton of people out. There are so many rich and famous people who used their money, power, and fame to keep abusing people. None of the shit Drake said in that song hit the way he thought it would. Trying to say Kendrick is a victim of sexual abuse(even throughout mother I sober I denied he was) then pretty much victim shaming him. Drake is a fuckin bum.
That’s the biggest one in my opinion. Like how could he look past that making that bar? Times are different so it’s easy for Drake to seem bigger, but Cosby was in every house in America. Dude got away with it for fifty years, despite the industry knowing, before Buress brought it up during metoo era.
I think if he is or isn’t doesn’t matter in terms of of the parents of being guilty of allowing that shit. When was it ever okay for a grown adult to be close with a child outside of their family?
Sometimes where there's smoke there's fire...
And sometimes, where there is fire there is fire.
I honestly don't know. Michael is a weird situation. I do think he may have done some inappropriate things with children like having sleepovers with them, but there was really never any proof that I'm aware of that called him out as a full on pedo. 

Michael was a grown man that never had any kind of childhood, so I think a lot of the shit that was considered weird was him trying to get the childhood he never had. 

I don't know a ton about the accusations that were brought against him, but I'm pretty sure he never got convicted of anything even after the government brought everything they had against him.
Ong 😭 this man is a master finesser but honestly Kendrick might be the same at this point
That takes some cojones to admit, respect
Right, like that is a wild response but I gotta respect the honest I guess 😅
That's the most gaslighting thing that I have ever seen
drake trying to go even lower is further proof that he has nothing to back his claim. it’s so embarrassing for him and makes everyone even more suspicious.
He literally said he was disgusted on the track, did you actually listen?
He didn’t say he was disgusted with it in the way you wanted I guess?
He legit said in the song, and I quote “I feel disgusted”
He said he was disgusted and he denied it. I don't think you even listened to the song
Pusha T has already copyrighted “yeuch” not many routes you can take with that in mind 😂
Do you really listen to music or do you skim through it 😭
Nah, man. If you get accused of fucking a sheep, and your response isn't something along the lines of "ew, what the fuck??", it's "where's your proof, huh? There's no proof of that!", people are 100% gonna think you've been fucking a sheep.   
   
You're admitting it's a possibility; just no one has any proof of it yet.
The correct response is not have verifiable online proof of you being creepy to young women. Then people believe you when you ask the other guy to come up with proof
It's cause Drake has a history of being weird to women, minors, and people that he used to date. It also doesn't help that he is just a slimey dude in general while still having Baka on the payroll. Denying allegations is good but if he isn't addressing the behavior that got him here, that shit doesn't matter.
>Denying it looks bad. Saying prove it looks bad.

Shouldn't have done groomer shit for a decade and more in the first place, ig 🤷🏾
It's because he's already dug a hole for himself with his past actions. 

He can't credibly deny being attracted to underage girls because he's already been filmed on stage, commenting on how good a 17 year old girl looked and how her breasts felt. And he dated an 18 year old when he was 31.  
  
The best he could have hoped for was to hold the line and maintain the status quo, but instead, he dug deeper by responding with "prove it!"
He did, he asked how old she was and then said I don’t know if I should feel guilty and leaned in for more kisses
Yes, and he was 24 in the video.
https://youtu.be/h-p1feEHJZM?si=dKJAGBKQweJaAszV
As a rapper he would lose all credibility if he turned to the legal system to settle a beef
>claiming that someone is a pedophile, when untrue, is actionable in a court of law. Drake’s teams should be more than aware of that option and I’d assume that’d be the first step in clearing his name.

this is true but he’d be forever labeled a snitch, one of the worst labels in rap. 

that’s an important conversation too here, they don’t like snitches but are accusing each other of crimes. it’s a bit inconsistent about whether they want people taken off the streets so they can’t continue doing these things or not
I'm not trying to insinuate anything with that myself (although if you're talking just generally, then yeah too many people will take this as "proof"). I'm looking at this purely from a meta game standpoint. Invoking names of people who haven't been named before and opening a new line of attack against yourself, while you're trying to defend yourself, is just a huge error.

I'm pretty sure Kendrick's done with this beef now, but if he wasn't, and had he dropped Millie Bobby Brown's name in a song without Drake having mentioned her, it would feel like a reach. Kendrick stans would eat it up still, but to everyone else it'd feel lazy trying to hop on a storyline that's only been floating on Reddit/Twitter.

But Drake bringing her into it preemptively now gives Kendrick an opening to make that attack, and it would feel warranted at that point. Same thing with Epstein. Sure Kendrick already made that insinuation, but Drake is opening himself up to get attacked even harder on that front.
Lol respect is out the window here
If the man isn't a pedo it hasn't gone far enough imo.
Bro I went to Rolling Loud last year (after the feature) and saw Kodak, my guy was not in a place of "healing" or "taking accountability". He was super fucked up and refused to perform but also refused to leave the stage and was just mumbling about haters until they turned his mic off and had security force him off... doesn't seem like a guy who "put in the work to understand, correct and atone for his behavior"
He mentions the industry in every single track though.
Didn’t he point out the hypocrisy of de platforming r kelly while still hosting music by known and admitted white rocker paedophiles?
>Calling someone a pedo generally doesn’t stick. 

Not in today's society. If people come out to say that you did or said anything, people are going to want to believe the person who came forward first. Anyone who reacts or responds defensively will always look bad. You'd have to actually take the accusers and naysayers to court and put everything out there in order to get your name cleared.

It's not about who is right, it's about whoever is first.
My response to that would be entirely dependent on the relationship they have. If it's some mentorship or some other things where there's a reason they need to stay in contact and they know the family already then it's fine

But having looked through some of the supposed evidence for him being a P, it's more than I thought. That stage thing was WILD but in the end it's a collection of weird things
He hasn't. He just has a better fanbase. The only "move" he's made is to immediately respond to family matters. Outside of that he's just been throwing tracks at Drake. Also the Euphoria is lyrically the best track so he has that

If Drake dropped video proof like Kanye did to Taylor then it'd be a completely different story
Yeah this is something that people should have told Michael Jackson

If Drake were smart, he'd take several steps back and re-pivot
[deleted]
My guess is that he thought he’d never get caught/was too powerful to get caught.  Either that or Drake is perpetually stuck in HS, which I think is equally likely.
Hey maybe we were too hard on Drake. Maybe he did write some of those lyrics himself
Drake has the maturity level of the a teenage boy. It's exactly why he cares that dave free "likes" whitneys photos. Why whitney doesnt "follow" kendrick. Why he attacks peoples partners when he's trying to diss. It's high school level shit.

Its like some MJ shit. MJ connected to kids because he never grew up. You know how older guys usually say they couldn't date a younger girl because they'd have nothing to talk about? Drake gets along just fine with 17 year olds because thats how far his brain has developed.
Yes, yes you would. I was. This is a prime example that the "norm" is a destructive idea. Sometimes.
because your reading into what you want to think the lyric means when its apparent it doesnt
Are you illiterate? He, as an adult man, is telling an adult woman that she was hot in her childhood pictures. That's weird...
That's not even out of context.
He showed that to us with the jet video
idk man. personally i think theres a pretty good bit of hot 18 and 19 year olds. legal=legal.
Why are you texting my classmate? 😠
The actor ran out of lines type shit
His fanbase is literally the gutter incels from 4chan.
I’ve found that sub recently and the copium is CRAZY.
Drake? Probably screenshot of Dms, call recordings, something that would solidify the theory outside of twitter/reddit theorists. Because without it, it looks like Drake just got on Twitter and rolled with the best comeback his fans had.
Any form of recorded conversations between the mole and Kendrick. Actually fuck it, just out the fake mole by name. Have them corroborate it publicly. They’ve served their purpose as a fake mole so there’s no reason left to keep them a secret
😂😂😂😂😂 he ded
Hahahah stoppppp bro he’s already dead
lmaoooooooo
Big Brothers/Big Sisters but that's entirely different I reckon
>Michael was a grown man that never had any kind of childhood, so I think a lot of the shit that was considered weird was him trying to get the childhood he never had.

That’s just his cover. If any other man not named Michael Jackson acted that way and used that excuse nobody would accept it. There is plenty of evidence that shows MJ was really into little boys and paid loads of people to silence them.
kendrick is definitely the master manipulator atp 😭 no one gives a fuck about the wife beating allegations cause he got on a club beat and called drake a pedo lmao
Kendrick might be the same at this point??
No it doesn’t make is all suspicious just y’all who never get no puss
Right, it’s really starting to seem like people just skim through Drake’s disses or something.
Yea see there’s really no good way to address the allegations. This was actually probably the most not terrible why to do it. Every word said about it was gonna get chalked up as lie regardless.
He said he was disgusted
So yeah, bias.
Hold the line and maintain the status quo?

What does that even mean??! You want more "drop a 50 bag for the thot" bars?
I don’t really disagree but has he not already?
Eh it's Drake, his fans would cheer the case on but I bet he doesn't want discovery.
Well, he's not one so
The MBB stuff is neither her nor there, like yeah Kendrick didnt say her name, but she was literally trending on twitter before Drake even dropped the heart part 6. I guess it is a lil stupid for Drake to respond to people online instead of Kendrick but I don’t think it’s the slip up people are trying to make

I could not disagree with you anymore about the Epstein stuff. Kendrick didn’t insinuate that Drake polices a sex trafficking ring, he straight up said it. Y’all acting like Drake snitched on himself and now people are talking about a trafficking ring because he mentioned Epstein, which is hella revisionist because all anyone was talking about after mtg is “why are people talking about the daughter when Kendrick says he is running a trafficking ring”
What? You want someone to get shot and killed?

Because that is how it will escalate
[deleted]
He couldn't possibly be on a difficult personal journey of healing! He did a shitty job at rolling loud and was on drugs!

wtf are you talking about are you simple minded
He did. And he was right to point out the hypocrisy.

But it is also hypocritical for him to take up for R Kelly on any level when R Kelly was a proven pedophile/groomer only to turn around and flame Drake as a pedophile based on rumors and inconclusive videos
Bro they are not related. And he started the conversation. What can a 30 something yr old possibly have to say to a fucking 9th grader
>My response to that would be entirely dependent on the relationship they have.

Choosing bear every tiiiiime.
He has. He’s pinned him into a corner with his lyrical content and Drake is essentially on the ropes panic swinging hoping to land a Hail Mary that isn’t there.
What is the saying, you stop aging the moment you become a famous millionaire?
The truth is in this last response track and you answered it yourself as well- he thought he could get away with it due to his major star power (basically, I’m Drake, I’m bullet proof (like Puffy and the others thought) which is also his excuse for why he could never get away with doing it.  But Drake is also stuck in high school too and it shows with his actions and reactions to things; We see this a lot with Eminem too.  Once you get rich enough that the rules of the real world don’t have to apply to you, you can do whatever you want and in this case Drake for whatever reason lives permanently in his high school years much like Eminem won’t grow beyond a certain point in his life.  This isn’t something that’s fixed with therapy but more likely a byproduct of wealth - whereas when we go through challenging times, most of the time we’re forced to get over it and move on because if we don’t it can negatively impact so many other parts of our lives (cost us relationships, cost us friends, cost us jobs, cost us our kids, etc) but when you’re rich as fuck like Drake you don’t have to just get over it and you can forever remain in that moment and it leads you to where we are now with him.
>Drake is perpetually stuck in HS


Not just any high school. Degrassi.
He can say what he wants bcos of his “background” and “connections”. Ask Kanye what I mean by that
Perpetually stuck in Degrassi
This is what i've been saying lol, no way a ghost writer makes something this incriminating lmao
What does it mean?

Either way, if it's *that* open to interpretation and it's about talking about school kids. I still think don't say it.

But what does it mean?
I never understood the lyric like that lol??? He could be implying that even back in high school when he knew her, she was still bad then. You’ve never been attracted to a bad bitch when you were in high school?
It is out of context. This post is about self love n also about Drake accepting his feminine side n y’all making it some creep shit. It’s a supposed to be empowering
That ranges from "Thats Fine" to "Bruh" depending on your age.
Soo
[removed]
All stuff that can be easily faked. Honestly I don’t think there is a whole lot that he really can do to get the public to believe him. It would be an idiotic plan if it were true, which it obviously isn’t lol
They have no evidence.

But now that Twitter have called their bluff, i expect them to AI and fake evidence now. lol
I always thought that and even having 17 year olds guiding Boy Scouts being weird too. Just seems like a bad environment to be in but MJ is a whole nother thing.
Even as a victim myself, to many people have retracted statements which is weird enough but even some celebs that were around MJ as a child have defended him. He was never for me anyways.
As someone who doesn’t listen to either artist- it’s clear that people don’t trust drakes word because the things Kendrick is accusing him off have been accused by others and have drake doing and saying sketchy things that back up Kendrick.

Conversely, there’s much less evidence to suggest drakes accusations are true. And many other things in his attacks that are known to be false or innacurate. Drake seems like an unreliable narrator. But I of course would like to see a response by Kendrick to the accusations.

https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1cl6lfw/why_the_dv_allegations_are_shaky_from_a_fact/

Give this a read if you have an open mind.
In terms of manipulation yeh he might be lol. Cuz the longer this goes the more I’m convinced Kenny is the one who really knew all the plays and set up Drake from the beginning to dig his own grave
i don’t fw the glazing but get no puss unfortunately goes hard
It’s just Kendrick fans coping
I mean him texting 14yo girls about boys and missing her doesn’t help his case lol
He also told a 17 year old girl he liked how her breasts felt. And dated an 18 year old when he was 31.   
  
So...not a surprise that people don't believe him when he tries to say he's not attracted to underage girls and finds it disgusting.
Tbf I'm pretty biased against creepy ass dudes who have hit on 17 year olds after finding out their age and doubling down. Stop being weird
It means the best he could have done is not make things worse in regards to how people view his questionable predilection for very young girls. And he made things worse.
>Y’all acting like Drake snitched on himself

Because he opened himself up to that. I'm not saying that this is proof in any way, just that it was a terrible play call. There are a hundred ways he could've tried to defend himself without actually bringing his name into this.

A basic understanding of how the general public is going to react is a pretty crucial part of this, and Drake is just stumbling over himself.
[deleted]
What's inconclusive about Drake hitting on someone he knows is 17? He literally says that he can't go to jail yet and proceeds to talk about touching her body
No it’s not. Kendrick isn’t saying to take all of drakes music off Spotify which was the context of the R kelly thing. Stop reaching. 
?
I might be wrong but is that not what people call arrested development? Like your life changes so rapidly at a young age that you never really get to mature mentally like a normal person.
Kinda, yeah.
Millionaire or famous? I can’t imagine degrassi paying *that* well
[deleted]
You stop growing.
So this beef probably has had a positive effect on Drake because he has to face adversity whether he likes or not. Or maybe he's so far gone that he doesn't see even think he's taken an L
Out of curiosity what are you talking about with Eminem? I don't know so it's interesting.
Honestly surprised he never rapped about getting shot and playin like that was part of his life.
high school pics, you were even bad [back] then. hes speaking to a girl he presumably grew up with and watched her age its NOT that hard to comprehend
He's talking about high school pics. It's pretty obvious what he means. He's fucking shallow too
Bro it’s a fake lyric people use as a joke and you’re out here defending a lie that was intentionally made as a pedo lyric lmao

jesus

That for sure goes both way. If thats the case both of them have to produce bodies.but producing screenshot and such is a good start. I'm sure the internet will be on that like a hawk and will dissect it to make sure it's real.


> It would be an idiotic plan

That's what makes this so wild. Drake backed himself into a corner. Kendrick is dictating the flow.
That would be possible. But it would definitely get scrutinized to pieces by the internet lol. Risky gamble with OK reward and high risk.
https://www.reddit.com/r/KendrickLamar/comments/1cl6lfw/why_the_dv_allegations_are_shaky_from_a_fact/

Read this.
Yeah I don't need this to go any further to know if Kendrick planned this.

Kendrick had been planning and working these angles this from the very, very beginning. Hell, Kendrick might've been plotting on Drake since Drake went in on the Control verse back in 2013.
In the end, it just shows that Kendrick is doing a lot of projecting. Because the real master manipulator here is Kendrick. Whatever manipulations Drake is capable of (I don't think he is that capable/smart tbh) is clearly little league compared to Kendrick.

Because Drake fell right into a trap that I don't think he will ever get out of.

Kendrick just bodied Drake on so many different levels. And the timing couldn't have been any better/worse...
Kendrick brain rot
I agree with you but you deadass said that Drake didnt say he was disgusted when he said, and I quote, “I feel disgusted”
Not saying he didn’t do any of that, just saying your original point was invalid
And while him feeling a 17 year olds breasts and dating an 18 year old IS weird and borderline predatory. It is NOT illegal and he isn’t a “pedo”. The age of consent in Colorado is 17, making what he did legal. And dating an 18 year old as a 31 year old is repulsive (I agree), but it does not make him a “pedo.”

If the age of consent in Colorado wasn’t 17, best believe Drake would’ve been ridiculed more heavily and hopefully put in jail as a sex offender
Exactly.
Sorry, but I'm not sure what Drake could've said that wouldn't have made things worst on some level. And for the record, a 17-year-old is not a "very young girl." Not even a 14-year-old can be called a "very young girl" in my opinion. Very young girls are females under the age of 12.

Personally, I don't think Drake really understood what was going on or what it was that he was up against. He was blinded by his cockiness and the amount of yes-men that he has in his circle.

He thinks/thought that this whole thing was about bars so he replied in a bars-way (i.e., "Touch My Body" reference) but he underestimated:

* the culture—we are back in the days of the Puritans in that we view sexual misconduct and deviancy to be worse than murder
* the amount of hate and envy that Kendrick has in his heart
* Kendrick's skill and expertise as both a rapper

This was never about going bar-for-bar or having regular beef. Kendrick is envious and he wants to see Drake be completely destroyed.

At the end of the day however, Kendrick calling Drake a pedophile without having any actual proof is not only very irresponsible and wrong but it's dangerous.

I've seen people get slapped with a hefty defamation lawsuit for less. I've seen people murdered for less.

So yes, I think it's fair for Drake to say "I'm disgusted," "I'm way too famous (and hated) to get away with this," and "prove it."

Kendrick should stay strapped and keep his circle extra tight. Drake should do the same and make sure that he has *very good* and *very proactive* legal team.
He didn’t open himself up to that tho, Kendrick literally said that Drake runs a sex trafficking ring on meet the grahams it was already open
He really did not. He said that it was hypocritical that streaming platforms were taking off Black artists with patterns of abuse but leaving up all the white ones, which is a fair point. It was only Black artists they were taking off.
It's inconclusive because it doesn't actual rise to the level of sexual abuse of a minor according to the law of the land. In fact, I don't know the Romeo/Juliet law of that particular state but Drake might even be covered by the Romeo/Juliet law. Who knows?

It's also inconclusive given that it is something that was captured on video and that no one complained or felt weird about it until over a decade later. These were the days when rappers were getting arrested and imprisoned for bringing supposedly drug and/or gun paraphernalia onstage when cameras were rolling. 

Does it make him weird? Yes, especially from our present-day POV. Could he have been arrested and charged for it? Yes, absolutely. Would it result in a conviction? No, probably not. Can Drake still get in actual trouble for it? Technically no.

And it's still hypocritical and weird for Kendrick to cosign R. Kelly and Kodak Black even though they are *proven* to have done the things that he's actually accusing Drake of doing.
They are referring to female meme that basically is would you rather be in the woods with a man or bear. The answer is always bear 100% cuz men are predators.


Anyway when it comes to drake there is smoke everywhere just need the fire to rise up.

Same thing with epstein and weinstein how it was a well known fact but no proof for decades
Yes
thats a tv show brodie
Probably famous, drake has probably thought he was the shit since then. Lives for clout..and children
Agreed, but I see where he’s coming from.  It’s a common saying when referring to movie stars and musicians:  “After you get famous, you stop growing, you don’t have to.  Every celebrity has an age of stagnation.”  Bojack Horseman is truly a masterpiece.
Yeah, I don’t see the Eminem connection
He even came up with an angle that Drake is opening up about his feminine side 😂😂😂
Just look at their history it's genuinely concerning, from manic rants to sissy/r#pe worship etc
I will never stop glazing Drake didn’t fuck anyone underage he’s not a weirdo he’s just a bachelor living his rich ass life n you peons are hating
True, I guess rn it’s just that Kendrick has more credibility. Drake has publicly been weird around minors and has already hidden one kid, so if he can’t show us something everyone is going to believe Kendrick like what is already happening lmao. Edit: and you’re probably right, I’m sure someone could snuff out fake receipts. At least I hope you’re right lol
Ya that’s about what I’ve heard! Sounds like Drake planted some bad articles lmao. Or got sketchy info
Yehhh. Bro knows drakes playbook on some “takes one to know one” typa time lol
Alright. Fair point.
The point is that he's clearly attracted to underage girls. They don't need to be 10 to be underage. He just waits until they turn 18 (as far as anyone can prove), so it's not illegal, just creepy.   
  
So him trying to claim it's not true and disgusting comes across completely hollow given his past actions.
We're just going in circles now. Again, I'm only looking at this from a metagame perspective.

Kendrick gets called a domestic abuser and how does he respond?

Not by clumsily trying to bring Bobby Brown or another well known abuser's name into this. He just straight up calls Drake a liar and then goes on the offensive.

Drake coulda done something similar. In fact Kendrick has left so many openings for Drake to attack him from, instead he does...whatever this was.
[deleted]
I don't even want to address how creepy a legal defense Is coming from a bunch of obsessed stans online.

I'll leave you with this. That video along with his history of texting young women and dating 18 year olds as an adult has painted Drake as a predator. In the eyes of the public, he  is a PDF unless he finds an actual recording of Kendrick saying that he planned to paint him this way. Rap beef has always been about communication, and Kendrick has communicated his point in a believable manner. Meanwhile, Drake's credibility is getting called into question for doing dumb shit like not doing his homework on Mother I Sober. Drake's only shot at winning the beef is receipts, but on a certain level, people already look at him like a creep and culture vulture. His image is tarnished because he has a history people knew of before the beef
I think they went through my comment history and saw me going back and forth with someone about it. I was waiting for them to explain it so I could make them feel like an obsessive weirdo for going through someone's comment history to discredit them, but they didn't bite

There's weird stuff there but not enough to make the claims Kendrick is making. It becomes doubly weird when you remember his line in Mortal Man defending MJ who has done wayyyyyyyyy worse in terms of indicating that he's a P
And it's such an ignorant "female" meme at that
The TV show didn’t invent the term, lol. The show is about a group of rich, immature adults.
A TV show about what?
i can’t w/ y’all 🙁
Genuinely deranged level of support, like man plz breathe for 2 sec lmao
>Drake has publicly been weird around minors and has already hidden one kid,

This is why it's an uphill battle for Drake xD finding out kendrick is a wife beater would be devastating because you don't expect it. Finding out Drake likes minors... Well, there's more proof to to move th needle in one direction   x.x.
I agree, and this is why I’ve been saying Kendrick should just air everything out in the new diss he’s gonna drop, he should just show all the evidence stacked against Drake so he can officially put the “beef” to rest.

I want evidence from both sides, because the casual listener does not know anything beyond the surface, winning the casual vote is crucial which I think Kendrick is doing so far.
I mean it’s damned if you, damned if you don’t right? Everyone was saying he absolutely has to respond to these pedophile allegations or his career is over. If he just said Kendrick is a liar and kept it pushing it wouldn’t have been enough, but now he’s getting called defensive, so what is he supposed to do? He loses either way in the eyes of public opinion, they already decided
Not to mention that kendrick beat his lady. He doesn't exactly have the morale high ground. I believe both of these dudes have skeletons and I'm just here for a good rap beef
I actually didn’t think too deeply about the name of that show and it works on two levels. The arrested development of the rich kids AND the arrested housing development. Such a good show
He also has to answer to fifteen years of being a creep towards very young to straight up underage girls, plural.
[sverige radio] Kylian Mbappe investigated for rape, per Swedish public service
Title.

De Zerbi keeping his fingers crossed and adding this to his news alerts.
Getafe licking their fingers in anticipation
The original report is from [expressen](https://www.expressen.se/sport/fotboll/polis-utreder-valdtakt-efter-mbappe-besok/) which this post reference to. 

There are different levels of being under investigation and Mbappe is on the lower end. It is stated that the incident occurred on Thursday the 10th of October.

Edit: The article linked by op is a summation of a radio report which is reporting that he’s under investigation, the radio report is only referencing what Expressen published. It isn’t the public services original reporting.
Mbappe to marseille here we go
According to Expressen the police are investigating Mbappé as *suspected on reasonable grounds* ("skäligen misstänkt" - the second lowest of four degrees of suspicion in Sweden) for rape and sexual assault. Currently the police do not offer further comment, but an investigation is ongoing at the hotel.

Expressen has an English article on its website (you will find it on the front page currently). Unlike the Swedish article, it does not currently specify that Mbappé is the suspect.

DeepL of the Swedish article (updated as of 8pm CET):

>**Mbappé investigated for rape after Sweden visit**

>*The police are investigating a suspected rape after football star Kylian Mbappé's visit to Stockholm last week.*

>*According to Expressen, the police are investigating the star as a reasonable suspect of rape and sexual offence. That is the lower level of suspicion.*

>*‘Fake news’, writes Mbappé on X.*

>Real Madrid player Kylian Mbappé, 25, unexpectedly turned up in Stockholm last week. He was seen during the night to Friday at Stureplan, where he is said to have visited the restaurant Chez Jolie and the nightclub V.

>The police are now investigating a suspected rape that is said to have been committed on Thursday in central Stockholm, as Aftonbladet was the first to report. On Monday, the police investigated the hotel where the party was staying.

>**Kylian Mbappé is being investigated**

>According to the Express, it is the football star who is the subject of the investigation. He is reasonably suspected - the lower degree of suspicion - of rape and sexual assault. The crime was allegedly committed on Thursday 10 October and reported two days later.

>\- ‘This is a prosecutable case,’ says police spokesperson Daniel Wikdahl.

>\- ‘This is not a case I will comment on in any detail, but I refer to the prosecuting authority.

>Expressen has sought prosecutor Maria Chirakova.

>She told Aftonbladet earlier today:

>\- I will not say anything about this.

>**Mbappé denies the allegations**

>The world star denies the accusations and calls it fake news.

>‘FAKE NEWS!!!’, Kylian Mbappé writes on X and continues.

>‘It becomes so predictable, the day before the hearing, as if by chance’.

>According to French RMC Sport, Mbappé is referring to the legal conflict between him and his former club PSG - over unpaid wages and bonuses. On Tuesday, he and the big club will meet in the appeal court of the professional football league.

>It was on Wednesday that a private plane from Madrid landed in Sweden. According to information to Expressen, Mbappé's good friend and former teammate Nordi Mukiele is behind the visit.

>The French footballer Kylian Mbappé, who is currently injured, is one of the biggest stars in the world of football and his visit to Stockholm has been heavily criticised in his home country, where the national team was gathering for the Nations League.
Huge if true. Small if not.
Ok we’re definitely going to wait for more evidence before making condemnations, right? Right?
Swedes who can properly translate, is it talking rape as we understand it in the Anglosphere or does it cover sexual assault etc?
all these mfs thinking they're the kings of comedy with their marseille and getafe comments
From Ronaldo Vegas to Mbappe Stockholm. Truly following the steps of his idol /s
The Swedish press ain't calling it 'fake news'. Maybe the police should make a statement.
If confirmed All Time Rapist XI will be way too stacked
Do we have any more information? What was his involvement in this?
Important to know that in Sweden there’s a broader purview of potential acts that constitute sexual assault. Swedish police is also more vigilant in pursuing these cases. I would hold off forming an opinion before more comes out, but the Swedish police are not known for taking frivolous action.
@Vikingfriends is there any reliable source reporting it ?
What the fuck
Nuts. Just this morrning I saw that a 24 prem player is being arrested over rape.

Someone needs to tell him not to do *everything* CR7 did
Nasser at it again
He's either innocent or Pérez will protect him until he's not useful for Real Madrid.
The dichotomy of /r/soccer:

Thomas Partey before the text messages were public:  BURN HIM AT THE STAKE! #metoo #believeallwomen

Mbappe: "Well it's on the low end of the accusation spectrum".  #MenToo #innocentuntilprovenguilty

Good lord yall.
Chat is this real?
It most likely isn't gonna be true and nothing will come of it, but it will do permanent damage to Mbappe's reputation. 5 years from now, people will slander call him a rapist or whatever based on this.
Being a suspect doesn't mean anything. No need to jump into conclusions until he's actually a suspect.
close enough welcome back karim benzema
Mbrappe
Marseille leadership down on their knees and praying it is true
Is he 24? Did he play in the premier league?
Kids never idolize footballers. Most of them are sociopaths
I love how I posted this 3 hours ago but it was removed due to “click bait”..
Real Madrid heritage
Mbappe Stockholm

Following his idol Ronaldo Las vegas
WAIT WHAT
The new Ronaldo indeed.
What's with football players and rape allegations?
Its Marseille time
r/soccer doing what r/soccer does lmao
Mbappé following in the footsteps of his idol Cristiano
If you google this other articles have come out giving more information. The SA took place at the same hotel M'Bappe was staying at. There is no evidence him or his entourage are involved. Let's get more info on this, that headline was salacious.
During my study abroad in Sweden, the police chief specifically told us about recent(2017) Sweden law that changed the definition of sexual assault to make it more broad and that solely was the reason for the uptick in sex crimes in Sweden (and not migrants or minorities). Make of that what you will.
surely we wait for evidence
Wonder how much Qatar is paying the officials and the news agency to pump this story 1 day before their trial where they’re being sued by Mbappe for unfulfilled wages. Timing is crazy.
Nasser is paying the swedish police to investigate on a fake rape according to Mbappé
Lmao. At this rate footballer is raper because a lot of accuser out there that want to derail their career. Gylfi sigurdson is not guilty but his career is gone. Mostly not much evidence but still fans and club throw them under the bus
Didn’t thank Beyoncé

That poor boy… 

The victim, not mbappe
MRappe
[Mbappe be like](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/535/262/6c2.jpg)
Easy money to accuse a footballer of rape
Let's hope he adds changing this to the bucket list for the next season
ok what the fuck?
Hmmm
Woah
mpope 15 for infermentation
Well this isn’t good
Ah he’s trying to cement his French national team legacy huh?
Holy shit, what the fuck?
What the actual fuck
was she 15??????
My profile picture sums up my reaction.
wow he's the last person on earth i thought i would read in such a case. hopefully it ends with an investigation only.
He really is Ronaldo's no.1 fan
Of course had to follow the footsteps of his idol
May they investigate the fuck out of this.
He specialising in buying stressed assets?
I think it's an unfair comment. 

We also welcome murderers.

*cries in marseillais*
They're crossing of the hitlist one-by-one:

~~Mason Greenwood~~ 

~~Elye Wahi~~ 

~~Amine Harit~~ 

Benjamin Mendy 

Thomas Partey

Quincy Promes 

Wissam Ben Yedder

Jerome Boateng 

Kylian Mbappe
It's DeZerbi who paid an escort to have sex and then denounce Mbappe so he could later sign him. i'ts like the scene in iron man one when Obadian says "who do you think locked you out, i was the one who filed the injunction against you"
"My other other other other.... other son! "
*De Zerbi steps out of the shadows*

”I’m here to talk to you about the Offender initiative“
Surely he doesn’t know anything and doesn’t want to know anything?
Bordalas will play him as RB.
Probably should have washed them first.
I dunno, I think Marseille have the upper hand in the bidding war given he'd share a common language with more players. Is there even anyone at Getafe at the moment who speaks a language where non = oui?
Al Nassr too
Not before Marseille gets him first though
They started the investigation today and he has been given the "lower end" label. In usual cases that means that by one or two days the case will be dismissed

Edit: asked my lawyer friend here in Sweden. "Skäligen misstänkt" means that he has been reported but there is nothing concrete as of yet
Innocent until proven guilty.

I've seen so many allegations be absolute bullshit
There's 4 suspect tiers and he is on the 2nd tier.
Take care PSG mbappe and mendy joining forces
A few years ago two french youtubers, McFly & Carlito had managed to invite Macron for a challenge video. The concept of the video that they had done a lot before is that you have to tell a story and the others have to guess if it's true or fake. One of Macron's story, who is a Marseille fan, was that he had exclusive information on Mbappe going to Marseille. The youtubers obviously didn't buy it and in a desperate last attempt to convince them Manu started calling Kyky on his phone, and he answered. Macron told Mbappe to tell them about the deal with Marseille on speakers mode and Kylian just laughed and said that it was impossible and "not in our DNA" or something like that.

Edit : [Link here for anyone interested ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=P4i2pdaQSPo7AFFq) starts at 5:48
The best thing I’ve learnt from this is Swedes have different degrees of suspicion.
Some clarifications and correcting of the translation:
- The correct legal translations of the crimes under investigation are *rape* and *sexual molestation*, the latter being similar to what you might label as sexual assault in the Anglosphere.
- Police spokesperson Daniel Wikdahl says that the case is currently directed/conducted/initiated by the prosecutor's office, not that the case is necessarily *prosecutable*.
FORZA BAJEN
So you say he's on 3rd highest of degrees of suspicion?
Medium if maybe.
All I know is my gut says Maybe
Of course (not)!
Nope. Anyone accused of rape must be guilty according to r/soccer and must be a scumbag of the highest order.

Of course it goes without saying anyone who rapes is  a scumbag if the highest order. But let's let the courts and due process do their thing eh.
yes but tbh it's low-key annoying cause i have many jokes and memes that came to mind and I wanna make them
Nobody did for Partey lol. He wasn't even officially named either, which says a fair bit about the lack of evidence. (I'm not saying he's innocent by any means though!)
Obviously mbappe is not gonna go through the gutter like him but this comment kinda reminded me of benjamin mendy. Poor lad lost 2 years of his life and his footballing career to a more than dubious rape accusation
Nah court of the public opinion already made their decision. Apparently here waiting for any source of information is defending someone.
Lmao.
It says rape and sexual harassment. Both.
Well the Expressen article mentions he's under investigation for both rape (våldtäkt) and sexual assault (sexuellt ofredande).
It does seem to be rape in the sense that most of us percieve it, but as mentioned by others in this thread, the degree of suspicion is low. On a scale from 1-4, where 4 is called "sufficient suspicions for prosecution", this case is (so far) a 2. So it's somewhat likely that he's innocent and/or that there will be no prosecution regardless.
A wider definition than in the many countries, but not sexual assault.
It can be "normal" rape (as in forced intercourse) but the law also includes actions that are equivalent with intercourse, which afaik essentially requires some sort of penetration, for example fingers or any object.
Also has 0 details basically police doesn’t wanna comment, can really be a nothing sandwich
Yeah everytime anyone is accused of/or arrested for some horrific crime 2/3 of the top comments are a Getafe or Marseille crack. It's lame as fuck.
Its not even funny
Yeah, the same joke over and over. Also, let's be real. He's Mbappe, likewise with Ronaldo, this wouldn't ruin his career, it barely ruined Greenwood's. Mbappe is a much better footballer (obviously) than Greenwood, and for Greenwood there was an audio recording but he's still playing at a top level. For Mbappe to end up at Getafe we would need a 4K video with crystal clear audio.
Shit so dumb 
yeah it's not funny but I do appreciate the effort of not letting the world forget that these clubs willingly turned a blind eye
As pseudonyms go, those are still a tier below Ron Mexico.
THAT'S WHY HES THE GOAT

THE GOOOOOOOOAAAAT
> Truly following the steps of his idol /s

Mbappe is a late bloomer, the former had already done that and left the country years ago at that age.

Just needed to go on a rant about how the club owners are doing a terrible job(which was something that's been talked about over and over for a decade and everybody already knew), then fuck off to Saudi Arabia in 10 years and he'd have completed the arc.
Police usually dont comment further on ongoing investigations.

He is being investigated for rape. The definition for rape is broader in sweden and has laws concerning concent. The way it is handled in Sweden is why some people call sweden the rape capital because we report higher stastics due to our processes.

So fake news? No. He is under investigation. Did he rape somebody? That is what investigation is for.
> What was his involvement in this?

Think he's suspected of raping someone
He’s being investigated for allegedly raping someone
Not the same, but remember what happened with Joost Klein during Eurovision this year...
SR is considered very reputable, but this just says he is being investigated and not more than that.
There isn't anything being said about it at the moment, only that he's being investigated. And of that there's no discussion of whether or not it's true.
[deleted]
He implied PSG was behind this in his tweet
Pérez vs Nasser. Battle of the Media 
All of a sudden, moralist r/ soccer takes into account the principles of law.
As a woman I find it interesting how people are usually very quick at judging suspects as guilty immediately , until it is rape, then it is “oh well we need the full story”
He just responded to a tweet earlier about it calling it fake news
No idea, but another swedish outlet has an article about it too.

[https://www.expressen.se/sport/fotboll/polis-utreder-valdtakt-efter-mbappe-besok/](https://www.expressen.se/sport/fotboll/polis-utreder-valdtakt-efter-mbappe-besok/)
> It most likely isn't gonna be true 

Why?
I don’t think so. Ronaldo only gets called that by a few still because he’s actually a rapist and also admitted to being one, but even then the vast majority of ppl choose to ignore it 
No way you’re comparing this to Ronaldo’s case.
nothing this sub loves more
I'm sure there will be plenty of brave people like you to defend them :]
I wasn't around when Ronaldo was accused.

Was that also like this or was that worse?


Edit: I genuinely don't know , instead of downvoting reply.
[deleted]
Didn't damage Neymar's reputation , although Neymar had the baller but very risky move to dump every information he had on social media to make sure the world know he was innocent.  
That said the thread and reports of Neymar being accused of rape were far more visible than the reports saying he was cleared.  
  
Still it's been 5 years if not more and most people have even forgotten he was ever accused in the first place.
First time on r/soccer?
Lord above. I'm done 
oh fuck off lol
💀 

I absolutely HATE how this going to catch on. Bet it's on an opposition poster by the next Real Madrid game
You posted this article published at 20, two hours ago, 3 hours ago?
What do you mean? I don't get people's obsession over defending millionaire's who don't know about your existence
Your article has been modified now that there is more information, they are reporting the same as OP

https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/enquete-sur-un-viol-presume-le-nom-de-kylian-mbappe-cite-selon-la-presse-suedoise-14-10-2024-2RJYQOFJGND77IGZ5GKJ3RS22E.php
Marseille currently has a few wrong'uns. I don't think it is a RdZ policy, more like the club.
As a *lyonnais* I very much appreciate your sarcasm.

We've had a few bad apples over the years too though (even Vairelles, back then).
Did I miss something? Who's the murderer?
Don't forget Ronaldo
Patrick Kluivert as trainer
The hitlist?
Neymar was also on the list, until he was vindicated after leaving his laptop camera on which recorded the whole interaction

these rape accusations are crazy
I can't imagine Promes freedom lasting longer than a few minutes outside Russia.
How about overmars as a team manager?
RDZ read Machiavelli and was like yeah this is it
This sounds like a quite reasonable system.
All these famous players with allegations smh. The worst part is the hypocrisy.
This had no right to get me 

It somehow got me. Hook, line and sinker.
Motherfucker
magnificent, spectacularly done.
Yeah, can be good to know on the occasion that cases like these pop up (remember ASAP Rocky, anyone?).

Copying over from one of my replies on the other post on this for anyone interested:

The degrees of suspicion go like this, from least to most probable, with examples brought over from Wikipedia (and translated with DeepL as I'm lazy):

1. May be suspected.  
*Example: A wallet has disappeared from a classroom where several people are present. All of them may have had something to do with it, but there is nothing to point to anyone in particular, so no coercive action can be taken.*
2. Reasonable suspicion.  
*Concrete, objectively substantiated circumstances exist that indicate with some strength that a certain person has committed the offence to which the suspicion relates. Example: A witness saw a person standing at the place where the wallet was found.*
3. Suspected on probable grounds.  
*The suspicion appears justified on an objective assessment. Something is needed to further link the person to the offence, such as a witness or technical evidence. Example: A witness has seen that a person has picked his wallet.*
4. Sufficient grounds for prosecution.  
*The prosecutor can expect a conviction on objective grounds, i.e., the court will find beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the offence charged by the prosecutor. Example: The offender was caught red-handed stealing the wallet.*
Du är synnerligen misstänkt!
Something something trapping Julian Assange
They are:   
1 - Sus  
2 - Real sus  
3 - Mad sus yall  
4 - Vote em out
Yeah, level 2 on a scale 1-4, the higher the more probable suspicion. Some of the other comments have good context on what this means.
Mbaybe?
It’s actually crazy they can release the name of the person being accused, without any evidence being provided. Being associated with this can already seriously harm your daily life.
Indeed. Alternatively, if charges are dropped or they are found not guilty, they are definitely innocent and the accuser should go to jail and etc
Oh come on. The top comments in this thread are all comments of this nature, or shitty Marseille jokes. I don’t see anybody saying “Mbappe is a rapist”
Nah for soccer to hate you, you have to be a generally unliked player.


Mbappe hasn't made the brightest decisions for his public image recently, but most people still know him as a "good guy"
[deleted]
What is the difference here with Partey? I dont know, just asking, is there evidence like with Greenwood?
The thing is you think it doesn't go without saying because you just said it. Otherwise you wouldn't have said it
lol I’m nearly certain the majority of this sub and Reddit in general does not believe in innocent until proven guilty. It’s the internet, everyone must be judge jury and executioner.
I mean most of the people we condemn as rapist have pretty damning evidence. Greenwood, Alves, Ronaldo.
The overwhelming (like 97%) of rapists are never charged with it. It’s a hard thing to prove. I don’t know what is or isn’t true here, but the public can have an opinion regardless of how the courts rule.
Is "Sexuellt ofredande" not sexual harassment?

Sexual assault is pretty much rape in the US, not the best translation I think
Regardless of the degree of suspicion (which is  btw a very common concept in legal systems worldwide, not just Sweden) the “likeliness” of innocence is completely unaffected and non-quantifiable until the verdict is given in any given case. Suspicion basically just determines whether and to what degree it is reasonable to prosecute someone.
I don’t find it super funny either but I don’t think people should ever stop calling out Marseille or Getafe for going out of their way to sign a rapist.

If people want to make shit low hanging fruit jokes about them so it stays in people’s memory then let them. Overall it’s a good thing, even if the jokes are shite.
It is a bit funny.
What is that?
Thought this was a Cougar Town reference
And Joey Freshwater
The world finally get to see actual sexual assault legislation. Love when people of Fame who think they can act whatever they want just because they have money.

Yea get fuck'd bro, this is not America where you can buy yourself out.
And you believe it ? 🤦🏾🤦🏾
Nasser is not winning this lol.
Damn if only he came out and said “I did it” we’d have him bang to rights!
Oh well that confirms it then!
Sometimes there's no better confirmation than a quick and angry denial lol
He’s not going to admit it either though
Usually newspapers copy stories from each other.
I’d like to know this too.
Because the low priority and designation by the Swedish police doesn't scream "we have evidence" and no victims have come forward 

Generally people tend to believe more in accusations the more proof they have. 

There's also the fact that he immediately denied it and called it fake news, which lawyers tend to tell you to avoid

Which isn't to say he's definitely innocent, but you can see why it seems like it might be a nothingburger
he was there when mbappe didn’t do the raping
Also to add, like Mbappe insinuates in his tweet the timing is very convenient. Literally the day before his court date about the PSG wage stuff he gets accused of this? Timing's a little too perfect.
I had no idea he raped.
Did he really admit the rape? I have heard a lot of his fans say that it was fake.
We'll never know
He shouldnt have gone partey
Idk a lot of this sub loves defending them
Mbappe isnt even a primary suspect.
That was categorically different and MUCH worse (but also got ~no coverage at the time)
Ha, which time Ronaldo was accused?
Just google Ronaldo Las Vegas.
It was much worse
Mason Greenwood is playing in Ligue 1 instead of for United because of his case and most sane football fans (so those who aren't part of the loud twitter minority) don't like him at all.

In his case, it's obviously more likely than not justified, but you can't seriously argue that his case hasn't done any damage to his career and reputation.
He is United hated in Manchester
😂😂😂

In all seriousness we gotta wait for real evidence, I just thought of that and couldn’t not share it
Blaming Nasser earlier for his name being dropped in the initial article when now it's coming out that Mbappé actually being investigated so it couldn't just be a case of throwing his name in a random case.
Given the context this is a dumbass comment lol.  Nobody deserves to be presumed guilty of something as heinous as rape.  That being said for all of the "rsoccer at it again" comments I've seen literally nobody here assuming he has 100% done it.
I don't get people's obsession with accusing everyone and anyone of heinous crimes.
Yes you’re right
It's like an evil version of Money Ball
I think it is RdZ too, he doesn't have to say "I will defend Greenwood like he's my son" and "after he scored these goals the controversy has been put to bed"
No it's RDZ. He would have specifically requested greenwood, that's the whole reason he left brighton (on his end), not being the one calling the shots on transfers.
TBF rumours that went round were he was demanding Greenwood stay at United.
Well it started with RdZ and he was the one who approved most of those so.
It's a more streamlined Portland Jail Blazers if you will.
What did Vairelles do?
https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37559236/amine-harit-sentenced-fatal-car-crash
Amine Harit had a car accident killing a guy. According to Schalke he couldn't prevent it, so probably not a murder. He did get a suspended sentence for it though.
Damn I actually forgot about that
More reasonable would be to not report the name until they are charged or a judge believes it’s in the public interest.
Is it? I find it a bit odd.

A woman going to the police to report a rape seems pretty concrete.

In terms of gathering evidence and deciding whether to prosecute, I imagine that takes quite some time.
I knew what it was, I knew exactly what I was doing, and I still clicked it
So in this case Mbappe is on level 2 of reasonable suspicion?
Jag är måttligt misstänksam!
Yeah this is always so annoying. Like it's so hard to prove sexual assault in most countries, even video or voice recording will not result in conviction as we saw before. And yet people will parrot that the person is 100% innocent. 
People always claim that someone not being put in jail means that they have been "proven innocent" like that is in actual thing the court system does. 

If it were the case that you had to be proven innocent then the number of people in jail for sexual assault would explode.
That also boils my piss.
Generally yes, but not if it is like Greenwood
Huh what? Mbappe seems very much hated on here, he's critisised every week. Which I didn't get either as hes publicly outspoken against gambling and drinking and soda, which all seems more "role mode"-esque than most players.

But I guess he's complained during games too much for their liking
The point flew way over your head
I'm not a fan of forming an opinion of someone on the basis of an accusation.

Nor am I a fan of condemning someone until all the due process has been dealt with
Hey remember that time a law enforcement officer died because reddit accused a guy that had committed suicide of bombing a marathon?
partey's victim leaked messages with him where he admitted to it and they were verified to be real
No but I have to make the distinction clear of people will accuse me of supporting a rapist or rape culture.

I've found that on here where unless someone makes the obvious statement they'll be accused of being on favour of something abhorrent
I would agree, I don't see a difference between sexual assault and rape. I also wouldn't translate "ofredande" to "assault", in any context. But the article mentions both, so the distinction doesn't really matter here.
I don't know if you're just a law student who really wants to prove you know better, but I never said nor implied this was a system specific to Sweden, and as a mathematics student I can tell you your read on correlation and probability is off here.

I understand what you're saying but the use of the word "likeliness" is arbitrary here, I agree that the degree of suspicion isn't used by the legal system as a method of disclosing the likelihood that the suspect is guilty. However, that doesn't mean that the likelihood doesn't correlate with the degree of suspicion. If someone is guilty, it is likelier that there will be severely damning evidence against them, and therefore likelier that the degree of suspicion will be higher.
An NFL player (Mike Vick) got arrested for weed possession or something, and gave the cops a fake name “Ron Mexico”. It became a rallying point/running joke until Vick got arrested again for slightly less funny reasons (the whole running a dog fighting ring and drowning dogs with his bare hands).
Former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick was accused of giving women genital herpes and going by the name Ron Mexico to hide his identity. He later went to prison for torturing and killing dogs. After release he got back into the NFL.
American Football player Michael Vick used this alias.
I thought the Joost Klein case was just regular assault, or did I miss something?
Yes… I do think anything is possible in this crazy world we live in and if anyone has connections it’s Nasser who is worth 8 billion and get just about anything done I suppose
Isnt his ruling for those unpaid PSG wages like tommorow lol?
Wouldn't be surprising from a Al Khalifi, a man backed by the most powerful Qatari's (of which he is one).
"When you're a star, they let you do it."
unlike a known headline bait outlet reporting it!
> no victims have come forward 

It's funny how this is used both ways lmao.

When victims come forward people say they're doing it for clout/a payoff, when they don't come forward it's because it's likely untrue.

People just see what they want to see.

The reality is that false accusations make up a tiny majority of cases, so on probability there is likely some level of truth to it.
I know it's a serious topic not to be laughed at, but the wording of this is very funny.

He used to have a residency in Vegas, search Ronaldo Vegas for more info.

Yes he admitted it to his lawyers via email. Those emails were obtained illegally, therefore could not be used as evidence in the case. He also paid her hush money and she went to the police etc at that time.

There is basically nothing but red flags that points to him raping her, but because the evidence was obtained illegally it didn't hold up in court. Dude raped a woman and got away with it. And because he sells shirts and brands he gets to avoid scrutiny from the masses.

I'll never stop calling him out. He's a piece of shit.
Yes. The documents were obtained illegally and released as a part of football leaks so they aren't admissable in court, though
😂
The article literally says the footballer is the focus of the investigation lol.
It definitely got coverage was all over the news that whole week if not longer. But since nothing ever came of it in terms of a possible trial it died down.
theres more than the vegas- lawyer fuck up one?
But the original comment claims Mbappe will have permanent damage to his reputation from this, which is likely false unless it goes further than this. Greenwood has permanent damage because we all heard the audio. Plenty of footballers have been accused, nothing pursued legally and continue as normal (such as Jonny Evans and Hakimi), with most fans never even knowing.
I mean I had to laugh
How is being investigated for rape the same as being considered guilty?? Do football fans lack the ability to think critically when it comes to situations like this?
Who's "accusing everyone"? He's a suspect, based on the context a Swedish user provided in the comments it's not that likely he did something, but it should be investigated regardless.
How is being a suspect have anything to do with what you said? Are you 14? When a crime happens, everyone in the vicinity is a suspect in the beginning until the investigation continues
Unironically would fit the money ball ethos. Would just treat players like Partey and greenwood as raw stats who are far too underpriced and snatch them up.
imagining the scene rn but every time Jonah Hill sees Brad Pitt point a finger at him he lists off all the crimes the players were charged with
Welcome to Marseille Deshaun Watson
Or just the football version of Suicide Squad
We can recreate Jimmy Savile in the aggregate
So, basically the Jeff Luhnow-era Houston Astros
I thank god every day that Barca went with Flick instead of De Zerbi
I’m starting to think we dodged a bullet when he and Bloom fell out. I feel like he would have pushed for Greenwood with us 😬.
Yeah that is wholly unnecessary and is just a clear telltale sign of selfishness, hopefully nothing more, nothing less
He also claimed he had no idea what Greenwood had done when he scouted and signed him.
Surely he would've known that going into the Brighton job though you would've thought?
Wait is this real? Do you have a source?
Mullet haircut
Sorry for the late reply, but here you go: [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony\_Vairelles#Affaire\_judiciaire](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Vairelles#Affaire_judiciaire)
That's an actual accident though not a murder.
Judges (to my knowledge) don't determine public interest in Sweden, although they can classify sensitive court cases. Rather, all established media follow ethical rules of publication, based on constitutional laws, that the industry itself has developed voluntarily. This would include following clear guidelines on weighing public interest against the protection of personal integrity and being careful with the publication of names.

This (*mostly*) works. This case seems one where the order of reporting basically already tied Mbappé to the whole thing, wherein the first articles just mentioned there was an ongoing investigation at the same hotel he had stayed. Normally you will see similar headlines as in the UK, e.g., "*Notable Allsvenskan player in their 20s suspected/prosecuted of rape"*.
Not how things work in Sweden. As most people know what “Skäligen misstänkt” means it’s reasonable. 

In Sweden, we have several unique laws that ensure transparency and democracy. For example, I can access anyone’s tax declarations, thanks to the principle of public access to information, called ‘offentlighetsprincipen.’ This law guarantees that the public can scrutinize government actions, fostering openness and accountability.
In general this is how it works in Sweden
Yeah especially for public figures, it’s not f air to have their name tarnished by something that potentially didn’t even happen, as this could cost them *millions* of dollars in sponsorships etc.
Yes, this is a shitshow. If its true, we gotta wsit until its proven anyway. If its false, millions of people will cry that half the rape acusations are made up.

Just to sell some ads...
And to apply the same effort to every investigation.
Yeah, but it's still very low. "Level 3" is regularly described as "more probable than not", i.e. over 50 % probability. Practically you jump to level 2-3 just from a report from the would-be victim (in sexual cases).
Yes!
Saying someone should be presumed innocent after a lack of evidence is one thing, sure, what only bothers me is that people always call the thrown out case a "false accusation" implying the accuser made it up. No, that's not how that works at all, just because evidence was lacking doesn't mean it was automatically a false accusation.
What can you do though? Unfortunately, unless you’re in that room, we don’t know. 

That’s why it’s best to just not have a strong opinion at all.
I wonder how many of the upvotes came from people who didn’t pick up the sarcasm 🤦‍♂️
I know that was my point, you're afraid. That's why the use of that figure of speech is incorrect, you think it has to be said. "It goes without saying" is used to describe obvious things
It’s not a matter of proving anything, it’s just a very common misconception to attribute a somewhat predictive quality to the process of investigation and/or prosecution. There is none.

The correlation you proposed is not exactly appropriate here both in principle and in practice, since degree of suspicion is based on the sum of relevant circumstances out of which usually only a portion satisfies the legal standards of evidence. So neither the quality nor quantity of evidence (usually evaluated at later stages of the process) is really directly proportional to the degree of suspicion, but I can see how it might seem so. Furthermore, extenuating evidence can be found or established much later than the suspicion takes part, however serious that suspicion might be initially.

Given that we know only the degree of suspicion, it is definitely not enough for any kind of approximation of likelihood of innocence, regardless of whether we’re laymen or not. It just sets the format of further investigation of the matter. That’s it, that’s all.
It’s actually funnier than that, Vick gave the name ‘Ron Mexico’ to the nurses at an STD clinic where he got checked out so he wouldn’t have any reports with his real name in them if they came back positive (which they did, for herpes).
I still use Ron Mexico when I need a quick name for something.
jon bois enjoyers unite
It’s wild to me that he’s got a regular gig on tv.
To be fair to him, he does seem to have changed after his time in jail. He's done a lot of work to fight against dog fighting rings since then, seems actually remorseful about the dog thing at least 
And won comeback player of the year with the Eagles
I highly doubt nasser would fabricate it from scratch, but he could very well amplify it
So Psg control swedish media ?
[deleted]
Makes it sound like a bad habit, like smoking
yeah it’s worded so casual lol
Just a casual hobby really 🤷🏻‍♂️
I searched “Ronaldo rape” instead. I found it that way.
Thanks, I knew what to search. I searched “Ronaldo rape”. It’s more specific.
Rui Pinto leaked emails or at least sold them to Der Spiegel, and we are taking for granted what that newspaper says. It's not like it is publicly accessible.
[deleted]
Wow, I am surprised how so many fans defend that case.
It also says that he isnt primary suspect.
> It definitely got coverage was all over the news that whole week if not longer.

It was buried initially, and then wasn't reported when Der Speigel re-broke the story.

The story only "broke" in places like the UK much later because they were scared of getting sued IIRC
First one was completely discounted I think, I think the girl admitted to lying about it or misrepresenting it, however the vegas one almost defo happened
He had like 3 different rape accusations in the 2000s when he was at Man United, iirc 2 of them paid off with NDAs or reported as such back then, 1 was dropped due to lack of evidence.
You very well know what connotation the reporting has, unless you are oblivious on purpose or have the reading comprehension of a 5 year-old. Don’t play stupid. I assume you would be ok with your name being dragged down the mud like this 👍
And it probably wouldn't even crack the top 10 worst things in football these days.
*but he can't even play RB*

*(snaps fingers) Pete?*

*he rapes*
More successful settlements than successful third downs
"what are we, some kind of football squad?"
Reprobates FC
"His name is Greenwood. He has my back."
[Hell FC](https://youtu.be/IcQ-Tc5NBYE?si=UI8wQTGbiuId7RAm)
I don't understand that reference but yes.
Trash cans weren’t the only things they were banging. Tell your mom Altuve says hi
Yeah, but sometimes you keep your cards close to your chest until you think you have leverage. Which, I guess, worked out, he left Brighton and went and joined Marseille in a season where they might actually challenge for the title again.
The bit about leaving Brighton is correct. Doesn’t prove that he brought in Greenwood although I don’t know either way
Do you call that an "actual accident" when he let his 14 year old brother behind the wheel in a populated area?
So everyone can see what everyone earns? Or at least what everyone declares to earn...?
Sure, but the guy you replied to said;

>More reasonable would be to not report the name until they are charged or a judge believes it’s in the public interest.

This is usually how it works in Sweden, names don't get publicised unless there are special circumstances, why are you saying it isn't? People are anonymous until they are committed of the crime so that innocent people don't get ousted.

It's not normal procedure that Mbappe is already named. You mention a bunch of other things regarding transparency in Sweden that has nothing to do with how we treat people accused or victims of a crime.

I think your post a bit misleading.
isn't it just logical that most suspects are maximum level 2 before any investigation has started?
I've seen people argue that if someone is found not guilty it must mean the accuser is lying and should go to prison and just, wow, what a wonderful way to stop people reporting rapes.
If that's the case Greenwood would be innocent, which is the one case with the most damning public evidence I've seen so far
Alright, you make a fair point. Even though I don't think it's completely irrelevant, I agree that I probably overstated the importance of the degree of suspicion with regards to his potential innocence.
Still can’t get a custom official jersey that says “Mexico” on the back. I try every year to see if they removed it, but one day I will have my Eagles #7 Mexico jersey.
He used the name a few times I think right? I can’t keep track of
You can test for herpes?
He spent time in jail, has spent time and money at animal shelters and by all accounts is a changed man. In terms of atonement what more could you want?
You are talking about Deshaun Watson right? Because i would agree.

Vick is a changed man as he got punished for his actions
Certainly. I was just trying to give a brief summary
They did the same thing against Neymar lmao
Before anything: I'm not saying this is what happened and I want in no way make any allegation about the potential victim here. 

However, in the realm of what's possible or even likely, a billionaire paying a random swedish girl to flirt with Mbappe, have rough sex with him and then accuse him of rape? Does not seem that farfetched to me.

Do I believe that's what happened? Nope. I have no clue and literally zero investment. Mbappe can be a rapist for all I know. *However*, claiming that what happened is beyond the power of a state owned club is quite ridiculous.
we get it, you rape
Yeah it made me laugh. Could just hear norm Macdonald saying it or something g
It's definitely not a good habit to have
Tbf raping is indeed bad
Vaping, even.
Are you though?
Where in the article does it say he's not the primary suspect?
Or top 1000 of disgusting shit a corp/religion/govt has done this year
I think you can still say he gets on base
Jesus Christ that’s awful lol
I would advice not to get raped by him, his dong traps the souls of his victims.
Saville has some fancy ball work
Yep
Yep exactly that was just an example. Another example of a practical use of offentlighetsprincipen for you as a private person iswhen you want to check records related to decisions that affect your life, like building permits in your neighborhood. It allows you to see exactly what’s been approved and who made the decisions, giving you insight into how public authorities operate and ensuring fairness in the process.
And their school grades, their phone numbers, their address etc etc.
Yes, that's true. I didn't mean to undermine what mbappe potentially has done, but at the moment we just don't have anything of substance. 
Let him manage Manchester United
yea this drives me crazy too. The American justice and prison system is awful but in this case people are so quick to still condemn him despite by all accounts doing exactly what prison is supposed to do. You don’t have to love him but if you can’t celebrate an actual good story of reform and rehabilitation then what do you believe in or think all our tax money is going to prisons for
I hate what he did.  He paid his debt to society and I am willing to give him room to make a new life for himself.  If a man can't be allowed redeem himself then you might as well kill him upon conviction.
Total Theo Von statement too.
The more I hear about this Ronaldo guy the more I don't care for him
at least he's not a hypocrite
Yeah he definitely steals bases well. He turned a pop up into an inside the park home run
The touch of a pedophile.
Total side note but we have a couple Finnish companies as clients and the amount of bullshit they put up with is 0%. Their players send us support emails that are basically 'it should work this way, why does it not work the way we are used to?' I wish our bureaucracy was so efficient
I didn't interpreted your comment like that at all. I just pointed out that the classification at this point is such a non news. The allegations are not non news at all.
Couldn’t be much worse than ETH.
*Excuse me?* Are you trying to say you shouldn't suffer in misery for the rest of your life even if you've shown you've taken steps to make amends? But what about my justice boner?!
This guy was a real jerk
Oh my
I’m totally confused to what you are talking about. What players send what type of email? 

Do you mean that American (I’m assuming of you Atalanta soccer logo) bureaucracy should work in similar way to Scandinavian so it was better for you?
His Finnish company (\*clients') employees send in tech/customer support emails with _very direct_ wording on expectations
